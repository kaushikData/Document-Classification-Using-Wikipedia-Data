'''Ballistol''' (meaning 'Ballistic Oil') is a [[mineral oil]]-based chemical which advertises that it has many uses. It was originally intended for cleaning, lubricating, and protecting [[firearms]]. 

==Description==
The product originated from [[Germany]] before [[World War I]], after the German military requested an 'all-around' oil and cleaner for their rifles and equipment. The German military used it from 1905 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ballistol.com/about-us/ Ballistol about us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical is a yellowish clear liquid with a consistency expected of a light oil. However, when it comes in contact with water it [[emulsion|emulsifies]], becoming a thick creamy white substance. It has a sweet and mildly pungent smell similar to black [[licorice]]. It is distributed in liquid and [[aerosol]] forms. The aerosol uses [[butane]] or [[propane]] as a [[propellant]].

It advertises it has no [[carcinogen]]s. Some other similar chemicals contain petro-chemicals which can pollute the environment if improperly handled, and can damage the 'seasoning' developed on the bore of a black-powder gun.

== Ingredients ==
(according to a specification from December 2002)
* pharmaceutical [[mineral oil|white oil]]: CAS RN 8042-47-5
* [[Oleic acid]]: CAS RN 112-80-1
* C-5 alcohols: CAS RN 78-83-1; CAS RN 137-32-6; CAS RN 100-51-6
* different essential oils to perfume Ballistol

The Lone Star Producing Co. 1–27 '''Bertha Rogers hole''' or well was an oil-exploratory hole drilled in [[Washita County, Oklahoma]] in 1974, and was the world's deepest hole until it was surpassed in 1979 by the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]], dug by the USSR.

It took [[Lone Star Producing Co.|Lone Star]] a little over a year and a half to reach 31,441 feet (9,583 m), a depth of almost six miles. During drilling, the well encountered enormous pressure – almost 25,000 psi (172,369 kPa). No commercial hydrocarbons were found before drilling hit a molten sulfur deposit, which melted the drill bit. The well was plugged back and completed in the Granite Wash from 11,000 to 13,200 feet as a natural gas producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Oklahoma Corporation Commission completion report (form 1002A) dated September 3, 1974 |url=http://imaging.occeweb.com/OG/Well%20Records/00000005/OCC_OG_0G5BFM7_1L8M2C4.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307092759/http://imaging.occeweb.com/OG/Well%20Records/00000005/OCC_OG_0G5BFM7_1L8M2C4.pdf |format=pdf |archivedate=March 7, 2016 |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5930">'''Bioconversion''', also known as ''biotransformation'', is the conversion of organic materials, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain microorganisms. One example is the industrial production of [[cortisone]], which one step is the bioconversion of [[progesterone]] to 11-alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone by ''[[Rhizopus nigricans]].'' Another example is the [[Bioconversion of Glycerol to 1,3-Propanediol|bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol]], which is part of scientific research for many decades.

Another example of bioconversion is the [[Conversion (chemistry)|conversion]] of [[organic material]]s, such as plant or animal waste, into usable products or [[energy source]]s by biological processes or agents, such as certain [[microorganism]]s, some [[detritivore]]s or [[enzyme]]s.

In the USA, the Bioconversion Science and Technology group performs multidisciplinary R&amp;D for the [[United_States_Department_of_Energy|Department of Energy]]'s (DOE) relevant applications of bioprocessing, especially with biomass. Bioprocessing combines the disciplines of chemical engineering, microbiology and biochemistry. The Group 's primary role is investigation of the use of microorganism, microbial consortia and microbial enzymes in bioenergy research. New [[cellulosic ethanol]] conversion processes have enabled the variety and volume of [[feedstock]] that can be bioconverted to expand rapidly. Feedstock now includes materials derived from plant or animal waste such as paper, auto-fluff, tires, fabric, construction materials, [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW), [[sludge]], [[sewage]], etc.

==Three different processes for bioconversion==
1 -''' Enzymatic hydrolysis''' - a single source of feedstock, switchgrass for example, is mixed with strong enzymes which convert a portion of cellulosic material into sugars which can then be fermented into ethanol. [[Genencor]] and [[Novozymes]] are two companies that have received United States government Department of Energy funding for research into reducing the cost of cellulase, a key enzyme in the production cellulosic ethanol by this process.

2 - '''Synthesis gas fermentation''' - a blend of feedstock, not exceeding 30% water, is [[gasified]] in a closed environment into a [[syngas]] containing mostly carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The cooled syngas is then converted into usable products through exposure to bacteria or other catalysts. BRI Energy, LLC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brienergy.com/|title=Clean Technology for Renewable Energy|website=www.brienergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a company whose pilot plant in Fayetteville, Arkansas is currently using synthesis gas fermentation to convert a variety of waste into ethanol. After gasification, anaerobic bacteria  (''[[Clostridium ljungdahlii]]'') are used to convert the syngas ([[carbon monoxide|CO]], [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) into ethanol. The heat generated by gasification is also used to co-generate excess electricity.

This type of engineered system introduces a substantial innovation represented by the automatic modulation of the treatment, able to adapt conditions of the system to the biology of the scavenger used, improving their performances and the power of this technology.

In [[electronics]], a '''crossatron''' is a high-power pulsed [[modulator]] device, a [[cold cathode]] [[gas-filled tube]] that combines the best features of [[thyratron]]s, [[vacuum tubes]], and power [[semiconductor]] switches. This switch is capable of operating with voltages in excess of 100 [[Volt|kilovolts]] by the use of [[deuterium]] gas fill to increase the [[Paschen breakdown voltage]], axial [[molybdenum]] cathode corrugations to provide a higher current capability, and a [[Paschen shield]] that is formed from molybdenum. The terminal curvature of the Paschen shield and of the adjacent portion of the anode are selected to establish a voltage stress at the curved Paschen shield surface within the approximate range of 90-150 kV/cm in response to a 100 kV differential. The cold cathode gives the crossatron an advantage of achievable lifetime and reliability in comparison to a hydrogen-filled thyratron.

It features instant start and rugged operation while enduring high temperatures, high radiation, [[electromagnetic pulse]], and repeated overvoltage and overcurrent events. Crossatron switch applications in [[power conditioning]] include high-voltage phase-control-rectifier service, high-frequency DC-to-AC [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] modulation, [[voltage regulation]], command charging, and [[fault protection]]. [[Pulsed power]] applications include high-speed discharging of [[capacitor]]s and [[pulse forming network]]s, repetitive opening of [[inductance|inductive]]-energy-storage circuits, modulation of [[square wave]] pulses in hard-tube modulators, and fault protection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2278">"'''Earth liberation'''" is an ideology founded by the [[radical environmentalism|radical environmental movement]] and was popularised by the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) as well as the [[Earth Liberation Army]] (ELA) in the 1990s.

==History==
{{Main|Radical environmentalism}}
Earth liberation has no universal understanding as a concept, as it is much considered to be a part of [[radical environmentalism]], or as a militant offshoot, favouring instead radical ''and'' [[revolutionary]] environmentalism.&lt;ref name=sf2&gt;[[Bron Taylor]], [[Steven Best|Best, Steven]] and Best &amp; Nocella. ''Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth'', [[Lantern Books]], 2006, p.4 &amp; 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a movement==
{{Main|Earth Liberation Front|Earth Liberation Army}}
Earth liberationists reject the mainstream [[environmental movement]] and include a diversity of individuals with a variety of different ideologies as well as theories. Activists include [[animal liberation movement|animal liberationists]], [[anti-capitalists]], [[green anarchism|green anarchists]], [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]], [[ecofeminism|eco-feminists]] and [[anti-globalisation]]ists.&lt;ref name=ern&gt;Manes, Christopher, 1990. ''Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization'', Boston: Little, Brown and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; They are notably also within the ELF and ELA, with others from the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) and [[Class War]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoting "Burn the Rich", popular [[Class War]] slogan. [http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/house-fires-with-a-message-in-the-northwest/?ref=us House Fires With a Message in the Northwest], ''[[The New York Times]], March 3rd 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary concern is making long lasting, systemic change, by overturning contemporary social and [[ecological]] conditions, as part of an ''earth liberation movement'', similar to the aims of the [[animal liberation movement]].&lt;ref name=sf2/&gt;

Earth Liberation Movement (ELM): is a free speech, unity, love movement which seeks unification of the human race and the liberation of Earth and its inhabitants from deliberate annihilation.

[[File:Energy Efficient Ethernet.gif|thumb|right |alt=three green leaves with "e" |Logo of the study group and standard task force]]

'''Energy-Efficient Ethernet''' ('''EEE''') is a set of enhancements to the [[twisted-pair]] and backplane [[Ethernet]] family of [[computer network]]ing standards that reduce power consumption during periods of low data activity.  The intention is to reduce power consumption by 50% or more, while retaining full compatibility with existing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Sean Michael Kerner |url= http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2009/07/energy-efficient-ethernet-hits.html |title=Energy Efficient Ethernet hits standards milestone&amp;nbsp;— InternetNews:The Blog&amp;nbsp;— Sean Michael Kerner |work= Internetnews blog |date= July 17, 2009 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), through the '''IEEE 802.3az''' task force developed the standard. The first study group had its call for interest in November 2006, and the official standards task force was authorized in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= IEEE 802.3 Energy Efficient Ethernet Study Group|url= http://www.ieee802.org/3/eee_study/index.html |date= September 21, 2007 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEEE ratified the final standard in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.lightwaveonline.com/education/news/IEEE-ratifies-new-8023az-standard-to-reduce-network-energy-footprint--104392129.html |title=IEEE ratifies new 8023az standard to reduce network energy footprint |date= October 5, 2010 |work= Lightwaveonline.com |accessdate= July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies introduced technology to reduce the power required for Ethernet before the standard was ratified, using the name '''Green Ethernet'''.

Some energy-efficient switch [[integrated circuits]] were developed before the IEEE 802.3az Energy-Efficient Ethernet standard was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Broadcom Corporation|date=June 3, 2009 |title=Top OEMs 'Go Green' With Broadcom's 65nm SMB Switch Family |url= http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=s387906  |accessdate= July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brcm-een"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calit2.uci.edu/uploads/Media/Text/Ilyadis_BRCM_EEN_Update_UCI%20Workshop%20April%201%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title=Broadcom Energy Efficiency Initiatives |date=April 1, 2010 |author=Nicholas Ilyadis |publisher=[[Broadcom]] |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |df= }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential savings ==
{{see also|IT energy management}}

In 2005, all the [[network interface controller]]s in the United States (in computers, switches, and routers) used an estimated 5.3 terawatt-hours of electricity.&lt;ref name=IEEESpectrum&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/energyefficient-ethernet |work=IEEE SpectrumEnergy-Efficient Ethernet: Ethernet connections waste lots of watts. It need not be so |author= Prachi Patel-Predd |title= Energy-Efficient Ethernet |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= May 2008 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a researcher at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]], Energy-Efficient Ethernet can potentially save an estimated {{nowrap|[[United States dollar|US$]]450 million}} a year in energy costs in the U.S. Most of the savings would come from homes ({{nowrap|$200 million}}) and offices ({{nowrap|$170 million}}), and the remaining {{nowrap|$80 million}} from data centers.&lt;ref name=EETimes/&gt;

== Concepts ==
The power reduction is accomplished in a few ways. In [[Fast Ethernet]], [[Gigabit Ethernet]] and [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] links, constant and significant energy is used by the [[physical layer]] as transmitters are active regardless of whether data is being sent. If they could be put into sleep mode when no data is being sent, that energy could be saved.&lt;ref name=EETimes&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4076984/Energy-efficient-Ethernet-standard-gains-traction/ |title=Energy-efficient Ethernet standard gains traction |work=EE Times |date= May 8, 2008 |first= Rick |last=Merritt |accessdate= July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the controlling software or firmware decides that no data needs to be sent, it can issue a low-power idle (LPI) request to the Ethernet controller physical layer [[PHY (chip)|PHY]]. The PHY will then send LPI symbols for a specified time onto the link, and then disable its transmitter. Refresh signals are sent periodically to maintain link signaling integrity. When there is data to transmit, a normal IDLE signal is sent for a predetermined period of time. The data link is considered to be always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the transmit path is in sleep mode.&lt;ref name="Ethernet: The Definitive Guide"&gt;{{cite book | last = Spurgeon | first = Charles | title = Ethernet: The Definitive Guide | publisher = O'Reilly | year = 2014 | location = | pages = 119–120 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Definitive-Charles-E-Spurgeon/dp/1449361846/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1410208370&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ethernet+the+definitive+guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green Ethernet ==
Green Ethernet technology was a superset of the 802.3az standard.  In addition to the link load power savings of Energy-Efficient Ethernet, Green Ethernet works in one of two ways. First, it detects link status, allowing each port on the switch to power down into a standby mode when a connected device, such as a computer, is not active. Second, it detects cable length and adjusts the power used for transmission accordingly. Standard switches provide enough power to send a signal up to {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps133/products_tech_note09186a00801f5d9e.shtml#limits|title=Ethernet 100BaseTX and 10BaseT Cables: Guidelines and specifications|work=Cisco 10000 Series Routers |publisher=Cisco Systems|at=Specifications and Connection Limits for 100-Mbps Transmission|date=August 1, 2006|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is often unnecessary in the SOHO environment, where {{convert|5|to|10|m|ft|sp=us}} of cabling are typical between rooms. Moreover, small data centers can also benefit from this approach since the majority of cabling is confined to a single room with a few meters of cabling among servers and switches. In addition to the pure power saving benefits of Green Ethernet, backing off the transmit power on shorter cable runs reduces alien crosstalk, and improves the overall performance of the cabling system.

Green Ethernet also encompasses the use of more efficient circuitry in Ethernet chips, and the use of [[TCP offload engine|offload engines]] on Ethernet interface cards intended for network servers.&lt;ref name="brcm-een" /&gt; In April 2008, the term was used for switches, and, in July 2008, used with wireless routers which featured user-selectable off periods for [[Wi-Fi]] to further reduce energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=D-Link| url= http://www.dlinkgreen.com/press.asp?pressrelease_id=3 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 |date= July 28, 2008 |title=D-Link First Company to Offer Green Wi-Fi Home Networking |website=DLinkGreen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Ethernet was first employed on home products. However, low port counts mean that significant energy savings are not going to be made using this technology only in the home. Turning off existing devices when they are idle is likely to provide a more immediate saving.&lt;ref name=smallnetDGStest&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/lanwan-features/30407-how-much-can-d-links-qgreen-ethernetq-switch-save-you |title=How Much Can D-Link's "Green Ethernet" Switch Save You? |author= Tom Higins |date= April 23, 2008 |work= Small Net Builder blog |accessdate= July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projected power savings of up to 80 percent were estimated using Green Ethernet switches,&lt;ref name="dlink2007"&gt;{{cite news |publisher= D-Link |url= http://www.dlinkgreen.com/press.asp?pressrelease_id=6 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 |date= October 24, 2007 |title= D-Link First Company to Offer 'Green Ethernet™' Technology for Network Connectivity, Embrace Energy-Saving Initiatives |quote=For example, when connected and subsequently powered down, the DGS-2208  multi-port desktop switch can realize up to 80 percent savings in power usage*, and the other D-Link 'Green Ethernet' switches can save up to 45 percent in power usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; translating into a longer product life due to reduced heat dissipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Green Ethernet |first=Brad |last=Kenney |date=April 11, 2008 |work=IndustryWeek |url=http://www.industryweek.com/articles/green_ethernet_16103.aspx |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602232847/http://www.industryweek.com/articles/green_ethernet_16103.aspx# |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''Ferrallitisation''' is the process in which [[rock (geology)|rock]] is changed into a [[soil]] consisting of [[clay]] ([[kaolinite]]) and [[sesquioxide]]s, in the form of hydrated oxides of iron and [[aluminium]]. In humid [[tropical]] areas, with consistently high temperatures and rainfall for all or most of the year, [[chemical weathering]] rapidly breaks down the rock. This at first produces clays which later also break down to form [[silica]]. The silica is removed by [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] and the sesquioxides of iron and aluminium remain, giving the characteristic red colour of many [[tropical|tropical soil]]s. Ferrallitisation is the reverse of [[podsolisation]], where silica remains and the iron and aluminum are removed. In tropical [[rain forest]]s with rain throughout the year, ferrallitic soils develop. In [[savanna]] areas, with altering dry and wet climates, [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] soils occur.

The '''Frank R. Bowerman Landfill''' is a [[landfill]] in the western [[Santa Ana Mountains]], in [[Orange County, California]]. It opened in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/LEA/hearing/Notice/OCNotice.pdf |title=public notice on proposed revision of the Bowerman Landfill permit |format=PDF |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landfill is located between [[Limestone Canyon Regional Park]] and [[California State Route 241|State Route 241]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/locations/frank-r-bowerman-landfill-635061/ |title=OC Weekly website |publisher=Ocweekly.com |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the largest landfills in California and the ninth largest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheeler|first=Ian|title=From Buried Trash, A Treasure Chest of Energy|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=October 27, 2013|page=News 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains an estimated 31 million tons of waste.

Beware that water need not be separated, causing the need to add chemicals so that the crude and water emulsifies. This process is then reversed at storage by adding demulsifiers that makes the water fall out, and can be tapped from the bottom of the tank. The gas and condensate are pumped on designated pipelines for this, while the sand and sediments require special handling. A gas/oil and water separator is called a 3-stage separator.

After storage of the crude this can be sold to refineries, that then produce the fuels, chemicals and energy we consume. 

==Reasons for processing==
===Pressure===
The raw crude often leaves the well head under very high pressure. Production pressures of greater than {{convert|23000|psi|atm}} is not uncommon. The high pressure is dampened at the choke valve (or "Blow-out preventer" - BOP) that is the only equipment on the rig before the GOSP - or "3-stage Separator". Modern oil recovery may place a hydro-cyclone to replace the GOSP, allowing the water to be removed immediately and re-injected into the well. The cyclone will vary the rotation according to the water content and can also separate condensate from the gas where separate storage can be provided for the products close to the production well (e.g. on offshore platforms).

If the crude is pumped after just filtering away sands, the crude, gas and water will separate on the pipeline, forming "clogs" and "clutter" where the gas and water runs smooth and crude runs slower. This will make the pressure vary, and the pipeline will burst (M.A.A).

===Contaminants===
Produced crude oil leaving the well may contain large quantities of sulfur (contains e.g. [[hydrogen sulfide]] and sulfuric acid) and is then called "sour". The sulfur can be very difficult to remove since it may be bound to molecules in the crude and encapsulated in this. The most usual "crude sweetening packages" use glycol and/or fatty acids to remove the sulphur content. Crude that contains water is called "wet", and the water can then be bound in an emulsion in the crude to allow pumping on a pipeline. The crude must be processed and treated to make it safe, environmentally acceptable, before it can be transported to a refinery for processing.

===Phase separation===
It is often appropriate to separate gases and liquids for separate use. This also involves the separation of oily and water liquid phases.

===Gas recovery===
In old days, the gas was considered waste and was burned on the spot - [[Gas flare|flared off]]. By recovering the gas, carbon emissions are reduced at the production site, and create a marketable commodity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">In [[mathematics]], the concept of a '''generalised metric''' is a generalisation of that of a [[metric space|metric]], in which the distance is not a [[real number]] but taken from an arbitrary [[ordered field]].

In general, when we define [[metric space]] the distance function is taken to be a real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]]. The real numbers form an ordered field which is [[archimedean property|Archimedean]] and [[complete ordered field|order complete]]. These metric spaces have some nice properties like: in a metric space [[compactness]], [[sequential compactness]] and [[countable compactness]] are equivalent etc. These properties may not, however, hold so easily if the distance function is taken in an arbitrary ordered field, instead of in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

==Preliminary definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;(F,+,\cdot,&lt;)&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary ordered field, and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; a nonempty set; a function &lt;math&gt;d :M\times M\to F^+\cup\{0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called a metric on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, iff the following conditions hold:

# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y&lt;/math&gt;;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=d(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;, commutativity;
# &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)+d(y,z)\geq d(x,z)&lt;/math&gt;, triangle inequality.

It is not difficult to verify that the open balls &lt;math&gt;B(x,\delta)\;:=\{y\in M\;:d(x,y)&lt;\delta\}&lt;/math&gt; form a basis for a suitable topology, the latter called the  ''[[metric topology]]'' on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with the metric in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

In view of the fact that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in its [[order topology]] is [[monotonically normal]], we would expect &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be at least [[Regular space|regular]].

== Further properties ==
However, under [[axiom of choice]], every general metric is [[monotonically normal]], for, given &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is open, there is an open ball &lt;math&gt;B(x,\delta)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in B(x,\delta)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. Take &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)=B(x,\delta/2)&lt;/math&gt;. Verify the conditions for Monotone Normality.

The matter of wonder is that, even without choice, general metrics are [[monotonically normal]].

''proof''.

Case I: ''F'' is an [[Archimedean field]].

Now, if ''x'' in  &lt;math&gt;G, G&lt;/math&gt; open, we may take &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G):= B(x,1/2n(x,G))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n(x,G):= \min\{n\in\mathbb N:B(x,1/n)\subseteq G\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the trick is done without choice.

Case II: F is a non-Archimedean field.

For given &lt;math&gt;x\in G&lt;/math&gt; where ''G'' is open, consider the set
&lt;math&gt;A(x,G):=\{a\in F\colon \forall n\in\mathbb N,B(x,n\cdot a)\subseteq G\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The  set ''A''(''x'', ''G'') is non-empty. For, as ''G'' is open, there is an open ball ''B''(''x'', ''k'') within ''G''. Now, as ''F'' is non-Archimdedean, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb N_F&lt;/math&gt; is not bounded above, hence there is some &lt;math&gt;\xi\in F&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall n\in\mathbb N\colon n\cdot 1\le\xi&lt;/math&gt;. Putting &lt;math&gt;a=k\cdot (2\xi)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is in ''A''(''x'', ''G'').

Now define &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)=\bigcup\{B(x,a)\colon a\in A(x,G)\}&lt;/math&gt;. We would show that with respect to this mu operator, the space is monotonically normal. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''y'' is not in ''G''(open set containing ''x'') and ''x'' is not in ''H''(open set containing ''y''), then we'd show that &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)&lt;/math&gt; is empty. If not, say ''z'' is in the intersection. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\exists a\in A(x,G)\colon d(x,z)&lt;a;\;\;
\exists b\in A(y,H)\colon d(z,y)&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

From the above, we get that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\le d(x,z)+d(z,y)&lt;2\cdot\max\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is impossible since this would imply that either ''y'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mu(x,G)\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt; or ''x'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\mu(y,H)\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;.

So we are done!

'''Glacial erratic boulders of Estonia''' are large [[boulders]] of rock which have been formed and moved into [[Estonia]] by [[glacial erratic|glacial action]] during previous [[ice age]]s.  Before the [[takeover of Estonia]] by the [[Soviet Union]], these large boulders were a symbol of [[national identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=224 |title=Nature and National Identity After Communism |author=Katrina Z. S. Schwartz |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |isbn=9780822973140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are now registered and protected by the Estonian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Nationalizing Nature: the history, preservation and meaning of glacial erratic boulders in Estonia |author=Rob Smurr |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These boulders are found in especially large quantities in Estonia.  Most of the boulders greater than {{nowrap|30 metres}} in circumference found in northern Europe are in Estonia.  There are 62 known boulders of this size in Estonia.  Some particular large ones have been found in the sea, including some near [[Osmussaar]] that are {{nowrap|100 metres}} diameter.  The Osmussaar boulders are believed to have been pushed there by glaciers from the [[Neugrund crater|Neugrund meteorite crater]].&lt;ref name=Raukos&gt;Anto Raukos, "Evolution of the theory of continental glaciation in northern and eastern Europe" in R. H. Grapes, D. R. Oldroyd, A. Grigelis (eds), ''History of Geomorphology and Quaternary Geology'', pp. 79-86, [[Geological Society of London]], 2008 {{ISBN|1862392552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estonian boulders were important in the development of the idea that northern Europe was once covered in glaciers.  The first to suggest that the boulders were moved by glaciers was Russian mineralogist [[Vasily Severgin]] who was led to this conclusion by their similarity to Finnish [[Basement (geology)|basement rock]] at the very early date of 1815.  However, Severgin was later to retract this theory in favour of the drift theory of [[Charles Lyell]] who believed they had been carried by icebergs.  However, in the following years of the 19th century the glaciation theory slowly gained the ascendancy.&lt;ref name=Raukos/&gt;

'''Glass''' is a non-[[Crystallinity|crystalline]] [[amorphous solid]] that is often transparent and has widespread practical, technological, and decorative usage in, for example, [[window]] panes, [[tableware]], and [[optoelectronic]]s. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of glass are "silicate glasses" based on the chemical compound [[silicon dioxide|silica]] (silicon dioxide, or [[quartz]]), the primary constituent of [[sand]].  The term ''glass'', in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, which is familiar from use as window glass and in glass bottles. Of the many silica-based glasses that exist, ordinary glazing and container glass is formed from a specific type called [[soda-lime glass]], composed of approximately 75% [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[sodium oxide]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Calcium oxide|calcium oxide (CaO)]], also called [[Lime (material)|lime]], and several minor additives.

Many applications of silicate glasses derive from their optical [[transparency and translucency|transparency]], giving rise to their primary use as window panes. Glass will [[Transmission coefficient#Optics|transmit]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] and [[refraction|refract]] light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make [[Lens (optics)|optical lenses]], [[prism]]s, fine glassware, and [[optical fiber]]s for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with [[vitreous enamel]]s. These qualities have led to the extensive use of glass in the manufacture of [[art objects]] and in particular, [[stained glass|stained glass windows]]. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[vase]]s, [[bottle]]s, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for [[paperweight collecting|paperweights]], [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], and [[bead]]s. When extruded as [[glass fiber]] and matted as [[glass wool]] in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer [[plastic]], they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material [[fiberglass]]. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.

Scientifically, the term "glass" is often defined in a broader sense, encompassing every solid that possesses a non-crystalline (that is, amorphous) structure at the atomic scale and that exhibits a [[glass transition]] when heated towards the liquid state. [[Porcelain]]s and many polymer [[thermoplastic]]s familiar from everyday use are glasses. These sorts of glasses can be made of quite different kinds of materials than silica: metallic [[alloy]]s, ionic melts, [[aqueous solution]]s, molecular liquids, and [[polymer]]s. For many applications, like [[glass bottles]] or [[eyewear]], polymer glasses ([[acrylic glass]], [[polycarbonate]] or [[polyethylene terephthalate]]) are a lighter alternative than traditional glass.

[[Fused quartz]] is a glass made from chemically-pure silica. It has excellent resistance to [[thermal shock]], being able to survive immersion in water while red hot.  However, its high melting temperature (1723&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]) and viscosity make it difficult to work with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ge-Hy/Glass.html|access-date=1 April 2015|title=Glass – Chemistry Encyclopedia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402113454/http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ge-Hy/Glass.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing. One is [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, "soda"), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. The soda makes the glass [[Sodium silicate|water-soluble]], which is usually undesirable, so [[lime (mineral)|lime]] (CaO, [[calcium oxide]], generally obtained from [[limestone]]), some [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO) and [[aluminium oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are added to provide for a better chemical durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight and is called a [[soda-lime glass]].&lt;ref name="ullmann"&gt;B.H.W.S. de Jong, "Glass"; in "Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry"; 5th edition, vol.

Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties. [[Lead glass]] or [[flint glass]] is more "brilliant" because the increased [[refractive index]] causes noticeably more [[specular reflection]] and increased [[Dispersion (optics)|optical dispersion]]. Adding [[barium]] also increases the refractive index.

==Physical properties==
{{See also|List of physical properties of glass}}

===Optical properties===
Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, [[polycrystal]]line materials do not generally transmit visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barsoum |first=Michel W. |title=Fundamentals of ceramics |year=2003 |publisher=IOP |location=Bristol |isbn=978-0750309028 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets ([[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]) reflect or scatter light resulting in [[diffuse reflection]]. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow [[surface tension]], which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing, i.e., colored.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;{{cite book |title=Optical properties of glass |publisher=American Ceramic Society |location=Westerville, OH |isbn=978-0944904350 |editor1=Donald R.

==Contemporary production==
{{Main|Glass production|Float glass|Flat glass|Glassblowing|Glazier}}

Following the [[glass batch]] preparation and mixing, the raw materials are transported to the furnace. [[Soda-lime glass]] for [[mass production]] is melted in [[Glass production#Furnace|gas fired units]]. Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.&lt;ref name=ullmann/&gt;
After melting, homogenization and [[refining (glass)|refining]] (removal of bubbles), the glass is [[Template:Glass forming|formed]]. [[Flat glass]] for windows and similar applications is formed by the [[float glass]] process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfg.co.za/about%20glass.htm |title=PFG Glass |publisher=Pfg.co.za |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106210357/http://www.pfg.co.za/about%20glass.htm |archivedate=6 November 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Container glass]] for common bottles and jars is formed by [[Glass container production#Forming process|blowing and pressing]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kbxv0oPJPK4C&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=%22container+glass%22+is+made+using+blowing+and+pressing+method#v=onepage&amp;q=%22container%20glass%22%20is%20made%20using%20blowing%20and%20pressing%20method&amp;f=false|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40,: Protection of Environment, Part 60 (Sections 60.1-end), Revised As of July 1, 2011|last=Office|first=U.S. Government Printing|date=October 2011|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0160889073}}&lt;/ref&gt; This glass is often slightly modified chemically (with more alumina and calcium oxide) for greater water resistance. Further glass forming techniques are summarized in the table [[Template:Glass forming|Glass forming techniques]].

Once the desired form is obtained, glass is usually [[annealing (glass)|annealed]] for the removal of stresses and to increase the glass's hardness and durability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2PSRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=glass+annealed+to+remove+stress#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20annealed%20to%20remove%20stress&amp;f=false|title=Scratching the Surface – An Introduction to Photonics – Part 1 Optics, Thin Films, Lasers and Crystals|last=Richling|first=Jeffrey|year=2017|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1312651708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color===
{{Main|Glass coloring and color marking}}
[[File:Cups2.png|thumb|Some of the many color possibilities of glass]]
Color in glass may be obtained by addition of electrically charged ions (or [[Transparent materials#Absorption of light in solids|color centers]]) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in [[photochromic lens|photochromic glasses]]).&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book |last=Vogel |first=Werner |title=Glass Chemistry |publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co.

Further FeO and [[chromium(III) oxide]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) additions may be used for the production of green bottles. [[Sulfur]], together with [[carbon]] and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce amber glass ranging from yellowish to almost black.&lt;ref&gt;David M Issitt.

[[Art glass]] and [[studio glass]] pieces are colored using closely guarded recipes that involve specific combinations of metal oxides, melting temperatures and "cook" times. Most colored glass used in the art market is manufactured in volume by vendors who serve this market, although there are some glassmakers with the ability to make their own color from raw materials.

Naturally occurring glass, especially the [[volcanic glass]] [[obsidian]], was used by many [[Stone Age]] societies across the globe for the production of sharp cutting tools and, due to its limited source areas, was extensively traded. But in general, archaeological evidence suggests that the first true glass was made in coastal north Syria, [[Mesopotamia]] or [[ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |title=Glass Online: The History of Glass |accessdate=29 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024000436/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |archivedate=24 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known glass objects, of the mid third millennium BCE, were beads, perhaps initially created as accidental by-products of [[Metalworking|metal-working]] ([[slag]]s) or during the production of [[Egyptian faience|faience]], a pre-glass vitreous material made by a process similar to glazing.&lt;ref&gt;True glazing over a ceramic body was not used until many centuries after the production of the first glass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glass remained a luxury material, and the [[Bronze age collapse|disasters]] that overtook Late Bronze Age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt.

[[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] in America specialized in stained glass, both secular and religious, and his famous lamps. The early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as [[Waterford Crystal|Waterford]] and [[Lalique]]. From about 1960 onwards, there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks, and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass, and their works as part [[fine art]]s.

New chemical glass compositions or new treatment techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The raw materials for laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure [[chemical]]s are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as [[alkali metal|alkali]] or [[alkaline earth metal]] oxides and hydroxides, or [[boron trioxide|boron oxide]]), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition).&lt;ref name=pnnl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/mti/1999/labs/glass_ceramics/mst_glass.html |title=Glass melting, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505144629/http://depts.washington.edu/mti/1999/labs/glass_ceramics/mst_glass.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during the selection of the raw materials, e.g., [[sodium selenite]] may be preferred over easily evaporating [[Selenium dioxide|SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] ones, such as [[Aluminium hydroxide|Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] over [[Aluminium oxide|Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass [[homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneity]] is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture ([[glass batch]]), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually [[annealing (glass)|annealed]] to prevent breakage during processing.&lt;ref name=pnnl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fluegel |first=Alexander |url=http://glassproperties.com/melting/ |title=Glass melting in the laboratory |publisher=Glassproperties.com |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213120553/http://glassproperties.com/melting/ |archivedate=13 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make glass from materials with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques are used to increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal nucleation triggers. Examples of these techniques include [[aerodynamic levitation]] (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream), [[splat quenching]] (pressing the melt between two metal anvils) and roller quenching (pouring the melt through rollers).[[File:Glasfaser Roving.jpg|thumb|Some [[glass fiber]]s]]

The presence of non-bridging oxygens lowers the relative number of strong bonds in the material and disrupts the network, decreasing the [[viscosity]] of the melt and lowering the melting temperature.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The alkali metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a degree of [[electrical conductivity]], especially in molten state or at high temperature. Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion. Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis. The most common commercial glass types contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions (usually sodium and calcium), for easier processing and satisfying corrosion resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourhis |first=Eric Le |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34W4ZNDBHqQC&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Glass: Mechanics and Technology |page=74 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=2007 |isbn=978-3527315499 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117100420/https://books.google.com/books?id=34W4ZNDBHqQC&amp;pg=PA64 |archivedate=17 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion resistance of glass can be increased by [[dealkalization]], removal of the alkali ions from the glass surface&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UvLTPs9USwgC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Corrosion+resistance+of+glass+can+be+increased+by+dealkalization,+removal+of+the+alkali+ions+from+the+glass+surface+by+reaction#v=onepage&amp;q=Corrosion%20resistance%20of%20glass%20can%20be%20increased%20by%20dealkalization,%20removal%20of%20the%20alkali%20ions%20from%20the%20glass%20surface%20by%20reaction&amp;f=false|title=Advances in Porcelain Enamel Technology|last=Baldwin|first=Charles|last2=Evele|first2=Holger|last3=Pershinsky|first3=Renee|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0470640890}}&lt;/ref&gt; by reaction with sulfur or fluorine compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cj4vBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=dealkalization+of+glass+reacting+with+sulfur+or+fluorine+compounds#v=onepage&amp;q=dealkalization%20of%20glass%20reacting%20with%20sulfur%20or%20fluorine%20compounds&amp;f=false|title=Glass Surfaces: Proceedings of the Fourth Rolla Ceramic Materials Conference on Glass Surfaces, St. Louis, Missouri, USA, 15–19 June, 1975|last=Day|first=D.E.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1483165226}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the [[loss tangent]] of the glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vJIpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Presence+of+alkaline+metal+ions+has+also+detrimental+effect+to+the+loss+tangent+of+the+glass&amp;dq=Presence+of+alkaline+metal+ions+has+also+detrimental+effect+to+the+loss+tangent+of+the+glass|title=Electri-onics|date=1985|publisher=Lake Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to its [[electrical resistance]]; glass manufactured for electronics (sealing, vacuum tubes, lamps&amp;nbsp;...) have to take this in account.

Addition of [[lead(II) oxide]] lowers melting point, lowers [[viscosity]] of the melt, and increases [[refractive index]]. Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glass. The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glass); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in [[vitreous enamel]]s and [[glass solder]]s. The high [[ionic radius]] of the Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (10&lt;sup&gt;8.5&lt;/sup&gt; vs 10&lt;sup&gt;6.5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ω⋅cm, [[direct current|DC]] at 250&amp;nbsp;°C).

Addition of [[fluorine]] lowers the [[dielectric constant]] of glass. Fluorine is highly [[electronegative]] and attracts the electrons in the lattice, lowering the polarizability of the material. Such silicon dioxide-fluoride is used in manufacture of [[integrated circuit]]s as an insulator. High levels of fluorine doping lead to formation of volatile SiF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and such glass is then thermally unstable. Stable layers were achieved with dielectric constant down to about 3.5–3.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doering |first=Robert |last2=Nishi |first2=Yoshio |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PsVVKz_hjBgC&amp;pg=SA12-PA3 |title=Handbook of semiconductor manufacturing technology |pages=12–3 |publisher=CRC Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-1574446753 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117040528/https://books.google.com/books?id=PsVVKz_hjBgC&amp;pg=SA12-PA3 |archivedate=17 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amorphous metals===
{{main|Amorphous metal}}
[[File:Bulk Metallic Glass Sample.jpg|thumb|Samples of amorphous metal, with millimeter scale]]
In the past, small batches of [[amorphous metal]]s with high surface area configurations (ribbons, wires, films, etc.) have been produced through the implementation of extremely rapid rates of cooling. This was initially termed "splat cooling" by doctoral student W. Klement at Caltech, who showed that cooling rates on the order of millions of degrees per second is sufficient to impede the formation of crystals, and the metallic atoms become "locked into" a glassy state. Amorphous metal wires have been produced by sputtering molten metal onto a spinning metal disk. More recently a number of alloys have been produced in layers with thickness exceeding 1 millimeter.

In 2004, [[NIST]] researchers presented evidence that an [[isotropic]] non-crystalline metallic phase (dubbed "q-glass") could be grown from the melt. This phase is the first phase, or "primary phase", to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a ''first-order transition''. [[Transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The [[X-ray scattering techniques|diffraction pattern]] shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a [[nucleation]] barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metallurgy.nist.gov/techactv2004/TechnicalHighlights.html#glass|title=Metallurgy Division Publications|work=NIST Interagency Report 7127|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916063500/http://www.metallurgy.nist.gov/techactv2004/TechnicalHighlights.html#glass|archivedate=16 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mendelev |first=M.I. |last2=Schmalian |first2=J. |last3=Wang |first3=C.Z. |last4=Morris |first4=J.R. |author5=K.M.

[[Electrolyte]]s or molten [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] are mixtures of different [[ion]]s. In a mixture of three or more ionic species of dissimilar size and shape, crystallization can be so difficult that the liquid can easily be supercooled into a glass.

===Molecular liquids===

A ''molecular liquid'' is composed of molecules that do not form a covalent network but interact only through weak [[van der Waals force]]s or through transient [[hydrogen bond]]s.
Many molecular liquids can be supercooled into a glass; some are excellent glass formers that normally do not crystallize.

An example of this is [[sugar glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uk66BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22sugar+glass%22+example+of+molecular+liquid#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sugar%20glass%22%20example%20of%20molecular%20liquid&amp;f=false|title=Candy Bites: The Science of Sweets|last=Hartel|first=Richard W.|last2=Hartel|first2=AnnaKate|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1461493839}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymers===
Important polymer glasses include amorphous and glassy pharmaceutical compounds. These are useful because the solubility of the compound is greatly increased when it is amorphous compared to the same crystalline composition. Many emerging pharmaceuticals are practically insoluble in their crystalline forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ics.u-strasbg.fr/etsp//research/glass/field.php Understanding polymer glasses ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525003628/http://www-ics.u-strasbg.fr/etsp/research/glass/field.php |date=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass-ceramics===
[[File:Glass ceramic cooktop.jpg|right|thumb|A high-strength glass-ceramic cooktop with negligible [[thermal expansion]].]]
[[Glass-ceramic]] materials share many properties with both non-crystalline glass and [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] [[ceramic]]s. They are formed as a glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment. For example, the microstructure of whiteware ceramics frequently contains both [[amorphous]] and [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] phases. Crystalline grains are often embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase of [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]]. When applied to whiteware ceramics, [[:wikt:vitreous|vitreous]] means the material has an extremely low [[permeability (fluid)|permeability]] to liquids, often but not always water, when determined by a specified test regime.&lt;ref name="KBU"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kingery |first=W.D. |last2=Uhlmann |first2=H.K. Bowen, D.R. |title=Introduction to ceramics |year=1976 |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |isbn=978-0471478607 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD"&gt;{{cite book |last=Richerson |first=David W. |title=Modern ceramic engineering : properties, processing and use in design |year=1992 |publisher=Dekker |location=New York |isbn=978-0824786342 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term mainly refers to a mix of lithium and [[aluminosilicate]]s that yields an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties. The most commercially important of these have the distinction of being impervious to thermal shock. Thus, glass-ceramics have become extremely useful for countertop cooking. The negative [[thermal expansion]] coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of [[glass-ceramic]] exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="KBU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MOD" /&gt;

==Structure==
{{main|Structure of liquids and glasses}}
As in other [[amorphous solid]]s, the atomic structure of a glass lacks the long-range periodicity observed in [[Crystal structure|crystalline solids]]. Due to [[chemical bonding]] characteristics, glasses do possess a high degree of short-range order with respect to local atomic [[polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salmon |first=P. S. |title=Order within disorder |doi=10.1038/nmat737 |journal=Nature Materials |pmid=12618817 |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=87–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Silica.svg|thumb|left|The amorphous structure of glassy silica (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in two dimensions. No long-range order is present, although there is local ordering with respect to the [[tetrahedral]] arrangement of oxygen (O) atoms around the silicon (Si) atoms.]]

===Formation from a supercooled liquid===

In physics, the standard definition of a glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt [[quenching]],&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] definition of glass from 1945; also: [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 1259, Glas – Begriffe für Glasarten und Glasgruppen, September 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zallen83&gt;{{cite book |last=Zallen |first=R. |title=The Physics of Amorphous Solids |publisher=John Wiley |place=New York |year=1983 |isbn=978-0471019688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cusack87&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cusack |first=N.E. |title=The physics of structurally disordered matter: an introduction |publisher=Adam Hilger in association with the University of Sussex press |year=1987 |isbn=978-0852748299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliot84&gt;{{Cite book |last=Elliot |first=S.R. |title=Physics of Amorphous Materials |publisher=Longman group ltd |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horst Scholze 1991"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Scholze |first=Horst |title=Glass – Nature, Structure, and Properties |publisher=Springer |year=1991 |isbn=978-0387973968}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term glass is often used to describe any [[amorphous solid]] that exhibits a [[glass transition]] temperature T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic [[crystallization]] time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the [[supercooled]] liquid is frozen into the solid state at T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability.

where certain [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[thermodynamic variable|variables]] such as [[volume]], [[entropy]] and [[enthalpy]] are discontinuous through the glass transition range. The [[glass transition]] may be described as analogous to a second-order phase transition where the intensive thermodynamic variables such as the [[thermal expansion|thermal expansivity]] and [[heat capacity]] are discontinuous.&lt;ref name=Zallen83/&gt; Nonetheless, the equilibrium theory of phase transformations does not entirely hold for glass, and hence the glass transition cannot be classed as one of the classical equilibrium phase transformations in solids.&lt;ref name="Elliot84"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horst Scholze 1991"/&gt;

Glass is an amorphous solid. It exhibits an atomic structure close to that observed in the supercooled liquid phase but displays all the mechanical properties of a solid.&lt;ref name=Gibbs&gt;{{cite web |last=Gibbs |first=Philip |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/Glass/glass.html |title=Is glass liquid or solid? |accessdate=21 March 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329154027/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/Glass/glass.html |archivedate=29 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Philip Gibbs" ''Glass Worldwide'', (May/June 2007), pp. 14–18&lt;/ref&gt; The notion that glass flows to an appreciable extent over extended periods of time is not supported by empirical research or theoretical analysis (see [[viscosity of amorphous materials]]).

Although the atomic structure of glass shares characteristics of the structure in a [[supercooled liquid]], glass tends to behave as a solid below its glass transition temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neumann |first=Florin |url=http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C01/C01Links/www.ualberta.ca/~bderksen/florin.html |title=Glass: Liquid or Solid – Science vs. an Urban Legend |accessdate=8 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409022023/http://dwb.unl.edu/Teacher/NSF/C01/C01Links/www.ualberta.ca/~bderksen/florin.html |archivedate=9 April 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A supercooled liquid behaves as a liquid, but it is below the [[freezing point]] of the material, and in some cases will crystallize almost instantly if a crystal is added as a core. The change in heat capacity at a glass transition and a [[melting point|melting transition]] of comparable materials are typically of the same order of magnitude, indicating that the change in active [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] is comparable as well. Both in a glass and in a crystal it is mostly only the [[vibration]]al degrees of freedom that remain active, whereas [[rotational]] and [[translation (physics)|translational]] motion is arrested. This helps to explain why both crystalline and non-crystalline solids exhibit rigidity on most experimental time scales.

===Behavior of antique glass===
The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/science/29glass.html?ex=1375070400&amp;en=048ade4011756b24&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=The Nature of Glass Remains Anything but Clear|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 July 2008|date=29 July 2008|author=Kenneth Chang|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424094929/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/29/science/29glass.html?ex=1375070400&amp;en=048ade4011756b24&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|archivedate=24 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by [[glassblowing|glassblowers]], the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the [[crown glass (window)|crown glass]] process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead [[came]]s at the bottom of the window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/homework/s95602.htm|title=Dr Karl's Homework: Glass Flows|publisher=ABC|location=Australia|date=26 January 2000|accessdate=24 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919032056/http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/homework/s95602.htm|archivedate=19 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Halem |first=H. |url=http://www.glassnotes.com/WindowPanes.html |title=Does Glass Flow |accessdate=2 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022034746/http://www.glassnotes.com/WindowPanes.html |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass production of glass window panes in the early twentieth century caused a similar effect. In glass factories, molten glass was poured onto a large cooling table and allowed to spread. The resulting glass is thicker at the location of the pour, located at the center of the large sheet. These sheets were cut into smaller window panes with nonuniform thickness, typically with the location of the pour centered in one of the panes (known as "bull's-eyes") for decorative effect. Modern glass intended for windows is produced as [[float glass]] and is very uniform in thickness.

Several other points can be considered that contradict the "cathedral glass flow" theory:

Zanotto]] states "...&amp;nbsp;the predicted [[relaxation time]] for [[Germanium dioxide|GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] at [[room temperature]] is [[1 E19 s and more|10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; years]]. Hence, the relaxation period (characteristic flow time) of cathedral glasses would be even longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zanotto |first=Edgar Dutra |title=Do Cathedral Glasses Flow? |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=66 |year=1998 |pages=392–396 |doi=10.1119/1.19026 |bibcode=1998AmJPh..66..392Z |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; years is many times longer than the estimated [[age of the universe]].)
* If medieval glass has flowed perceptibly, then ancient Roman and Egyptian objects should have flowed proportionately more—but this is not observed. Similarly, prehistoric [[obsidian]] blades should have lost their edge; this is not observed either (although obsidian may have a different [[viscosity]] from window glass).&lt;ref name=Gibbs/&gt;
* If glass flows at a rate that allows changes to be seen with the naked eye after centuries, then the effect should be noticeable in antique [[telescope]]s. Any slight deformation in the antique telescopic lenses would lead to a dramatic decrease in optical performance, a phenomenon that is not observed.&lt;ref name=Gibbs/&gt;

'''Granulation''' is the process of forming of [[granularity|grains or granules]] from a [[powder]]y or [[solid]] substance, producing a [[granular material]]. It is applied in several technological processes in chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Typically, granulation involves agglomeration of fine [[particle]]s into larger granules, typically of size range between 0.2 and 4.0&amp;nbsp;mm depending on their subsequent use. Less commonly, it involves shredding or grinding solid material into finer granules or pellets.

==From powder==
The granulation process combines one or more [[powder (substance)|powder]] [[particles]] and forms a granule that will allow tableting to be within required limits. It is the process of collecting particles together by creating bonds between them. Bonds are formed by compression or by using a binding agent. Granulation is extensively used in the [[pharmaceutical industry]], for manufacturing of [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]] and pellets. This way predictable and repeatable process is possible and granules of consistent quality can be produced.

Granulation is carried out for various reasons, one of which is to prevent the [[Particle segregation|segregation]] of the constituents of powder mix. Segregation is due to differences in the size or density of the components of the mix. Normally, the smaller and/or denser particles tend to concentrate at the base of the container with the larger and/or less dense ones on the top. An ideal granulation will contain all the constituents of the mix in the correct proportion in each granule and segregation of granules will not occur.

Many powders, because of their small size, irregular shape or surface characteristics, are cohesive and do not flow well. Granules produced from such a cohesive system will be larger and more isodiametric (roughly spherical), both factors contributing to improved flow properties.

Some powders are difficult to compact even if a readily compactable adhesive is included in the mix, but granules of the same powders are often more easily compacted. This is associated with the distribution of the adhesive within the granule and is a function of the method employed to produce the granule.

For example, if one were to make tablets from [[Sucrose#White_refined|granulated sugar]] versus [[powdered sugar]], powdered sugar would be difficult to compress into a tablet and granulated sugar would be easy to compress. Powdered sugar’s small particles have poor flow and compression characteristics. These small particles would have to be compressed very slowly for a long period of time to make a worthwhile tablet. Unless the powdered sugar is granulated, it could not efficiently be made into a tablet that has good tablet characteristics such as uniform content or consistent hardness.

Two types of granulation technologies are employed: wet granulation and dry granulation.

===Wet granulation===
In wet granulation, granules are formed by the addition of a granulation liquid onto a powder bed which is under the influence of an [[impeller]] (in a high-shear granulator), screws (in a twin screw granulator) &lt;ref name="Doipowtec"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.powtec.2012.05.045 | title = Twin screw granulation using conveying screws: Effects of viscosity of granulation liquids and flow of powders | year = 2012 | last1 = Dhenge | first1 = Ranjit M. | last2 = Washino | first2 = Kimiaki | last3 = Cartwright | first3 = James J. | last4 = Hounslow | first4 = Michael J. | last5 = Salman | first5 = Agba D. | journal = Powder Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; or air (in a fluidized bed granulator). The agitation resulting in the system along with the wetting of the components within the formulation results in the aggregation of the primary powder particles to produce wet granules.&lt;ref name="Doipowtec" /&gt; The granulation liquid ([[fluid]]) contains a [[solvent]] or carrier material which must be [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] so that it can be removed by drying, and depending on the intended application, be non-toxic. Typical liquids include [[water]], [[ethanol]] and [[isopropanol]] either alone or in combination. The liquid solution can be either aqueous based or solvent-based. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than other solvents.

Water mixed into the powders can form bonds between powder particles that are strong enough to lock them together. However, once the water dries, the powders may fall apart. Therefore, water may not be strong enough to create and hold a bond. In such instances, a liquid solution that includes a [[Binder (material)|binder]] (pharmaceutical glue) is required. [[Povidone]], which is a [[polyvinyl pyrrolidone]] (PVP), is one of the most commonly used pharmaceutical binders. PVP is dissolved in water or solvent and added to the process. When PVP and a solvent/water are mixed with powders, PVP forms a bond with the powders during the process, and the solvent/water evaporates (dries). Once the solvent/water has been dried and the powders have formed a more densely held mass, then the granulation is [[Mill (grinding)|milled]]. This process results in the formation of granules.

The process can be very simple or very complex depending on the characteristics of the powders, the final objective of tablet making, and the equipment that is available. In the traditional wet granulation method the wet mass is forced through a sieve to produce wet granules which are subsequently dried.

Wet granulation is traditionally a [[Batch production|batch process]] in the pharmaceutical production, however, the batch type wet granulations are foreseen to be replaced more and more by continuous wet granulation in the pharmaceutical industry in the future. The shift from batch to continuous technologies has been recommended by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sau L. Lee |author2=Thomas F. O’Connor |author3=Xiaochuan Yang |author4=Celia N. Cruz |author5=Sharmista Chatterjee |author6=Rapti D. Madurawe |author7=Christine M. V. Moore |author8=Lawrence X. Yu |author9=Janet Woodcock |title=Modernizing Pharmaceutical Manufacturing: from Batch to Continuous Production|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Innovation|date=2015|volume=10|pages=191–199|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12247-015-9215-8/fulltext.html |doi=10.1007/s12247-015-9215-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This continuous wet granulation technology can be carried out on a twin-screw [[Extrusion|extruder]] into which solid materials and water can be fed at various parts. In the extruder the materials are mixed and granulated due to the intermesh of the screws, especially at the kneading elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=QDevelopment|title=Wet Granulation|url=http://www.qdevelopment.hu/granulation.html|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dry granulation===

The dry granulation process is used to form granules without a liquid solution because the product granulated may be sensitive to moisture and heat. Forming granules without moisture requires compacting and densifying the powders. In this process the primary powder particles are aggregated under high pressure. A swaying granulator or a roll compactor can be used for the dry granulation.

Dry granulation can be conducted under two processes; either a large tablet (slug) is produced in a heavy duty tabletting press or the powder is squeezed between two counter-rotating rollers to produce a continuous sheet or ribbon of material.

When a tablet press is used for dry granulation, the powders may not possess enough natural flow to feed the product uniformly into the [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] cavity, resulting in varying density. The roller compactor (granulator-compactor) uses an [[Screw conveyor|auger]]-feed system that will consistently deliver powder uniformly between two pressure rollers. The powders are compacted into a ribbon or small pellets between these rollers and milled through a low-shear mill. When the product is compacted properly, then it can be passed through a mill and final blend before tablet compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osborne|first=James|author2=T. Althaus |author3=L. Forny |author4=G.Neideiretter |author5=S.Palzer |author6=M.Hounslow |author7= A.D. Salman |title=Bonding Mechanisms Involved in the Roller Compaction of an Amorphous Material|journal=Chemical Engineering Science|year=2013|volume=86|issue=5th International Granulation Workshop|pages=61–69|doi=10.1016/j.ces.2012.05.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical roller compaction processes consist of the following steps: convey powdered material to the compaction area, normally with a screw feeder, compact powder between two counter-rotating rolls with applied forces, mill resulting compact to desired particle size distribution. Roller compacted particle are typically dense, with sharp-edged profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Sackett|first2=Gary|last3=Sheskey|first3=Paul|last4=Liu|first4=Lirong|title=Development, Scale Up and Optimization of Process Parameters: Roller Compaction|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[plastic recycling]], granulation is the process of shredding plastic objects to be recycled into flakes or pellets, suitable for later reuse in [[plastics extrusion]]. In the first stage, plastic objects to be recycled are fed to an electric motor-powered cutting chamber, which continually cuts the material in scissor-like fashion. The material is ground into all the smaller flakes until they became fine enough to fall through a mesh screen. In wet-granulation lines, water is continually sprayed in the cutting chamber to remove the debris and impurities, and acts as a lubricant of the steel blades; in dry-granulation lines, water is not present, but such technology generally produces output of lower quality than the wet technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticrecyclingmachine.net/plastic-granulator/ |title=Plastic Granulator |website=Plastic Recycling Machine |access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the process is relatively simple, it must be carefully parametrized, as the high temperatures resulting from friction can damage the material and affect its plasticity. Regular maintenance and sharpening of the scissor blades are essential, as well as close monitoring of the process due to potential clogging and jamming.&lt;ref name="RosatoRosato2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dominick V. Rosato|author2=Donald V. Rosato|author3=Marlene G. Rosato|title=Injection Molding Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5jqDRauKNYC&amp;pg=PA924|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-8619-3|pages=924–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, granulation may be the only step required before the plastics can be reused for manufacturing of new products. In other, the new or recycled plastic material must be remade into [[Pelletizing|pellets]]. The material is molten and extruded into thin rods, which are then cooled in a water tank and finely chopped into small cyllindric pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ptonline.com/articles/how-to-select-the-right-pelletizer |title=How to Select the Right Pelletizer |date=25 April 2011 |first=Horst |last=Mueller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-pressure electrolysis''' ('''HPE''') is the [[electrolysis of water]] by decomposition of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to the passing of an electric current through the water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risoe.dk/Risoe_dk/Home/Research/sustainable_energy/fuel_cells/projects/SERC/Meetings/~/media/Risoe_dk/Research/SERC/Documents/280808_project1.ashx High pressure electrolysis]&lt;/ref&gt; The difference with a standard [[proton exchange membrane electrolyzer]] is the [[compressed hydrogen]] output around {{convert|120|–|200|bar|MPa|disp=flip}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fz-juelich.de/scientific-report-2001/docs/patente/26_11600.pdf?web_session=e4af90eba1518be519b2c1b61fa42cfb 2001-High pressure electrolysis – The key technology for efficient H.2]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; at 70&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://event08.ise-online.org/site/files/ise080562.pdf Investigations of hydrogen compressor based on proton exchange membrane]&lt;/ref&gt; By pressurising the hydrogen in the electrolyser the need for an external [[hydrogen compressor]] is eliminated, the average energy consumption for internal differential pressure compression is around 3%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fz-juelich.de/ief/ief-3/datapool/page/214/solar%20energy%2075%20469-478.pdf 2003-PHOEBUS-Pag.9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327074743/http://www.fz-juelich.de/ief/ief-3/datapool/page/214/solar%20energy%2075%20469-478.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
As the required compression power for water is less than that for hydrogen-gas the water is pumped up to a high-pressure,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15701199 Prediction of production power for high-pressure hydrogen by high-pressure water electrolysis]&lt;/ref&gt; in the other approach [[differential pressure]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review08/pd_10_hamden.pdf Differential pressure]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also an '''importance''' for the electrolyser stacks to be able to accept a fluctuating electrical input, such as that found with [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itm-power.com/tech/electrolyser-stacks/&lt;/ref&gt; This then enables the ability to help with [[grid balancing]] and [[energy storage]].

==Ultrahigh-pressure electrolysis==
Ultrahigh-pressure electrolysis is high-pressure electrolysis operating at {{convert|5000|–|10000|psi|MPa|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref name="DOE2"&gt;XI.13 High-Efficiency, Ultra-High Pressure Electrolysis with Direct Linkage to Photovoltaic Arrays (Phase II Project) ([http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress05/xi_13_jackson.pdf Available here] Accessed 2008-08-9.)&lt;/ref&gt; At ultra-high pressures the water solubility and cross-permeation across the membrane of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is affecting [[hydrogen purity]], modified PEMs are used to reduce cross-permeation in combination with catalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recombiners to maintain H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at values compatible with [[hydrogen safety]] requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vgr.ing.unipi.it/ichs/fileadmin/user_upload/CD/PAPERS/12SEPT/2.1.73.pdf Hydrogen safety aspects related to high pressure PEM water electrolysis]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOE" /&gt;

==Research==
The [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]] believes that high-pressure electrolysis, supported by ongoing research and development, will contribute to the enabling and acceptance of technologies where hydrogen is the energy carrier between renewable energy resources and clean energy consumers.&lt;ref name="DOE3"&gt;Alkaline, High Pressure Electrolysis ([http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress06/ii_h_5_ibrahim.pdf Available here] Accessed 2008-08-9.)&lt;/ref&gt;

High-pressure electrolysis is being investigated by the DOE for efficient production of hydrogen from water. The target total in 2005 is $4.75 per [[Gasoline gallon equivalent|gge]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at an efficiency of 64%.&lt;ref name="DOE"&gt;2005 DOE H2 Program Review Alkaline, High Pressure Electrolysis.
([http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd26_ibrahim.pdf Available here] Accessed 2008-08-9.)&lt;/ref&gt; The total goal for the DOE in 2010 is $2.85 per gge H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at an efficiency of 75%.&lt;ref name="DOE3" /&gt; As of 2005 the DOE provided a total of $1,563,882 worth of funding for research.&lt;ref name="DOE" /&gt;

Mitsubishi is pursuing such technology with its [[High-pressure hydrogen energy generator]] (HHEG) project.&lt;ref name="Mitsubishi"&gt;Mitsubishi Monitor August and September 2004 ([http://www.mitsubishi.com/mpac/e/monitor/back/0408/news.html available here] Accessed 2008-08-9.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forschungszentrum Jülich, in Jülich Germany is currently researching the cost reduction of components used in high-pressure [[PEM electrolysis]] in the EKOLYSER &lt;ref name="EKOLYSER"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/UeberUns/Kooperationen/EKOLYSER.html|title= Forschungszentrum Jülich EKOLYSER Project|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; project. The primary goal of this research is to improve performance and gas purity, reduce cost and volume of expensive materials and reach the alternative energy targets set forth by the German government for 2050 in the Energy Concept published in 2010.&lt;ref name="energiekonzept2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmu.de/fileadmin/bmu-import/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/energiekonzept_bundesregierung.pdf |title=Das Energiekonzept der Bundesregierung 2010 und die Energiewende 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226222555/http://www.bmu.de/fileadmin/bmu-import/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/energiekonzept_bundesregierung.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carmo2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmo|first=M|author2=Fritz D |author3=Mergel J |author4=Stolten D |title=A comprehensive review on PEM water electrolysis|journal=Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=38|issue=12|pages=4901|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.01.151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57483">'''Hydrogen production''' is the family of industrial methods for generating [[hydrogen]].  Currently the dominant technology for direct production is [[steam reforming]] from [[hydrocarbon]]s. Many other methods are known including [[electrolysis]] and [[thermolysis]]. 

In 2006, the United States was estimated to have a production capacity of 11 million tons of hydrogen. 5 million tons of hydrogen were consumed on-site in oil refining, and in the production of [[ammonia]] ([[Haber process]]) and [[methanol]] (reduction of [[carbon monoxide]]). 0.4 million tons were an incidental by-product of the [[chlor-alkali process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Impact of Increased Use of Hydrogen on Petroleum Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Emissions | title = Appendix C. Existing Hydrogen Production Capacity | publisher = U.S. Energy Information Administration | date = August 2008 | url = http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/hydro/appendixc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydrogen production is an estimated $100 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Zeke|title=Breakthrough in hydrogen fuel production could revolutionize alternative energy market|url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2013/04/040413-cals-hydrogen.html|work=Virginia Tech News|publisher=[[Virginia Tech]]|accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 53 million metric tons were consumed worldwide in 2004. There are no natural hydrogen deposits, and for this reason the production of hydrogen plays a key role in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Energy, U. S. D. o. The Impact of Increased Use of Hydrogen on Petroleum Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Emissions. 84 (Energy Information Administration, Washington, DC, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1999, the majority of hydrogen (∼95%) is produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming or partial oxidation of [[methane]] and [[coal gas]]ification with only a small quantity by other routes such as biomass gasification or electrolysis of water.&lt;ref name="Ogden 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogden |first=J.M. |title=Prospects for building a hydrogen energy infrastructure |journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment |year=1999 |volume=24 |pages=227–279 |doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.24.1.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 8GW of electrolysis capacity is installed 
worldwide, accounting for around 4% of global hydrogen production (Decourt et al., 2014). Developing affordable methods for producing hydrogen with less damage to the environment is a goal of the [[hydrogen economy]].

==Steam reforming==
{{main article|Steam reforming}}

There are four main sources for the commercial production of hydrogen: natural gas, oil, coal, and electrolysis; which account for 48%, 30%, 18% and 4% of the world’s hydrogen production respectively.&lt;ref name="rotech"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Roman J. |last1=Press |first2=K. S. V. |last2=Santhanam |first3=Massoud J. |last3=Miri |first4=Alla V. |last4=Bailey |first5=Gerald A. |last5=Takacs |title=Introduction to hydrogen Technology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-471-77985-8 }}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fossil fuels are the dominant source of industrial hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; Carbon dioxide can be separated from [[natural gas]] with a 60-70% efficiency for hydrogen production and from other [[hydrocarbon]]s to varying degrees of efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;https://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/04/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-about-not-clean/{{full|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;Specifically, bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the [[steam reforming]] of methane or natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-processor.htm Fossil fuel processor]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The production of hydrogen from natural gas is the cheapest source of hydrogen currently. This process consists of heating the gas to between 700-1100°C in the presence of steam and a nickel catalyst. The resulting [[endothermic reaction]] breaks up the methane molecules and forms carbon monoxide CO and hydrogen H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The carbon monoxide gas can then be passed with steam over [[iron oxide]] or other oxides and undergo a [[water gas shift reaction]] to obtain further quantities of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The downside to this process is that its major byproducts are CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="rotech"/&gt; Depending on the quality of the feedstock (natural gas, rich gases, naphtha, etc.), one ton of hydrogen produced will also produce 9 to 12 tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For this process high temperature (700–1100&amp;nbsp;°C) steam (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) reacts with [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in an [[endothermic reaction]] to yield [[syngas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Hydrogen.from.Coal.gasification tampa.jpg|thumb|Gasification]]

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   CO  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In a second stage, additional hydrogen is generated through the lower-temperature, exothermic, [[water gas shift reaction]], performed at about 360&amp;nbsp;°C:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Essentially, the [[oxygen]] (O) atom is stripped from the additional water (steam) to oxidize CO to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This oxidation also provides energy to maintain the reaction.  Additional heat required to drive the process is generally supplied by burning some portion of the methane.

===CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration===&lt;!--rather tangential and almost advocacy--&gt;
Steam reforming generates [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Since the production is concentrated in one facility, it is possible to separate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dispose of it without atmospheric release, for example by injecting it in an oil or gas reservoir (see [[carbon capture]]), although this is not currently done in most cases. A carbon dioxide injection project has been started by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] company [[Statoil]] in the [[North Sea]], at the [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner field]].

Integrated steam reforming / [[co-generation]] - It is possible to combine steam reforming and [[co-generation]] of [[steam]] and [[Electric power|power]] into a single plant. This can deliver benefits for an [[oil refinery]] because it is more efficient than separate [[hydrogen]], [[steam]] and [[Electric power|power]] plants. [[Air Products]] recently built an integrated steam reforming / [[co-generation]] plant in [[Port Arthur, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airproducts.com/nr/rdonlyres/6226ec23-a536-4603-ab37-2b2ff3f9d45b/0/port_arthur_122212258eprint.pdf Port Arthur II Integrated Hydrogen/Cogeneration Facility, Port Arthur, Texas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205185938/http://www.airproducts.com/NR/rdonlyres/6226EC23-A536-4603-AB37-2B2FF3F9D45B/0/Port_Arthur_122212258eprint.pdf |date=2008-12-05 }} Power magazine, September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other production methods from fossil fuels==

===Partial oxidation===
Hydrogen production from natural gas or other hydrocarbons is achieved by partial oxidation. A fuel-air or fuel-oxygen mixture is partially combusted resulting in a hydrogen rich [[syngas]]. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide are obtained via the water-gas shift reaction.&lt;ref name="rotech"/&gt;  Carbon dioxide can be co-fed to lower the hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio. 

The [[partial oxidation]] reaction occurs when a [[stoichiometry|substoichiometric]] fuel-air mixture or fuel-oxygen is partially [[combustion|combusted]] in a reformer or partial oxidation reactor. A distinction is made between ''thermal partial oxidation'' (TPOX) and ''catalytic partial oxidation'' (CPOX). The chemical reaction takes the general form:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''n'' CO + &lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Idealized examples for heating oil and coal, assuming compositions C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, are as follows:
:C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 12 CO + 12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 24 CO + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Plasma reforming ===
The [[Kværner-process]] or Kvaerner [[carbon black]] &amp; [[hydrogen]] process (CB&amp;H)&lt;ref name="BHR"&gt;[http://www.interstatetraveler.us/Reference-Bibliography/Bellona-HydrogenReport.html Bellona-HydrogenReport]&lt;/ref&gt; is a plasma reforming method, developed in the 1980s by a [[Norway|Norwegian]] company of the same name, for the production of hydrogen and [[carbon black]] from liquid hydrocarbons (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Of the available energy of the feed, approximately 48% is contained in the hydrogen, 40% is contained in [[activated carbon]] and 10% in superheated steam.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hfpeurope.org/infotools/energyinfos__e/hydrogen/main03.html{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{full citation needed|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not produced in the process.

A variation of this process is presented in 2009 using [[plasma arc waste disposal]] technology for the production of hydrogen, heat and carbon from methane and natural gas in a plasma converter&lt;ref&gt;[http://fuelcellsworks.com/news/2009/10/12/hydrogen-breakthrough-for-norwegian-company/ Kværner-process with plasma arc waste disposal technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coal ===
For the production of hydrogen from [[coal]], [[coal]] gasification is used. The process of coal gasification uses steam and a carefully controlled concentration of gases to break molecular bonds in coal and form a gaseous mix of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="Hordeski"&gt;Hordeski, M. F. Alternative fuels: the future of hydrogen.  171-199 (The Fairmont Press, inc., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
This source of hydrogen is advantageous since its main product is coal-derived gas which can be used for fuel. The gas obtained from coal gasification can later be used to produce electricity more efficiently and allow a better capture of greenhouse gases than the traditional burning of coal.

Another method for conversion is low temperature and high temperature [[coal carbonization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ef990178a |title=Internal Gas Pressure Characteristics Generated during Coal Carbonization in a Coke Oven |year=2001 |last1=Lee |first1=Woon-Jae |last2=Lee |first2=Yong-Kuk |journal=Energy &amp; Fuels |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=618–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petroleum coke ===
Similarly to coal, [[petroleum coke]] can also be converted in hydrogen rich [[syngas]], via [[coal gasification]]. The syngas in this case consists mainly of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, depending on the sulfur content of the coke feed. [[Gasification]] is an attractive option for producing hydrogen from almost any carbon source, while providing attractive hydrogen utilization alternatives through process integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fuel.2013.06.045 |title=Simulation of the integration of a bitumen upgrading facility and an IGCC process with carbon capture |journal=Fuel |volume=117 |pages=1288–97 |year=2014 |last1=Gemayel |first1=Jimmy El |last2=MacChi |first2=Arturo |last3=Hughes |first3=Robin |last4=Anthony |first4=Edward John }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From water==
{{Main article|Water splitting}}
Many technologies have been explored but it should be noted that as of 2007 "Thermal, thermochemical, biochemical and photochemical processes have so far not found industrial applications."&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;  High temperature electrolysis of alkaline solutions has been used for the industrial scale production of hydrogen (see [[Sable Chemicals]]) and there are now a number of small scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis units available commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HYDROFILL PRO|url=http://www.horizonfuelcell.com/store_other/hydrofillpro.htm|access-date=2012-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021023520/http://www.horizonfuelcell.com/store_other/hydrofillpro.htm|archive-date=2012-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HyLYZER™ PEM Electrolyser |url=https://www.hydrogenics.com/hydro/hystat_p |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013105142/http://www.hydrogenics.com/hydro/hystat_p |archivedate=2012-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITM power products page|url=http://www.itm-power.com/products/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas Extraction===

Due to their use of water, a readily available resource, electrolysis and similar water-splitting methods have attracted the interest of the scientific community. With the objective of reducing the cost of hydrogen production, renewable sources of energy have been targeted to allow electrolysis.&lt;ref name="Hordeski"/&gt;
There are three main types of cells, [[Solid oxide electrolyser cell|solid oxide electrolysis cells]] (SOECs), [[Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis|polymer electrolyte membrane cells]] (PEM) and alkaline electrolysis cells (AECs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.S.|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Munnings|first3=Christopher|title=Hydrogen production via solid electrolytic routes|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment|volume=2|issue=5|pages=473–487|doi=10.1002/wene.50}}&lt;/ref&gt; SOECs operate at high temperatures, typically around 800&amp;nbsp;°C. At these high temperatures a significant amount of the energy required can be provided as thermal energy (heat), and as such is termed [[High temperature electrolysis]]. The heat energy can be provided from a number of different sources, including waste industrial heat, nuclear power stations or concentrated solar thermal plants. This has the potential to reduce the overall cost of the hydrogen produced by reducing the amount of electrical energy required for electrolysis.&lt;ref name="Ogden 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/b718822f |title=Highly efficient high temperature electrolysis |year=2008 |last1=Hauch |first1=Anne |last2=Ebbesen |first2=Sune Dalgaard |last3=Jensen |first3=Søren Højgaard |last4=Mogensen |first4=Mogens |journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry |volume=18 |issue=20 |pages=2331–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the laboratory, water electrolysis can be done with a simple apparatus like a [[Hofmann voltameter]]:{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalphysics.org/go/Experiment_677.html |title=Electrolysis of water and the concept of charge |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613112114/http://practicalphysics.org/go/Experiment_677.html |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Nuclear power plants can produce hydrogen to fuel the 'hydrogen economy' |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |date=March 25, 2012 |url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/PublicWebSite/pressroom/newsreleases/CNBP_029640 |accessdate=March 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM electrolysis cells typically operate below 100&amp;nbsp;°C and are becoming increasingly available commercially.&lt;ref name="Ogden 1999"/&gt; These cells have the advantage of being comparatively simple and can be designed to accept widely varying voltage inputs which makes them ideal for use with renewable sources of energy such as solar PV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.053 |title=Direct coupling of an electrolyser to a solar PV system for generating hydrogen |year=2009 |last1=Clarke |first1=R.E. |last2=Giddey |first2=S. |last3=Ciacchi |first3=F.T. |last4=Badwal |first4=S.P.S. |last5=Paul |first5=B. |last6=Andrews |first6=J. |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=2531–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; AECs optimally operate at high concentrations electrolyte (KOH or potassium carbonate) and at high temperatures, often near 200&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Industrial output and efficiency====
Efficiency of modern hydrogen generators is measured by ''energy consumed per standard volume of hydrogen'' (MJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), assuming [[standard temperature and pressure]] of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The lower the energy used by a generator, the higher would be its efficiency; a 100%-efficient electrolyser would consume {{convert|39.4|kWh/kg|MJ/kg|0}} of [[hydrogen]],&lt;ref name=EU140207&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fch-ju.eu/sites/default/files/study%20electrolyser_0-Logos_0_0.pdf |title= Development of water electrolysis in the European Union |author= Luca Bertuccioli |work= Client Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking |date= 7 February 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|{{#expr:141840*0.08988round0}}|J/L|MJ/m3|2}}. &lt;!-- H2 density is 0.08988 g/L --&gt; Practical electrolysis (using a rotating electrolyser at 15 bar pressure) may consume {{convert|50|kWh/kg|MJ/kg|0}}, and a further {{convert|15|kWh|MJ|0}} if the hydrogen is compressed for use in hydrogen cars.&lt;ref&gt;Stensvold, Tore (26 January 2016).

Electrolyser vendors provide efficiencies based on [[enthalpy]].  To assess the claimed efficiency of an electrolyser it is important to establish how it was defined by the vendor (i.e. what enthalpy value, what current density, etc.).

There are two main technologies available on the market, ''alkaline'' and ''[[proton exchange membrane]]'' (PEM) electrolysers.
Traditionally, alkaline electrolysers are cheaper in terms of investment (they generally use nickel catalysts), but less efficient; PEM electrolysers, conversely, are more expensive (they generally use expensive platinum-group metal catalysts) but are more efficient and can operate at higher current densities, and can therefore be possibly cheaper if the hydrogen production is large enough.

Conventional alkaline electrolysis has an efficiency of about 70%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stolten|first1=Detlef|title=Hydrogen Science and Engineering: Materials, Processes, Systems and Technology|date=Jan 4, 2016|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9783527674299 |page=898|url=https://books.google.hu/books?id=we5bCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however thyssenkrupp have recently developed an advanced alkaline water electrolyser with an efficiency of 82%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=thyssenkrupp |title=Hydrogen from water electrolysis - solutions for sustainability |url=https://www.thyssenkrupp-uhde-chlorine-engineers.com/en/products/water-electrolysis/ |website=https://www.thyssenkrupp-uhde-chlorine-engineers.com |accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

At an electricity cost of $0.06/kWh, as set out in the Department of Energy hydrogen production 
targets for 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DOE Technical Targets for Hydrogen Production from Electrolysis|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/doe-technical-targets-hydrogen-production-electrolysis|website=www.energy.gov|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hydrogen cost is $3/kg. With the range of natural gas prices from 2016 as shown in the graph ([https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/11/f46/HPTT%20Roadmap%20FY17%20Final_Nov%202017.pdf Hydrogen Production Tech Team Roadmap, November 2017]) putting the cost of SMR hydrogen at between $1.20 and $1.50, the cost price of hydrogen via electrolysis is still over double 2015 DOE hydrogen target prices.

This puts the $4/gge H2 dispensed objective well within reach, and close to a slightly elevated natural gas production cost for SMR.

In many cases, the advantage of electrolysis over SMR hydrogen is that the hydrogen can be produced on-site, meaning that the costly process of delivery via truck or pipeline is avoided.

In other parts of the world, steam methane reforming is between $1-3/kg on average. This makes production of hydrogen via electrolysis cost competitive in many regions already, as outlined by Nel Hydrogen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wide Spread Adaption of Competitive Hydrogen Solution|url=http://nelhydrogen.com/assets/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-02-FC-EXPO-Nel_FINAL.pdf|website=nelhydrogen.com|publisher=Nel ASA|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, including an article by the IEA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Philibert|first1=Cédric|title=Commentary: Producing industrial hydrogen from renewable energy|url=https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2017/april/producing-industrial-hydrogen-from-renewable-energy.html|website=www.iea.org|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; examining the conditions which could lead to a competitive advantage for electrolysis.

===Chemically assisted electrolysis (Organic solution assisted water electrolysis)===
In addition to reducing the voltage required for electrolysis via the increasing of the temperature of the electrolysis cell it is also possible to electrochemically consume the oxygen produced in an electrolyser by introducing a fuel (such as carbon/coal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2014.11.033 |title=Low emission hydrogen generation through carbon assisted electrolysis |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=70–4 |year=2015 |last1=Giddey |first1=S |last2=Kulkarni |first2=A |last3=Badwal |first3=S.P.S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[methanol]],&lt;ref name="Uhm et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.09.083 |title=Clean hydrogen production from methanol–water solutions via power-saved electrolytic reforming process |journal=Journal of Power Sources |volume=198 |pages=218–22 |year=2012 |last1=Uhm |first1=Sunghyun |last2=Jeon |first2=Hongrae |last3=Kim |first3=Tae Jin |last4=Lee |first4=Jaeyoung }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ju et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2017.01.106 |title=The role of nanosized SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Pt-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen production in methanol assisted water electrolysis |journal=Electrochimica Acta |volume=229 |pages=39–47 |year=2017 |last1=Ju |first1=Hyungkuk |last2=Giddey |first2=Sarbjit |last3=Badwal |first3=Sukhvinder P.S }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethanol]],&lt;ref name="Ju et al 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2016.07.062 |title=Electro-catalytic conversion of ethanol in solid electrolyte cells for distributed hydrogen generation |journal=Electrochimica Acta |volume=212 |pages=744–57 |year=2016 |last1=Ju |first1=Hyungkuk |last2=Giddey |first2=Sarbjit |last3=Badwal |first3=Sukhvinder P.S |last4=Mulder |first4=Roger J }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[formic acid]],&lt;ref name="Lamy et al 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.electacta.2011.11.006 |title=Clean hydrogen generation through the electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid in a Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell (PEMEC) |journal=Electrochimica Acta |volume=60 |pages=112–20 |year=2012 |last1=Lamy |first1=Claude |last2=Devadas |first2=Abirami |last3=Simoes |first3=Mario |last4=Coutanceau |first4=Christophe }}&lt;/ref&gt;  glycerol,&lt;ref name="Lamy et al 2012"/&gt; etc.) into the oxygen side of the reactor.

===Thermolysis===
Water spontaneously dissociates at around 2500&amp;nbsp;°C, but this [[thermolysis]] occurs at temperatures too high for usual process piping and equipment. Catalysts are required to reduce the dissociation temperature.

===Thermochemical cycle===
{{Main article|thermochemical cycle}}
[[Thermochemical cycle]]s combine solely heat sources (''thermo'') with ''chemical'' reactions to split [[water]] into its [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] components.&lt;ref&gt;[https://inlportal.inl.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_816_259_0_43/http%3B/exps3.inl.gov%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/communities/inl_gov/about_inl/home_page_fact_sheets/sheets/producing_hydrogen__the_thermochemical_cycles_4.pdf Producing hydrogen: The Thermochemical cycles]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''cycle'' is used because aside from water, hydrogen and oxygen, the chemical compounds used in these processes are continuously recycled. If electricity is partially used as an input, the resulting thermochemical cycle is defined as a [[wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] one.

The [[sulfur-iodine cycle]] (S-I cycle) is a thermochemical cycle processes which generates hydrogen from water with an efficiency of approximately 50%.  The sulfur and iodine used in the process are recovered and reused, and not consumed by the process.  The cycle can be performed with any source of very high temperatures, approximately 950&amp;nbsp;°C, such as by [[Concentrating solar power]] systems (CSP) and is regarded as being well suited to the production of hydrogen by [[Very high temperature reactor|high-temperature nuclear reactors]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea.org/techno/essentials5.pdf IEA Energy Technology Essentials - Hydrogen Production &amp; Distribution], April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and as such, is being studied in the [[High-temperature engineering test reactor|High Temperature Test Reactor]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://httr.jaea.go.jp/eng/index.html |title=HTTR High Temperature engineering Test Reactor |publisher=Httr.jaea.go.jp |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://smr.inl.gov/Document.ashx?path=DOCS%2FGCR-Int%2FNHDDELDER.pdf.

===Ferrosilicon method===
Ferrosilicon is used by the military to quickly produce [[hydrogen]] for [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]]. The chemical reaction uses [[sodium hydroxide]], [[ferrosilicon]], and water. The generator is small enough to fit a truck and requires only a small amount of electric power, the materials are stable and not combustible, and they do not generate hydrogen until mixed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091069_1993091069.pdf Report No 40: The ferrosilicon process for the generation of hydrogen]&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been in use since [[World War I]].  A heavy steel [[pressure vessel]] is filled with sodium hydroxide and ferrosilicon, closed, and a controlled amount of water is added; the dissolving of the hydroxide heats the mixture to about 93&amp;nbsp;°C and starts the reaction; [[sodium silicate]], hydrogen and steam are produced.&lt;!--  After the cylinder cools and the steam condenses, hydrogen is drained and the glassy sodium silicate is scraped from the cylinder; the cleaning is a laborious operation, taking a soldier an entire day.  The silicate scrapings have to be buried, but the tired soldiers often resorted to just dumping them on the ground; [[cattle]] then ate them and the army was getting lawsuits because of the damaged cattle. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The steel cylinders were also difficult to transport.

===Photocatalytic water splitting===
{{Main article|Photocatalytic water splitting}}
The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by means of water splitting process is one of the most interesting ways to achieve clean and renewable energy systems. However, if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using photovoltaic and an electrolytic system the reaction is in just one step, it can be made more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cssc.200900018 |title=Water Splitting on Semiconductor Catalysts under Visible-Light Irradiation |year=2009 |last1=Navarro Yerga |first1=Rufino M. |last2=Álvarez Galván |first2=M.

=== Biohydrogen routes ===

[[Biomass]] and waste streams can in principle be converted into [[biohydrogen]] with biomass [[gasification]], steam reforming, or biological conversion like biocatalysed electrolysis&lt;ref name="Sukhvinder P. S 2014"/&gt; or fermentative hydrogen production.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Among hydrogen production methods such as steam methane reforming, thermal cracking, coal and biomass gasification and pyrolysis, electrolysis, and photolysis, biological ones are more eco-friendly and less energy intensive. In addition, a wide variety of waste and low-value materials such as agricultural biomass as renewable sources can be utilized to produce hydrogen via biochemical pathways. Nevertheless, at present hydrogen is produced mainly from fossil fuels, in particular, natural gas which are non-renewable sources. Hydrogen is not only the cleanest fuel but also widely used in a number of industries, especially fertilizer, petrochemical and food ones. This makes it logical to investigate alternative sources for hydrogen production. The main biochemical technologies to produce hydrogen are dark and photo fermentation processes. In dark fermentation, carbohydrates are converted to hydrogen by fermentative microorganisms including strict anaerobe and facultative anaerobe bacteria. A theoretical maximum of 4&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose can be produced and, besides hydrogen, sugars are converted to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and alcohols as by-products during this process. Photo fermentative bacteria are able to generate hydrogen from VFAs. Hence, metabolites formed in dark fermentation can be used as feedstock in photo fermentation to enhance the overall yield of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen Step"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Karimi Alavijeh|first2=Masih|last3=Zilouei|first3=Hamid|title=Development of a mathematical methodology to investigate biohydrogen production from regional and national agricultural crop residues: A case study of Iran|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.021|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309382052_Development_of_a_mathematical_methodology_to_investigate_biohydrogen_production_from_regional_and_national_agricultural_crop_residues_A_case_study_of_Iran|volume=42|pages=1989–2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fermentative hydrogen production ====
{{Main article|fermentative hydrogen production|dark fermentation}}

[[Fermentative hydrogen production]] is the fermentative conversion of organic substrate to [[biohydrogen]] manifested by a diverse group of [[bacteria]] using multi [[enzyme]] systems involving three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. [[Dark fermentation]] reactions do not require light energy, so they are capable of constantly producing [[hydrogen]] from organic compounds throughout the day and night. [[Photofermentation]] differs from [[dark fermentation]] because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]]. For example, photo-fermentation with [[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]] SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2006.06.034 |title=High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark- and photo-fermentation of sucrose |year=2007 |last1=Tao |first1=Y |last2=Chen |first2=Y |last3=Wu |first3=Y |last4=He |first4=Y |last5=Zhou |first5=Z |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=200–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermentative hydrogen production can be done using direct biophotolysis by green algae, indirect biophotolysis by cyanobacteria, photo-fermentation by anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria and dark fermentation by anaerobic fermentative bacteria. For example, studies on hydrogen production using ''H. salinarium'', an anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria, coupled to a hydrogenase donor like ''E. coli'',  are reported in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brijesh |last1=Rajanandam |first2=Siva |last2=Kiran |year=2011 |title=Optimization of hydrogen production by ''Halobacterium salinarium'' coupled with ''E coli'' using milk plasma as fermentative substrate |journal=Journal of Biochemical Technology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=242–4 |url=http://www.jbiochemtech.com/index.php/jbt/article/viewArticle/JBT321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterobacter aerogenes'' is an outstanding hydrogen producer. It is an anaerobic facultative and mesophilic bacterium that is able to consume different sugars and in contrast to cultivation of strict anaerobes, no special operation is required to remove all oxygen from the fermenter. ''E. aerogenes'' has a short doubling time and high hydrogen productivity and evolution rate. Furthermore, hydrogen production by this bacterium is not inhibited at high hydrogen partial pressures; however, its yield is lower compared to strict anaerobes like ''Clostridia''. A theoretical maximum of 4&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose can be produced by strict anaerobic bacteria. Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as ''E. aerogenes'' have a theoretical maximum yield of 2&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biohydrogen can be produced in bioreactors that utilize feedstocks, the most common feedstock being waste streams. The process involves bacteria feeding on hydrocarbons and exhaling hydrogen and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be sequestered successfully by several methods, leaving hydrogen gas.  In 2006-2007, NanoLogix first demonstrated a prototype hydrogen bioreactor using waste as a feedstock at Welch's grape juice factory in Pennsylvania (U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NanoLogix generates energy on-site with bioreactor-produced hydrogen|url=http://electroiq.com/blog/2007/09/nanologix-generates-energy-on-site-with-bioreactor-produced-hydrogen/|website=Solid State Technology|accessdate=14 May 2018|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enzymatic hydrogen generation ====

Due to the Thauer limit (four H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/glucose) for dark fermentation, a non-natural enzymatic pathway was designed that can generate 12 moles of hydrogen per mole of glucose units of polysaccharides and water in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000456 |title=High-Yield Hydrogen Production from Starch and Water by a Synthetic Enzymatic Pathway |year=2007 |editor1-last=Melis |editor1-first=Anastasios |last1=Percival Zhang |first1=Y.-H. |last2=Evans |first2=Barbara R. |last3=Mielenz |first3=Jonathan R. |last4=Hopkins |first4=Robert C. |last5=Adams |first5=Michael W.W. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e456 |pmid=17520015 |pmc=1866174|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..456Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stoichiometric reaction is:

Besides dark fermentation, [[electrohydrogenesis]] (electrolysis using microbes) is another possibility. Using [[microbial fuel cell]]s, wastewater or plants can be used to generate power. Biocatalysed electrolysis should not be confused with [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|biological hydrogen production]], as the latter only uses algae and with the latter, the algae itself generates the hydrogen instantly, where with biocatalysed electrolysis, this happens after running through the microbial fuel cell and a variety of aquatic plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/er.1397 |laysummary=http://www.glastuinbouw.wur.nl/UK/expertise/energy/innovations/plantenergy/ |laysource=[[Wageningen University and Research Centre]] |title=Green electricity production with living plants and bacteria in a fuel cell |year=2008 |last1=Strik |first1=David P.

In 2014 a low-temperature {{convert|50|C|F}}, atmospheric-pressure [[enzyme]]-driven process to convert xylose into hydrogen with nearly 100% of the theoretical yield was announced.

==Carbon-neutral hydrogen==
Currently there are two practical ways of producing hydrogen in a renewable industrial process. One is to use [[power to gas]], in which electric power is used to produce hydrogen from electrolysis, and the other is to use [[landfill gas]] to produce hydrogen in a steam reformer. Hydrogen fuel, when produced by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar power, is a [[Renewable fuels#Hydrogen fuel|renewable fuel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36178.pdf#page=4 |publisher=[[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] |journal=Research Review |title=New Horizons for Hydrogen |date=April 2004 |issue=2 |pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Use of hydrogen==
Hydrogen is mainly used for the conversion of heavy petroleum fractions into lighter ones via the process of [[hydrocracking]] and other processes ([[dehydrocyclization]] and the [[aromatization process]]).  It is also required for cleaning fossil fuels via [[hydrodesulfurization]].

[[Hydrogen]] is mainly used for the production of [[ammonia]] via [[Haber process]].  In this case, the hydrogen is produced ''in situ''.  Ammonia is the major component of most [[fertilizer]]s.

Earlier it was common to vent the surplus [[hydrogen]] off, nowadays the process systems are balanced with [[hydrogen pinch]] to collect [[hydrogen]] for further use.

[[Hydrogen]] may be used in [[fuel cells]] for local electricity generation, making it possible for hydrogen to be used as a transportation fuel for an [[electric vehicle]].

[[Hydrogen]] is also produced as a [[by-product]] of [[Chlorine#Industrial production|industrial chlorine production by electrolysis]]. Although requiring expensive technologies, hydrogen can be cooled, compressed and purified for use in other processes on site or sold to a customer via pipeline, cylinders or trucks. The discovery and development of less expensive methods of production of bulk hydrogen is relevant to the establishment of a [[hydrogen economy]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1002/14356007.a13_297.pub2 |chapter=Hydrogen, 1.

[[File:Diagram induction regulator.svg|thumb|Diagram of electrical [[phasor]]s for an induction regulator]]
An '''induction regulator''' is an [[alternating current]] electrical machine, somewhat similar to an [[induction motor]], which can provide a continuously variable output [[voltage]]. The induction regulator was an early device used to control the voltage of electric networks. Since the 1930s it has been replaced in distribution network applications by the [[Tap (transformer)|tap]] [[transformer]].  Its usage is now mostly confined to electrical laboratories, electrochemical processes and [[arc welding]]. With minor variations, its setup can be used as a [[Quadrature booster|phase-shifting power transformer]].

==Construction==
A single-phase induction regulator has a (primary) excitation winding, connected to the supply voltage, wound on a magnetic core which can be rotated.  The stationary secondary winding is connected in series with the circuit to be regulated. As the excitation winding is rotated through 180 degrees, the voltage induced in the series winding changes from adding to the supply voltage to opposing it. By selection of the ratios of the number of turns on the excitation and series windings, the range of voltage can be adjusted, say, plus or minus 20% of the supply voltage, for example.

The [[three phase]] induction regulator can be regarded as a wound [[induction motor]]. The rotor is not allowed to turn freely and it can be mechanically shifted by means of a [[worm gear]]. The rest of the regulator's construction follows that of a wound rotor [[induction motor]] with a slotted three-phase stator and a wound three-phase rotor. Since the rotor is not allowed to turn more than 180 degrees, mechanically, the rotor leads can be connected by flexible cables to the exterior circuit. If the stator winding is a two-pole winding, moving the rotor through 180 degrees physically will change the phase of the induced voltage by 180 degrees. A four-pole winding only requires 90 degrees of physical movement to produce 180 degrees of phase shift.

Since a torque is produced by the interaction of the magnetic fields, the movable element is held by a mechanism such as a [[worm gear]]. The rotor may be rotated by a hand wheel attached to the machine, or an electric motor can be used to remotely or automatically adjust the rotor position.

Depending on the application, the ratio of number of turns on the rotor and the stator can vary.

==Working==
Since the single phase regulator only changes the flux linking the excitation and series windings, it does not introduce a phase shift between the supply voltage and the load voltage. However, the varying position of the movable element in the three-phase regulator does create a phase shift.  This may be a concern if the load circuit may be connected to more than one supply, since circulating currents will flow owing to the phase shift.

If the rotor terminals are connected to a [[three-phase electric power]] network, a [[rotating magnetic field]] will be driven into the [[magnetic core]]. 
The resulting flux will produce an [[electromotive force|emf]] on the windings of the stator with the particularity that if rotor and stator are physically shifted by an angle α, then the electric phase shifting of both windings is α too. Considering just the fundamental harmonic, and ignoring the shifting, the following equation rules:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U_{stator}}{U_{rotor}}=\frac{\xi_{stator} N_{stator}}{\xi_{rotor} N_{rotor}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ξ is the [[winding factor]], a constant related to the construction of the windings.

If the stator winding is connected to the primary phase, the total voltage seen from the neutral (N) will be the sum of the voltages at both windings rotor and stator. Translating this to electric [[phasor]]s, both phasors are connected. However, there is an angular shifting of α between them. Since α can be freely chosen between [0, π], both phasors can be added or subtracted, so all the values in between are attainable. The primary and secondary are not isolated. Also, the ratio of the magnitudes of voltages between rotor and stator is constant; the resultant voltage varies owing to the angular shifting of the series winding induced voltage.

==Advantages==
The output voltage can be continuously regulated within the nominal range. This is a clear benefit against tap transformers where output voltage takes discrete values. Also, the voltage can be easily regulated under working conditions.

==Drawbacks==
In comparison to tap transformers, induction regulators are expensive, with lower efficiency, high open circuit currents (due to the airgap) and limited in voltage to less than 20kV.

==Applications==
An induction regulator for power networks is usually designed to have a nominal voltage of 14kV and ±(10-15)% of regulation, but this use has declined.  Nowadays, its main uses are in electrical laboratories and [[arc welding]].

The '''January 1886 blizzard''' was caused by a strong [[extratropical cyclone]] which initially dropped southeast across Texas before strengthening while it moved through the South and East, near the Eastern Seaboard through New England.  The cyclone was at its strongest as it moved by New Jersey.  This system formed within an active pattern which brought significant snow to the southern Rockies over many days.  The system brought high winds and snowfall near and west of its path, resulting in blizzard conditions across portions of the Plains and East.  A significant cold spell was ushered in by this system across portions of the southern and eastern United States.  A slightly stronger [[January 1913 Atlantic coast storm|storm on January 3, 1913]] would break January low sea level pressure records originally set by this storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/JanuaryWhenRecordLowSLPswhite.gif|title=Occurrence of January Record Low SLPs|date=2015|accessdate=2015-02-21|author=David M.

Roth|publisher=[[Weather Prediction Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological evolution==
A cold wave was ongoing across the northern Plains when this low developed, with temperatures close to {{convert|-50|F|C}} near the central [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]].  A surface low developed north of Texas on January 6,&lt;ref name="win"/&gt; dropping southeast to the lower Texas coast early on January 7.  The cyclone tracked inland of the coast through the Deep South later on January 7 and early January 8, before turning northeast through Georgia and emerging offshore the Virginia Capes late on January 8.  The system reached its maximum intensity as it moved near New Jersey late on January 8.&lt;ref name="MWR"/&gt;

The lowest pressure measured on land was {{convert|28.69|inHg|hPa}} at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and [[Blue Hill Observatory]] in Massachusetts; the cyclone was considered one of the most extreme to pass through New England at the time.  The storm's center then moved inland across Long Island by 11 a.m. on January 9, then across Rhode Island by 1 p.m. and Boston by 2 p.m. before turning northward through Maine around 10 p.m.  Temperature readings quickly fell 10-15F (6-9 C) after the passage of the cyclone.  High-level [[cirrus cloud]]s led the center of circulation by 24&amp;nbsp;hours, with snow occurring 12&amp;nbsp;hours after the cirrus invasion.&lt;ref name="win"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The American Meteorological Journal|volume=III|date=December 1886|number=8|pages=367–382|author=Winslow Upton|title=An Investigation of Cyclonic Phenomena in New England: The Cyclone Of January 9, 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; While weakening, the storm moved through southeast Quebec on January 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/014/mwr-014-01-c1.pdf|title=Chart I.

==Wind and related damage near the coast==
Fort Macon, North Carolina registered winds up to {{convert|62|mph|km/h}} from the southwest on January 8.  The high winds led to the wreck of the ''Cressie Wright'', with six of the seven aboard perishing.  Norfolk, Virginia reported high winds which caused damage.  High water and wave action from the Atlantic greatly damaged the New Jersey Southern Railroad track in Sandy Hook, New Jersey on January 9.  The gale in New York City blew away the anemometer cups at the local weather observing site, and led to numerous maritime mishaps.  A blizzard was caused by the high winds and heavy snow at New London, Connecticut.  A schooner sank with all aboard offshore [[Charles Island]].

The schooner ''Alan Greene'' beached near Port Judith, Rhode Island, while the ''Mattie D.'' went ashore near Newport, Rhode Island.  This storm reopened an inlet at [[Martha's Vineyard]] first opened by a storm in 1856.  The inlet would reclose between 1902 and 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Martha's Vineyard Magazine |url=http://www.mvmagazine.com/article.php?29657 |title=A Record of Openings and Closings |author=Tom Dunlop |date=May 2011 |publisher=Vineyard Gazette, Inc. |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221183111/http://www.mvmagazine.com/article.php?29657 |archivedate=2015-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Provincetown, Massachusetts experienced their worst gale in a decade,&lt;ref name="MWR"/&gt; with winds peaking at an estimated {{convert|68|mph|km/h}}.  Blue Hill Observatory, Massachusetts saw winds peak at {{convert|65|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="win"/&gt;  Boston, Massachusetts measured winds as high as {{convert|64|mph|km/h}} and heavy snow.  Seven lives were lost in Boston Harbor while 40&amp;nbsp;vessels went ashore in New England.  Eastport, Maine experienced a $20,000 (1886 USD) loss during the storm.  Snow and sleet fell at that station, and 19&amp;nbsp;schooners were damanged, with five sinking in the rough seas.&lt;ref name="MWR"/&gt;

As the initial low pressure system formed, a cold front swept through the Plains, stirring up snow which had fallen from a previous blizzard.  Although a minimal amount of new snow fell, blizzard conditions resumed in Colorado, Kansas, and Nebraska late on January 6 due to increasing winds.  Telegraph wires were downed over a large area, with the rails of the Santa Fe, Burlington, Union, and Kansas Pacific railroads recovered with snow, resuspending travel.  Cattle across the region were driven southward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DAC18860109.2.45.1#|title=The Blizzard: Trains Stopped and Cattle Driven Before the Blasts|newspaper=Daily Alta California|volume=40|number=13084}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Across the [[Texas Panhandle]], at least five died due to exposure on January 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GA306Jt6bQ8C&amp;pg=PA216|page=216|title=Texas Disasters: True Stories of Tragedy and Survival|author=Mike Cox|publisher=Globe Pequot|date=2006|isbn=0762736755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other locations across the Midwest received blizzard condition's along the inverted trough to the north and northwest of the main low pressure area.  On January 7 and 8, this system's associated blizzard led to the largest loss of life from a blizzard in Iowa's history, with 20 perishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Annals of Iowa|volume=40|number=3|date=Winter 1970|title=Outstanding Iowa Storms|author=Paul J.

In Jasper, Alabama, a mix of rain, sleet, and snow fell on January 8 and 9.&lt;ref name="Jasper"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIeTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|page=42|title=People and Things from the Walker County, Alabama Jasper Mountain Eagle (1884 - 1897)|author=Robin Sterling|publisher=Lulu.com|date=2013|isbn=1304126099}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Savannah, Georgia, reported a light snowfall for the first time in six years.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;  On January 8, a site within Wilkes County, North Carolina recorded {{convert|8|in|cm}} of snowfall.&lt;ref name="Wilkes"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Wilkes Journal-Patriot|title=Articles describe extreme cold in Wilkes in late 1890s|date=2014-02-28|author=Jule Hubbard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The South Mountains near [[Staunton, Virginia]] reported {{convert|14|in|cm}} of snow, with {{convert|6|in|cm}} measured in Staunton proper.

A separate maximum of over {{convert|10|in|cm}} was noted across central Vermont.  A 7:1 snow to liquid ratio (or 7&amp;nbsp;cm/in of snow for every 1&amp;nbsp;cm/in of rain) was determined from an average of the available snowfall and liquid equivalent measurements made at the time.&lt;ref name="win"/&gt;  [[Montreal]] experienced blizzard conditions with heavy snow and wind on January 9.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;

==Cold wave in its wake==
A significant chunk of arctic air from the north filtered down into the South in the wake of this system.  [[Corpus Christi, Texas]] saw its temperature plunge 64 F° (38 C°) within 12&amp;nbsp;hours.  [[Palestine, Texas]] fell to {{convert|0|F|C}}, its coldest temperature in 40&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;  [[Nashville, Tennessee]] recorded five consecutive days with lows below {{convert|0|F|C}} between January 8 and January 12, with a minimum of {{convert|-9|F|C}} on January 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/ohx/?n=calendar |title=Calendar of Significant Weather Events in Middle Tennessee|author=[[National Weather Service]] Forecast Office Nashville Tennessee|date=2014-09-02|accessdate=2015-02-21|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] fell to {{convert|-5|F|C}} on January 9, their coldest reading on record at the time.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;  On January 11, the temperature at [[Jasper, Alabama]] fell to {{convert|0|F|C}}.&lt;ref name="Jasper"/&gt;  Portions of North Carolina saw temperatures fall well below {{convert|0|F|C}} from January 11 through 14, with readings as low at {{convert|-18|F|C}} in [[Wilkes County, North Carolina]] on January 12.&lt;ref name="Wilkes"/&gt;

US nuclear weapons of '''all types''' – bombs, warheads, shells, and others – are numbered in the same sequence starting with the Mark 1 and ({{As of|2006|alt=as of March 2006}}) ending with the W-91 (which was canceled prior to introduction into service). All designs which were formally intended to be weapons at some point received a number designation. Pure test units which were experiments (and not intended to be weapons) are not numbered in this sequence.

Early weapons were very large and could only be used as free fall bombs. These were known by "Mark" designators, like the Mark 4 which was a development of the Fat Man weapon. As weapons became more sophisticated they also became much smaller and lighter, allowing them to be used in many roles. At this time the weapons began to receive designations based on their role; bombs were given the prefix "B", while the same warhead used in other roles, like missiles, would normally be prefixed "W". For instance, the [[W-53 warhead]] was also used as the basis for the [[B53 nuclear bomb]]. Such examples share the same sequence number.

In other cases, when the modifications are more significant, variants are assigned their own number. An example is the [[B61 nuclear bomb]], which was the parent design for the [[W80 (nuclear warhead)|W80]], [[W81]], and [[W84]]. There are also examples of out-of-sequence numbering and other prefixes used in special occasions.

This list includes weapons which were developed to the point of being assigned a model number (and in many cases, prototypes were test fired), but which were then canceled prior to introduction into military service. Those models are listed as canceled, along with the year or date of cancellation of their program.

* Bombs – designated with Mark ("Mk") numbers until 1968, and with "B" numbers after that. "Test Experimental" bombs designated with "TX".

==India==
{{Main|India and weapons of mass destruction}}
India is believed to possess between 150-200 nuclear weapons (March 2010 estimate).

==Israel==
{{Main|Israel and weapons of mass destruction}}
Israel is widely believed to possess a substantial arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles, estimated at 75-130 and 100-200&lt;ref&gt;Normark, Magnus, Anders Lindblad, Anders Norqvist, Björn Sandström and Louise Waldenström. "Israel and WMD: Incentives and Capabilities." Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI-R--1734--SE December 2005 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foi.se/FOI/templates/Page____4657.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707104517/http://www.foi.se/FOI/templates/Page____4657.aspx |archivedate=2007-07-07 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; warheads, but refuses officially to confirm or deny whether it has a nuclear weapon program, leaving the details of any such weapons unclear. [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a former nuclear technician for Israel, confirmed the existence of a nuclear weapons program in 1986.

Unconfirmed rumors have hinted at tactical nuclear artillery shells, light fission bombs and missile warheads, and perhaps thermonuclear missile warheads.&lt;ref&gt;''The Samson option: Israel's nuclear arsenal and American foreign policy'', Hersh, Seymour M., New York, Random House, 1991, {{ISBN|0-394-57006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article continues to state that this is the second confirmation of Israel's nuclear capability by a U.S. spokesman following comments from U.S. Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] at a Senate hearing and had apparently been confirmed a short time later by Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7420573.stm "Israel 'has 150 nuclear weapons'", ''BBC News Online''] May 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan==
{{Main|Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction}}
As of March 2010, Pakistan is believed to possess between 90-120 nuclear weapons. The specifications of its weapon production are not disclosed to the public.
The main series for nuclear transportation is Hatf.

==North Korea==
{{Main|North Korea and weapons of mass destruction}}
North Korea claims to possess nuclear weapons, however, the specifications of its systems are not public. It is estimated to have 6-18 low yield nuclear weapons (August 2012 estimate).&lt;ref name="NK2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9487574/North-Korea-could-have-fuel-for-48-nuclear-weapons-by-2015.html|title=North Korea could have fuel for 48 nuclear weapons by 2015|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 August 2012|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October 2006, [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|North Korea achieved its first nuclear detonation]].

On 25 May 2009, North Korea conducted a second test of nuclear weapons at the same location as the original test. The test weapon was of the same magnitude as the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in the 2nd World War. At the same time of the test, North Korea tested two short range ballistic missiles.  The country tested a 7&amp;nbsp;kt nuclear weapon on 2 February 2013. On 3 September 2017, North Korea conducted an underground thermonuclear test which had an estimated yield of 100kt to 250kt, according to various sources.

==South Africa==
{{Main|South Africa and weapons of mass destruction}}
South Africa built six or seven gun-type weapons.  All constructed weapons were verified by [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and other international observers to have been dismantled, along with the complete weapons program, and their highly enriched uranium was reprocessed back into low enriched form unsuitable for weapons.

The '''Manas River''' (Pron: ˈmʌnəs; in Bhutan '''Drangme Chhu'''; in China '''Niamjang'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.maps.vlasenko.net/smtm200/g-46-02.jpg Topomap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501182710/http://download.maps.vlasenko.net/smtm200/g-46-02.jpg |date=2013-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a transboundary river in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills between southern [[Bhutan]] and [[India]].
It is named after [[Manasa]], the serpent god in [[Hindu mythology]]. It is the largest river system of Bhutan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/L8853E/L8853E02.htm|title=Physiological survey|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; among its four major river systems; the other three are Amo Chu or [[Torsa river]], Wong Chu or [[Raidak]], Mo Chu or [[Sankosh]]. It is met by three other major streams before it again debouches into India in western [[Assam]]. The total length of the river is {{convert|376|km|mi}}, flows through Bhutan for {{convert|272|km|mi}} and then through Assam for {{convert|104|km|mi}} before it joins the mighty [[Brahmaputra River]] at [[Jogighopa]]. Another major tributary of the Manas, the [[Aie river]] joins it in Assam at Bangpari.&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/003/L8853E/L8853E02.htm|title= Physiological Survey|accessdate=2010-03-07|publisher=FAO Corporate Document Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBA&gt;{{Cite book|title=Report Volume I: Rashtriya Barh Ayog (National Commission On Floods)|year=1973|publisher=Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river valley has two major reserve forest areas, namely the [[Royal Manas National Park]] ({{convert|43854|ha|acre}}, established in 1966) in Bhutan and the contiguous [[Manas Wildlife Sanctuary]] ({{convert|391000|ha|acre}} in 1955 increased to {{convert|95000|ha|acre}} in December 1985) encompassing [[Project Tiger]] reserve, an elephant teserve and a biosphere reserve, which constitutes a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] declared in December 1985.&lt;ref name=Bhutan&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/bhutan/projects/index.cfm?uProjectID=BT0010 |title=Royal Manas National Park, Bhutan |publisher=WWF Global |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107044212/http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/bhutan/projects/index.cfm?uProjectID=BT0010 |archivedate=2009-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramsar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ramsar.wetlands.org/Portals/15/Bhutan.pdf |title=Bhutan |accessdate=2010-03-07 |publisher=Ramsar.

==Geography==
The Manas River drains {{convert|41350|km2|mi2}} of eastern Bhutan and northeast India. It has three major branches: the [[Drangme Chhu]], [[Mangde Chhu]], and [[Bumthang Chhu]] that cover most of eastern Bhutan, with the [[Tongsa valley|Tongsa]] and [[Bumthang valley|Bumthang]] valleys also forming part of its catchment. The area drained in Bhutan territory is 18,300&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is bound by the geographical coordinates {{coord|26.217|N|90.633|E}}.&lt;ref name=Manas&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tageo.com/index-e-bt-v-00-d-m3206481.htm?Manas+river|title= Manas river|accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drangme&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/bhutan/16.htm|title= River Systems|accessdate=2010-03-06|publisher=US  Liba raray of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the main stem of the river rises in the southern Tibet before entering into India at Bumla pass at the northwestern corner of Arunachal Pradesh.&lt;ref name=Negi&gt;{{Cite book|last=Negi|first= Sharad Singh|title= Himalayan rivers, lakes, and glaciers|pages=97–99|accessdate=2010-04-04|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YtUShKY8zcC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=Manas++River+in+Bhutan&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Manas%20%20River%20in%20Bhutan&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing|year=1991|isbn= 81-85182-61-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The river flows through Bhutan in a south-west direction between two ranges of the [[Lower Himalayas]] in V-shaped gorges and enters into [[Assam]] in [[India]] into the south-central foot hills of the Himalayas. The valley opens up in the foot hills; marked by the formation of swamps and marshes in the plains. The upper catchment is snow bound while the middle and lower catchment are thickly forested.&lt;ref name=Negi/&gt;

[[File:Transparent flow.jpg|thumb|right|Clear waters of the Manas River in the sanctuary]]
The river system as a whole in Bhutan constitutes a length of {{convert|3200|km|mi}}, the main stem of the river is the Manas or Gongri river, which originates in the [[West Kameng District]] of Arunachal Pradesh in India and after flowing in a south westerly direction (the rivers in Bhutan generally flow from northwest to southwest) enters Bhutan near [[Trashigang District|Tashigang]]. At Tashigong, it is joined by the [[Kulong Chu]], which rises in the northern Himalaya snow ranges of Bhutan. At Tashigong, the bed width of the river is about {{convert|550|m|ft}} and river bed elevation is {{convert|606|m|ft}}. The river Kulong Chu is formed by two rivers namely, the [[Tongsa (Mangde) Chu]] that rises in northern Bhutan near [[Kula Kangri|Kula Kangri Peak]] where the elevation is {{convert|1666|m|ft}} and the [[Bumthang River]], also called [[Murchangphy Chu]]; the combined stream joins the Manas river.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

The [[Lhobrak]], or [[Kuri Chhu]], is the main central tributary of the Manas. It is the only river that rises north of the [[Great Himalayas]] and it joins the Manas in southern Bhutan; further downstream of the combined stream joining at the [[Tongsa Chu]]. Here, the river bed level is {{convert|121|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; After flowing in a generally south-westerly direction for about {{convert|29|km|mi}} in Bhutan, the Aie river enters In India into the [[Goalpara district]] of Assam at the village of [[Agrong]]. From here, it follows a meandering course for about {{convert|75|km|mi}} and outfalls into the Brahmaputra near Jogigopa. Aie River, which rises in the Black mountains at an altitude of about {{convert|4915|m|ft}} near the village of Bangpari, is about {{convert|110|km|mi}} in length. The total length of the Manas measured along its longest tributary the Kur is {{convert|376|km|mi}}, out of which about {{convert|104|km|mi}} lies in India.&lt;ref name="RBA"/&gt;

The river valley in the foothills is surrounded by small meadows located among thickly deciduous forested foothills with many rivulets, streams and natural drainage channels related to the river system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tixik.com/image-560695.htm|title=The Manas River bordering Bhutan famous for the game fish "Golden Masheer"|publisher=En.tixik|accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lower reaches of the river, there are many smooth sandy stretches populated with trees.&lt;ref name="Niva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nivalink.com/bansbari/facilities.html|title=What to See - Manas National Park|publisher=Nivalink|accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot hills in Bhutan and India known as [[Terai]] and the [[Duars]] (A [[Sanskrit languuge|Sanskrit]] word meaning "passes" or "gates"), which encompass {{convert|15|-|30|km|mi}} stretch of the foot hills and which are very fertile. Each Duar (with elevation varying from {{convert|100|m|ft}} to near sea level as they join the Brahmaputra river) is named after a stream or hemmed between two streams. Some part of the Duars in Bhutan was under [[United Kingdom|British]] control. The fertile lands have been developed into tea estates and paddy fields.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Lindsay |author2=Bradley Mayhew |author3=Stan Armington |author4=Richard Whitecross|title=Bhutan|pages=83–86|accessdate=2010-04-04|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Manas++River+in+Bhutan&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Manas%20%20River%20in%20Bhutan&amp;f=false|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2007|isbn=1-74059-529-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrology==
The catchment is wholly mountainous, rising within the space of {{convert|140|km|mi}} from an elevation of about {{convert|100|m|ft}} near the Indian border to the great Himalayan peaks at over {{convert|7500|m|ft}} along the main Himalayan range bordering Bhutan and Tibet. The huge elevation range and varied climatic conditions are reflected in the great ecological diversity and rich fauna and flora in the river catchment.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;

==Climate==
The climate is extremely varied, ranging from hot and humid subtropical conditions in the south to cold and dry alpine conditions in the north. From May to October, the [[southwest monsoon]] brings heavy rainfall&amp;mdash;more than {{convert|4000|mm|in}} to the southern part&amp;mdash;and there is a pronounced dry season in winter. Further north, the rainfall is generally scanty, of the order of {{convert|600|to|700|mm|in}}, recorded during June–August.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;

The difference between maximum and minimum river flow in monsoon and the dry months is said to be as much as 20 times.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt; The Manas river, the largest north bank tributary of the Brahmaputra, has a recorded maximum discharge of 7,641&amp;nbsp;cubic metres and contributes 5.48% of the total flows of the Brahmaputra. Its total length up to its confluence with the Brahmaputra is {{convert|375|km|mi}} ({{convert|270|km|mi}} in hills and balance in plains) and raises at an altitude of{{convert|4500|m|ft}}. It has a total catchment area of {{convert|41350|km2|mi2}} out of which 85.9% is in hills and plains.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;

==Reserved areas==
[[File:Hanging bridge from bottom.jpg|right|thumb|A suspension bridge across the Manas River in reserved area of the Park]]
Out of the large catchment of the river valley, protected or reserved areas have been specifically demarcated, both in Bhutan and India, which are declared national parks or sanctuaries. The two reserved forest and wild life areas cover an area of {{convert|9938.54|km2|mi2}}, which account for about 24% of the total catchment area of {{convert|41350|km2|mi2}} of the Manas river valley; brief details are provided.

===Royal Manas National Park===
{{Main|Manas National Park|Royal Manas National Park}}
Royal Manas National Park in southern Bhutan, considered the national heritage of Bhutan, was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1996 and subsequently raised to the status of a national park in 1993. Covering an area of {{convert|9938.54|km2|mi2}}, the area is forested to the extent of 92% and is a well-preserved Eastern Himalayan ecosystem. The park is bounded on its north by the Black Mountain National Park and the Manas Tiger Reserve on its South in India. Within Bhutan, biological corridors linked with the park are the Thrumshingla National Park in the North, Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary in the West, and Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary in the East. As researched so far, the park has a large diversity of tropical grasslands, temperate moist forests, alpine meadows, and scrublands. The various flora and fauna identified in the park are 45 species of mammals, 366 species of birds and 900 species of vascular plants. [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) is actively working on a conservation management plan in association with local wildlife authorities to preserve and protect this national heritage.&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/bhutan/projects/index.cfm?uProjectID=BT0010 |title=Royal Manas National Park, Bhutan |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=WWF for a Living Planet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107044212/http://www.panda.org/who_we_are/wwf_offices/bhutan/projects/index.cfm?uProjectID=BT0010 |archivedate=2009-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the important faunal species identified are: the royal [[Bengal tiger]], [[elephant]], [[gaur]] (''[[Bos gaurus]]''), four rare species of [[golden langur]] (''[[Trachypithecus geei]]''), [[pygmy hog]] (''[[Sus salvanius]]''), [[hispid hare]] (''[[Caprolagus hispidus]]''), greater [[one-horned rhinoceros]] (''[[Rhinoceros unicornis]]'') and [[wild Asiatic water buffalo]] (''[[Bubalus arnee]]''). There are 362 species of birds, out of which four species of [[hornbills]] (rufous-necked, wreathed, pied and great Indian) have been recorded. Apart from the [[Ganges river dolphin]] (''[[Platanista gangetica]]'') other aquan species identified in the river are the deep bodied [[mahseer]] (''Tor tor''), [[golden mahseer]] (''[[Tor putitora]]''), and chocolate mahseer or katle (''Acrossocheilus hexangonolepis''). Five thousand people live within the park limits in several villages.&lt;ref name=parks&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutantrustfund.bt/parks-of-bhutan |title=Parks of Bhutan |accessdate=2010-04-04 |publisher=Bhutan Trust Fund for Environment Conservation |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702041330/http://www.bhutantrustfund.bt/parks-of-bhutan |archivedate=2011-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tigers, the most revered animal in Bhutan, are estimated to number about 100 and are mostly in this national park and the neighbouring Manas National Park in India&lt;ref name="Brown p.86"&gt;Brown p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's rarest monkeys, the [[golden langur]], which flourish in dense forests,  "with its long tail with a tassel at the end, are found both in Bhutan and India, in the two reserved forest sanctuaries. These monkeys found in groups have no hair on their black face but have generous golden ruff on their body. They are found in large numbers – 180 in India and 1200 in Bhutan, as per counts made in 1978 and 1980 respectively.&lt;ref name=Thapar&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thapar|first=Valmiki|title=Land of the tiger: a natural history of the Indian subcontinent|pages=64–65|accessdate=2010-04-04|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dvx6EoLwa4C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Manas++River+in+Bhutan&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=Manas%20%20River%20in%20Bhutan&amp;f=false|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0-520-21470-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manas Wild Life Sanctuary===
{{Main|Manas Wildlife Sanctuary}}
[[File:Way to Panbang through Manas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manas Wildlife Sanctuary]] in the Manas valley]]
The Manas Wild Life Sanctuary, located in Assam, is considered as one of "Asia's finest wild life reserves" and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is contiguous to the Bhutan's Royal National Park to its north. It now encompasses a bio reserve, a tiger reserve and also an elephant reserve. The park is well forested and also comprises grass lands and marshes. In 1928, the core of the area was designated a sanctuary and in 1978 it was declared a tiger reserve.&lt;ref name=Kemf&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kemf|first=Elizabeth|title= Indigenous peoples and protected areas: the law of mother Earth|pages= 156–161|accessdate=2010-04-04|url=https://books.google.com/?id=a7urXnqCitoC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Manas++River+in+Bhutan&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=Manas%20%20River%20in%20Bhutan&amp;f=false|publisher= Earthscan|year=1993|isbn= 1-85383-167-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manas River and another tributary of Manas, the Hakua, flow through the sanctuary. A thick mantle of [[alluvium]] is the dominant soil of the terrain. Under subtropical climatic conditions (with {{convert|30|mm|in}} of annual rainfall and temperature varying from a maximum of {{convert|30|C|F}} and a minimum of {{convert|5|C|F}}), the forest consists of the semi-evergreen forest vegetation with mixed deciduous, littorals and swamps, and interspersed with bamboo and cane. Flooding occurs in large parts of the Bio Reserve.&lt;ref name=Negi91&gt;{{Cite book|last=Negi|first=S.S.|title= Handbook of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves in India|pages=91–92|accessdate=2010-04-04|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JYFmoOWfmX8C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Manas++River+in+Bhutan&amp;cd=47#v=onepage&amp;q=Manas%20%20River%20in%20Bhutan&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing|year=2002|isbn= 9788173871283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Negi1&gt;{{Cite book|last=Negi|first=Sharad Singh|title= Biosphere reserves in India: landuse, biodiversity and conservation|pages=86–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrP3-4IFtMUC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Manas++River+in+India&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|publisher= Indus Publishing|year=1996|isbn= 81-7387-043-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is managed under several conservation management units such as the Core Zone, the Buffer Zone, and the Economic Zone. The park is known for its rare and endangered endemic wildlife such as the tigers, elephants, Assam roofed [[turtle]], [[hispid hare]], golden and capped langurs and [[pygmy hog]], one-horned rhinoceros, Asiatic buffalo, swamp deer, barking deers, leopards, clouded leopards, marbled cats, sloth bears, hoolock gibbons, wild boar, gharials, crocodiles, and river [[dolphins]]. Reptiles consist of [[pythons]], common Indian [[crocodile]], common [[wolf snake]], [[cat snake]] and many other species. Birds listed include [[hornbills]], [[common crane]], [[common redshank]], [[Eurasian woodcock]], [[spotted eagle]]s, [[black-throated diver]], [[little grebe]], different types of [[heron]]s, [[black ibis]], [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], [[spot-bellied eagle-owl]] and several others. The park is home for 22 endangered mammal species. Fish species identified are: katli, jurraha, chenga, telliah, [[labeo]] and mahaseer.&lt;ref name="Kemf p.157"&gt;Kemf p.157&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation measures have been undertaken to prevent poaching, overfishing, encroachments, and many other related issues. These measures are meant to minimise human interference in the fragile core zone, creation of a data base and carry out research on animal and plant populations for better conservation of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Negi1 p.93"&gt;Negi p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the park has been central to the [[Bodoland]] agitation of Assam as the Bodos dominating the area took refuge in the sanctuary. [[Bodo people|Bodos]] have been demanding autonomy or a separate state of their own on grounds that their lands were incorporated into Assam during the [[British Raj]].&lt;ref name="Kemf p.157" /&gt;

==River development options==
[[File:Album Pose.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Brahma]] [[temple]] in the Manas valley at [[Kokrajhar]] town in [[Assam]]]]
One of the development projects planned in the past on the Manas River envisaged flood control in the Brahmaputra River and augmentation of flows in the Ganga river system by building a dam on the river at the Indo-Bhutan border. The stored water stored behind the reservoir  was proposed to be transferred through a long canal system through the foot hills of the Himalayas (skirting Bangladesh) crossing 25 major and minor rivers, out of which the major rivers the Sankosh, Raidak, Amo ([[Torsa]]),  [[Kartoya]], [[Teesta River|Teesta]], [[Atrai River|Atrai]] and [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]] through [[North Bengal]], and finally out falling into the [[Kosi River]] in [[North Bihar]]. The project has not proceeded further due to several adverse public opinion and environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=River&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesouthasian.org/archives/2003/riverlinking_and_assams_intere.html|title=River-Linking and Assam's Interests|accessdate=2010-04-04|publisher=The South Asian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iucn&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reijnders, P. J. H. |author2=Oliver, William L. R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IkvLQtkpwYC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=manas+river,+assam&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=manas%20river%2C%20assam&amp;f=false|title=Seals, fur seals, sea lions, and walrus: status survey and conservation action plan|publisher=IUCN/SSC action plans for the conservation of biological diversity. The [[IUCN]] conservation library|year=1993|page=126|isbn=2-8317-0141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal mooted in the 1970s to build a dam on the river for multipurpose uses of power, irrigation and flood control in Assam involved a {{convert|100|km|mi}} long canal from the Manas reservoir to another reservoir on the Sankosh River. As the canal was passing through the Manas Tiger Reserve, the Ministry of Environment and Forests of Government of India objected to the proposal on the grounds of adverse impact that would occur due to the dam on the Hydrology and ecology of the area. This view was also supported by the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO. The late Prime Minister of India, [[Rajiv Gandhi]] upheld the objections and decided to discontinue with the project. It is unlikely to be revived.&lt;ref name="Kemf p.159"&gt;Kemf p.159&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposal had been mooted as a joint project of India and Bhutan. The pre-feasibility report prepared for this Manas multipurpose project envisaged power generation of 2800 MW. Another cooperation project on the Mandgde Chu, in central Bhutan, tributary of Manas, envisages power generation of 360/600 MW for which Detailed Project Report (DPR) is under preparation.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powermin.nic.in/whats_new/pdf/India-Cooperation%20with%20neighbouring%20countries.pps#10|title=Intercountry Cooperation in Development of Hydropower|format=ppt|work=Indi-Bhutan Cooperation Projects|page=11|accessdate=2010-04-04|publisher=National Informatics Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental threats==
The Manas River has often been the centre of environmental controversies, particularly in the 1980s. Two dams were proposed  on the Bhutanese side of the river to provide hydroelectric power and to control the flow of the Brahmaputra on its northern bank and make way for irrigation schemes. However, there were not only local concerns but national and international ones among environmentalists with regard to the proposals who lobbied enough support to ensure that the dam proposals were dropped in 1986.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In February 1989, the [[All Bodo Students Union]] (ABSU) invaded the park and killed several wardens and guards, permitting the entry of poachers and loggers who posed an immediate threat to the wildlife of the park and its river. The threat of flooding remained as ever in 2010.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

{{Infobox neon}}
'''Neon''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ne''' and [[atomic number]] 10. It is a [[noble gas]].&lt;ref&gt;Group 18 refers to the modern numbering of the periodic table. Older numberings described the rare gases as Group 0 or Group VIIIA (sometimes shortened to 8). See also [[Group (periodic table)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert [[monatomic gas]] under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard conditions]], with about two-thirds the density of air. It was discovered (along with [[krypton]] and [[xenon]]) in 1898 as one of the three residual rare inert elements remaining in dry air, after [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[argon]] and [[carbon dioxide]] were removed. Neon was the second of these three rare gases to be discovered and was immediately recognized as a new element from its bright red [[emission spectrum]]. The name neon is derived from the Greek word, {{lang|grc|νέον}}, neuter singular form of {{lang|grc|νέος}} (''neos''), meaning new. Neon is chemically [[Inert gas|inert]], and no uncharged neon compounds are known. The [[Neon compounds|compounds of neon]] currently known include ionic molecules, molecules held together by [[van der Waals forces]] and [[clathrates]].

During cosmic [[nucleogenesis]] of the elements, large amounts of neon are built up from the alpha-capture fusion process in stars. Although neon is a very common element in the universe and solar system (it is fifth in cosmic abundance after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[oxygen]] and [[carbon]]), it is rare on Earth. It composes about 18.2 ppm of air by volume (this is about the same as the molecular or mole fraction) and a smaller fraction in Earth's crust. The reason for neon's relative scarcity on Earth and the [[terrestrial planet|inner (terrestrial) planets]] is that neon  is highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and forms no compounds to fix it to solids. As a result, it escaped from the [[planetesimal]]s under the warmth of the newly ignited Sun in the early Solar System. Even the outer atmosphere of [[Jupiter]] is somewhat depleted of neon, although for a different reason.&lt;ref name=Wilson2010&gt;{{citation | title=Sequestration of Noble Gases in Giant Planet Interiors | last1=Wilson | first1=Hugh F. | last2=Militzer | first2=Burkhard | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=104 | issue=12 | id=121101 | date=March 2010 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.121101 | bibcode=2010PhRvL.104l1101W | arxiv=1003.5940 | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also [[lighter than air]], causing it to escape even from Earth's atmosphere.

Neon gives a distinct reddish-orange glow when used in low-[[volt]]age [[Neon lamp|neon glow lamps]], high-voltage [[Geissler tube|discharge tubes]] and [[Neon sign|neon advertising signs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Project STAR: The Universe in Your Hands|author = Coyle, Harold P. |publisher = Kendall Hunt|date = 2001|isbn = 978-0-7872-6763-6|url = https://books.google.com/?id=KwTzo4GMlewC&amp;pg=PA127 |pages = 464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Phosphors for lamps |title = Phosphor Handbook|editor = Shionoya, Shigeo|editor2 = Yen, William M. |author = Kohmoto, Kohtaro |publisher = CRC Press|date = 1999|isbn = 978-0-8493-7560-6|url = https://books.google.com/?id=lWlcJEDukRIC&amp;pg=PA380|pages = 940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of [[helium–neon laser]]s. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the [[fractional distillation]] of [[liquid air]]. Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.

==History==
[[File:NeTube.jpg|thumb|left|Neon [[gas-discharge lamp]]s forming the symbol for neon "Ne"]]
Neon (Greek {{lang|el|νέον}} (''néon''), neuter singular form of {{lang|el|νέος}}, meaning "new"), was discovered in 1898 by the British chemists Sir [[William Ramsay]] (1852–1916) and [[Morris W. Travers]] (1872–1961) in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = On the Companions of Argon |author = [[William Ramsay|Ramsay, William]], Travers, Morris W. |journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume = 63 |issue = 1 |pages = 437–440 |date = 1898 |doi = 10.1098/rspl.1898.0057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neon was discovered when Ramsay chilled a sample of air until it became a liquid, then warmed the liquid and captured the gases as they boiled off. The gases [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[argon]] had been identified, but the remaining gases were isolated in roughly their order of abundance, in a six-week period beginning at the end of May 1898. First to be identified was [[krypton]]. The next, after krypton had been removed, was a gas which gave a brilliant red light under spectroscopic discharge. This gas, identified in June, was named "neon", the Greek analogue of "novum" (new), suggested by Ramsay's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e01000.html |title=Neon: History |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Softciências |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314232318/http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e01000.html |archivedate=2007-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic brilliant red-orange color emitted by gaseous neon when excited electrically was noted immediately. Travers later wrote: "the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287 |title=Discovery of the Elements: Third Edition (reprint) |last=Weeks |first=Mary Elvira |date=2003 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-0-7661-3872-8 |page=287 |authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322191804/http://books.google.com/books?id=SJIk9BPdNWcC&amp;pg=PA287 |archivedate=2015-03-22|df=}}&lt;!--This is an important quote. It eliminates the many claims that Claude was the first to note the brilliant emission of neon. The probable original source is Travers' 1928 book: {{cite book |title=The Discovery of the Rare Gases |last=Travers |first=Morris W. |publisher=Edward Arnold &amp; Co. |location=London |year=1928}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A second gas was also reported along with neon, having approximately the same density as argon but with a different spectrum – Ramsay and Travers named it ''metargon''.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;

Finally, the same team discovered [[xenon]] by the same process, in September 1898.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt;

Neon's scarcity precluded its prompt application for lighting along the lines of [[Moore tube]]s, which used [[nitrogen]] and which were commercialized in the early 1900s. After 1902, [[Georges Claude]]'s company [[Air Liquide]] produced industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of his air-liquefaction business. In December 1910 Claude demonstrated modern [[neon lighting]] based on a sealed tube of neon. Claude tried briefly to sell neon tubes for indoor domestic lighting, due to their intensity, but the market failed because homeowners objected to the color. In 1912, Claude's associate began selling neon discharge tubes as eye-catching [[neon sign|advertising signs]] and was instantly more successful. Neon tubes were introduced to the U.S. in 1923 with two large neon signs bought by a Los Angeles Packard car dealership. The glow and arresting red color made neon advertising completely different from the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Neon played a role in the basic understanding of the nature of atoms in 1913, when [[J. J. Thomson]], as part of his exploration into the composition of [[canal rays]], channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the [[atom]]s in the neon [[gas]] were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of [[isotope]]s of [[Stable isotope|stable]] atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a [[mass spectrometer]].

==Isotopes==
{{Main|Isotopes of neon}}
[[File:Discovery of neon isotopes.JPG|thumb|left|The first evidence for isotopes of a stable element was provided in 1913 by experiments on neon plasma. In the bottom right corner of [[J. J. Thomson]]'s photographic plate are the separate impact marks for the two isotopes neon-20 and neon-22.]]
Neon is the second lightest inert gas. Neon has three [[stable isotope]]s: &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne (90.48%), &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne (0.27%) and &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne (9.25%). &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne and &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne are partly [[primordial isotope|primordial]] and partly [[nucleogenic]] (i.e. made by nuclear reactions of other nuclides with neutrons or other particles in the environment) and their variations in [[natural abundance]] are well understood. In contrast, &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne (the chief [[primordial isotope]] made in stellar [[nucleosynthesis]]) is not known to be nucleogenic or [[radiogenic]]. The causes of the variation of &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne in the Earth have thus been hotly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-521-82316-6|chapter = Neon|page = 303|url = https://books.google.com/?id=z8ZCg2HRvWsC&amp;pg=PA303|title = Radiogenic isotope geology|author1 = Dickin, Alan P|date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal [[nuclear reaction]]s generating nucleogenic neon [[isotope]]s start from &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg and &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;Mg, which produce &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne and &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne respectively, after [[neutron capture]] and immediate emission of an [[alpha particle]]. The [[neutron]]s that produce the reactions are mostly produced by secondary spallation reactions from [[alpha particle]]s, in turn derived from [[uranium]]-series [[decay chain]]s. The net result yields a trend towards lower &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne/&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne and higher &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne/&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne ratios observed in uranium-rich rocks such as [[granite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/ne_iig.html Resources on Isotopes. Periodic Table—Neon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923194636/http://wwwrcamnl.wr.usgs.gov/isoig/period/ne_iig.html |date=2006-09-23 }}. explanation of the nucleogenic sources of Ne-21 and Ne-22. USGS.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne may also be produced in a nucleogenic reaction, when &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne absorbs a neutron from various natural terrestrial neutron sources.

In addition, isotopic analysis of exposed terrestrial [[rock (geology)|rocks]] has demonstrated the [[cosmogenic]] (cosmic ray) production of &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne. This isotope is generated by [[spallation]] reactions on [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], [[silicon]], and [[aluminium]]. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can be resolved from [[magma]]tic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e01093.html |title=Neon: Isotopes |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=Softciências |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69YsG9S1a?url=http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e01093.html |archivedate=2012-07-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to [[xenon]], neon content observed in samples of [[volcano|volcanic]] [[gas]]es is enriched in &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne and nucleogenic &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Ne relative to &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Ne content. The neon isotopic content of these mantle-derived samples represents a non-atmospheric source of neon. The &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne-enriched components are attributed to exotic primordial rare-gas components in the Earth, possibly representing [[solar neon]]. Elevated &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne abundances are found in [[diamond]]s, further suggesting a solar-neon reservoir in the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mantleplumes.org/Ne.html |title=Helium, Neon &amp; Argon |accessdate=2006-07-02 |author=Anderson, Don L. |publisher=Mantleplumes.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528113659/http://www.mantleplumes.org/Ne.html |archivedate=2006-05-28 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after [[helium]]. It glows reddish-orange in a [[discharge tube|vacuum discharge tube]]. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45&amp;nbsp;°C to −245.95&amp;nbsp;°C, or −415.21&amp;nbsp;°F to −410.71&amp;nbsp;°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity (per unit volume) of liquid [[helium]] and three times that of liquid [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; In most applications it is a less expensive [[refrigerant]] than helium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nassmc.org/bulletin/dec05bulletin.html#table |title=NASSMC: News Bulletin |accessdate=2007-03-05 |date=December 30, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213072031/http://www.nassmc.org/bulletin/dec05bulletin.html |archivedate=February 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhVEI52-VE8C&amp;pg=PA195 |page=195|title=Fundamentals of Cryogenic Engineering |isbn=9788120330573 |author1=Mukhopadhyay |first1=Mamata |date=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116145946/https://books.google.com/books?id=nhVEI52-VE8C&amp;pg=PA195 |archivedate=2017-11-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neon emission.png|thumb|left|Spectrum of neon with ultraviolet (at left) and infrared (at right) lines shown in white]]
Neon plasma has the most intense light discharge at normal voltages and currents of all the noble gases. The average color of this light to the human eye is red-orange due to many lines in this range; it also contains a strong green line, which is hidden, unless the visual components are dispersed by a spectroscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricalfun.com/plasma.htm |title=Plasma |accessdate=2007-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307005259/http://www.electricalfun.com/plasma.htm |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two quite different kinds of [[neon lighting]] are in common use. [[Neon lamp|Neon glow lamps]] are generally tiny, with most operating between 100 and 250 [[volts]].&lt;ref name=Baumann&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumann |first=Edward |title=Applications of Neon Lamps and Gas Discharge Tubes |publisher=Carlton Press |date=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have been widely used as power-on indicators and in circuit-testing equipment, but [[light-emitting diodes]] (LEDs) now dominate in those applications.

==Occurrence==
Stable isotopes of neon are produced in stars. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne is created in fusing [[helium]] and [[oxygen]] in the [[alpha process]]. This requires temperatures above 100 mega[[kelvin]]s&lt;!-- pluralized! --&gt;, which are only available in the cores of stars of more than 3 solar masses.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Neon is abundant on a universal scale; it is the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|fifth most abundant chemical element]] in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see [[chemical element]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2009ARA&amp;A..47..481A |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145222 |title=The Chemical Composition of the Sun |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=47 |pages=481 |year=2009 |last1=Asplund |first1=Martin |last2=Grevesse |first2=Nicolas |last3=Sauval |first3=A. Jacques |last4=Scott |first4=Pat |arxiv=0909.0948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend to keep it from being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.

Neon is monatomic, making it lighter than the molecules of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, albeit more slowly than a helium balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Chemistry for Higher Tier |author = Gallagher, R. |author2 = Ingram, P. |publisher = University Press |isbn = 978-0-19-914817-2 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=SJtWSy69eVsC&amp;pg=PA96 |pages = 282 |date = 2001-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neon's abundance in the universe is about 1 part in 750; in the Sun and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The [[Galileo spacecraft]] atmospheric entry probe found that even in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-[[planetesimal]]s which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found in the Sun).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/gll38.html |title=Galileo Probe Science Result |accessdate=2007-02-27 |last=Morse |first=David |date=January 26, 1996 |publisher=Galileo Project |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224232055/http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/gll38.html |archivedate=February 24, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neon comprises 1 part in 55,000 in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], or 18.2 ppm by volume (this is about the same as the molecule or mole fraction), or 1 part in 79,000 of air by mass. It comprises a smaller fraction in the crust. It is industrially produced by cryogenic [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air.&lt;ref name=CRC /&gt;

On 17 August 2015, based on studies with the [[Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer]] (LADEE) spacecraft, NASA scientists reported the detection of neon in the [[exosphere]] of the [[moon]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20150817"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steigerwald |first=William |title=NASA's LADEE Spacecraft Finds Neon in Lunar Atmosphere |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/ladee-lunar-neon |date=17 August 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=18 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819035151/http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/ladee-lunar-neon/ |archivedate=19 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ne-water clathrate.png|thumb|Crystal structure of Ne [[clathrate hydrate]]&lt;ref name=hydrate/&gt;]]
Neon is the first [[p-block]] noble gas, and the first element with a true octet of electrons. It is [[Chemically inert|inert]]: as is the case with its lighter analogue, [[helium]], no strongly bound neutral [[Neon compounds|molecules containing neon]] have been identified. The [[ion]]s [Ne[[argon|Ar]]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [Ne[[hydrogen|H]]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [HeNe]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have been observed from optical and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] studies.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Solid neon [[clathrate hydrate]] was produced from water ice and neon gas at pressures 0.35–0.48 GPa and temperatures about −30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1410690111 |pmid=25002464 |pmc=4115495 |year=2014 |author1=Yu |first1=X. |title=Crystal structure and encapsulation dynamics of ice II-structured neon hydrate |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=111 |issue=29 |pages=10456–61 |last2=Zhu |first2=J. |last3=Du |first3=S. |last4=Xu |first4=H. |last5=Vogel |first5=S.

S. |last11=Zhao |first11=Y. |bibcode=2014PNAS..11110456Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ne atoms are not bonded to water and can freely move through this material. They can be extracted by placing the clathrate into a vacuum chamber for several days, yielding [[ice XVI]], the least dense crystalline form of water.&lt;ref name=hydrate&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature14014 |pmid=25503235 |title=Formation and properties of ice XVI obtained by emptying a type sII clathrate hydrate |journal=Nature |volume=516 |issue=7530 |pages=231 |year=2014 |last1=Falenty |first1=Andrzej |last2=Hansen |first2=Thomas C. |last3=Kuhs |first3=Werner F. |bibcode=2014Natur.516..231F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The familiar [[Electronegativity#Pauling electronegativity|Pauling electronegativity scale]] relies upon chemical bond energies, but such values have obviously not been measured for inert helium and neon. The [[Electronegativity#Allen electronegativity|Allen electronegativity scale]], which relies only upon (measurable) atomic energies, identifies neon as the most electronegative element, closely followed by fluorine and helium.

==Applications==
Neon is often used in [[neon sign|signs]] and produces an unmistakable bright reddish-orange light. Although tube lights with other colors are often called "neon", they use different [[noble gas]]es or varied colors of [[Fluorescent bulb|fluorescent]] lighting.

Neon is used in [[vacuum tube]]s, high-voltage indicators, [[lightning arrester]]s, [[wavemeter]] tubes, [[television]] tubes, and [[helium–neon laser]]s. Liquefied neon is commercially used as a [[cryogenic]] [[refrigerant]] in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more extreme liquid-helium refrigeration.

Neon, as liquid or gas, is relatively expensive&amp;nbsp;– for small quantities, the price of liquid neon can be more than 55 times that of liquid helium. Driving neon's expense is the rarity of neon, which unlike helium, can only be obtained from air.

The [[triple point]] temperature of neon (24.5561 K) is a defining fixed point in the [[International Temperature Scale of 1990]].&lt;ref name="ITS90-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.its-90.com/ |title=The Internet resource for the International Temperature Scale of 1990 |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815110916/http://www.its-90.com/ |archivedate=2009-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''off line regulator''', '''off-line regulator''', or '''offline regulator''' is an [[Electronic component|electronic]] [[voltage regulation]] or [[current regulator|current regulation]] device that is designed to directly accept [[electric power]] obtained from an [[alternating current]] utility power source.

This [[electronics design]] terminology has no relationship to the use of "[[online and offline]]" for computers and networking, and no relationship with [[uninterruptible power supplies]] that provide power while disconnected from the electrical grid.

An off line regulator can be a complete [[integrated circuit]] with all capabilities necessary to provide clean power to a small portable or handheld device,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/parametrics.do?id=449&lt;/ref&gt; or it may be used as part of a larger [[switched mode power supply]] (SMPS) or [[DC-DC converter]].

== Characteristics ==
Although alternating current is commonly described as being "120 V" or "240 V", this is the [[root mean square]] of the actual full peak voltage of the AC sinewave, which is +/- 169 V for 120 V and +/- 338 V for 240 V.

Additionally, 120 V and 240 V are considered [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] voltages, and actual voltages may be somewhat higher or lower during normal operation. The range of this variability is not well-defined but can be as much as +/- 20 volts (100 V - 140 V and 220 V - 260 V). This pushes the peak line voltage up to +/- 198 V for 120 V and +/- 368 V for 240 V.

Off line regulators must also be tolerant of voltage spikes, surges, brownouts, and other [[power quality]] conditions that may affect the electronic device.

{{Greek myth (aquatic nymphs)}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Pallas''' (/ˈpæləs/; [[Ancient Greek]]: Παλλάς) was the daughter of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], son of [[Poseidon]] and messenger of the seas.

== Mythology ==
After Athena was born fully armed from [[Zeus]]' forehead, Triton acting as a foster parent to the goddess raised her alongside his own daughter, Pallas. The sea god taught both girls the arts of war.

During an athletics festival, Pallas and Athena fought with spears in a friendly mock battle, where the victor who be whoever managed to disarm their opponent. At the beginning of the fight, Athena got the upper hand, until Pallas took over. Before she could win, Zeus, who was in attendance, fearing to see his own daughter lose, distracted Pallas with the [[Aegis]], which she had once shown interest in. Pallas, stunned in awe, stood still as Athena, expecting her to dodge, impaled Pallas, accidentally.

Out of sadness and regret, she created the [[Palladium (mythology)|palladium]], a statue in the likeness of Pallas and wrapped the aegis, which she had feared, about the breast of it, and set it up beside Zeus and honored it.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]]. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]],'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+3.12.3&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022 3.12.3.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Athena took on the title Pallas as tribute to her late friend.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

This story about Athena and Pallas inspired a yearly festival in [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] dedicated to the goddess. A passage by [[Herodotus]] recounts this custom:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]]. ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D180%3Asection%3D1 4.180.1-4].'' Translated by A. D. Godley. Cambridge. Harvard University Press. 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''"Next to these [[Machlyes]] are the Auseans; these and the Machlyes, separated by the Triton, live on the shores of the Tritonian lake. The Machlyes wear their hair long behind, the Auseans in front.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''They celebrate a yearly festival of Athena, where their maidens are separated into two bands and fight each other with stones and sticks, thus (they say) honoring in the way of their ancestors that native goddess whom we call Athena. Maidens who die of their wounds are called false virgins.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''Before the girls are set fighting, the whole people choose the fairest maid, and arm her with a Corinthian helmet and Greek panoply, to be then mounted on a chariot and drawn all along the lake shore.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''With what armor they equipped their maidens before Greeks came to live near them, I cannot say; but I suppose the armor was Egyptian; for I maintain that the Greeks took their shield and helmet from Egypt."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In modern literature ==
Pallas is mentioned in the poem "[[The Raven]]" by American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]] as well as by [[Pierre de Ronsard]] in the Second Book of his 'Sonnets For Helen': Sonnet 12, Line 13: "Ou bien tu es Pallas, ou bien l'une des Graces." (Translation: "Or perhaps you are Pallas, or one of the Graces.")

The '''Petroleum Authority of Uganda''' (PAOU), also known as the '''Uganda National Petroleum Authority''', is governmental organisation that regulates the petroleum industry in [[Uganda]], the third-largest economy in the [[East African Community]]. Its responsibilities include licensing, regulation, supervision of exploration, harvesting, refining, marketing, and disposal of petroleum products in the country. Although owned by the Ugandan government, it is expected to act independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Ibrahim | last=Kasita | date=2012 | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/134-blog-uganda-s-draft-petroleum-law-provides-checks-and-balances.aspx | title=Uganda's Draft Petroleum Law Provides Checks And Balances | accessdate=29 August 2014 | location=Kampala | newspaper=[[New Vision]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The law authorising the creation of PAOU is known as the Petroleum (Exploration, Development and Production) Act 2013. It was passed by the [[Parliament of Uganda|Ugandan parliament]] on 7 December 2012 and was assented to by the [[president of Uganda]] on 12 March 2013. The law was gazetted on 15 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=President Museveni signs Oil Law |url=http://www.independent.co.ug/ugandatalks/2013/04/president-museveni-signs-oil-law | first=Ronald | last=Musoke | date=19 April 2013 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | newspaper=[[The Independent (Uganda)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAOU was established once the president named its [[board of directors]] and once Uganda's parliament approved the board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/653607-oil-proceeds-to-transform-agriculture.html | title=Oil Proceeds To Transform Agriculture | newspaper=[[New Vision]] | location=Kampala | first=Reporter | last=Vision | date=17 March 2014 | accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/657511-mps-reject-two-presidential-appointees-on-oil-management.html | title=MPs Reject Two Presidential Appointees On Oil Management | newspaper=[[New Vision]] | date=14 July 2014 | accessdate=29 August 2014 | location=Kampala | first=Henry | last=Sekanjako}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=26 January 2016 | location=Kampala | url=http://ugandaoil.co/2015/09/uganda-parliament-approves-members-of-national-board-of-petroleum | title=Uganda Parliament approves Members of National Board of Petroleum | date=16 September 2015 | last=Amos Desmond Wambi | publisher=Uganda Oil Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, PAOU advertised 37 mainly managerial positions, in preparation for expected first oil in 2020.&lt;ref name="Rec"&gt;{{cite web|date=23 August 2017| url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1460337/petroleum-authority-recruits-staff | title=Petroleum Authority recruits more staff | accessdate=23 August 2017 |newspaper=[[New Vision]] |location=Kampala| first=Billy |last=Rwothungeyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The headquarters of PAOU is at 34-36 Lugard Avenue, in [[Entebbe]], on the northern shores of [[Lake Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=4 July 2017 |  url=http://pau.go.ug/uploads/Press_Statement.pdf | title=Petroleum Authority of Uganda publishes the National Suppliers’ Database 2017 for the Oil and Gas Sector |format=PDF |author=Executive Director | location=Entebbe | publisher=Petroleum Authority of Uganda|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordinates of the headquarters of the authority are:0°03'15.0"N, 32°28'52.0"E (Latitude:0.054167; Longitude:32.481111).&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps|

'''Polyacrylamide''' ([[IUPAC]] '''poly(2-propenamide)''' or '''poly(1-carbamoylethylene)''', abbreviated as PAM) is a [[polymer]] (-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-) formed from [[acrylamide]] subunits. It can be synthesized as a simple linear-chain structure or [[cross-link]]ed, typically using [[N,N'-Methylenebisacrylamide|''N'',''N''{{'}}-methylenebisacrylamide]]. In the cross-linked form, the possibility of the monomer being present is reduced even further.  It is highly water-absorbent, forming a soft [[gel]] when hydrated, used in such applications as [[SDS-PAGE|polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], and can also be called ghost crystals when cross-linked, and in manufacturing soft [[contact lens]]es. In the straight-chain form, it is also used as a [[thickener]] and [[suspension (chemistry)|suspending]] agent. More recently, it has been used as a [[subdermal filler]] for aesthetic facial surgery (see [[Aquamid]]).

==Uses of polyacrylamide==
One of the largest uses for polyacrylamide is to [[flocculation|flocculate]] solids in a liquid. This process applies to [[water treatment]], and processes like [[paper mill|paper making]] and screen printing.  Polyacrylamide can be supplied in a powder or liquid form, with the liquid form being subcategorized as solution and emulsion polymer.
Even though these products are often called 'polyacrylamide', many are actually [[copolymer]]s of [[acrylamide]] and one or more other chemical species, such as an [[acrylic acid]] or a salt thereof. The main consequence of this is to give the 'modified' polymer a particular [[ionic potential|ionic]] character.

Another common use of polyacrylamide and its derivatives is in subsurface applications such as Enhanced Oil Recovery.  High viscosity aqueous solutions can be generated with low concentrations of polyacrylamide polymers, and these can be injected to improve the economics of conventional waterflooding.

The linear soil conditioning form was developed in the 1950s by [[Monsanto Company]] and was marketed under the trade name [[Krilium]]. The soil conditioning technology was presented at a symposium on "Improvement of Soil Structure" held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on December 29, 1951. The technology was strongly documented and was published in the June 1952 issue of the journal ''Soil Science'', volume 73, June 1952 that was dedicated to polymeric soil conditioners.
 
The original formulation of [[Krilium]] was difficult to use because it contained calcium which cross-linked the linear polymer under field conditions.  Even with a strong marketing campaign, [[Krilium]] was abandoned by Monsanto.
 
After 34 years, the journal ''Soil Science'' wanted to update the soil conditioning technology and published another dedicated issue on polymeric soil conditioner and especially linear, water-soluble, anionic polyacrylamide in the May 1986 issue, volume 141, issue number 5.
 
The Foreword, written by [[Arthur Wallace]] from [[UCLA]] and [[Sheldon D. Nelson]] from [[BYU]] stated in part:
 
The new water-soluble soil conditioners may, if used according to established procedures
 
# increase pore space in soils containing clay
# increase water infiltration into soils containing clay
# prevent soil crusting
# stop erosion and water runoff
# make friable soil that is easy to cultivate
# make soil dry quicker after rain or irrigation, so that the soil can be worked sooner
 
Consequently, these translate into
 
# stronger, larger plants with more extensive root system
# earlier seed emergence and crop maturity
# more efficient water utilization
# easier weed removal
# more response to fertilizers and to new crop varieties 
# less plant diseases related to poor soil aeration
# decreased energy requirement for tillage
 
The cross-linked form which retains water is often used for horticultural and agricultural under trade names such as Broadleaf P4, Swell-Gel, and so on.

The anionic form of linear, water soluble polyacrylamide is frequently used as a soil conditioner on farm land and [[construction sites]] for [[erosion control]], in order to protect the [[water quality]] of nearby [[rivers]] and streams.&lt;ref&gt;Construction Contract Standards [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/oe/construction_contract_standards/std_specs/2010_StdSpecs/2010_StdSpecs.pdf] "Standard Specifications State of California"&lt;/ref&gt;

The polymer is also used to make Gro-Beast toys, which expand when placed in water, such as the [[Test Tube Aliens]]. Similarly, the absorbent properties of one of its copolymers can be utilized as an additive in body-powder.

The ionic form of polyacrylamide has found an important role in the potable [[water industry|water treatment industry]]. Trivalent metal salts, like [[ferric chloride]] and [[aluminum chloride]], are bridged by the long polymer chains of polyacrylamide. This results in significant enhancement of the [[flocculation]] rate.  This allows [[water purification|water treatment]] plants to greatly improve the removal of total organic content (TOC) from raw water.

Polyacrylamide is also often used in molecular biology applications as a medium for electrophoresis of proteins and nucleic acids in a technique known as [[PAGE]].

It was also used in the synthesis of the first [[Constant Viscosity Elastic (Boger) Fluids|Boger fluid]].

===Soil conditioner===

The primary functions of polyacrylamide soil conditioners are to increase soil tilth, aeration, and porosity and reduce compaction, dustiness and water run-off.  Secondary functions are to increase plant vigor, color, appearance, rooting depth and emergence of seeds while decreasing water requirements, diseases, erosion and maintenance expenses.   FC 2712 is used for this purpose.

== Stability ==
In dilute aqueous solution, such as is commonly used for [[Enhanced Oil Recovery]] applications, polyacrylamide polymers are susceptible to chemical, thermal, and mechanical degradation.  Chemical degradation occurs when the labile amide moiety hydrolyzes at elevated temperature or pH, resulting in the evolution of ammonia and a remaining carboxyl group.  Thus, the degree of anionicity of the molecule increases.  Thermal degradation of the vinyl backbone can occur through several possible radical mechanisms, including the autooxidation of small amounts of iron and reactions between oxygen and residual impurities from polymerization at elevated temperature.  Mechanical degradation can also be an issue at the high shear rates experienced in the near-wellbore region.

==Environmental effects==

Concerns have been raised that polyacrylamide used in agriculture may contaminate food with [[acrylamide]], a known [[neurotoxin]] and [[carcinogen]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-139/pdfs/2011-139.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. While polyacrylamide itself is relatively non-toxic, it is known that commercially available polyacrylamide contains minute residual amounts of acrylamide remaining from its production, usually less than 0.05% [[Weight percent#Mass percentage .28fraction.29|w/w]].&lt;ref&gt;

Additionally, there are concerns that polyacrylamide may de-polymerise to form acrylamide. In a study conducted in 2003 at the [[Central Science Laboratory]] in [[Sand Hutton]], [[England]], polyacrylamide was treated similarly as food during cooking. It was shown that these conditions do not cause polyacrylamide to de-polymerise significantly.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Portoscuso Wind Farm''' is a proposed wind power project in [[Portoscuso]], [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]]. It will have 39 individual [[wind turbine]]s with a nominal output of around 2.3 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] each which will deliver up to 90 MW of power, enough to power over 70,000 homes, with a capital investment required of approximately €100 million. The wind farm will have an electricity production of 185 GWh per year that will save the emission of 130,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE70D0ZA20110114|title=Enel Green Power to build 90 MW wind farm in Italy|publisher=''Reuters''|accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyridinium ''p''-toluenesulfonate''' ('''PPTS''') is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[pyridine]] and [[p-Toluenesulfonic acid|''p''-toluenesulfonic acid]]. It is a colourless solid.

== Uses ==
In [[organic synthesis]], PPTS is used as a weakly acidic [[catalyst]], providing an organic soluble source of pyridinium (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions. For example, PPTS is used to deprotect [[silyl|silyl ethers]] or [[Tetrahydropyran|tetrahydropyranyl ethers]] when a substrate is unstable to stronger acid catalysts.  It is also a commonly used catalyst for the preparation of [[Acetal|acetals]] and [[Ketal|ketals]] from aldehydes and ketones.

In [[chemistry]], a '''pyrophosphate''' is a [[phosphorus]] [[oxyanion]]. Compounds such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ester]]s are also called pyrophosphates. The group is also called '''diphosphate''' or '''dipolyphosphate''', although this should not be confused with [[phosphate]]s. As a [[food additive]], diphosphates are known as '''E450'''. A number of hydrogen pyrophosphates also exist, such as Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the normal pyrophosphates.

== Chemistry ==
Pyrophosphates were originally prepared by heating phosphates (''pyro'' from the Greek, meaning "fire"). They generally exhibit the highest solubilities among the phosphates;&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phosphate?topic=49557 ''Phosphate''. Encyclopedia of Earth. Topic ed. Andy Jorgensen. Ed.-in-Chief C.J.Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; moreover, they are good complexing agents for metal ions (such as calcium and many transition metals) and have many uses in industrial chemistry.  Pyrophosphate is the first member of an entire series of [[polyphosphate]]s.

The term pyrophosphate is also the name of [[ester]]s formed by the [[condensation reaction|condensation]] of a phosphorylated biological compound with inorganic phosphate, as for [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]]. This bond is also referred to as a [[high-energy phosphate]] bond.

The synthesis of [[tetraethyl pyrophosphate]] was first described in 1854 by [[Philippe de Clermont]] at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences.

== In biochemistry ==
Pyrophosphates are very important in biochemistry. The anion {{chem|P|2|O|7|4−}} is abbreviated '''PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' and is formed by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] into [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] in [[Cell (biology)|cells]].
:ATP → [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]] + PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

For example, when a nucleotide is incorporated into a growing [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] strand by a [[polymerase]], pyrophosphate (PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is released. Pyrophosphorolysis is the reverse of the [[polymerization]] reaction in which pyrophosphate reacts with the 3′-nucleosidemonophosphate ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleoside_triphosphate NMP] or dNMP), which is removed from the [[oligonucleotide]] to release the corresponding triphosphate (dNTP from DNA, or NTP from RNA).

The pyrophosphate anion has the structure {{chem|P|2|O|7|4−}}, and is an [[acid anhydride]] of [[phosphate]]. It is unstable in [[aqueous solution]] and [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]]s into inorganic phosphate:
:{{chem|P|2|O|7|4−}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 {{chem|HPO|4|2−}}
or in biologists' shorthand notation:
:PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

In the absence of enzymic catalysis, hydrolysis reactions of simple polyphosphates such as pyrophosphate, linear triphosphate, [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and ATP normally proceed extremely slowly in all but highly acidic media.&lt;ref name="Wazer"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Van Wazer JR, Griffith EJ, McCullough JF |title=Structure and Properties of the Condensed Phosphates. VII. Hydrolytic Degradation of Pyro- and Tripolyphosphate |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |date=Jan 1955 |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=287–291  |pmid= |doi=10.1021/ja01607a011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

(The reverse of this reaction is a method of preparing pyrophosphates by heating phosphates.)

This hydrolysis to inorganic phosphate effectively renders the cleavage of ATP to AMP and PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [[hydrolysis|irreversible]], and biochemical reactions coupled to this hydrolysis are irreversible as well.

PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in [[synovial fluid]], [[blood plasma]], and [[urine]] at levels sufficient to block [[calcification]] and may be a natural inhibitor of [[hydroxyapatite]] formation in [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF).&lt;ref name=Ho&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Ho AM, Johnson MD, Kingsley DM |title=Role of the mouse ank gene in control of tissue calcification and arthritis |journal=Science |date=Jul 2000 |volume=289 |issue=5477 |pages=265–70 |pmid=10894769 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5477.265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells may channel intracellular PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; into ECF.&lt;ref name=Rutsch&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Rutsch F, Vaingankar S, Johnson K, Goldfine I, Maddux B, Schauerte P, Kalhoff H, Sano K, Boisvert WA, Superti-Furga A, Terkeltaub R |title=PC-1 nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase deficiency in idiopathic infantile arterial calcification |journal=Am J Pathol |date=Feb 2001 |volume=158 |issue=2 |pages=543–54 |pmid=11159191 |pmc=1850320 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63996-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ANKH|ANK]] is a nonenzymatic plasma-membrane PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; channel that supports extracellular PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; levels.&lt;ref name=Rutsch/&gt; Defective function of the membrane PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; channel ANK is associated with low extracellular PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and elevated intracellular PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ho/&gt; [[Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1|Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase]] (ENPP) may function to raise extracellular PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rutsch/&gt;

From the standpoint of [[high energy phosphate]] accounting, the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; requires two high-energy phosphates, as to reconstitute AMP into ATP requires two [[phosphorylation]] reactions.
:AMP + ATP → 2 [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]
:2 ADP + 2 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 ATP

The plasma concentration of inorganic pyrophosphate has a reference range of 0.58–3.78&amp;nbsp;µ[[Mole (unit)|M]] (95% prediction interval).&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Ryan LM, Kozin F, McCarty DJ |title=Quantification of human plasma inorganic pyrophosphate.

'''Pyrotechnics''' is the science of using materials capable of undergoing self-contained and self-sustained [[exothermic]] chemical reactions for the production of heat, light, gas, smoke and/or sound. Its [[etymology]] stems from the Greek words ''pyro'' ("fire") and ''tekhnikos'' ("made by art").&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pyrotechnics Pyrotechnics | Define Pyrotechnics at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrotechnics include not only the manufacture of [[fireworks]] but items such as [[safety matches]], oxygen candles, [[Pyrotechnic fastener|explosive bolts and fasteners]], components of the automotive [[airbag]] and gas pressure blasting in mining, quarrying and demolition.

Individuals responsible for the safe storage, handling, and functioning of pyrotechnic devices are referred to as [[pyrotechnician]]s.

==Proximate pyrotechnics==
Explosions, flashes, smoke, flames, fireworks or other pyrotechnic driven effects used in the entertainment industry are referred to as theatrical special effects, special effects, or proximate pyrotechnics. Proximate refers to the pyrotechnic device's location relative to an audience. In the majority of jurisdictions, special training and licensing must be obtained from local authorities to legally prepare and use proximate pyrotechnics.

[[Image:Rammstein-flamethrowers.jpg|thumb|[[Rammstein]] uses pyrotechnics numerous times in their shows, such as this performance of [[Feuer Frei]].]]
[[Image:Stunt Pyrotechnics Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|upright|Pyrotechnics [[stunt]] exhibition by "Giant Auto Rodéo", [[Ciney]], [[Belgium]]]]
Many musical groups use pyrotechnics to enhance their live shows. [[Pink Floyd]] were innovators of pyrotechnic use in concerts. For instance, at the climax of their song "[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]", a blast of smoke was set off at the back of the stage. Bands such as [[The Who]], [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and [[Queen (band)#Live performances|Queen]] soon followed with use of pyrotechnics in their shows. [[Michael Jackson]] attempted using pyrotechnics in a 1984 Pepsi advertisement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/27/newsid_4046000/4046605.stm BBC ON THIS DAY | 27 | 1984: Michael Jackson burned in Pepsi ad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; where a stray spark caused a small fire in his hair. German industrial metal band [[Rammstein]] are renowned for their incorporation of a large variety of pyrotechnics into performances, which range from flaming costumes to face-mounted flamethrowers. [[Nightwish]], [[Lordi]] and [[Green Day]] are also known for their vivid pyrotechnics in concert. Many professional wrestlers have also used pyrotechnics as part of their entrances to the ring.

Modern pyrotechnics are, in general, divided into categories based upon the type of effect produced or manufacturing method. The most common categories are:

*Airburst - Hanging charges designed to burst into spheres of sparks.
*Binary powders - Kits divided into separate oxidizer and fuel, intended to be mixed on site.
*Comet (meteor) - Brightly colored burning pellets resembling shooting stars.
*Mine - Tubes containing a lift charge intended to project stars, sparks, confetti or streamers.
*Preloaded Smoke Pot - Cartridges designed to release a mushroom cloud of smoke.
*Concussion (cannon simulator,concussion tube) - Device designed to create a loud report.
*Falls - Propellant with titanium burning in an open ended tube creating a falling spark effect.
*Fireballs / Mortar Hits - Short barreled device projecting smoky rolling ball of flame.
*Flame Projector - Tube containing nitrocellulose granules that burn in pillars of colored flame.
*[[Flare|Flare (Torch)]] - Short, high intensity flames or various colours.
*Flash Cotton (Sparkle String) - Nitrated cotton string(nitrocellulose).
*Flashpaper - Sheets of nitrated paper (nitrocellulose) resembling tissue paper.
*Flash Pot - Short metal pot used with binary powders creating flash, smoke or sparks.
*[[Flash Tray]] (split mine) - A long tube slit down one side to project a sheet of flash.
*[[Gerb (pyrotechnic)|Gerb (including fountain, whistle, and waterfall)]] - A fountain of sparks.
*Lance - A Small colored flare tube used in making points of light lancework or pictures in fire.
*Line Rockets - Whistling or colored rocket devices that travel along guide cables.
*Multi-Tube Article (multi-shot plate, multiple shot repeater boards and bombardo boards; designed to function in sequence) - Multiple effects chained together.
*Pre-Mixed Powder - Powders intended to create various effects. (Concussions, flashes, etc.)
*[[Squib (explosive)|Squib]] - A small electrically initiated device replicating bullet hits.
*[[Strobe]] - A brightly colored magnesium fueled flare blinking with repetitive flashes.
*[[Saxon (firework)|Wheel (Saxon)]] - Tubes that create a spinning wheel of sparks.

[[Image:Gerb Schematic.JPG|thumb|left|A basic pyrotechnic device.]]
A basic theatrical effect, designed to create a jet or fountain of sparks, is referred to as a gerb. A gerb consists of a sufficiently strong and non-flammable container to hold the pyrotechnic compound. Typical pyrotechnic formulations consist either of flammable materials such as nitrocellulose and/or black powder or a mixture of a fuel and [[oxidizer]] blended in situ. A plug placed at one end of the container with a small orifice, called a choke, constricts the expulsion of the ignited pyrotechnic compound, increasing the size and aggressiveness of the jet.
[[Image:Jeff-Hardy-&amp;-Triple-H on Stage,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007.jpg|right|thumb|Pyrotechnics are widely used in [[professional wrestling]], including the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]], to enhance the event.]]

Various ingredients may be added to pyrotechnic devices to provide colour, smoke, noise or sparks. Special additives and construction methods are used to modify the character of the effect produced, either to enhance or subdue the effect; for example, sandwiching layers of pyrotechnic compounds containing potassium perchlorate, sodium salicylate or sodium benzoate with layers that do not creates a fountain of sparks with an undulating whistle.

In general, such pyrotechnic devices are initiated by a remotely controlled electrical signal that causes an [[electric match]], or e-match, to produce ignition. The remote control may be manual, via a switch console, or computer controlled according to a pre-programmed sequence and/or a sequence that tracks the live performance via stage cues.

==Display pyrotechnics==
{{Main|Firework}}
[[File:NYE melb 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The 2008-09 Melbourne NYE fireworks, as seen from [[Alexandra Gardens, Melbourne|Alexandra Gardens]]]]

Display pyrotechnics, also known as commercial fireworks, are pyrotechnic devices intended for use outdoors, where the audience can be further away, and smoke and fallout is less of a concern. Generally the effects, though often similar to proximate pyrotechnics, are of a larger size and more vigorous in nature. It will typically take an entire day to set up a professional fireworks display. The size of these fireworks can range from 50&amp;nbsp;mm (2") to over 600&amp;nbsp;mm (24") diameter depending on the type of effect and available distance from the audience. In most jurisdictions, special fireworks training and licensing must be obtained from local authorities to legally prepare and use display pyrotechnics.

==Consumer pyrotechnics==
Consumer pyrotechnics are devices readily available for purchase to the [[general public]] with little or no special licensing or training. These items are considered ''relatively'' low hazard devices but, like all pyrotechnics, can still be hazardous and should be stored, handled and used appropriately. Some of the most common examples of consumer pyrotechnics encountered include recreational [[fireworks]] (including whistling and sparking types), [[model rocket#Motors|model rocket motors]], highway and marine distress [[flares]], [[sparklers]] and caps for toy guns. Pyrotechnics are also indirectly involved in other consumer products such as powder actuated [[nail gun]]s, [[ammunition]] for [[firearms]], and modern [[fireplaces]]. Some types, including [[bird scarer]]s, shell crackers, whistle crackers and flares, may be designed to be fired from a [[12-gauge]] pistol or rifle.

==Safety==
Pyrotechnics are dangerous and must be handled and used properly. Recently, several high-profile incidents involving pyrotechnics have re-enforced the need to respect these explosives at all times{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Proximate pyrotechnics is an area of expertise that requires additional training beyond that of other professional pyrotechnics areas and the use of devices specifically manufactured for indoor, close proximity use.

===Homemade devices===

[[Image:Hazardous Homemade Pyrotechnic Flash Pot.jpg|thumb|200px|Homemade flashpots built without any safety mechanisms]]
A common low-budget pyrotechnic flash pot is built using modified screw-in electric fuses in a common light fixture. The fuses are intentionally blown, acting as ignitors for a pyrotechnic material.

Homemade devices may fail to include safety features and can provide numerous hazards, including:

*A firing circuit using high-power, non-isolated AC line voltage can be a shock hazard to the operator and bystanders.
*The use of high-current fuses as ignitors can cause main circuit breakers and fuses to trip, due to the sudden inrush of hundreds of amperes through a dead-shorted circuit. Switches used to control ignition may be damaged from the high-current surges.
*There may not be indicators or interlocks preventing premature ignition of the pyrotechnic material. Screwing a powder-loaded fuse into an unknowingly powered socket will result in immediate ignition, injuring the operator.

Commercial flash pots include safety features such as warning pilot lamps, preignition grounding, and safing circuits. They also use isolated and low-voltage power sources, and have keyed power connections to help prevent accidental ignition.

==Pyrotechnic incidents==
{{Main|Pyrotechnic incidents}}
[[File:My Chemical Romance fire.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[My Chemical Romance]] performing live with pyrotechnics, on the stage]]

Pyrotechnics can be dangerous substances that must always be treated with the utmost respect and with the proper training. Due to the hazardous nature of these materials, precautions must always be taken to ensure the safety of all individuals in the vicinity of pyrotechnics. Despite all precautions, accidents and errors occur from time to time, which may result in property damage, injury and in severe cases loss of life. These incidents may be the result of poorly manufactured product, unexpected or unforeseen events, or in many cases, the result of operator error.

Some of the more widely publicized incidents involving pyrotechnics in recent history include:

At [[Olympic Stadium]] in Montreal during the [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour]] on August 8, 1992, [[Metallica]] frontman [[James Hetfield]] was the victim of a severe pyrotechnics accident during the song "Fade to Black", in which a pyrotechnic charge exploded. Hetfield's guitar protected him from the full force of the blast; however, the fire engulfed his left side, burning his hand, arm, eyebrows, face and hair. He suffered second and third-degree burns, but was back on stage 17 days later.

In 2003, improper use of pyrotechnics caused a fire in a [[Rhode Island]] nightclub called The Station. [[The Station nightclub fire]] was started when fireworks used by the band [[Great White]] accidentally ignited flammable soundproofing foam. The pyrotechnics in question were not appropriate. The foam caused combustion to spread rapidly and the resulting fire led to 100 deaths, apparently because their quick escape was blocked by ineffective exit doors. While the type of foam used and the lack of a sprinkler system were important factors in the fire,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/ncst/upload/Vol_I_NCSTAR2.pdf Nist.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622110448/https://www.nist.gov/ncst/upload/Vol_I_NCSTAR2.pdf |date=June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Great White fire could likely have been prevented had those involved paid attention to standard safety practices around the use of pyrotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/pdf/1126.PDF NFPA.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318065736/http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files/pdf/1126.PDF |date=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar pyrotechnic-induced fire in 2004 destroyed the [[Republica Cromagnon]] nightclub in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]], killing 194 people.

In May 2000, a small fire led to [[Enschede fireworks disaster|two massive explosions]] at the SE Fireworks Depot in [[Enschede]], the [[Netherlands]], leaving 23 people dead, 947 people injured, and an estimated 2,000 homes damaged or destroyed.

In March 2008, A Pyrotechnic lead cable snapped during the end of the show pyrotechnics, causing some minor burns and injuries to the crowd at [[WWE]] [[Wrestlemania 24]] leading to a big investigation.

In February 2010, a pyrotechnic flame engulfed [[WWE]] wrestler [[The Undertaker|Mark Calaway]]. He was seen with multiple burns throughout the show.

In July 2012, a [[WWE RAW]] pyrotechnic rehearsal caused a small fire on the led wall before doors opened. Crews put it out before it could get any bigger. No one was injured but the doors were opened thirty minutes late.

On January 27, 2013, at the "Kiss" nightclub in Santa Maria, Brazil, an accident due to the use of pyrotechnics by the performing live show band caused a fire which resulted in the deaths of at least 236 people, while dozens suffered serious injuries from the fire and smoke inhalation.

In January 2015 a fireworks factory in Granada, Colombia exploded injuring one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-30690377|title=Fireworks factory explodes in Colombia|work=BBC|date=5 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2015 Michael Clifford of [[5 Seconds of Summer]] suffered face, hair, and shoulder injuries from a pyrotechnics accident on the Rock Out With Your Socks Out tour at the [[Wembley Arena|SSE Wembley Arena]], [[London]]. Calum Hood suffered a minor burn on his arm in the incident.

On October 30, 2015, at the [[Colectiv nightclub fire|Colectiv]] nightclub in [[Bucharest, Romania]], pyrotechnics used by the band [[Goodbye to Gravity]] accidentally ignited soundproofing foam on a pillow. The fire quickly spread onto the ceiling and the rest of the club. This led to the death of 64 people and injured approximately 200 others. Four members of [[Goodbye to Gravity]]  lost their lives, and only their soloist survived. It remains the worst night club fire in Romania's history.

[[File:Resistograph (Foto).jpg|alt=Rinntech Resistograph|thumb|Rinntech Resistograph for wood density analysis]]
'''Resistograph''' is an electronic [[high-resolution]] needle drill resistance measurement device, developed by Frank Rinn (since 1986 in [[Heidelberg, Germany]]).

A thin, long needle is driven into the wood. The electric [[power consumption]] of the drilling device is measured, recorded and printed. Resistograph devices are different from other resistance [[drills]] because they provide a high [[linear correlation]] between the measured values and the [[density]] of the penetrated wood. They are used for inspecting trees and [[timber]] in order to find internal defects, and to determine wood density and growth rates.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Image:Glare honeycomb.jpg|thumb|400px|Composite sandwich structure panel used for testing at NASA]]
{{Continuum mechanics|cTopic=[[Solid mechanics]]}}
'''Sandwich theory'''&lt;ref name=Plantema&gt;Plantema, F, J., 1966, '''Sandwich Construction: The Bending and Buckling of Sandwich Beams, Plates, and Shells''', Jon Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zenkert&gt;Zenkert, D., 1995, '''An Introduction to Sandwich Construction''', Engineering Materials Advisory Services Ltd, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the behaviour of a [[beam theory|beam]], [[plate theory|plate]], or [[Theory of plates and shells|shell]] which consists of three layers—two facesheets and one core.  The most commonly used sandwich theory is [[linear]] and is an extension of first order [[beam theory]].  Linear sandwich theory is of importance for the design and analysis of [[Sandwich Panel|sandwich panels]], which are of use in building construction, vehicle construction, airplane construction and refrigeration engineering.

Some advantages of sandwich construction are:
* Sandwich cross sections are [[Composite material|composite]]. They usually consist of a low to moderate [[stiffness]] core which is connected with two stiff exterior face-sheets.  The composite has a considerably higher shear stiffness to weight ratio than an equivalent beam made of only the core material or the face-sheet material.  The composite also has a high tensile strength to weight ratio.
* The high stiffness of the face-sheet leads to a high [[bending|bending stiffness]] to weight ratio for the composite.

The behavior of a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] with sandwich cross-section under a load differs from a beam with a constant [[linear elasticity|elastic]] cross section.  If the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] during bending is large compared to the thickness of the sandwich beam and the strains in the component materials are small, the [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of a sandwich composite beam can be separated into two parts
* deformations due to bending moments or bending deformation, and
* deformations due to transverse forces, also called shear deformation.

Sandwich beam, [[plate theory|plate]], and [[Theory of plates and shells|shell]] theories usually assume that the reference stress state is one of zero stress.  However, during curing, differences of temperature between the face-sheets persist because of the thermal separation by the core material. These temperature differences, coupled with different linear expansions of the face-sheets, can lead to a bending of the sandwich beam in the direction of the warmer face-sheet.  If the bending is constrained during the manufacturing process, [[residual stress]]es can develop in the components of a sandwich composite.  The [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of a reference stress state on the solutions provided by sandwich theory is possible when the problem is [[linear]].  However, when large elastic deformations and rotations are expected, the initial stress state has to be incorporated directly into the sandwich theory.

==Engineering sandwich beam theory==
[[Image:SandwichBendEng.svg|thumb|450px|Bending of a sandwich beam without extra deformation due to core shear.]]
In the engineering theory of sandwich beams,&lt;ref name=Zenkert/&gt; the axial strain is assumed to vary linearly over the cross-section of the beam as in [[beam theory|Euler-Bernoulli theory]], i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{xx}(x,z) = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the axial stress in the sandwich beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}(x,z) = -z~E(z)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;E(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Young's modulus]] which is a function of the location along the thickness of the beam.  The [[bending moment]] in the beam is then given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_x(x) = \int\int z~\sigma_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y = -\left(\int\int z^2 E(z)~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =: -D~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
The quantity &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''' flexural stiffness''' of the sandwich beam.  The [[shear force]] &lt;math&gt;Q_x&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    Q_x = \frac{\mathrm{d} M_x}{\mathrm{d} x}~.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using these relations, we can show that the stresses in a sandwich beam with a core of thickness &lt;math&gt;2h&lt;/math&gt; and modulus &lt;math&gt;E^c&lt;/math&gt; and two facesheets each of thickness &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and modulus &lt;math&gt;E^f&lt;/math&gt;, are given by
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:650px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; = \cfrac{z E^{\mathrm{f}} M_x}{D} ~;~~ &amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; = \cfrac{z E^{\mathrm{c}} M_x}{D} \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; = \cfrac{Q_x E^{\mathrm{f}}}{2D}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] ~;~~ &amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; = \cfrac{Q_x}{2D}\left[ E^{\mathrm{c}}\left(h^2-z^2\right) + E^{\mathrm{f}} f(f+2h)\right]
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

!Derivation of engineering sandwich beam stresses
|-
|Since
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{d^2 w}{d x^2}= -\cfrac{M_x(x)}{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
we can write the axial stress as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_{xx}(x,z) = \cfrac{z~E(z)~M_x(x)}{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
The equation of equilibrium for a two-dimensional solid is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \tau_{xz}}{\partial z} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xz}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear stress]].  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_{xz}(x,z) = \int \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
       = \int \cfrac{z~E(z)}{D}~\frac{\mathrm{d} M_{x}}{\mathrm{d} x}~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of integration.  
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_{xz}(x,z) = \cfrac{Q_x}{D}\int z~E(z)~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
Let us assume that there are no shear tractions applied to the top face of the sandwich beam.  The shear stress in the top facesheet is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau^{\mathrm{face}}_{xz}(x,z) = \cfrac{Q_xE^f}{D}\int_z^{h+f} z~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
                  = \cfrac{Q_x E^f}{2D}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
At &lt;math&gt;z = h+f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{xz}(x,h+f) = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;C(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the shear stress at the top of the core, &lt;math&gt;z = h&lt;/math&gt;, is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau_{xz}(x,h) = \cfrac{Q_x E^f f(f+2h)}{2D}
&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the shear stress in the core can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau^{\mathrm{core}}_{xz}(x,z) = \cfrac{Q_xE^c}{D}\int_z^{h} z~\mathrm{d}z + C(x)
                  = \cfrac{Q_x E^c}{2D}\left(h^2-z^2\right) + C(x)
&lt;/math&gt;
The integration constant &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is determined from the continuity of shear stress at the interface of the core and the facesheet.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   C(x) =  \cfrac{Q_x E^f f(f+2h)}{2D}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \tau^{\mathrm{core}}_{xz}(x,z) 
                  = \cfrac{Q_x}{2D}\left[ E^c\left(h^2-z^2\right) + E^f f(f+2h)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
|}
For a sandwich beam with identical facesheets and unit width, the value of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   D &amp; = E^f\int_w\int_{-h-f}^{-h} z^2~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y + E^c\int_w\int_{-h}^{h} z^2~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y + 
     E^f\int_w\int_{h}^{h+f} z^2~\mathrm{d}z\,\mathrm{d}y  \\
     &amp; = \frac{2}{3}E^ff^3 + \frac{2}{3}E^ch^3 + 2E^ffh(f+h)~.
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;E^f \gg E^c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated as
:&lt;math&gt;
   D \approx \frac{2}{3}E^ff^3 + 2E^ffh(f+h) = 2fE^f\left(\frac{1}{3}f^2+h(f+h)\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the stresses in the sandwich beam can be approximated as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{z M_x}{\frac{2}{3}f^3 +2fh(f+h)} ~;~~ &amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx 0 \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{\frac{4}{3}f^3+4fh(f+h)}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] ~;~~ &amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x(f+2h)}{\frac{2}{3}f^2+h(f+h)}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If, in addition, &lt;math&gt;f \ll 2h&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;
   D \approx 2E^ffh(f+h)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the approximate stresses in the beam are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{zM_x}{2fh(f+h)} ~;~~&amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx 0 \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{4fh(f+h)}\left[(h+f)^2-z^2\right] ~;~~&amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x(f+2h)}{4h(f+h)} \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{2h}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
If we assume that the facesheets are thin enough that the stresses may be assumed to be constant through the thickness, we have the approximation
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx \pm \cfrac{M_x}{2fh} ~;~~&amp;
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx 0 \\
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{f}} &amp; \approx 0 ~;~~ &amp;
     \tau_{xz}^{\mathrm{c}} &amp; \approx \cfrac{Q_x}{2h}
   \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hence the problem can be split into two parts, one involving only core shear and the other involving only bending stresses in the facesheets.

== Linear sandwich theory ==

=== Bending of a sandwich beam with thin facesheets ===
[[Image:SandwichBendInit.svg|thumb|450px|Bending of a sandwich beam after incorporating shear of the core into the deformation.]]
The main assumptions of linear sandwich theories of beams with thin facesheets are:
* the transverse normal stiffness of the core is infinite, i.e., the core thickness in the z-direction does not change during bending
* the in-plane normal stiffness of the core is small compared to that of the facesheets, i.e., the core does not lengthen or compress in the x-direction
* the facesheets behave according to the [[Beam theory|Euler-Bernoulli]] assumptions, i.e., there is no xz-shear in the facesheets and the z-direction thickness of the facesheets does not change
However, the xz shear-stresses in the core are not neglected.

==== Constitutive assumptions ====
The constitutive relations for two-dimensional orthotropic [[linear elasticity|linear elastic]] materials are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{xx} \\ \sigma_{zz} \\ \sigma_{zx} \end{bmatrix} = 
   \begin{bmatrix} C_{11} &amp; C_{13} &amp; 0 \\ C_{13} &amp; C_{33} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{55} \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{xx} \\ \varepsilon_{zz} \\ \varepsilon_{zx} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The assumptions of sandwich theory lead to the simplified relations
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} = C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} ~;~~
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\varepsilon_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} ~;~~
   \sigma_{zz}^{\mathrm{face}} = \sigma_{xz}^{\mathrm{face}} = 0 ~;~~ \sigma_{zz}^{\mathrm{core}} = \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{core}} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{zz}^{\mathrm{face}} = \varepsilon_{xz}^{\mathrm{face}} = 0 ~;~~ \varepsilon_{zz}^{\mathrm{core}} = \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{core}} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;

The equilibrium equations in two dimensions are
:&lt;math&gt;
      \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{xx}}{\partial x} + \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{zx}}{\partial z} = 0 ~;~~
      \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{zx}}{\partial x} + \cfrac{\partial \sigma_{zz}}{\partial z} = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
The assumptions for a sandwich beam and the equilibrium equation imply that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} \equiv \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}(z) ~;~~
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \mathrm{constant}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, for homogeneous facesheets and core, the strains also have the form
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} \equiv \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}(z) ~;~~
   \varepsilon_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \mathrm{constant}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Kinematics ====
[[Image:SandwichBend.svg|thumb|450px|Bending of a sandwich beam. The total deflection is the sum of a bending part w&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; and a shear part w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;]]
[[Image:SandwichBendInPlane.svg|thumb|450px|Shear strains during the bending of a sandwich beam.]]

Let the sandwich beam be subjected to a bending moment &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and a shear force &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Let the total deflection of the beam due to these loads be &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;.  The adjacent figure shows that, for small displacements, the total deflection of the mid-surface of the beam can be expressed as the sum of two deflections, a pure bending deflection &lt;math&gt;w_b&lt;/math&gt; and a pure shear deflection &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  w(x) = w_b(x) + w_s(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

From the geometry of the deformation we observe that the engineering shear strain (&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) in the core is related the effective shear strain in the composite by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
   \gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \tfrac{2h + f}{2h}~\gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{beam}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Note the shear strain in the core is larger than the effective shear strain in the composite and that small deformations (&lt;math&gt;\tan \gamma = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;) are assumed in deriving the above relation.  The effective shear strain in the beam is related to the shear displacement by the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
    \gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{beam}} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;

The facesheets are assumed to deform in accordance with the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.  The total deflection of the facesheets is assumed to be the superposition of the deflections due to bending and that due to core shear.   The &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-direction displacements of the facesheets due to bending are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   u_b^{\mathrm{face}}(x,z) = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_b}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The displacement of the top facesheet due to shear in the core is
:&lt;math&gt;
   u_s^{\mathrm{topface}}(x,z) = -\left(z - h - \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
and that of the bottom facesheet is
:&lt;math&gt;
   u_s^{\mathrm{botface}}(x,z) = -\left(z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The normal strains in the two facesheets are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \varepsilon_{xx} = \cfrac{\partial u_b}{\partial x} + \cfrac{\partial u_s}{\partial x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
     \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{topface}}  = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z - h - \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} ~;~~
     \varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{botface}}  = -z~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Stress-displacement relations ====
The shear stress in the core is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = C^{\mathrm{core}}_{55}~\varepsilon_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \cfrac{C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}}{2}~\gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \tfrac{2h + f}{4h}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\gamma_{zx}^{\mathrm{beam}} 
&lt;/math&gt;
or,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:250px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \tfrac{2h + f}{4h}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The normal stresses in the facesheets are given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} = C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\varepsilon_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:800px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{topface}} &amp; = -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z - h - \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} 
     &amp; = &amp; -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \left(\tfrac{2h+f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\\
     \sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{botface}} &amp; = -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} -\left(z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} 
     &amp; = &amp; -z~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(\tfrac{2h+f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Resultant forces and moments ====
The resultant normal force in a face sheet is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   N^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx} := \int_{-f/2}^{f/2} \sigma^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z_f
 &lt;/math&gt;
and the resultant moments are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx} := \int_{-f/2}^{f/2} z_f~\sigma^{\mathrm{face}}_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z_f 
 &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
   z_f^{\mathrm{topface}} := z - h - \tfrac{f}{2} ~;~~ z_f^{\mathrm{botface}} := z + h + \tfrac{f}{2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Using the expressions for the normal stress in the two facesheets gives
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:600px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   N^{\mathrm{topface}}_{xx} &amp; = -f\left(h + \tfrac{f}{2}\right)~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} = - N^{\mathrm{botface}}_{xx} \\
   M^{\mathrm{topface}}_{xx} &amp; = -\cfrac{f^3~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{12}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\right) = -\cfrac{f^3~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{12}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} = M^{\mathrm{botface}}_{xx} 
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the core, the resultant moment is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M^{\mathrm{core}}_{xx} := \int_{-h}^{h} z~\sigma^{\mathrm{core}}_{xx}~\mathrm{d}z = 0
 &lt;/math&gt;
The total bending moment in the beam is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = N_{xx}^{\mathrm{topface}}~(2h+f) + 2~M^{\mathrm{topface}}_{xx}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:450px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = -\cfrac{f(2h+f)^2}{2}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \cfrac{f^3}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The shear force &lt;math&gt;Q_x&lt;/math&gt; in the core is defined as
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:400px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_x^{\mathrm{core}} = \kappa\int_{-h}^h \sigma_{xz}~dz = \tfrac{\kappa(2h+f)}{2}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}w_s}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a shear correction coefficient.  The shear force in the facesheets can be computed from the bending moments using the relation
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_x^{\mathrm{face}} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d}M_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
or,
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:250px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_x^{\mathrm{face}} = -\cfrac{f^3~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{12}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For thin facesheets, the shear force in the facesheets is usually ignored.&lt;ref name=Zenkert/&gt;

==== Bending and shear stiffness ====
The bending stiffness of the sandwich beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   D^{\mathrm{beam}} = -M/\tfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d}x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
From the expression for the total bending moment in the beam, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = -\cfrac{f(2h+f)^2}{2}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \cfrac{f^3}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
For small shear deformations, the above expression can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M \approx -\cfrac{f[3(2h+f)^2+f^2]}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the bending stiffness of the sandwich beam (with &lt;math&gt;f \ll 2h&lt;/math&gt;) is given by
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:500px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  D^{\mathrm{beam}} \approx \cfrac{f[3(2h+f)^2+f^2]}{6}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}} \approx  \cfrac{f(2h+f)^2}{2}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and that of the facesheets is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:250px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  D^{\mathrm{face}} = \cfrac{f^3}{12}~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The shear stiffness of the beam is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   S^{\mathrm{beam}} = Q_x/\tfrac{\mathrm{d}w_s}{\mathrm{d}x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the shear stiffness of the beam, which is equal to the shear stiffness of the core, is
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:350px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  S^{\mathrm{beam}} = S^{\mathrm{core}} = \cfrac{\kappa(2h+f)}{2}~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Relation between bending and shear deflections ====
A relation can be obtained between the bending and shear deflections by using the continuity of [[stress (mechanics)|traction]]s between the core and the facesheets.  If we equate the tractions directly we get
:&lt;math&gt;
   n_x~\sigma_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}} = n_z~\sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}}
 &lt;/math&gt;
At both the facesheet-core interfaces &lt;math&gt;n_x = 1&lt;/math&gt; but at the top of the core &lt;math&gt; n_z = 1&lt;/math&gt;  and at the bottom of the core &lt;math&gt;n_z = -1&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, traction continuity at &lt;math&gt; z = \pm h&lt;/math&gt; leads to
:&lt;math&gt;
   2fh~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - (2h+f)~C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} = 4h^2~C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The above relation is rarely used because of the presence of second derivatives of the shear deflection.  Instead it is assumed that 
:&lt;math&gt;
   n_z~\sigma_{zx}^{\mathrm{core}} = \cfrac{\mathrm{d} N_{xx}^{\mathrm{face}}}{\mathrm{d}x}
&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:300px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} = -2fh~\left(\cfrac{C_{11}^{\mathrm{face}}}{C_{55}^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w_b}{\mathrm{d} x^3}
 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Governing equations ====
Using the above definitions, the governing balance equations for the bending moment and shear force are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \begin{align}
   M &amp; = D^{\mathrm{beam}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(D^{\mathrm{beam}}+2D^{\mathrm{face}}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}\\
   Q &amp; = S^{\mathrm{core}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} - 2D^{\mathrm{face}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3}
   \end{align}
 &lt;/math&gt;
We can alternatively express the above as two equations that can be solved for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_s&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} + \left(\cfrac{1}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} x} = \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}} \\
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^3} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x} - \cfrac{1}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}~\cfrac{\mathrm{d} M}{\mathrm{d} x} = -\left(1+\cfrac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\frac{Q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Using the approximations
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q \approx \cfrac{\mathrm{d} M}{\mathrm{d} x} ~;~~ q \approx \cfrac{\mathrm{d} Q}{\mathrm{d} x}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the intensity of the applied load on the beam, we have
&lt;blockquote style="border: 1px solid black; padding:10px; width:550px"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =  \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}- \cfrac{q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}} \\
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w_s}{\mathrm{d} x^3} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d} w_s}{\mathrm{d} x}  = -\left(\cfrac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\frac{Q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Several techniques may be used to solve this system of two coupled ordinary differential equations given the applied load and the applied bending moment and displacement boundary conditions.

==== Temperature dependent alternative form of governing equations ====
Assuming that each partial cross section fulfills [[beam theory|Bernoulli's hypothesis]], the balance of forces and moments on the deformed sandwich beam element can be used to deduce the bending equation for the sandwich beam.

[[Image:Verformung und Schnittgroessen am Sandwichquerschnitt.svg|thumb|300px|Figure 1 - Equilibration of a deflected sandwich beam under temperature load and burden in comparison with the undeflected cross section]]
The stress resultants and the corresponding deformations of the beam and of the cross section can be seen in Figure 1. The following relationships can be derived using the theory of [[linear elasticity]]:&lt;ref&gt;K. Stamm, H. Witte: ''Sandwichkonstruktionen - Berechnung, Fertigung, Ausführung''.

Superposition of the equations for the facesheets and the core leads to the following equations for the total shear force &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and the total bending moment &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{3}
&amp; S^{\mathrm{core}}\gamma - D^{\mathrm{face}} \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^3 w}{\mathrm{d} x^3} = Q            &amp;\quad\quad&amp; (1)\\
&amp; D^{\mathrm{beam}}\left(\cfrac{\mathrm{d} \gamma}{\mathrm{d} x}+\vartheta\right) - \left(D^{\mathrm{beam}}+D^{\mathrm{face}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} = M &amp;\quad\quad&amp; (2)\,
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;
We can alternatively express the above as two equations that can be solved for &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =  \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}-\cfrac{q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}-\vartheta \\
&amp; \left(\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 \gamma}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(1+\frac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\gamma = -\left(\cfrac{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}{D^{\mathrm{face}}}\right)\frac{Q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution approaches ==
[[Image:sandwich bending.jpg|thumb|Shear and bending deformation of a sandwich composite beam.]]
The bending behavior and stresses in a continuous sandwich beam can be computed by solving the two governing differential equations.

=== Analytical approach ===
For simple geometries such as double span beams under uniformly distributed loads, the governing equations can be solved by using appropriate boundary conditions and using the superposition principle. Such results are listed in the standard DIN EN 14509:2006&lt;ref name="EN14509"&gt;EN 14509 (D):''Self-supporting double skin metal faced insulating panels''. November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;(Table E10.1).  Energy methods may also be used to compute solutions directly.

=== Numerical approach ===
The differential equation of sandwich continuous beams can be solved by the use of numerical methods such as [[finite difference method|finite differences]] and [[finite element method|finite elements]].  For finite differences Berner&lt;ref  name=Berner&gt;Klaus Berner: ''Erarbeitung vollständiger Bemessungsgrundlagen im Rahmen bautechnischer Zulassungen für Sandwichbauteile''.Fraunhofer IRB Verlag, Stuttgart 2000 (Teil 1).&lt;/ref&gt;  recommends a two-stage approach.  After solving the differential equation for the normal forces in the cover sheets for a single span beam under a given load, the energy method can be used to expand the approach for the calculation of multi-span beams. Sandwich continuous beam with flexible cover sheets can also be laid on top of each other when using this technique.   However, the cross-section of the beam has to be constant across the spans.

A more specialized approach recommended by Schwarze&lt;ref name="Schwarze"/&gt; involves solving for the homogeneous part of the governing equation exactly and for the particular part approximately.  Recall that the governing equation for a sandwich beam is
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^4 w}{\mathrm{d} x^4} - \left(1+\frac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}\right)\cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2} =  \frac{M}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}}-\cfrac{q}{S^{\mathrm{core}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
If we define
:&lt;math&gt;
   \alpha := \cfrac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{D^{\mathrm{beam}}} ~;~~ \beta := \cfrac{2D^{\mathrm{face}}}{S^{\mathrm{core}}} ~;~~ W(x) :=  \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 w}{\mathrm{d} x^2}
 &lt;/math&gt;
we get
:&lt;math&gt;
 \cfrac{\mathrm{d}^2 W}{\mathrm{d} x^2} - \left(\cfrac{1+\alpha}{\beta}\right)~W  =  \frac{M}{\beta D^{\mathrm{beam}}} - \cfrac{q}{D^{\mathrm{face}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Schwarze uses the general solution for the homogeneous part of the above equation and a polynomial approximation for the particular solution for sections of a sandwich beam.   Interfaces between sections are tied together by matching boundary conditions.  This approach has been used in the [[Open Source|open source]] code [http://www.swe2.com swe2].

== Practical Importance ==
Results predicted by linear sandwich theory correlate well with the experimentally determined results.  The theory is used as a basis for the [[structural analysis|structural report]] which is needed for the construction of large industrial and commercial buildings which are clad with [[Sandwich Panel|sandwich panels]] . Its use is explicitly demanded for approvals and in the relevant engineering standards.&lt;ref name="EN14509"/&gt;

'''Sawdust''' or '''wood dust''' is a by-product or waste product of woodworking operations such as sawing, milling, planing, routing, drilling and sanding. It is composed of fine particles of wood. These operations can be performed by woodworking machinery, portable power tools or by use of hand tools.  Wood dust is also the byproduct of certain animals, birds and insects which live in wood, such as the [[woodpecker]] and [[carpenter ant]]. In some manufacturing industries it can be a significant fire hazard and source of occupational dust exposure. 

Sawdust is the main component of [[particleboard]]. Wood dust is a form of particulate matter, or [[particulates]]. Research on wood dust health hazards comes within the field of occupational health science, and study of wood dust control comes within the field of indoor air quality engineering.

==Formation==
Two waste products, dust and chips, form at the working surface during woodworking operations such as sawing, milling and sanding.  These operations both shatter lignified wood cells and break out whole cells and groups of cells. Shattering of wood cells creates dust, while breaking out of whole groups of wood cells creates chips. The more cell-shattering that occurs, the finer the dust particles that are produced. For example, sawing and milling are mixed cell shattering and chip forming processes, whereas sanding is almost exclusively cell shattering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol62/mono62-6.pdf IARC 1995. ''Wood Dust''. In ''IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans''. Volume 62: Wood Dust and Formaldehyde. Lyon, France: World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, p.70.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
A major use of sawdust is for particleboard; coarse sawdust may be used for [[Pulp (paper)|wood pulp]]. Sawdust has a variety of other practical uses, including serving as a [[mulch]], as an alternative to clay [[litter box|cat litter]], or as a [[fuel]]. Until the advent of refrigeration, it was often used in [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] to keep ice frozen during the summer. It has been used in [[art|artistic displays]], and as [[scatter (modeling)|scatter]] in [[model railroading|miniature railroad]] and other models. It is also sometimes used to soak up liquid spills, allowing the spill to be easily collected or swept aside.  As such, it was formerly common on barroom floors.&lt;ref&gt;Felman, David (2005) "Why Did Bars Used to Put Sawdust on the Floor? Why Don't They Anymore?" ''Why Do Elephant's Jump?'' HarperCollins, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3akztvHXlf0C&amp;pg=PA118 page 118], {{ISBN|978-0-06-053914-6}}, quoting Christopher Halleron, bartender and beer columnist.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to make [[Cutler's resin]]. Mixed with water and frozen, it forms [[pykrete]], a slow-melting, much stronger form of [[ice]].

Sawdust is used in the manufacture of [[Briquette|charcoal briquettes]]. The claim for invention of the first commercial charcoal briquettes goes to [[Henry Ford]] who created them from the wood scraps and sawdust produced by his automobile factory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Harvey (2006) ''Wood: Craft, Culture, History'' Penguin Books, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQzZri48QvcC&amp;pg=PT403 page 403], {{ISBN|978-1-1012-0185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in food===
Cellulose, fibre starch that is indigestible to humans, and a filler in some low calorie foods, can be and is made from sawdust, as well as from other plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nassauer, Sarah|title=Why Wood Pulp Makes Ice Cream Creamier |date=4 May 2011|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703834804576300991196803916|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no documentation&lt;ref&gt;Packing houses formerly purchased large quantities of sawdust for the cutting room floors, and still purchase sawdust for use as a fuel and flavoring in the smoking process.&lt;/ref&gt; for the persistent rumor, based upon [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', that sawdust was used as a filler in sausage, cellulose derived from sawdust was and is used for sausage casings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6556e/X6556E03.htm|author=Savic, I.

When cereals were scarce, sawdust was sometimes an ingredient in Kommissbrot. [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] survivor, Dr. [[Miklós Nyiszli]], reports in ''Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account'' that the subaltern medical staff, who served [[Josef Mengele|Dr. Josef Mengele]], subsisted on "bread made from wild [[Chestnut#Nutrition|chestnuts]] sprinkled with sawdust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nyiszli, Miklos|title=Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account|chapter=3|date=2011|publisher=New York: Arcade Publishing|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathing airborne wood dust may cause allergic respiratory symptoms, mucosal and non-allergic respiratory symptoms, and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/wooddust/index.html United Startes Department of Labor: Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Wood Dust.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, lists of carcinogenic factors are published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). All these organisations recognize wood dust as carcinogenic in relation to the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

People can be exposed to wood dust in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for wood dust exposure in the workplace as 15&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Wood dust|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0667.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all airborne [[particulates]], wood dust particle sizes are classified with regard to effect on the human respiratory system.  For this classification, the unit for measurement of particle sizes is the micrometre or micron (μm), where 1 micrometre = 1 micron. Particles below 50 μm are not normally visible to the naked human eye.&lt;ref&gt;Yuanhui Zhang, 2004. ''Indoor Air Quality Engineering''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Particles of concern for human respiratory health are those &lt;100 μm (where the symbol &lt; means ‘less than’).

Zhang (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Yuanhui Zhang, 2004. ''Indoor Air Quality Engineering''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; has defined the size of indoor particulates according to respiratory fraction:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Respiratory fraction !! Size range
|-
| Inhalable || ≤ 100 μm
|-
| Thoracic || ≤10 μm
|-
| Respirable || ≤4 μm
|-
| Diminutive || ≤0.5 μm
|}

Particles which precipitate in the vicinity of the mouth and eyes, and get into the organism, are defined as the inhalable fraction, that is total dust. Smaller fractions, penetrating into the non-cartilage respiratory tract, are defined as respirable dust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dust emitted in the wood industry is characterized by the dimensional disintegration of particles up to 5&amp;nbsp;μm, and that
is why they precipitate mostly in the nasal cavity, increasing the risk of cancer of the upper respiratory tract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposure ===
The parameter most commonly used to characterize exposures to wood dust in air is total wood dust concentration, in mass per unit volume. In countries that use the metric system, this is usually measured in mg/m³ (milligram per cubic metre)&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol62/mono62-6.pdf IARC 1995. IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans. Volume 62: Wood Dust and Formaldehyde. Lyon, France: World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, p.66.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study to estimate occupational exposure to inhalable wood dust by country, industry, the level of exposure and type of wood dust in 25 member states of the European Union (EU-25) found that in 2000–2003, about 3.6 million workers (2.0% of the employed EU-25 population) were occupationally exposed to inhalable wood dust. The highest exposure levels were estimated to occur in the construction sector and furniture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kaupinnen, T., et.al. 2006 Occupational Exposure to Inhalable Wood Dust in the Member States of the European Union. Ann Occup Hyg (2006) 50 (6): 549-561.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Wood dust is known to be a human carcinogen, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans. It has been demonstrated through human epidemiologic studies that exposure to wood dust increases the occurrence of cancer of the nose (nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses). An association of wood dust exposure and cancers of the nose has been observed in numerous case reports, cohort studies, and case control studies specifically addressing nasal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/wd.pdf Final Report on Carcinogens. Background Document for Wood Dust. Meeting of the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors, December 13–14, 2000. Research Triangle Park, NC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service National Toxicology Program / Durham, NC: Technology Planning and Management Corporation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417232235/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/WD.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other safety hazards of wood dust==
Water-borne [[bacteria]] digest organic material in leachate, but use up much of the available oxygen. This high "biological oxygen demand" can suffocate fish and other organisms. There is an equally detrimental effect on beneficial bacteria, so it is not at all advisable to use sawdust within home aquariums, as was once done by hobbyists seeking to save some expense on activated charcoal.

===Explosions and fire===
{{Main|Combustibility#Combustible dust|Dust explosion}}
Sawdust is flammable and accumulations provide a ready source of fuel.  Airborne sawdust can be ignited by sparks or even heat accumulation and result in explosions.

===Environmental effects===
At [[sawmill]]s, unless reprocessed into particleboard, burned in a sawdust burner or used to make heat for other milling operations, sawdust may collect in piles and add harmful [[leachate]]s into local water systems, creating an [[environmental hazard]]. This has placed small sawyers and environmental agencies in a deadlock.

Questions about the science behind the determination of sawdust being an environmental hazard remain for sawmill operators (though this is mainly with finer particles), who compare wood residuals to dead trees in a forest. Technical advisors have reviewed some of the environmental studies, but say most lack standardized methodology or evidence of a direct impact on [[wildlife]]. They don’t take into account large [[drainage area]]s, so the amount of material that is getting into the water from the site in relation to the total drainage area is minuscule.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Other scientists have a different view, saying the "dilution is the solution to pollution" argument is no longer accepted in environmental science. The decomposition of a tree in a forest is similar to the impact of sawdust, but the difference is of scale. Sawmills may be storing thousands of cubic metres of [[wood residues]] in one place, so the issue becomes one of concentration.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

But of larger concern are substances such as [[lignin]]s and [[fatty acid]]s that protect trees from predators while they are alive, but can leach into water and poison wildlife. Those types of things remain in the tree and, as the tree decays, they slowly are broken down. But when sawyers are processing a large volume of wood and large concentrations of these materials permeate into the runoff, the [[toxicity]] they cause is harmful  to a broad range of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/environment.asp Canadian Geographic Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428075135/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/environment.asp |date=2006-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood dust control==
To lower the concentration of airborne dust concentrations during woodworking, dust extraction systems are used. These can be divided into two types. The first are local exhaust ventilation systems, the second are room ventilation systems. Use of personal [[respirator]]s, a form of [[personal protective equipment]], can also isolate workers from dust.

===Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems===
These rely on air pulled with a suction force through piping systems from the point of dust formation to a waste disposal unit. LEV systems consist of four elements: dust hoods at the point of dust formation, ventilation ducts, an air cleaning device (waste separator or dust collector) and an air moving device (a fan, otherwise known as an impeller).&lt;ref&gt;Mutchler, J.E., 1973. ''Chapter 41: Local Exhaust Systems''. In: ''The Industrial Environment: its Evaluation and Control''. Washington: US Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NOISH). www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/74-177-w.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The air, containing dust and chips from the woodworking operation, is sucked by an impeller. The impeller is usually built into, or placed close to, the waste disposal unit, or dust collector.

Guidelines of performance for woodworking LEV systems exist, and these tie into occupational air quality regulations that exist in many countries. The LEV guidelines often referred to are those set by the ACIAH.

====Low Volume/High Velocity (LVHV) systems====
Low-volume/high-velocity capture systems are a specialised type of LEV that use an extractor hood designed as an integral part of the tool or positioned very close to the operating point of the cutting tool. The hood is designed to provide high capture velocities, often greater than 50&amp;nbsp;m/s (10,000 fpm) at the contaminant release point. This high velocity is accompanied by airflows often less than 0.02m3/s (50 cfm) resulting from the small face area of the hood that is used.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, W.A., et. al., 2004. ''Ventilation for Control of the Work Environment'', 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; These systems have come into favour for portable power tools, although adoption of the technology is not widespread. Festool is one manufacturer of portable power tools using LVHV ventilation integrated into the tool design.

===Room ventilation systems===
If suitably designed, general ventilation can also be used as a control of airborne dust. General ventilation can often help reduce skin and clothing contamination, and dust deposition on surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/occupational_health/publications/en/oehairbornedust.pdf WHO, 1999. Hazard Prevention and Control in the Work Environment: Airborne Dust. WHO/SDE/OEH/99.14. Geneva: World Health Organization, Department of Protection of the Human Environment, Occupational and Environmental Health. p.98.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air quality standards for respirable wood dust==
Within industry, many countries have air quality regulations. This is to help ensure that wood dust is extracted to a level that ensures specified maximum allowable residual airborne dust concentrations and worker exposure levels.

The '''tau neutrino''' or '''tauon neutrino''' is a [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] [[elementary particle]]  which has the symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Tauon neutrino}} and no net [[electric charge]]. Together with the [[tau (particle)|tau]], it forms the third [[generation (physics)|generation]] of [[lepton]]s, hence the name tau [[neutrino]]. Its existence was immediately implied after the tau particle was detected in a series of experiments between 1974 and 1977 by [[Martin Lewis Perl]] with his colleagues at the [[SLAC]]–[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBL]] group.&lt;ref&gt;

==Discovery==
{{Main|DONUT}}
The tau neutrino is last of the leptons, and is the second most recent particle of the [[Standard Model]] to be discovered. The [[DONUT|DONUT experiment]] from [[Fermilab]] was built during the 1990s to specifically detect the tau neutrino. These efforts came to fruition in July 2000, when the DONUT collaboration reported its detection.&lt;ref name=tauonpress/&gt;&lt;ref name=tauonpaper/&gt;

{{infobox tellurium}}
'''Tellurium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Te''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white [[metalloid]]. Tellurium is chemically related to [[selenium]] and [[sulfur]]. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme [[abundance of the chemical elements|rarity]] in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of [[platinum]], is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile [[hydride]] which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.

[[Gold chalcogenides|Tellurium-bearing compounds]] were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in [[Zlatna]], [[Romania]] by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein]], although it was [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]] who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for "earth", ''tellus''. [[Gold telluride]] minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds. However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[lead]] production.

Commercially, the primary use of tellurium is copper and steel [[alloy]]s, where it improves [[machinability]]. Applications in [[CdTe solar panel]]s and [[Cadmium telluride|semiconductors]] also consume a considerable portion of tellurium production.

Tellurium has no biological function, although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and selenium in [[amino acid]]s such as [[cysteine|tellurocysteine]] and [[methionine|telluromethionine]].&lt;ref name="tellurium-fungi" /&gt; In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into [[dimethyl telluride]], (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te, a gas with a [[garlic]]-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
Tellurium has two [[allotrope]]s, crystalline and amorphous. When [[crystal]]line, tellurium is silvery-white with a metallic luster. It is a brittle and easily pulverized metalloid. Amorphous tellurium is a black-brown powder prepared by precipitating it from a solution of [[tellurous acid]] or [[telluric acid]] (Te(OH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="lan"/&gt; Tellurium is a [[semiconductor]] that shows a greater electrical conductivity in certain directions depending on [[atom]]ic alignment; the conductivity increases slightly when exposed to light ([[photoconductivity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty5Ymlg_Mh0C&amp;pg=PA89|pages = 89–91|isbn = 978-0-8493-8912-2|chapter = Tellurium|publisher = CRC Press| title = Semiconductor materials|first = Lev Isaakovich|last = Berger|date =1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, [[iron]], and [[stainless steel]]. Of the [[chalcogen]]s, tellurium has the highest melting and boiling points, at {{convert|722.66|K|°F}} and {{convert|1261|K|°F}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptable.com/#Property/State Periodic Table]. ptable.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Tellurium adopts a polymeric structure consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air and is not volatile.

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of tellurium}}
Naturally occurring tellurium has eight isotopes. Six of those isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;Te, &lt;sup&gt;122&lt;/sup&gt;Te, &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;Te, &lt;sup&gt;124&lt;/sup&gt;Te, &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te, and &lt;sup&gt;126&lt;/sup&gt;Te, are stable.

With an abundance in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] comparable to that of platinum (about 1&amp;nbsp;µg/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1Kb-xizc1wC&amp;pg=PA396|page=396|title=A handbook of industrial ecology|first1 = Robert U.|last1 = Ayres|first2= Leslie|last2 = Ayres|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=1-84064-506-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In comparison, even the rarest of the stable [[lanthanide]]s have crustal abundances of 500&amp;nbsp;µg/kg (see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.28.53|title=Abundances of the Elements|date=1956|last1=Suess|first1=Hans|last2=Urey|first2=Harold|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=28|pages=53–74|bibcode=1956RvMP...28...53S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance.  Tellurium is more abundant than [[rubidium]] in the cosmos, though rubidium is 10,000 times more abundant in the Earth's crust. The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be caused by conditions during the formation of the Earth, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of [[oxygen]] and [[water]], was controlled by the reductive power of free [[hydrogen]]. Under this scenario, certain elements that form volatile [[hydride]]s, such as tellurium, were severely depleted through evaporation of these hydrides. Tellurium and selenium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Tellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of [[gold]] such as [[calaverite]] and  [[krennerite]] (two different [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of AuTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[petzite]], Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AuTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[sylvanite]], AgAuTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The city of [[Telluride, Colorado]], was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found). Gold itself is usually found uncombined, but when found as a chemical compound, it is most often combined with tellurium.

Although tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. [[melonite]], NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Natural [[tellurite]] and [[tellurate]] minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of tellurium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter = Phase Relations in the Selenide Telluride Systems|pages =217–256| isbn = 978-90-5410-723-1|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HUWRZecignoC&amp;pg=PA217|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|date = 1996|title = Geochemistry, mineralogy and genesis of gold deposits|first = I.

In the gold rush of 1893, miners in [[Kalgoorlie]] discarded a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and it was used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be [[calaverite]], a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Earth: An Intimate History |last=Fortey |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Fortey |date=2004 |publisher=[[Harper Perennial]]&lt;!-- presumably UK but not sure |location= --&gt; |isbn=978-0-00-257011-4 |page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Martin Heinrich Klaproth.jpg|thumb|alt=Oval black and white engraving of a man looking left with a scarf and a coat with large buttons. |[[Martin Heinrich Klaproth|Klaproth]] named the new element and credited [[Franz Joseph Müller von Reichenstein|von Reichenstein]] with its discovery]]

Tellurium ([[Latin]] ''tellus'' meaning "earth") was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in [[Zlatna]], near today's city of [[Alba Iulia]], Romania. This ore was known as "Faczebajer weißes blättriges Golderz" (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Facebánya, now Fața Băii in [[Alba County]]) or ''antimonalischer Goldkies'' (antimonic gold pyrite), and according to [[Anton von Rupprecht]], was ''Spießglaskönig'' (''argent molybdique''), containing native [[antimony]].&lt;ref&gt;v.

After a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests, Müller determined the [[specific gravity]] of the mineral and noted that when heated, the new metal gives off a white smoke with a [[radish]]-like odor; that it imparts a red color to [[sulfuric acid]]; and that when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names ''aurum paradoxium'' (paradoxical gold) and ''metallum problematicum'' (problem metal), because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony.&lt;ref name="Reich"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = von Reichenstein|first = F.

The 1960s brought an increase in thermoelectric applications for tellurium (as [[bismuth telluride]]), and in free-machining [[steel]] alloys, which became the dominant use.&lt;ref name="USGS2007Yb"/&gt;

==Production==
The principal source of tellurium is from [[anode]] [[sludge]]s from the electrolytic refining of blister [[copper]]. It is a component of dusts from [[blast furnace]] refining of [[lead]]. Treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore typically yields one kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;pounds) of tellurium. 
[[File:World Tellurium Production 2006.svg|upright=1.4|thumb|Tellurium production 2006|alt=Grey and white world map with four countries colored to show the percentage of worldwide tellurium production. US to produce 40%; Peru 30%; Japan 20% and Canada 10%.]]
The anode sludges contain the [[selenide]]s and tellurides of the [[noble metals]] in compounds with the formula M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se or M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te (M = Cu, Ag, Au). At temperatures of 500&amp;nbsp;°C the anode sludges are roasted with [[sodium carbonate]] under air. The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to [[sodium tellurite]].&lt;ref name="wiberg2001"/&gt;

:M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 M + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Tellurite (ion)|Tellurites]] can be leached from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydrotellurites HTeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in solution. [[Selenite (ion)|Selenites]] are also formed during this process, but they can be separated by adding [[sulfuric acid]]. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble [[tellurium dioxide]] while the selenites stay in solution.&lt;ref name="wiberg2001"/&gt;

: {{chem|HTeO|3|-}} + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + {{chem|SO|4|2-}} + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The metal is produced from the oxide (reduced) either by electrolysis or by reacting the [[tellurium dioxide]] with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="wiberg2001"/&gt;

: TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Te + 2 {{chem|SO|4|2-}} + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Commercial-grade tellurium is usually marketed as 200-[[Mesh (scale)|mesh]] powder but is also available as slabs, ingots, sticks, or lumps. The year-end price for tellurium in 2000 was [[United States dollar|US$]]14 per pound. In recent years, the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply, reaching as high as [[United States dollar|US$]]100 per pound in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arizonageology.blogspot.com/2007/05/arizona-tellurium-rush.html|accessdate=2009-08-08|date=May 21, 2007|title=An Arizona tellurium rush?|publisher=arizonageology.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.resourceinvestor.com/News/2007/4/Pages/Byproducts-Part-I--Is-There-a-Tellurium-Rush-in.aspx |accessdate=2009-08-08|date=April 19, 2007 |title=Byproducts Part I: Is There a Tellurium Rush in the Making?|publisher=resourceinvestor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DoE) anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0262-4079(11)61452-8|title = 13 elements you can't live without|journal = New Scientist|volume = 210|issue = 2817|page = 39|year = 2011|last1 = Crow|first1 = James Mitchell|bibcode = 2011NewSc.210...36C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reduction of Te metal produces the [[Telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] and polytellurides, Te&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. The −2 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals, such as zinc telluride, {{chem|ZnTe}}, produced by heating tellurium with zinc.&lt;ref name="roscoe"/&gt; Decomposition of {{chem|ZnTe}} with [[hydrochloric acid]] yields [[hydrogen telluride]] ({{chem|H|2|Te}}), a highly unstable analogue of the other chalcogen hydrides, [[Water (molecule)|{{chem|H|2|O}}]], [[Hydrogen sulfide|{{chem|H|2|S}}]] and [[Hydrogen selenide|{{chem|H|2|Se}}]]:

{{chem|H|2|Te}} is unstable, whereas salts of its conjugate base [TeH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are stable.

Interchalcogen cations also exist, such as {{chem|Te|2|Se|6|2+}} (distorted cubic geometry) and {{chem|Te|2|Se|8|2+}}. These are formed by oxidizing mixtures of tellurium and selenium with {{chem|AsF|5}} or [[antimony pentafluoride|{{chem|SbF|5}}]].&lt;ref name="wiberg2001"/&gt;

;Organotellurium compounds
{{Main|Organotellurium chemistry}}
Tellurium does not readily form analogues of [[alcohol]]s and [[thiol]]s, with the functional group –TeH, that are called [[tellurol]]s. The –TeH functional group is also attributed using the prefix ''tellanyl-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1070/RC1999v068n11ABEH000544|first1 = I. D.|last1 =Sadekov|first2 = A.

==Applications==

===Metallurgy===
The largest consumer of tellurium is [[metallurgy]] in [[iron]], [[stainless steel]], [[copper]], and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into [[cast iron]] for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where the presence of electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name="USGS2007Yb"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mineral Yearbook 2007: Selenium and Tellurium|first = Micheal W.|last = George| publisher = United States geological Survey|date = 2007| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/selenium/myb1-2007-selen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jallcom.2008.08.011 | volume=475 | title=Study on the structure and property of lead tellurium alloy as the positive grid of lead-acid batteries | journal=Journal of Alloys and Compounds | pages=102–109| year=2009 | last1=Guo | first1=W.

'''Thomas Davenport''' (9 July 1802 &amp;ndash; 6 July 1851) was a [[Vermont]] [[blacksmith]] who constructed the first American [[Direct current|DC]] [[electric motor|electric]] [[DC electric motor|motor]] in 1834.&lt;ref name=daven /&gt;

Davenport was born in [[Williamstown, Vermont]]. He lived in Forest Dale, a village near the town of [[Brandon, Vermont|Brandon]].

As early as 1834, he developed a battery-powered electric motor. He used it to operate a small model car on a short section of track, paving the way for the later electrification of [[streetcar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dAElGDvk2yUC&amp;pg=PA86 Electrifying America by David E. Nye, p.86, from Google Books]. Retrieved 14 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davenport's 1833 visit to the Penfield and Taft iron works at [[Crown Point, New York]], where an [[electromagnet]] was operating, based on the design of [[Joseph Henry]], was an impetus for his electromagnetic undertakings.  Davenport bought an electromagnet from the Crown Point factory and took it apart to see how it worked.  Then he forged a better iron core and redid the wiring, using silk from his wife's wedding gown.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, 2008, p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

With his wife [[Emily Davenport|Emily]] and colleague Orange Smalley, Davenport received the first American [[patent]] on an electric machine in 1837, U. S. Patent No. 132.&lt;ref name=GP132&gt;{{cite web|title=IMPROVEMENT IN PROPELLING MACHINERY BY MAGNETISM AND ELECTRO-MAGNETISM|url=https://www.google.com/patents/about?id=NM0-AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Davenport%22|publisher=Google|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used his electric motor in 1840 to print ''[[The Electro-Magnetic and Mechanics Intelligencer]]'' - the first newspaper printed using electricity.

In 1849, [[Charles Grafton Page]], the Washington scientist and inventor, commenced a project to build an electromagnetically powered locomotive, with substantial funds appropriated by the US Senate.  Davenport challenged the expenditure of public funds, arguing for the motors he had already invented.  In 1851, Page's full sized electromagnetically operated locomotive was put to a calamity-laden test on the rail line between Washington and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976), p. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tropical horticulture''' is a branch of [[horticulture]] that studies and cultivates plants in the [[tropics]], i.e., the [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]] regions of the world. The field is sometimes known by the [[portmanteau]] "TropHort".

Tropical horticulture includes plants such as perennial woody plants ([[arboriculture]]), ornamentals ([[floriculture]]), vegetables ([[olericulture]]), and fruits ([[pomology]]) including grapes ([[viticulture]]). The origin of many of these crops is not in the tropics but in temperate zones. Their adoption to tropical climatic conditions is an objective of [[breeding in the wild|breeding]]. Many important crops, however, are indigenous to the tropics. The latter embrace perennial crops such as [[Elaeis guineensis|oil palm]], vegetables including [[okra]], field crops such as [[rice]] and [[sugarcane]], and particularly fruits including [[pineapple]], [[banana]], [[papaya]], and [[mango]].

Since the tropics represent 36 percent of the earth's surface and 20 percent of its land surface, the potential of tropical horticulture is huge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/tropical/ |title=''Tropical Horticulture'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427054655/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/tropical/ |archivedate=April 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Temperate climate|temperate]] regions, [[Natural environment|environmental]] conditions in the tropics are defined less by seasonal temperature fluctuations and more by seasonality of precipitation. Thus the [[climate]] in the greater part of the tropics is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, although such variation is reduced in locations closer to the equator (±5° latitude). Temperature conditions in the tropics are affected by elevation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajol.info/index.php/ijotafs |title=''Tropical Agriculture and Food Systems'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623234040/http://ajol.info/index.php/ijotafs |archivedate=June 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which contrasting warmer and colder climate areas in the tropics can be differentiated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEbQAtyUJt8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tropical+plants&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=47KCT4aDMcTYiAKrpMmbAw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tropical%20plants&amp;f=false | title=Physiological Ecology of Tropical Plants | publisher=Springer | year=1997 |accessdate=April 9, 2012 | author=Lüttge, Ulrich}} {{ISBN|3540611614}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|4-5}} and highland areas in the tropics can consequently be more favourable for production of temperate plant species than are lowland areas.

==Types of plants==
{{see also|Tropical agriculture#Common tropical horticulture crops}}
{{see also|List of fruits#Tropical fruits}}

Both [[Vascular plant|vascular]] and [[Non-vascular plant|non-vascular]] plants grow in tropical environments. Plants indigenous to the tropics are usually cold sensitive and adapted to receiving high levels of [[Sunlight|solar radiation]]. They are sensitive to small variations in photoperiod ("short day" plants), and can be adapted to extended drought, high precipitation and/or distinct wet and dry seasons. High night temperatures are a major hindrance to adopting temperate crops (e.g., [[tomato]]es) to the tropical lowlands. Furthermore, such conditions promote high [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] rates of plants, resulting in comparably lower net [[photosynthesis]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akademisains.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=9 |title=''Tropical Horticulture and Gardening'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308151218/http://www.akademisains.gov.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=202&amp;Itemid=9 |archivedate=March 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 1995, a [[cold front]] entered southern Chile. While at the beginning the cold front seemed normal, it was soon joined by a second cold front that caused temperatures to drop drastically, below {{convert|-14|C}} in some areas, and generated large snowfalls. The snow made road transit difficult and isolated hundreds of communities in the [[Andes]] and the [[Patagonia]]n plains. 

The fodder stored for animals began to run out, and sheep and cows were trapped in metres of snow. The government of [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle|Eduardo Frei]] declared an [[emergency state]] in 24 [[Communes of Chile|communes]] initially but extended it later to encompass more than 30 communes.

Between 10,000 and 12,000 families suffered the severe effects of the White Earthquake which also buried several houses in snow. Livestock farmers suffered the worst economic effects, since they lost most of their livestock due to starving and freezing. It has been estimated that in [[Magallanes Region]] two of every ten sheep died, while in parts of [[Tierra del Fuego]] up to eight out of ten sheep died.   

The emerging [[aquaculture in Chile|aquaculture industry of southern Chile]] also suffered huge losses with the loss of 20,000 trout and 50,000 salmon. Wildlife such as the [[South Andean Deer]] also registered high death rates. 

Only by the end of August could the government clean the principal roads of snow and provide effective help to the affected zones, specially in the form of fodder.

[[Image:Cirrus clouds2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cirrus clouds|Cirrus]] uncinus ice crystal plumes showing high level wind shear, with changes in wind speed and direction.]]

'''Wind shear''' (or '''windshear'''), sometimes referred to as [[wind gradient]], is a difference in [[wind]] [[wind speed|speed]] and/or [[wind direction|direction]] over a relatively short distance in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear. Vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with change in altitude.  Horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with change in lateral position for a given altitude.&lt;ref name="Shear"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurricanescience.org/glossary/?letter=V#glossaryword373|title=Vertical wind shear. Retrieved on 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind shear is a [[microscale meteorology|microscale meteorological]] phenomenon occurring over a very small distance, but it can be associated with [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] or [[synoptic scale]] weather features such as squall lines and cold fronts. It is commonly observed near [[microburst]]s and [[downburst]]s caused by [[thunderstorm]]s, fronts, areas of locally higher low-level winds referred to as low level jets, near [[mountain]]s, radiation inversions that occur due to clear skies and calm winds, buildings, wind turbines, and sailboats. Wind shear has significant effects on control of an aircraft, and it has been a sole or contributing cause of many aircraft accidents.

Wind shear is sometimes experienced by pedestrians at ground level when walking across a plaza towards a tower block and suddenly encountering a strong wind stream that is flowing around the base of the tower.

Sound movement through the atmosphere is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the [[troposphere]] also inhibits [[tropical cyclone]] development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into longer life cycles which can then produce [[severe weather]]. The [[thermal wind]] concept explains how differences in wind speed at different heights are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains the existence of the [[jet stream]].&lt;ref name="IP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/weather3/6-15.htm|title=Low-Level Wind Shear|access-date=2007-11-25|publisher=Integrated Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Downdraft Wind shear-2.jpg|thumb|right|Down draft winds with associated [[virga]] allow these [[cloud]]s in the eastern sky at civil [[twilight]] to mimic [[aurora borealis]] in the [[Mojave desert]]]]

==Definition==
Wind shear refers to the variation of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of {{convert|30|knot|m/s|lk=in}} for light aircraft, and near {{convert|45|knot|m/s}} for airliners at flight altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[[FAA]] [http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/0/b3fb7dd636fb870b862569ba0068920b/$FILE/AC00-54.pdf FAA Advisory Circular Pilot Wind Shear Guide.] Retrieved on 2007-12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical speed changes greater than {{convert|4.9|knot|m/s}} also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during take off and landing in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of {{convert|30|knot|m/s|disp=sqbr}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind Shear |url=http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Concept2Reality/wind_shear.html |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2007-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009144924/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Concept2Reality/wind_shear.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for this additional caution includes:
*microburst intensity can double in a minute or less,
*the winds can shift to excessive cross wind,
*{{convert|40|-|50|knot|m/s}} is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and
*several of the historical wind shear accidents involved {{convert|35|-|45|knot|m/s}} microbursts.
Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of [[turbulence]] is often associated with wind shear.

==Where and when it is strongly observed==
{{See also|Jet stream}}
[[Image:Microburstnasa.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Microburst]] schematic from NASA. Note the downward motion of the air until it hits ground level, then spreads outward in all directions. The wind regime in a microburst is completely opposite to a tornado.]]
Weather situations where shear is observed include:
*[[Weather fronts]]. Significant shear is observed when the temperature difference across the front is {{cvt|5|C-change|F-change|0}} or more, and the front moves at {{convert|30|knot|m/s}} or faster. Because fronts are three-dimensional phenomena, frontal shear can be observed at any altitude between surface and [[tropopause]], and therefore be seen both horizontally and vertically. Vertical wind shear above warm fronts is more of an aviation concern than near and behind cold fronts due to their greater duration.&lt;ref name="IP"/&gt;
*Upper-level jet streams.

*Low-level jet streams. When a nocturnal low-level jet forms overnight above the Earth's surface ahead of a cold front, significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet. This is also known as nonconvective wind shear since it is not due to nearby thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="IP"/&gt;
*Mountains. When winds blow over a mountain, vertical shear is observed on the [[Windward and leeward|lee]] side. If the flow is strong enough, turbulent [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] known as "rotors" associated with [[lee waves]] may form, which are dangerous to ascending and descending aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Atmospheric Research.

*[[Downburst]]s. When an outflow boundary forms due to a shallow layer of rain-cooled air spreading out near ground level from the parent thunderstorm, both speed and directional wind shear can result at the leading edge of the three dimensional boundary.

==Horizontal component==

===Weather fronts===
{{main article|Weather fronts}}
Weather fronts are boundaries between two masses of air of different [[density|densities]], or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are [[convergence zone]]s in the wind field and are the principal cause of significant weather. Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in [[temperature]] and may also differ in [[humidity]]. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.
[[Cold front]]s feature narrow bands of [[thunderstorm]]s and [[severe weather]], and may be preceded by [[squall line]]s and [[dry line]]s. Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts. When a front becomes [[stationary front|stationary]], it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed, known as a [[shear line (meteorology)|shear line]], though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant. In the [[tropics]], [[tropical wave]]s move from east to west across the [[Atlantic basin|Atlantic]] and eastern [[Pacific basin]]s. Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves, as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis. Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and [[sea breeze]] boundaries.&lt;ref name="DR"&gt;David M. Roth. Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.

The magnitude of winds offshore are nearly double the wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters.

===Thermal wind===
{{main article|Thermal wind}}
Thermal wind is a meteorological term not referring to an actual [[wind]], but a ''difference'' in the [[geostrophic wind]] between two [[pressure level]]s {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, with {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}; in essence, wind shear. It is only present in an atmosphere with horizontal changes in [[temperature]] (or in an ocean with horizontal gradients of [[density]]), i.e. [[baroclinicity]]. In a [[barotropic]] atmosphere, where temperature is uniform, the geostrophic wind is independent of height. The name stems from the fact that this wind flows around areas of low (and high) temperature in the same manner as the [[geostrophic wind]] flows around areas of [[Low pressure area|low]] (and [[High pressure area|high]]) [[pressure]].&lt;ref name="Holton"&gt;James R. Holton (2004). ''An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology.'' {{ISBN|0-12-354015-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''thermal wind equation'' is

:&lt;math&gt;f \mathbf{v}_T = \mathbf{k} \times \nabla \left( \boldsymbol{\varphi}_1 - \boldsymbol{\varphi}_0 \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|'''φ'''}} are [[geopotential height]] fields with {{math|'''φ'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; '''φ'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''f''}} is the [[Coriolis parameter]], and {{math|'''k'''}} is the upward-pointing [[unit vector]] in the [[vertical direction]]. The thermal wind equation does not determine the wind in the [[tropics]]. Since {{math|''f''}} is small or zero, such as near the equator, the equation reduces to stating that {{math|∇('''φ'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − '''φ'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is small.&lt;ref name="Holton"/&gt;

This equation basically describes the existence of the jet stream, a westerly current of air with maximum wind speeds close to the [[tropopause]] which is (even though other factors are also important) the result of the temperature contrast between equator and pole.

{{see also|Tropical cyclogenesis#Weak vertical wind shear}}
[[Tropical cyclone]]s are, in essence, [[heat engine]]s that are fueled by the [[temperature gradient]] between the warm tropical ocean surface and the colder upper atmosphere. Tropical cyclone development requires relatively low values of vertical wind shear so that their warm core can remain above their surface circulation center, thereby promoting intensification. Vertical wind shear tears up the "machinery" of the heat engine causing it to break down. Strongly sheared tropical cyclones weaken as the upper circulation is blown away from the low level center.

The vertical wind shear in a tropical cyclone's environment is very important. When the wind shear is weak, the storms that are part of the cyclone grow vertically, and the [[latent heat]] from [[condensation]] is released into the air directly above the storm, aiding in development. When there is stronger wind shear, this means that the storms become more slanted and the latent heat release is dispersed over a much larger area.&lt;ref&gt;University of Illinois.

===Effects on thunderstorms and severe weather===
{{main article|Severe thunderstorm}}
Severe thunderstorms, which can spawn [[tornado]]es and hailstorms, require wind shear to organize the storm in such a way as to maintain the [[thunderstorm]] for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.&lt;ref&gt;University of Illinois.

===Planetary boundary layer===
[[File:PBLimage.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of where the planetary boundary layer lies on a sunny day]]
{{see also|Ekman layer|Ekman spiral|Planetary boundary layer|Surface layer}}
The atmospheric effect of surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise near the surface of the [[Earth]] blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AMS Glossary of Meteorology, Ekman layer | publisher = [[American Meteorological Association]] | url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Ekman_layer | accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the [[planetary boundary layer]], sometimes the [[Ekman layer]], and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to [[insolation]], or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.

====Effects on flight====
{{main article|Aeronautics|Gliding}}

=====Gliding=====
[[Image:FAA-8083-13 Fig 7-20.PNG|thumb|right|Glider ground launch affected by wind shear.]]
In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]].
Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,
or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding
the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the
gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | pages = 7–16
 | url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.&lt;ref name=Piggott&gt;{{cite book | last = Piggott | first = Derek | title = Gliding: a Handbook on Soaring Flight | publisher = Knauff &amp; Grove | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-9605676-4-5 | pages = 85–86, 130–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind shear is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long [[wingspan]], which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given [[Roll (flight)|bank]] angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.&lt;ref name=Piggott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knauff | first = Thomas | title = Glider Basics from First Flight to Solo | publisher = Thomas Knauff | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-9605676-3-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parachuting=====
Wind shear or wind gradients are a threat to parachutists, particularly to [[BASE jumping]] and [[wingsuit flying]]. Skydivers have been pushed off of their course by sudden shifts in wind direction and speed, and have collided with bridges, cliffsides, trees, other skydivers, the ground, and other obstacles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Skydivers routinely make adjustments to the position of their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion.

=====Soaring=====
Soaring related to wind shear, also called [[dynamic soaring]], is a technique used by [[soaring birds]] like [[albatross]]es, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Alexander | first = R. | title = Principles of Animal Locomotion | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton | year = 2002 | pages = 206 | isbn = 0-691-08678-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Alerstam | first = Thomas | title = Bird Migration | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1990 | pages = 275 | isbn = 0-521-44822-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used by [[gliding|glider pilots]] on rare occasions.

Wind shear can also create [[lee wave|wave]]. This occurs when an [[atmospheric inversion]] separates two layers with a marked difference in wind direction. If the wind encounters distortions in the inversion layer caused by [[thermal]]s coming up from below, it will create significant shear waves that can be used for soaring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=====Impact on passenger aircraft=====
[[Image:Windshearaircraftnasa.gif|thumb|right|200 px|Effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory. Note how merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences.]]
Strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft's airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing lift generated by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact. 
[[File:Delta 191 wreckage.jpg|thumb|left|Wreckage of [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]] tail section after a microburst slammed the aircraft into the ground. Another aircraft can be seen flying in the background past the crash scene.]]
As the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]], in 1988 the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] mandated that all commercial aircraft have [[Airborne wind shear detection and alert system|on-board wind shear detection systems]] by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, [[Langley Research Center]] |url=http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Windshear.html |title=Making the Skies Safer From Windshear |date=June 1992 |accessdate=2012-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329221032/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Windshear.html |archivedate=March 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler [[weather radar]] units on the ground ([[NEXRAD]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The installation of high-resolution [[Terminal Doppler Weather Radar]] stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.&lt;ref name=tdwr-nws&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gsp/tdwr/info/specs.html

====Sailing====
Wind shear affects [[sailboats]] in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the [[mast (sailing)|mast]]. The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into the selection of [[sail twist]] in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. [[Sailors]] may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a [[boom vang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garrett | first = Ross | title = The Symmetry of Sailing | publisher = Sheridan House | location = Dobbs Ferry | year = 1996 | pages = 97–99 | isbn = 1-57409-000-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sound propagation====
{{see also|Speed of sound}}
Wind shear can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere, where waves can be "bent" by [[refraction]] phenomenon. The audibility of sounds from distant sources, such as [[thunder]] or [[gunshot]]s, is very dependent on the amount of shear. The result of these differing sound levels is key in [[noise pollution]] considerations, for example from [[roadway noise]] and [[aircraft noise]], and must be considered in the design of [[noise barrier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[speed of sound]] varies with temperature.

====Effects on architecture====
[[Wind engineering]] is a field of [[engineering]] devoted to the analysis of [[wind]] effects on the natural and [[built environment]]. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as [[tornadoes]], [[hurricanes]] and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon [[meteorology]], [[aerodynamics]] and a number of specialist [[engineering]] disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Professor John Twidell.
