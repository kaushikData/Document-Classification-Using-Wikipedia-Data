'''1,1-Dimethyldiborane''' is the [[organoboron compound]] with the formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B(μ-H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A pair of related [[1,2-Dimethyldiborane|1,2-dimethyldiborane]]s are also known.&lt;ref name=Srebnik87&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srebnik|first1=Morris|last2=Cole|first2=Thomas E.|last3=Brown|first3=Herbert C.|title=Methylborane - a remarkable unhindered monoalkylborane which achieves the controlled sequential hydroboration of representative alkenes|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|date=January 1987|volume=28|issue=33|pages=3771–3774|doi=10.1016/s0040-4039(00)96380-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a colorless gas that ignites in air.

==Formation==
The methylboranes were first prepared by [[Hermann Irving Schlesinger|H. I. Schlesinger]] and A. O. Walker in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=long&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=L. H.|last2=Wallbridge|first2=M. G. H.|title=646. The chemistry of boron. Part VI. New preparative methods and decomposition studies relating to methyldiboranes|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society (Resumed)|date=1965|pages=3513|doi=10.1039/JR9650003513|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/1965/jr/jr9650003513}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlesinger|first1=H. I.|last2=Walker|first2=A. O.|title=Hydrides of Boron. IV. The Methyl Derivatives of Diborane|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=April 1935|volume=57|issue=4|pages=621–625|doi=10.1021/ja01307a009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Methylboranes are formed by the reaction of [[diborane]] and [[trimethylborane]].  This reaction produces four different substitution of methyl with hydrogen on diborane.  Produced are 1-[[methyldiborane]], 1,1-dimethyldborane, 1,1,2-[[trimethyldiborane]], and 1,1,2,2-[[tetramethyldiborane]].&lt;ref name=bell48&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=R. P.|last2=Emeléus|first2=H. J.|title=The boron hydrides and related compounds|journal=Quarterly Reviews, Chemical Society|date=1948|volume=2|issue=2|pages=132|doi=10.1039/QR9480200132}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Tetramethyl lead]] reacts with diborane in a [[1,2-dimethoxyethane]] solvent at room temperature to make a range of methyl substituted diboranes, ending up at trimethylborane, but including 1,1-dimethyldiborane, and trimethyldiborane. The other outputs of the reaction are hydrogen gas and lead metal.&lt;ref name=holl67&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holliday|first1=A.K.|last2=N. Jessop|first2=G.|title=The reaction of tetramethyllead with diborane|journal=Journal of Organometallic Chemistry|date=November 1967|volume=10|issue=2|pages=291–293|doi=10.1016/s0022-328x(00)93089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods to form methyldiboranes include heating trimethylborane with hydrogen.  Alternatively trimethylborane reacts with [[borohydride]] salts with in the presence of [[hydrogen chloride]], [[aluminium chloride]], or [[boron trichloride]]. If the borohydride is [[sodium borohydride]], then [[methane]] is a side product.  If the metal is lithium then no methane is produced.&lt;ref name=long/&gt; dimethylchloroborane and methyldichloroborane are also produced as gaseous products.&lt;ref name=long/&gt;

When Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Zr(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with borane dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, a borohydro group inserts into the zirconium carbon bond, and methyl diboranes are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marsella|first1=John A.|last2=Caulton|first2=Kenneth G.|title=Dealkylation of zirconium(IV) by borane: the intimate mechanism of an alkyl transfer reaction|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 1982|volume=104|issue=9|pages=2361–2365|doi=10.1021/ja00373a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ether [[dimethylcalcium]] reacts with diborane to produce dimethyldiborane and calcium borohydride:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=B. D.|last2=Wallbridge|first2=M. G. H.|editor1-last=Lippard|editor1-first=Stephen J.|title=Progress in Inorganic Chemistry, Volume 11|date=1970|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0471-54081-1|page=185|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=8N6nFvNzfv0C&amp;pg=PA185|chapter=Metal Tetrahydroborates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1,2-dimethyldiborane slowly converts on standing to 1,1-dimethyldiborane.&lt;ref name=Leh60&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehmann|first1=Walter J.|last2=Wilson|first2=Charles O.|last3=Shapiro|first3=I.|title=Infrared Spectra of Alkyldiboranes.

[[Gas chromatography]] can be used to determine the amounts of the methyl boranes in a mixture.  The order they elute are diborane, monomethyldiborane, trimethylborane, 1,1-dimethyldiborane, 1,2-dimethyldiborane, trimethyldiborane, and last tetramethyldiborane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seely|first1=G.

Trimethyldiborane partially disproportionates over a period of hours at room temperature to yield [[tetramethyldiborane]] and [[1,2-Dimethyldiborane|1,2-dimethyldiborane]].

Over the next decade more than 350,000 of these amplifiers were produced.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynaco&lt;/ref&gt; American 7199 production ended sometime in the 1980s while the Soviet tube company Sovtek produced one until roughly 2007. As a result the tube is becoming increasingly scarce. Another tube of the same type found in far more plentiful supply is the [[6U8A]], which is electrically identical, but with a different pinout configuration. The 6U8A can be substituted for a 7199 with a slight modification to the wiring of its tube socket.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tubedepot.com/t/tubes/preamp-tubes/7199&lt;/ref&gt;

'''André-Marie Ampère''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|p|ɪər}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ampere "Ampère"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]].''&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃pɛʁ|lang}}; 20 January 1775{{snd}}10 June 1836)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|year=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[French people|French]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who was one of the founders of the science of [[classical electromagnetism]], which he referred to as "electrodynamics". He is also the inventor of numerous applications, such as the [[solenoid]] (a term coined by him) and the electrical [[telegraph]]. An autodidact, Ampère was a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and professor at the [[École polytechnique]] and the [[Collège de France]].

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of measurement of [[electric current]], the [[ampere]], is named after him. His name is also one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed]] on the [[Eiffel Tower]].

==Early life==
André-Marie Ampère was born on 20 January 1775 to Jean-Jacques Ampère, a prosperous businessman, and Jeanne Antoinette Desutières-Sarcey Ampère, during the height of the [[French Enlightenment]]. He spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at [[Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or]] near Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Andre-Marie_Ampere |title=Andre-Marie Ampere |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Jacques Ampère, a successful merchant, was an admirer of the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whose theories of education (as outlined in his treatise [[Emile, or On Education|Émile]]) were the basis of Ampère's education. Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an "education direct from nature." Ampère's father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as [[Georges Louis Leclerc, Count of Buffon|Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon]]'s ''Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière'' (begun in 1749) and [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became Ampère's schoolmasters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The young Ampère, however, soon resumed his [[Latin]] lessons, which enabled him to master the works of [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Ampère, André Marie|volume=1|pages=878–879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution==
In addition, Ampère used his access to the latest books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age 12. In later life Ampère claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a [[polymath]], his reading embraced history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and the natural sciences.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; His mother was a devout woman, so Ampère was also initiated into the [[Catholicism|Catholic faith]] along with Enlightenment science. The [[French Revolution]] (1789–99) that began during his youth was also influential: Ampère's father was called into [[Civil service|public service]] by the new revolutionary government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://simplyknowledge.com/popular/biography/andre-marie-ampere] Biography of Andre Marie Ampere&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a justice of the peace in a small town near Lyon. When the [[Jacobin]] faction seized control of the Revolutionary government in 1792, his father Jean-Jacques Ampère resisted the new political tides, and he was [[guillotine]]d on 24 November 1793, as part of the [[Jacobin#The Terror|Jacobin purges]] of the period.

In 1796 Ampère met Julie Carron, and in 1799 they were married. André-Marie Ampère took his first regular job in 1799 as a [[mathematics]] teacher, which gave him the financial security to marry Carron and father his first child, [[Jean-Jacques Ampère|Jean-Jacques]] (named after his father), the next year. (Jean-Jacques Ampère eventually achieved his own fame as a scholar of languages). Ampère's maturation corresponded with the transition to the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic regime]] in France, and the young father and teacher found new opportunities for success within the technocratic structures favoured by the new French [[Napoleon|First Consul]]. In 1802 Ampère was appointed a professor of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] at the École Centrale in [[Bourg-en-Bresse]], leaving his ailing wife and infant son [[Jean-Jacques Ampère|Jean-Jacques Antoine Ampère]] in Lyon. He used his time in Bourg to research mathematics, producing ''Considérations sur la théorie mathématique de jeu'' (1802; "Considerations on the Mathematical Theory of Games"), a treatise on [[Probability theory|mathematical probability]] that he sent to the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]] in 1803.

==Teaching career==
[[File:Ampère - Essai sur la philosophie des sciences, 1838 - 3912601 323893 1 00011.tif|thumb|''Essai sur la philosophie des sciences'']]
After the death of his wife in July 1803, Ampère moved to [[Paris]], where he began a tutoring post at the new [[École Polytechnique]] in 1804. Despite his lack of formal qualifications, Ampère was appointed a professor of mathematics at the school in 1809. As well as holding positions at this school until 1828, in 1819 and 1820 Ampère offered courses in [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]], respectively, at the [[University of Paris]], and in 1824 he was elected to the prestigious chair in [[experimental physics]] at the [[Collège de France]]. In 1814 Ampère was invited to join the class of mathematicians in the new ''Institut Impérial'', the umbrella under which the reformed state Academy of Sciences would sit.

Ampère engaged in a diverse array of scientific inquiries during the years leading up to his election to the academy—writing papers and engaging in topics from mathematics and philosophy to chemistry and astronomy, which was customary among the leading scientific intellectuals of the day. Ampère claimed that "at eighteen years he found three culminating points in his life, his [[First Communion]], the reading of Antoine Leonard Thomas's "Eulogy of Descartes", and the [[Taking of the Bastille]]. On the day of his wife's death he wrote two verses from the [[Psalm]]s, and the prayer, 'O Lord, God of Mercy, unite me in Heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth.' In times of duress he would take refuge in the reading of the [[Bible]] and the [[Fathers of the Church]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | work = | publisher = | date = | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01437c.htm| doi = | accessdate = 29 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time he took into his family the young student [[Frédéric Ozanam]] (1813–1853), one of the founders of the [[Conference of Charity]], later known as the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]]. Through Ampère, Ozanam had contact with leaders of the neo-Catholic movement, such as [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], and [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]]. Ozanam was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1998.

==Work in electromagnetism==

In September 1820, Ampère's friend and eventual eulogist [[François Arago]] showed the members of the French Academy of Sciences the surprising discovery of [[Denmark|Danish]] physicist [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] that a [[Compass|magnetic needle]] is deflected by an adjacent [[electric current]]. Ampère began developing a mathematical and physical theory to understand the relationship between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. Furthering Ørsted's experimental work, Ampère showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions, respectively - this laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He also applied mathematics in generalizing physical laws from these experimental results. The most important of these was the principle that came to be called [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]], which states that the mutual action of two lengths of current-carrying wire is proportional to their lengths and to the intensities of their currents. Ampère also applied this same principle to magnetism, showing the harmony between his law and French physicist [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]]'s law of magnetic action. Ampère's devotion to, and skill with, experimental techniques anchored his science within the emerging fields of experimental physics.

Ampère also provided a physical understanding of the electromagnetic relationship, theorizing the existence of an "electrodynamic molecule" (the forerunner of the idea of the [[electron]]) that served as the component element of both electricity and magnetism. Using this physical explanation of electromagnetic motion, Ampère developed a physical account of electromagnetic phenomena that was both empirically demonstrable and mathematically predictive. In 1827 Ampère published his magnum opus, ''Mémoire sur la théorie mathématique des phénomènes électrodynamiques uniquement déduite de l’experience'' (Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience), the work that coined the name of his new science, ''electrodynamics'', and became known ever after as its founding treatise.

In 1827 Ampère was elected a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] and in 1828, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27ampere%27%29| title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate = 13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In recognition of his contribution to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 [[International Exposition of Electricity]], established the [[Ampere (unit)|ampere]] as a standard unit of electrical measurement, along with the [[coulomb]], [[volt]], [[ohm]], and [[watt]], which are named, respectively, after Ampère's contemporaries [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] of France, [[Alessandro Volta]] of [[Italy]], [[Georg Ohm]] of [[Germany]], and [[James Watt]] of [[Scotland]]. Ampère's name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

Several items are named after Ampère; many streets and [[Place Ampère|squares]], [[Collège-lycée Ampère|schools]], a [[List of Lyon Metro stations#Line A|Lyon metro station]], and an [[Electric boat#Types|electric ferry]] in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/artikler/batterifergen-har-mattet-sta-over-avganger-na-er-losningen-klar/364633 |title=Batterifergen har måttet stå over avganger.

The elements [[bismuth]] and [[indium]] have relatively low [[melting points]] when compared to other metals, and their alloy '''Bismuth Indium''' is classified as a [[fusible alloy]]. It has a melting point lower than the [[eutectic]] point of the tin lead alloy. The most common application of the alloy is as a low temperature [[solder]], which can also contain, besides Bismuth and Indium, [[lead]], [[cadmium]] and [[tin]].&lt;ref name="Porteous, Russ" &gt;Porteous, Russ;'''Heat Detectors - Principle of Operation''';V 2011.2; available at:

==Metals==

===[[Bismuth]]===
Bismuth has characteristics which are uncommon in the majority of the metals. As with [[gallium]], it expands when solidified, approximately 3.32%. Its electrical resistance is higher in the solid state than in the liquid (in a half proportion). The thermal conductivity is low, only bigger than the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] one (just considering pure metals). It is fragile, highly diamagnetic (higher value of metals) with magnetic susceptibility of -1,68x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;mks. Bismuth is used as [[catalyst]] in the production of [[plastics]] and cosmetics, as additives in [[steel alloys]], [[aluminum]] and in [[electronics]]. It has a [[rhombohedral]] (Biα) structure, with an [[atomic radius]] of 1.54 Å, [[electronegativity]] of 1.83, and valence of +3 and +5.

&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 9"&gt;ASM Handbook; Metallography and Microstructures, v. 9; ASM Internacional, USA; 2004; p. 68-73&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Indium]]===
Indium is a metal softer than [[lead]] ([[hardness]] of 0.9 HB), permitting it to be scratched by a nail. It is also malleable, [[ductile]] and has a thermal conductivity value of 0.78 W/m°C (85&amp;nbsp;°C). It also has the capacity of wetting glass, quartz and other ceramic materials. It maintains the plasticity and ductility when exposed to cryogenic environments and has a big gap between the melting point and the boiling point (156.6&amp;nbsp;°C and 2080&amp;nbsp;°C respectively). Under compression, it has high plasticity that allows almost unlimited deformation (2.14 MPa of compression resistance) and under tensile it has low elongation (4 MPa of tensile resistance). Indium is used in dental alloys, semiconductor components, nuclear reactor panels, sodium lamps, strengthening factor in lead-based welds and low melting temperature welds. The metal has a [[body centered tetragonal]] structure, atomic radius of 1.63 Å, electronegativity of 1.81 and valence of +3 or +5, being the trivalent the more common.&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 2 part 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 2 part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 6 part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 6 part 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 9" /&gt;

==Common Compositions of alloys==

The most common application of this alloy is as a [[solder]], with the composition of 95wt% of In and 5wt% of Bi. The [[liquidus]] line of this composition occurs at 423K (150&amp;nbsp;°C; 302&amp;nbsp;°F), and the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] line at 398K (125&amp;nbsp;°C; 257&amp;nbsp;°F), being the first solid phase to be formed during the cooling process In, with Bi as a substitutional [[solid solution]].&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 2 part 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 6 part 1" /&gt;

With a smaller application area, due to difficulties on the process of synthesizing, is the alloy composed by 33 wt% of In and 67wt% of Bi. This alloy presents a [[eutectic]] temperature of 382K (109&amp;nbsp;°C; 228.2&amp;nbsp;°F). The resistance to thermal [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] of this material is higher, but the quantity of slag when compared to the alloy between tin and lead.

There is, on the market a solder composed by 49 wt% of Bi, 21 wt% of In, 18 wt% of Pb, and 12 wt% of Sn, called commercially solder 136. This alloy presents a density of 8.58g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, tensile strength of 43 MPa, toughness of 14HB, eutectic temperature of 331k (58&amp;nbsp;°C; 136.4&amp;nbsp;°F), thermic coefficient of expansion of 12,8 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/K. It is used to parts where precision is necessary, as in inspections, and fusible cores to wax patterns compounds.&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 2 part 2" /&gt;

Another alloy also on the market is the solder 117, composted by 44.7 wt% of Bi, 22.60 wt% of Pb, 19 wt% of In, 8.30 wt% of Sn, and  5.30 wt% of Cd. The density of this alloy is 8.86g/cm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, tensile strength of 37 MPa, toughness of 12HB, eutectic temperature of 320K (47&amp;nbsp;°C; 116.6&amp;nbsp;°F). It is also used to parts on inspection equipment, spindles for machining (polishing), molds for development of prosthesis and dental molds.&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 2 part 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 6 part 1" /&gt;

Other compositions founded on the market:

- Solder 174: 26 wt% of In, 17 wt% of Sn, and 57 wt% of Bi, presenting a eutectic temperature of 352K (79&amp;nbsp;°C; 174.2&amp;nbsp;°F).

- 32.5 wt% of Bi, 16.5 wt% of Sn, and 51 wt% of In, presenting a eutectic temperature of 333K (60&amp;nbsp;°C; 140&amp;nbsp;°F).

- 48 wt% of Bi, 25.63 wt% of Pb, 12.77 wt% of Sn, 9.6 wt% of Cd and 4 wt% of In, present a liquids temperature of 338K (65&amp;nbsp;°C; 149&amp;nbsp;°F), and a solidus temperature of 334K (61&amp;nbsp;°C; 141.8&amp;nbsp;°F).

'''The influence of each element'''

[[Antimony]]: is added to increase the strength, but not changing the wettability.

[[Bismuth]]: it significantly improves the wettability of the solder. When the composition is more than 47% Bi, it will expand upon cooling.

[[Cadmium]]: It oxidizes fast, causes tarnishes, and slow pace of solder. It improves the mechanical properties of the alloys.

[[Indium]]: Each 1 wt% of In added on the alloy of the melting point reduces 1.45&amp;nbsp;°C. It easily oxidizes, has a very high cost, enables soldering for cryogenic applications, and allows soldering between nonmetals. It makes easier the fabrication process if compared with Bi.

[[Lead]]: With presence of In it forms a compound that have a phase change at 387K (114&amp;nbsp;°C; 237.20&amp;nbsp;°F).

==[[Phase equilibrium diagram]]==
The phase diagram of the alloy between Bi and In, in room temperature can form three intermetallic, being them: Bi(α), BiIn; Bi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; BiIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Above the room temperature there is another phase named ε.

'''Solubility of the elements'''

The solubility of the basic elements is not too high, being de 0 - 0,005 wt% of In, on the Bi structure; and ~0 -14 wt% of Bi, on the In structure. This percentage of solubility can be explained by the [[Hume-Rothery rules]], where the crystalline structure must to be the same, the atomic radius must differ 15% or less, the valency must to be the same and the electronegativity of the two components must to be similar.

When the two elements are mixed together, the alloy between Bi an In presents three eutectic points, being:

|}

When cooled from the melt, it will form a lamellar structure.

There is one [[eutectoid]] point on the diagram, at 83 wt% of In. The eutectoid temperature is 322K (49&amp;nbsp;°C; 120.20&amp;nbsp;°F). In the cooling process the phase ε will form BiIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and In.

In the Peritectic point, with the composition of 86 wt% of In, the liquid and the already formed In&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; will result in the phase ε.

There are three intermetallic formed in the equilibrium, being:

-	BiIn (from 0,005 to 35.4 wt% of In), presenting a structure [[tetragonal]], with 2 atoms per unit cell.

-	Bi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (from 47.5 to 97.97 wt% of In), with a [[tetragonal structure]] and 4 atoms per unit cell.

-	Bi In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (from 52.5 to 53.5 wt% of In), having a [[hexagonal structure]], with 2 atoms per unit cell.

There is regions on the diagram with were determinate thermodynamically due the process of formation take too much time or difficulties on the visualization of the phase.&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 6 part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ASM Handbook vol. 9" /&gt;

The lowest fusion value found for the alloy is at 345.7K (72,7&amp;nbsp;°C; 162.86&amp;nbsp;°F), on the composition of 66,7 wt% of In. In a cooling process the phases that will be formed is the Bi In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ε.

This alloy also present a metastable phases BiIn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, occurring at 62 wt% of In.

==General considerations==

Fusible alloys present a [[precipitation hardening]] (aging), so the mechanic properties will be dependent of the melting conditions, solidification rate, time since the melting, and the conditions in which the alloy will be used.

We can attribute advantages of the Bi In alloy, when compared to the traditional ones (Sn Pb), as bigger thermal fatigue resistance, and lower melting point. Some of the disadvantages are that they are less ductile and they will produce more slag.

'''Caprylic acid''' is the common name for the eight-carbon saturated [[fatty acid]] known by the systematic name '''octanoic acid'''. Its compounds are found naturally in the [[milk]] of various mammals, and as a minor constituent of [[coconut oil]] and [[palm kernel oil]].&lt;ref name="lexicon" /&gt; It is an oily liquid that is minimally soluble in water with a slightly unpleasant rancid-like smell and taste.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

Two other acids are named after [[goat]]s via the Latin word ''[[wikt:capra#Latin|capra]]'': [[hexanoic acid|caproic acid]] (C6) and [[decanoic acid|capric acid]] (C10). Along with caprylic acid (C8) these total 15% in goat milk fat.

==Uses==
Caprylic acid is used commercially in the production of [[ester]]s used in perfumery and also in the manufacture of dyes.

Caprylic acid is an antimicrobial pesticide used as a food contact surface sanitizer in commercial food handling establishments on dairy equipment, food processing equipment, breweries, wineries, and beverage processing plants.  It is also used as disinfectant in health care facilities, schools/colleges, animal care/veterinary facilities, industrial facilities, office buildings, recreational facilities, retail and wholesale establishments, livestock premises, restaurants, and hotels/motels.  In addition, caprylic acid is used as an algaecide, bactericide, fungicide, and herbicide in nurseries, greenhouses, garden centers, and interiorscapes on ornamentals. Products containing caprylic acid are formulated as soluble concentrate/liquids and ready-to-use liquids.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - Antimicrobials Division. [http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0477 Docket Number; EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0477   Caprylic (Octanoic) Acid].&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[ghrelin]] to have a hunger-stimulating action on a [[hypothalamus]], caprylic acid must be linked to a [[serine]] residue at the 3-position of ghrelin. To cause hunger, it must acylate an [[hydroxyl group|-OH group]]. Other fatty acids in the same position have similar effects on hunger.

The [[acid chloride]] of caprylic acid is used in the synthesis of [[perfluorooctanoic acid]].

===Dietary uses===
{{see also|Medium-chain triglyceride#Dietary relevance}}

Caprylic acid is taken as a [[dietary supplement]].

Some studies have shown that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) can help in the process of excess calorie burning, and thus [[weight loss]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Medium-chain triglycerides|author1=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9492">'''Chalcogenide glass''' (pronounced hard ''ch'' as in ''chemistry'') is a [[glass]] containing one or more [[chalcogen]]s ([[sulfur]], [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]], but excluding [[oxygen]]). Such glasses are [[covalently]] bonded materials and may be classified as [[covalent network solid]]s. [[Polonium]] is also a chalcogen but is not used because of its strong [[radioactivity]]. Chalcogenide materials behave rather differently from oxides, in particular their lower [[band gap]]s contribute to very dissimilar optical and electrical properties.

The classical chalcogenide glasses (mainly sulfur-based ones such as [[Arsenic trisulfide|As-S]] or [[Germanium monosulfide|Ge-S]]) are strong glass-formers and possess glasses within large concentration regions. Glass-forming abilities decrease with increasing molar weight of constituent elements; i.e., S &gt; Se &gt; Te.

Chalcogenide compounds such as [[AgInSbTe]] and [[GeSbTe]] are used in rewritable [[optical disc|optical disks]] and [[phase-change memory]] devices. They are [[fragility|fragile]] glass-formers: by controlling heating and annealing (cooling), they can be switched between an [[amorphous]] (glassy) and a [[crystalline]] state, thereby changing their optical and electrical properties and allowing the storage of information.

==Chemistry==

Most stable binary chalcogenide glasses are compounds of a chalcogen and a group 14 or 15 element and may be formed in a wide range of atomic ratios. Ternary glasses are also known.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Flemings, B. Ilschner, E.J. Kramer, S. Mahajan, K.H. Jurgen Buschow and R.W. Cahn, Encyclopedia of Materials: Science and Technology, Elsevier Science Ltd, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all chalcogenide compositions exist in glassy form, though it is possible to find materials with which these non-glass-forming compositions can be alloyed in order to form a glass. An example of this is gallium sulphide-based glasses. [[Gallium(III) sulphide]] on its own is not a known glass former; however, with sodium or lanthanum sulphides it forms a glass, [[gallium lanthanum sulphide]] (GLS).

==Applications==

Uses include infrared detectors, mouldable infrared optics such as [[lens (optics)|lenses]], and infrared [[optical fiber]]s, with the main advantage being that these materials transmit across a wide range of the [[infrared]] [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

The physical properties of chalcogenide glasses (high refractive index, low [[phonon]] energy, high nonlinearity) also make them ideal for incorporation into [[lasers]], planar optics, [[photonic integrated circuits]], and other active devices especially if doped with [[rare-earth element]] ions. Some chalcogenide glasses exhibit several non-linear optical effects such as photon-induced refraction,&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, K. and Shimakawa, K. (2009), Chalcogenide glasses in Japan: A review on photoinduced phenomena. Phys. Status Solidi B, 246: 1744–1757. [[doi: 10.1002/pssb.200982002]]&lt;/ref&gt; and electron-induced permittivity modification&lt;ref&gt;Electron irradiation induced reduction of the permittivity in chalcogenide glass (As[sub 2]S[sub 3]) thin filmDamian P.

Some chalcogenide materials experience thermally driven amorphous-to-crystalline phase changes.  This makes them useful for encoding binary information on thin films of chalcogenides and forms the basis of rewritable optical discs &lt;ref name="Greer05"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/4371246a | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | pages = 1246&amp;ndash;1247 | year = 2005 | title = Materials science: Changing face of the chameleon | author = Greer, A.

Examples of such [[phase transition|phase change]] materials are [[GeSbTe]] and [[AgInSbTe]]. In optical discs, the phase change layer is usually sandwiched between dielectric layers of [[zinc sulfide|ZnS]]-[[silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], sometimes with a layer of a crystallization promoting film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Other less commonly used such materials are [[InSe]], [[Antimony selenide|SbSe]], [[Antimony telluride|SbTe]], [[InSbSe]], [[InSbTe]], [[GeSbSe]], [[GeSbTeSe]] and [[AgInSbSeTe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6511788.html US Patent 6511788] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215942/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6511788.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] claims that its chalcogenide-based [[3D XPoint]] memory technology achieves throughput and write durability 1,000 times higher than [[flash memory]].

Electrical switching in chalcogenide semiconductors emerged in the 1960s, when the amorphous chalcogenide Te&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; was found to exhibit sharp, reversible transitions in electrical resistance above a threshold voltage. If current is allowed to persist in the non-crystalline material, it heats up and changes to crystalline form. This is equivalent to information being written on it. A crystalline region may be melted by exposure to a brief, intense pulse of heat. Subsequent rapid cooling then sends the melted region back through the glass transition. Conversely, a lower-intensity heat pulse of longer duration will crystallize an amorphous region. Attempts to induce the glassy–crystal transformation of chalcogenides by electrical means form the basis of phase-change random-access memory (PC-RAM). This technology has been developed to near commercial use by [[ECD Ovonics]]. For write operations, an electric current supplies the heat pulse. The read process is performed at sub-threshold voltages by utilizing the relatively large difference in electrical resistance between the glassy and crystalline states. Examples of such phase change materials are [[GeSbTe]] and [[AgInSbTe]].

==Research==
The [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] properties of chalcogenide glasses were revealed in 1955 by B.T. Kolomiets and N.A. Gorunova from [[Ioffe Institute]], USSR.&lt;ref name=Kolomiets/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kolomiets2/&gt;

Although the electronic structural transitions relevant to both optical discs and PC-RAM were featured strongly, contributions from ions were not considered—even though amorphous chalcogenides can have significant ionic conductivities. At Euromat 2005, however, it was shown that ionic transport can also be useful for data storage in a solid chalcogenide electrolyte. At the nanoscale, this electrolyte consists of crystalline metallic islands of [[silver selenide]] (Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se) dispersed in an amorphous semiconducting matrix of [[germanium selenide]] (Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The electronic applications of chalcogenide glasses have been an active topic of research throughout the second half of the twentieth century and beyond For example, the migration of dissolved ions is required in the electrolytic case, but could limit the performance of a phase-change device. Diffusion of both electrons and ions participate in electromigration—widely studied as a degradation mechanism of the electrical conductors used in modern integrated circuits. Thus, a unified approach to the study of chalcogenides, assessing the collective roles of atoms, ions and electrons, may prove essential for both device performance and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''coating''' is  a covering that is applied to the surface of an object, usually referred to as the '''substrate'''. The purpose of applying the coating may be decorative, functional, or both. The coating itself may be an all-over coating, completely covering the substrate, or it may only cover parts of the substrate. An example of all of these types of coating is a [[product label]] on many drinks bottles- one side has an all-over functional coating (the [[adhesive]]) and the other side has one or more decorative coatings in an appropriate pattern (the printing) to form the words and images.

[[Paint]]s and [[lacquer]]s are coatings that mostly have dual uses of protecting the substrate and being decorative, although some artists paints are only for decoration, and the paint on large industrial pipes is presumably only for the function of preventing corrosion.

Functional coatings may be applied to change the surface properties of the substrate, such as [[adhesion]], [[Wetting|wettability]], [[corrosion resistance]], or wear resistance. In other cases, e.g. [[semiconductor device fabrication]] (where the substrate is a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]]), the coating adds a completely new property, such as a magnetic response or electrical conductivity, and forms an essential part of the finished product.

A major consideration for most coating processes is that the coating is to be applied at a controlled thickness, and a number of different processes are in use to achieve this control, ranging from a simple brush for painting a wall, to some very expensive machinery applying coatings in the electronics industry. A further consideration for 'non-all-over' coatings is that control is needed as to where the coating is to be applied. A number of these non-all-over coating processes are [[printing]] processes.

Many industrial coating processes involve the application of a thin film of functional material to a substrate, such as paper, [[fabric]], film, foil, or sheet stock. If the substrate starts and ends the process wound up in a roll, the process may be termed [[Roll-to-roll processing|"roll-to-roll"]] or "web-based" coating. A roll of substrate, when wound through the coating machine, is typically called a '''web'''.

Coatings may be applied as [[liquid]]s, [[gas]]es or [[solid]]s.

[[Concrete]] is widely used construction material all over the world. It is composed of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]], [[cement]] and water. Composition of [[concrete]] varies to suit for different applications desired. Even size of the aggregate can influence mechanical properties of [[concrete]] to a great extent.

==Peculiarities of Concrete==

===Response to tensile and compressive loading===

Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension. When tensile loads are applied, concrete undergoes fracture easily. The reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows. The aggregates in concrete are capable of taking compressive stresses so that concrete withstands compressive loading. But during tensile loading cracks are formed which separates the cement particles which hold the aggregates together. This separation of cement particles causes the entire structure to fail as crack propagates. This problem in concrete is resolved by the introduction of reinforcing components such as metallic bars, [[ceramic]] fibres etc. These components act as a skeleton of the entire structure and are capable of holding aggregates under tensile loading. This is known as ''Reinforcement of Concrete''.

===Material Properties===

Concrete may be referred to as a [[brittle]] material. This is because concrete's behaviour under loading is completely different from that of [[ductile]] materials like [[steel]]. But actually concrete differs from ideal brittle materials in many aspects. In modern [[fracture mechanics]] concrete is considered as a quasi-brittle material.&lt;ref&gt;Fracture Mechanics, Fundamentals and Applications, 3rd edition by T.L.Anderson&lt;/ref&gt; Quasi-brittle materials possess considerable [[hardness]] which is similar to ceramic hardness, so often it is called ceramic hardness. The reason for ceramic hardness can be explained on the basis of sub{{nbhyph}}critical cracking that happens during loading of concrete. Sub{{nbhyph}}critical cracking in concrete which precedes [[ultimate failure]], results in non{{nbhyph}}linear Stress{{nbhyph}}Strain response and R{{nbhyph}}curve behaviour. So concrete obtains hardness from subcritical failure.&lt;ref&gt;Fracture Mechanics by Gross Dietmar and Thomas Seelig&lt;/ref&gt;
Also concrete has a [[heterogeneous]] structure due to uneven composition of ingredients in it. This also complicates the analysis of concrete by producing misleading results.

==LEFM and Concrete==

Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics yields reliable results in the field of ductile materials like steel. Most of the experiments and theories in [[fracture mechanics]] are formulated taking ductile materials as object of interest. But if we compare the salient features in LEFM with results derived from the testing of concrete, we may find it irrelevant and sometimes trivial. For example, LEFM permits infinite stress at crack tip. This makes no sense in real analysis of concrete where the stress at crack tip is fixed. And LEFM fails to calculate stress at crack tip precisely. So we need some other ways to find out what is stress at crack tip and distribution stress near crack tip.

LEFM cannot answer many phenomenon exhibited by concrete. Some examples are 
* Size Effect (some properties are strongly dependent on size of specimen selected).
* Unobjectivity of Finite Element analysis due to mesh size dependence.
* Concept of Fracture energy or Crack energy is not known in LEFM.
* Inability to explain strain softening or quasi softening in concrete.

===Fracture Process Zone (FPZ) in concrete===

In LEFMPA, during cracking, no specific region is mentioned in between the area which is cracked and that which is not. But it is evident that in concrete, there is some intermediate space between cracked and uncracked portion. This region is defined as the ''Fracture Process Zone (FPZ)''. FPZ consists of micro cracks which are minute individual cracks situated nearer to crack tip. As the crack propagates these micro cracks merge and becomes a single structure to give continuity to the already existing crack. So indeed, FPZ acts as a bridging zone between cracked region and uncracked region. Analysis of this zone deserves special notice because it is very helpful to predict the propagation of crack and ultimate failure in concrete.
In [[steel]] (ductile) FPZ is very small and therefore [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]] hardening dominates over strain softening. Also due to small FPZ, crack tip can easily be distinguished from uncracked metal. And in ductile materials FPZ is a yielding zone.

When we consider FPZ in concrete, we find that FPZ is sufficiently large and contains micro cracks. And cohesive pressure still remains in the region. So strain softening is prevalent in this region. Due to the presence of comparatively large FPZ, locating a precise crack tip is not possible in concrete.

:&lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; = Ultimate strength

:&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; = crack width

:Area under the curve = Fracture Energy

===Pre-peak and post-peak response of steel and concrete===

If we plot stress (''Pascal'') vs. strain (''percentage deformation'') characteristics of a material, the maximum stress up to which the material can be loaded is known as peak value (&lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt;). The behaviour of concrete and steel can be compared to understand the difference in their fracture characteristics.
For this a strain controlled loading of un-notched specimen of each materials can be done. From the observations we can draw these conclusions:&lt;ref name=saouma&gt;Lecture Notes in Fracture Mechanics by Victor E. Saouma&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pre-peak''

# Steel exhibits linear elastic response up to yield stress and strain approximately 0.1%. After that it undergoes plastic deformation due internal dislocations up to a strain corresponding to 25%.
# Concrete exhibits linear response to a stress value: 0.6 &lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt; (60% of peak stress), then after internal micro{{nbhyph}}cracking induces plastic response up to peak stress value (&lt;math&gt;f_t&lt;/math&gt;). This peak value is observed at a strain of approximately 0.01%.

''Post-peak''

#Metals behaviour after peak value of stress is still a dilemma to scientists. After this peak value necking complicates the analysis and it is of no practical usefulness.
# In post peak zone concrete exhibits additional strains. We can observe a localized crack and elastic unloading in this region. Also a strain cannot be properly defined at the crack, we may prefer a stress crack opening displacement (σ-COD) model for the purpose of analysis.

==Fracture mechanics of concrete==

=== Concept of fracture energy===

Fracture energy is defined as the energy required to open unit area of crack surface. It is a material property and does not depend on size of structure. This can be well understood from the definition that it is defined for a unit area and thus influence of size is removed.

Fracture energy can be expressed as the sum of surface creation energy and surface separation energy. Fracture energy found to be increasing as we approach crack tip.

Fracture energy is a function of [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] and not [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]]. Fracture energy deserves prime role in determining ultimate [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] at crack tip.

===Mesh Size Dependence===

In [[Finite Element Method]] analysis of concrete, if mesh size is varied, then entire result varies according to it. This is called mesh size dependence. If mesh size is higher, then the structure can withstand  more stress. But such results obtained from FEM analysis contradict real case.

===Size effect===
{{main|Size effect on structural strength}}
In classical Fracture Mechanics, critical stress value is considered as a material property. So it is same for a particular material of any shape and size. But in practice, it is observed that, in some materials like plain concrete size has a strong influence on critical stress value.&lt;ref name=bazant1&gt;Bažant, Z.P., and Planas, J. (1998). ''Fracture and Size Effect in Concrete and Other Quasibrittle Materials''. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida&lt;/ref&gt; So fracture mechanics of concrete consider critical stress value a material property as well as a size dependent parameter.

===Bažant's size effect relation===
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;/√(1+{&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;})&lt;ref name=bazant1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bažant, Z. P., and Pang, S.-D. (2006) “Mechanics based statistics of failure risk of quasibrittle structures and size effect on safety factors.” ''Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci., USA'' 103 (25), pp.&amp;nbsp;9434–9439&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;= Critical stress

:&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; = tensile strength

:&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; = size of specimen

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; = empirical constant

:&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; = maximum aggregate size

This clearly proves that material size and even the component size like aggregate size can influence cracking of concrete.

==Computational models for fracture analysis==

Because of the heterogeneous nature of concrete, it responds to already existing crack testing models "anomaly". And it is evident that alteration of existing models was required to answer the unique fracture mechanics characteristics of concrete.

===Earlier models===
;Dugdale Model
:Major assumptions of this model were:
:* A [[plastic zone]] is present near the crack tip.
:* Critical stress value is  a constant and it is equal to [[yield stress]] across the crack.

;Barenblatt Model
:* A plastic zone is present near the crack tip.
:* Critical stress value is varying along with deformation produced.

The main drawback of both these models was negligence of concept of fracture energy.&lt;ref&gt;Concrete Fracture Models: Testing and Practices by Zdenek P Bažant&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fictitious crack model or Hillerborg model===

The model proposed by Hillerborg in 1976, was the first model to analyse concrete fracture making use of the fracture energy concept. In this model, Hillerborg describes two crack regions namely,
* True or physical crack
* Fictitious crack or fracture process zone (FPZ)&lt;ref name=saouma /&gt;

;True crack region
:is the outer most part where cracking process is completed and no stresses can be propagated through this zone. COD is comparatively high and more or less constant.
:In this region we have both stress discontinuity and displacement discontinuity.
;Fracture process zone
: situated just interior to the True crack region where crack is initiating and propagating.
In this zone at crack tip, we have peak stress = tensile strength of concrete.&lt;ref&gt;Bažant, Z. P. (2004) “Scaling theory of quaisbrittle structural failure.” ''Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci., USA'' 101 (37), 13397-13399&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the FPZ stress is continuous and displacement is discontinuous.

Crack propagation in FPZ starts when critical stress is equal to tensile strength of concrete and as crack starts propagating, stress does not become zero. Using the plot of fracture energy versus crack width, we can calculate critical stress at any point including crack tip. So one of the major drawbacks of LEFM is overcome using fracture energy approach. Direction of [[crack propagation]] can also be determined by identifying the direction of maximum [[energy release rate]].

;Concept of characteristic length
:Hillerborg defined a parameter called Hillerborg characteristic length(&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;) which is numerically expressed as,

::&lt;math&gt;l=\frac{EG}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=epfl&gt;{{cite web
| url        = http://ibeton.epfl.ch/Etudiant/et_doct-11/Courses/2011-11-23%20Topic%207%20Fracture.pdf
| title      = Fracture Mechanics for Structural Concrete
| author     = 
| accessdate = {{date|13 apr 2013}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where

::&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;= characteristic length

::&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;= Young's Modulus

::&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; = fracture energy

::&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = critical stress value

Hillerborg characteristic length can be used to predict brittleness of a material. As magnitude of characteristic length decreases brittle nature dominates and vice versa.

===Crack band model===

Proposed by Bazant and Oh in 1983, this theory can well attribute materials whose homogeneous nature changes over a certain range randomly. So we select any  particular  more or less homogeneous volume for the purpose of analysis. Hence we can determine the stresses and strains. The size of this region should be several times that of maximum aggregate. Otherwise the data obtained will be of no physical significance.
Fracture Process Zone is modelled with bands of smeared crack.&lt;ref name=epfl /&gt; And to overcome the Finite Element Method unobjectivity, we use cracking criterion of fracture energy.

Crack width is estimated as the product of crack band width and element strain. 
In finite element analysis, the crack band width is the element size of fracture process path.

Based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the solar system's speed with respect to the center of the galaxy (which on short time scales can be considered constant), the [[Earth]] should be exposed to a higher flux of dark matter particles around June&amp;nbsp;2,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} when its [[orbital speed]] is added to the one of the solar system with respect to the [[galaxy]] and to a smaller one around December&amp;nbsp;2, when the two velocities are subtracted. The annual modulation signature is distinctive since the effect induced by dark matter particles must simultaneously satisfy many requirements.

==Description==
The experimental set-up was located deep underground in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]] in [[Italy]].

The experimental set-up was made by nine 9.70&amp;nbsp;kg low-radioactivity scintillating [[thallium]]-doped [[sodium iodide]]  [[crystal]]s [NaI(Tl)]. Each crystal was faced by two low-background [[photomultiplier]]s through 10&amp;nbsp;cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium foil. A plexiglas box encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A concrete neutron moderator 1&amp;nbsp;m thick largely surrounds the set-up.

==Results==
The DAMA/NaI set-up observed the annual modulation signature over 7 annual cycles (1995-2002). The presence of a model independent positive evidence in the data of DAMA/NaI was first reported by the DAMA collaboration in fall 1997 and published beginning of 1998.&lt;ref name="mod1"&gt;{{cite journal

Negative results from the [[XENON Dark Matter Search Experiment]] seem to contradict DAMA/Nal's results.&lt;ref name=sciamer&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=dama-dark-matter |title=WIMP Wars: Astronomers and physicists remain skeptical of long-standing dark matter claim |last=Matson |first=John |date=6 May 2011 |magazine=Scientific American |access-date=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Follow-up==
DAMA/NaI has been replaced by the new generation experiment, [[DAMA/LIBRA]]. These experiments are carried out by Italian and Chinese researchers.

The '''Emerson Cavitation Tunnel''' is a propeller testing facility that is part of the School of Engineering at [[Newcastle University]]. 
== Capabilities ==
The Emerson Cavitation Tunnel consists of a water circuit which flows in the vertical plane, within which propellers and other propulsion devices can be tested. The system is powered by a {{convert|300|kW|abbr=on}} pump, with a four-bladed [[impeller]] and can produce a maximum water velocity of {{convert|15.5|kn}}. The test area has a cross sectional area of {{convert|0.99|m2|abbr=on}} allowing model propellers of up to {{convert|30|cm||abbr=on}} in diameter to be tested. The pressure range of the tunnel can vary from a minimum of 7.6&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to a maximum of 106&amp;nbsp;kN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Euler number (physics)|Cavitation numbers]] of 0.5 (minimum) to 23 (maximum) can be accommodated for. Measurements can be taken using a 3 Watt, water-cooled, [[Argon]]-ion laser, a hydrophone, and two [[dynamometer]]s. A high-speed video camera is also attached with an imaging frequency of 1–10,000 frames per second. 

Funding for the tunnel's equipment is raised by numerous organisations, including the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)]] and the Scottish Universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]].

== History ==
The tunnel was first established at the University in 1949 after being disassembled and transported from Pelzerhaken, [[Germany]] after the [[Second World War]]. The tunnel arrived at the University in 1947 and over the following few years the tunnel was heavily modified. The tunnel - which was originally designed to be operated in the horizontal plane - was converted into a vertical loop tunnel and the length was reduced by half. The original observation window was modified and two more added. Because of damage, a new impeller was constructed and numerous pieces of measuring equipment were added. This equipment included [[pitot tube]]s, a [[tachometer]], [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] lighting equipment, contact meters and a [[vacuum pump]]. The tunnel was connected to an electrical supply in 1949 and entered service late in 1950, after technical problems called for recalibration of some of the instruments. The Cavitation Tunnel was housed in Newcastle University's old boiler house, where it was originally reconstructed. That location was on King's Road in the middle of the University's city centre campus between the Armstrong building, the Student Union, the Arches and the Bedson building.

In 2016, the tunnel was moved from the Newcastle University city centre campus and taken to Poland, where it was fully refurbished before being brought back to the North East and installed in a new purpose-built research centre, Marine campus at Blyth.

The first research grant of £8,000 was awarded in 1950 for the testing of a new series of [[propeller]]s, and was awarded by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)]].

In the 1970s and 1980s, the tunnel was extensively modified and upgraded in order to improve the range of propellers that could be tested. The tunnel was also renamed to its current name, the ''Emerson Cavitation Tunnel'' after Dr Arnold Emerson, who was the tunnel superintendent and the driving force behind the upgrades.

Modifications were made to the tunnel during the 1980s. New computer-based data collection, interpretation and analysis technology has been added to aid with [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Data is also collected with the help of [[Laser Doppler velocimetry|laser doppler anemometry (LDA)]] and phase doppler anemometry (PDA).

== Location ==
The tunnel is now located at Newcastle University's Marine Campus at Blyth, Northumberland.

'''Exchange bias''' or '''exchange anisotropy''' occurs in bilayers (or multilayers) of magnetic materials where the hard magnetization behavior of an [[antiferromagnetic]] thin film causes a shift in the soft magnetization curve of a [[ferromagnetic]] film.  The exchange bias phenomenon is of tremendous utility in magnetic recording, where it is used to pin the state of the readback heads of [[hard disk]] drives at exactly their point of maximum sensitivity; hence the term "bias."

==Fundamental science==

[[Image:Exchangebias.png|thumb|Easy-axis magnetization curves of a) a soft ferromagnetic film; b) an antiferromagnetic film and c) an exchange-biased bilayer consisting of a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet.  The susceptibility (slope) of the antiferromagnetic's magnetization curve is exaggerated for clarity.]]

The essential physics underlying the phenomenon is the exchange interaction between the antiferromagnet and ferromagnet at their interface.  Since antiferromagnets have a small or no net magnetization, their spin orientation is only weakly influenced by an externally applied magnetic field.  A soft ferromagnetic film which is strongly exchange-coupled to the antiferromagnet will have its interfacial spins pinned.  Reversal of the ferromagnet's moment will have an added energetic cost corresponding to the energy necessary to create a [[Néel wall|Néel domain wall]] within the antiferromagnetic film.  The added energy term implies a shift in the switching field of the ferromagnet.  Thus the magnetization curve of an exchange-biased ferromagnetic film looks like that of the normal ferromagnet except that is shifted away from the H=0 axis by an amount H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;.

In most well-studied ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers, the [[Curie temperature]] of the ferromagnet is larger than the [[Néel temperature]] T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; of the antiferromagnet.  This inequality means that the direction of the exchange bias can be set by cooling through T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of an applied magnetic field.  The moment of the magnetically ordered ferromagnet will apply an effective field to the antiferromagnet as it orders, breaking the symmetry and influencing the formation of domains.

The exchange bias effect is attributed to a ferromagnetic unidirectional anisotropy formed at the interface between different magnetic phases. Generally, the process of field cooling from higher temperature is used to obtain ferromagnetic unidirectional anisotropy in different exchange bias systems. In 2011, a large exchange bias has been realized after zero-field cooling from an unmagnetized state, which was attributed to the newly formed interface between different magnetic phases during the initial magnetization process.

Exchange [[anisotropy]] has long been poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying the dynamics of domain walls in thin antiferromagnetic films.  A naive approach to the problem would suggest the following expression for energy per unit area:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} n J_{ex} S_F S_{AF} + M_F t_F H&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the number of interfacial spins interactions per unit area, J&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt; is the exchange constant at the interface, S refers to the spin vector, M refers to the magnetization, t refers to film thickness and H is the external field.  The subscript F describes the properties of the ferromagnet and AF to the antiferromagnet.  The expression omits [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]], which is unaffected by the presence of the antiferromagnet.  At the switching field of the ferromagnet, the pinning energy represented by the first term and the Zeeman dipole coupling represented by the second term will exactly balance.  The equation then predicts that the exchange bias shift H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; will be given by the expression

&lt;math&gt;H_b = \frac{n  J_{ex}  S_F  S_{AF}}{2  M_F  t_F}&lt;/math&gt;

Many experimental findings regarding the exchange bias contradict this simple model.  For example, the magnitude of measured H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; values is typically 100 times less than that predicted by the equation for reasonable values of the parameters.  The amount of hysteresis shift H&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is not correlated with the density ''n'' of uncompensated spins in the plane of the antiferromagnet that appears at the interface.  In addition, the exchange bias effect tends to be smaller in epitaxial bilayers than in polycrystalline ones, suggesting an important role for defects.  In recent years progress in fundamental understanding has been made via [[synchrotron]] radiation based element-specific magnetic linear [[dichroism]] experiments that can image antiferromagnetic domains and frequency-dependent [[magnetic susceptibility]] measurements that can probe the dynamics.  Experiments on the Fe/FeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe/MnF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; model systems have been particularly fruitful.

==Technological impact==

Exchange bias was initially used to stabilize the magnetization of soft ferromagnetic layers in readback heads based on the anisotropic [[magnetoresistance]] (AMR) effect.  Without the stabilization, the magnetic domain state of the head could be unpredictable, leading to reliability problems.  Currently exchange bias is used to pin the harder reference layer in [[spin valve]] readback heads and [[MRAM]] memory circuits that utilize the [[giant magnetoresistance]] or [[tunnel magnetoresistance|magnetic tunneling]] effect.  Similarly the most advanced disk media are antiferromagnetically coupled, making use of interfacial exchange to effectively increase the stability of small magnetic particles whose behavior would otherwise be [[superparamagnetism|superparamagnetic.]]

Desirable properties for an exchange bias material include a high [[Néel temperature]], a large [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] and good chemical and structural compatibility with NiFe and Co, the most important ferromagnetic films.  The most technologically significant exchange bias materials have been the rocksalt-structure antiferromagnetic oxides like NiO, CoO and their alloys and the rocksalt-structure intermetallics like FeMn, NiMn, IrMn and their alloys.

==History==

Exchange anisotropy was discovered by Meiklejohn and Bean of [[General Electric]] in 1956.  The first commercial device to employ the exchange bias was [[IBM|IBM's]] [[magnetoresistance|anisotropic magnetoresistance]] (AMR) [[disk drive]] [[recording head]], which was based on a design by Hunt in the 1970s but which didn't fully displace the inductive readback head until the early 1990s.  By the mid-1990s, the [[spin valve]] head using an exchange-bias layer was well on its way to displacing the AMR head.

Fish paper is a durable, flexible, electrical insulator that's made of vulcanized fiber and used with motor windings and for gasket insulation. A lightweight dielectric paper, this electrical grade material is also a good choice for oil-filled transformers. Moisture absorption can cause fish paper to swell or curl.

The '''tenth generation of the [[Ford F-Series]]''' is a line of pickup trucks produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1995 to 2004; it was sold from model years 1997 to 2004. In a major product shift in the Ford truck lineup, the F-250 and F-350 were split from the F-150. Beginning production in early-1998 (model year 1999) the newly branded [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] trucks had a distinct body and chassis, while still branded as F-Series trucks.

This generation of the F-Series was also sold by Lincoln as the [[Lincoln Blackwood|Blackwood]] for the model year 2002 (2002-2003 in Mexico). In Mexico, the F-150 was rebranded as the '''Ford Lobo''' from 2004 to 2010, when it was replaced by the [[Ford F-Series twelfth generation|twelfth-generation model]].

== Development ==
In late 1989, during mid-stage development of a facelift due in late-1991 for model year 1992, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] commenced the PN-96 program on a new truck platform and designated Thomas Baughman as chief engineer. In mid-1990, Andrew Jacobson was designated as design director for the PN-96 truck program. By 1991, designers had developed clay models indicative of car like styling, based on a new design theme. Despite the disapproval from focus groups towards "softer" styling, during 1991 and 1992 in concept design clinics, Ford management backed the "aero" design philosophy. The end result by Bob Aikins reached in November 1992 and frozen for production in February 1993, took the aero styling further with a rounded nose on the new F-series. The PN-96 mules went into testing 1993, with prototypes running from early 1994. Pilot production began in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99289998/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford Truck Design 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PN-96 Development" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=InCRk-VZ-HQC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=1997+f150+designe |page=7 |title=Ford F-150 Pickup 1997-2005: America's Best-Selling Truck |first=Robert |last=Ackerson  |publisher=Veloce |year=2005 |isbn=9781904788867 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=POUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+spy+ford |title=Detroit Spy Report |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=114 |first=Jim |last=Dunne |date=April 1994 |volume=171 |issue=4 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NWYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+spy+for |page=35 |title=Detroit Spy Report |journal=Popular Mechanics |first=Jim |last=Dunne |date=May 1995 |volume=172 |issue=5 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_mMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=popular+mechanics+spy+ford |page=42 |title=Detroit Spy Report |journal=Popular Mechanics |first=Jim |last=Dunne |date=August 1995 |volume=172 |issue=8 |accessdate=March 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1997–2004 ==
Being the F-150's first major redesign since 1979, the redesigned truck went on a nationwide 87-stop tour to Ford plants and the external part suppliers in October 1995, prior to its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17610463.html |title=Ford plants and suppliers get sneak peek at 1997 Ford F-150 |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=1995-10-16 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build anticipation for the redesigned truck, the 1997 model was released in January 1996 with the first ad campaigns airing during [[Super Bowl XXX]]. Because of the radical styling, Ford predicted from marketing clinics that traditional truck buyers would not receive the radical and car-like 1997 well, so it continued to produce and sell the previous 1996 model alongside the redesigned 1997 model for a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6357019_ITM |title=Article: Contractors eyeball new pickup from Ford, like what they see |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=1996-02-05 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of body options were available: the 2-3 passenger regular cab and the 5-6 passenger SuperCab, {{convert|8|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|6.5|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} beds, and a choice of Styleside or Flareside beds on {{convert|6.5|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} models. A new [[Ford Lightning|Lightning]] was introduced in March 1999, and [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[King Ranch]] versions were also created for the 2000 and 2001 model years, respectively. In 2000, the SuperCrew cab was introduced with four full-size doors for the 2001 model year. A Sport 4x4 model was introduced in 2000 as well. It featured the 5.4L Triton V8 and color-matched bumpers and mirror housings, and was available in regular cab and SuperCab in four colors: white, red, black, and silver. In 2002, an FX4 model was introduced, which came with skid plates, a carbon steel frame, [[Tenneco Automotive|Rancho]] shock absorbers, and unique 17" aluminum wheels along with more standard features that were optional on XLT. In 2003, a sporty STX trim package was introduced, aimed at younger truck buyers. The STX package featured color-keyed front/rear bumpers along with clear lens headlights and integrated round fog lamps. The package also featured chrome step rails, 17" chrome wheels, and a Kenwood Z828 stereo was installed in place of the standard Ford radio. Also in 2003, a special trim package "Heritage Edition" version with special badging was produced to mark the 100th anniversary of Ford trucks, available only in the 139" wheelbase SuperCab model.

Sales of the F-150 surged in the tenth generation from 750,000 to over 900,000 in 2001 as products from [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] lagged. Ford's sales dropped, however, for the final years of this generation as the redesigned [[Dodge Ram]] and refreshed [[Chevrolet Silverado]] were released.

The new F-150 was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/truck/truck_of_the_year_winners/index.html |title=Truck of the Year Winners List |work=Motor Trend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A minor facelift was introduced September 1998, with minor interior updates for 1999 models. In February 2000, the SuperCrew was added to the lineup early in the 2001 MY (Model Year), entering production on December 13, 1999. Ford also manufactured a limited run of "Heritage" (differentiated from the 2003 "Heritage Edition") F-150s of the 2003 body style to August 2004 as 2004 models to finish out production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carenthusiast.com/2000/shows/la2000/articles/ford/f150_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/supercrew-may-force-ford-juggle-mix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fleet.ford.com/truckbbas/topics/whatnew2000.html#f150&lt;/ref&gt;

This generation of F-150 was sold in Mexico alongside the new [[Ford_F-Series_(eleventh_generation)|11th generation]] F-Series through 2008. It was only available as a Regular Cab and in XL trim, while the newer model was available in more trims, SuperCab and SuperCrew configurations and the new model was badged as Lobo, while the older model retained the F-150 name.

==Powertrain==
A new lineup of improved efficiency engines were offered beginning for 1997. A 4.2 L OHV [[V6 engine|V6]], based on Ford's [[Ford Essex V6 engine (Canadian)|3.8 L Essex V6]], replaced the 4.9 L OHV [[Straight-six engine|I6]], while 4.6 and 5.4 liter SOHC V8s replaced the 5.0 and 5.8 liter OHV V8s. The 4.6 and 5.4 liter V8s were marketed under the name Triton and mark the first use of Ford's [[Ford Modular engine|Modular]] [[Single overhead camshaft|Single Overhead Cam (SOHC)]] engines in the F-series pickups. Ford's own 8.8 IFS replaced the [[Dana 44]] front end, while the Ford 8.8 rear remained. The Ford Sterling 9.75 axle was also optioned in heavy-duty versions. In 2000, the [[Sterling 10.5 axle|Sterling 10.25 axle]] became an option.

==Safety==
This generation F-150 received an overall "Poor" rating by the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) in the frontal offset test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iihs.org/ratings/rating.aspx?id=7 |title=Ford F-150, 1997–2004 models |publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety |date=September 2, 2005 |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ranked the ''2nd Worst Performing Vehicle'' behind the [[GM U platform#Second Generation Minivans|1997–2005 GM U-platform minivans]].

Ford has found that the cruise control system in many of their trucks could catch fire, because the switch system could corrode over time, overheat and ignite. Ignition was later blamed on spillage from the adjacent master cylinder. On March 5, 2007 Ford recalled 155,000 2003 full-size pickups and full-size SUVs for the defective part. During the previous two years Ford had recalled 5.8 million vehicles in because of the defective cruise control systems in trucks, SUVs and [[van]]s. That recall, one of the largest in history, covered vehicles from the 1994–2002 model years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonauto.com/complaints/ford/ford_f150.htm |title=Ford F150 Recall Information – Ford Recalls &amp; Problems |publisher=Lemonauto.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

===F-250 (1997-1998)===
[[File:'97-'98 Ford F-250 Extended Cab.jpg|thumb|1997-1998 Ford F-250 XLT SuperCab]]
At its January 1996 launch, the 1997 PN96 F-Series was only offered as a F-150; the F-250 and F-350 were produced as 1996 models on the previous-generation chassis.  To bridge the gap between the F-150 and the heavier-duty pickups, a PN96 version of the F-250 was introduced nearly a year later (though also a 1997 model), slotted between the F-150 and the F-250HD of the previous-generation chassis.  While nearly externally indentical to the F-150, the F-250 gained increased load capability from a [[Sterling 10.5 axle|heavy-duty rear axle]] and load-leveling rear suspension; the F-250 was distinguished by 7-bolt wheel rims.  

The PN-96 F-250 was marketed in 1997 and 1998, with Ford offering two generations of the vehicle under the same nameplate.  For 1999, the F-250HD and F-350 were replaced by the [[Ford Super Duty|Super Duty]] F-Series; the suspension components of the PN-96 F-250 continued as a "7700" option package from 2000 to 2003.

===SVT Lightning (1999-2004)===
[[File:Ford-F150-SVT-Lightning.jpg|thumb|2001-2003 Ford F-150 SVT Lightning]]The '''Ford SVT Lightning''' is a [[sport car|sports]]/performance version of the F-150, developed by the [[Ford SVT|SVT]] (Special Vehicle Team) division of Ford.  For 1999, the second generation of the Lightning was released using the PN96 platform, after a three year hiatus of the model line.  As with its 1993-1995 predecessor, the Lightning was based on the F-150; all versions were produced with a regular cab, rear-wheel drive, and a 6½-foot bed length.  In sharp contrast to its predecessor, the 1999-2002 Lightning was given a payload of 800 pounds (half the payload of a Ranger); for 2003, the figure was raised to 1,350 pounds.  

While the first-generation Lightning chassis was a hybrid of the F-150 and F-250, to save weight and lower its cost, the second-generation adopted the stock F-150 frame.  To improve handling, while the stock [[Double wishbone suspension|short/long arm]] front suspension configuration was used, the Lighting was lowered one inch with a 31mm stabilizer bar; the rear solid axle with leaf springs was lowered two inches, using a 23mm stabilizer bar.  Monroe shocks were used from 1999 to 2001; Bilstein shocks were used from 2002 to 2004. In place of the 17-inch wheels of its predecessor, the second-generation Lightning was given 18-inch wheels with Goodyear Eagle F1 directional tires developed for the truck.  

The second-generation Lightning was powered by a 5.4 L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Triton]] SOHC V8 equipped with an Eaton M112 supercharger.  At its launch, the Lightning produced {{convert|360|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|440|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque, increased to {{convert|380|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|ft.lbf|N.m|0|abbr=on}} of torque (under 8 psi boost) in 2001.  The supercharged V8 was paired with a 4-speed [[Ford C6 transmission#4R100|Ford 4R100]] overdrive automatic transmission (shared with the 5.4L V8, 6.8L V10, and 7.3L diesel).  From 1999 to 2000, the rear axle ratio was 3.55:1, shortened to 3.75:1 in 2001.  The same year, a 4.5-inch aluminum driveshaft replaced a 3.5-inch steel unit.  

Following the 2001 drivetrain revisions, [[Car and Driver|''Car and Driver'']] magazine tested a Lightning, accelerating from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 5.2 seconds.  

During its production, the 1999-2004 was offered in a limited variety of colors.  Initially produced in Bright Red, Black, and White, for 2000, Silver was introduced.  For 2002, True Blue (a very dark blue) was introduced, but was replaced by a lighter Sonic Blue for 2003, along with Dark Shadow Gray.  

The Ford SVT Lightning was manufactured by [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford of Canada]] at its [[Ontario Truck]] facility in [[Oakville, Ontario]]; in was closed in 2004.  Special features specific to the Lightning included:&lt;ref&gt;2001 Ford Lightning Owner's Guide Supplement - Printed October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lincoln Blackwood (2002) ===
[[File:2002 Lincoln Blackwood 1.jpg|thumb|2002 Lincoln Blackwood ]]
For 2002, the [[Lincoln Motor Company|Lincoln-Mercury]] division of Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Blackwood]], the first pickup truck ever sold by the Lincoln brand.  Brought into production after a positive reception to a 1999 concept vehicle, the Blackwood was a variant of the Ford F-150 SuperCrew introduced for 2001.  

Styled with the front fascia of the [[Lincoln Navigator]] SUV, the Blackwood diverged from the F-150 in terms of functionality.  In place of a pickup bed, the Blackwood was given a stainless-steel cargo area lined with carpet covered with a power-operated [[Tonneau cover|tonneau]]; the plastic body panels of the pickup bed were styled as black wood with pinstripes.  To match the simulated wood design of the pickup bed, Lincoln offered black as the only body color for the Blackwood.  Sharing its interior with the Navigator, the Blackwood was fitted with four seats (with a center console between the rear seats).

Equipped only with rear-wheel drive, the Blackwood shared its 300 hp 5.4L 32-valve V8 with the Navigator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3163">A '''gas dynamic laser''' ('''GDL''') is a [[laser]] based on differences in relaxation velocities of molecular vibrational states. The lasing medium gas has such properties that an energetically lower [[Molecular vibration|vibrational state]] relaxes faster than a higher vibrational state, and so a [[population inversion]] is achieved in a particular time. It was invented by [[Edward Gerry]] and [[Arthur Kantrowitz]] at [[Avco Everett Research Laboratory]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osa-opn.org/home/articles/volume_21/issue_1/features/history_of_gas_lasers,_part_1%E2%80%94continuous_wave_gas/#.UZLRTrvLg0h Optics &amp; Photonics News] Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure gas dynamic lasers usually use a combustion chamber, supersonic expansion [[nozzle]], and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], in a mixture with [[nitrogen]] or [[helium]], as the [[active laser medium|laser medium]].

Gas dynamic lasers can be [[Laser pumping|pumped]] by [[combustion]] or [[adiabatic expansion]] of gas. Any hot and compressed gas with appropriate vibrational structure could be utilized.

The '''explosively pumped gas dynamic laser''' is a version of GDL pumped by expansion of explosion products. [[Hexanitrobenzene]] and/or [[tetranitromethane]] with metal powder is the preferred explosive. This device could have very high pulsed peak power output suitable for [[directed energy weapon|laser weapon]]s.

==Function==
[[Image:Gas dynamic laser.png|thumb|Gas dynamic laser components and function]]
# Hot compressed gas is generated.
# Gas expands through subsonic or supersonic expansion nozzle, the temperature of the gas becomes lower and according to [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] the gas isn't in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] until the vibrational states relax.
# The gas flows through the tube of a particular length for a particular time. In this time lower vibrational state does relax but higher vibrational state doesn't. Thus population inversion is achieved.
# Gas flows through mirror area where [[stimulated emission]] takes place.
# Gas returns to equilibrium and becomes warm. It must be removed from the [[Optical cavity|laser cavity]] or it will interfere with the thermodynamics and vibrational state relaxation of the freshly expanded gas.

== Application ==
Almost any [[chemical laser]] uses gas-dynamic processes to increase its efficiency. 
 
High [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] (as high as 30%) and very high power output make GDL suitable for some (especially military) applications.

The '''Georgian Bay Land Trust''' (GBLT) is a not-for-profit, registered charity, whose goal is to protect the uniqueness of the eastern shore and [[North Channel (Ontario)]] of [[Georgian Bay]] through the securement and ongoing stewardship of land that has [[ecological]], geological and historical importance.

Through this work, the GBLT works to educate and promote the importance of this area. The GBLT is one of 45 land trusts working in Ontario to protect important private land from development and loss of native habitats and flora and fauna. As one of the first land trusts in Ontario, GBLT has been a leader in many facets, helping to promote the land trust movement and support other land trusts in their interests and activities in other areas throughout the province.

Since forming in 1991, the GBLT has secured and currently stewards over {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} that have come to the Trust via donations, purchases, conservation [[easements]] and a lease. Currently, both independently and in partnership with the [[Nature Conservancy of Canada]], our land protection committee is actively involved in discovering new opportunities and assessing these opportunities with the goals and objectives of the Trust and the funds available to purchase, if necessary and steward these potential projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10275">Electrical devices are considered '''grid friendly''' if they operate in a manner that supports electrical [[Electric power transmission|power grid]] reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Ning Lu; Hammerstrom, D.J.; , "Design Considerations for Frequency Responsive Grid Friendly&amp;trade; Appliances," Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition, 2005/2006 IEEE PES , vol., no., pp.647-652, 21–24 May 2006 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1668573&amp;isnumber=34941]&lt;/ref&gt;  Basic grid-friendly devices may incorporate features that work to offset short-term undesirable changes in line [[frequency]] or [[voltage]]; more sophisticated devices may alter their operating profile based on the current market price for electricity, reducing load when prices are at a peak.  Grid-friendly devices can include [[major appliance]]s found in homes, commercial building systems such as [[HVAC]], and many industrial systems.

== Frequency Response ==

Most electric systems use [[alternating current]] with a nominal frequency of 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz ([[hertz]]) to deliver [[energy]] produced by [[electrical generator]]s to the electricity consumers.  When the amount of [[electric power]] produced by the generators exceeds the power used by the customers, the frequency of the electricity rises.  Conversely, when the amount of electric power produced is less than what is consumed, the frequency drops.  Therefore frequency is an accurate indicator of the system-wide (called ''global'') balance between supply and demand.  Without grid-friendly frequency response, the rate at which the frequency changes is dependent principally on the system's total [[inertia]] (which is not very controllable) and the aggregate response of the generators' [[control system]]s (which can only be controlled relatively slowly).  In contrast, grid-friendly devices can act very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Ning Lu; Hammerstrom, D.J.; , "Design Considerations for Frequency Responsive Grid Friendly&amp;trade; Appliances," Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition, 2005/2006 IEEE PES , vol., no., pp.647-652, 21–24 May 2006 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1668573&amp;isnumber=34941]&lt;/ref&gt;

A grid-friendly device can respond to changes in frequency by reducing or interrupting the demand for electric power (called ''load'') when the frequency drops below a certain threshold, and/or increasing load when the frequency rises.  Although a single grid-friendly device may be a very small load, the fraction of the total load that can be controlled by frequency at any time is usually sufficient to provide under-frequency protection to the system before more drastic measures like black-outs are required.&lt;ref&gt;Ning Lu; Hammerstrom, D.J.; , "Design Considerations for Frequency Responsive Grid Friendly&amp;trade; Appliances," Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exhibition, 2005/2006 IEEE PES , vol., no., pp.647-652, 21–24 May 2006 [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1668573&amp;isnumber=34941]&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantage of grid-friendly frequency response is that frequency is ubiquitous on an electric system.  When a generator shuts down in one part of the system, all the loads everywhere in the system can simultaneously detect the change and respond instantly and appropriately without the need for a control system to detect the problem, a control center to make a decision, or a [[telecommunications network]] to deliver commands to millions of devices.  This type of behavior changes frequency from a simple [[electrodynamic]] and control systems input to an [[emergent property]].  While there is still some controversy on the subject, it is believed that [[complex systems]] utilizing self-regulation through emergence are generally more resilient and flexible than are simpler top-down command and control systems.

== Voltage Response ==

In contrast to frequency, voltage varies widely throughout electric systems, because it is the voltage difference between two devices that largely determines the direction and magnitude of the [[Current (electricity)|current]] (hence the power) that flows between them.  Therefore voltage is a more local phenomenon, and grid-friendly devices that respond to voltage will support more local aspects of the electric delivery system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iee.tu-clausthal.de/fileadmin/downloads/Poster-SmartGrids.pdf Voltage Level as Information Carrier in Smart Distribution Networks]&lt;/ref&gt; However, load types such as thermally protected induction motors and power electronics can respond poorly to significant voltage changes.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Heng. "Cascaded stalling of induction motors in fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR)." ''Univ. Wisconsin-Madison, ECE Depart.''(2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kundu, Soumya, and Ian A. Hiskens. "Overvoltages due to synchronous tripping of plug-in electric-vehicle chargers following voltage dips." ''IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery'' 29.3 (2014): 1147-1156.&lt;/ref&gt; When a sufficient fraction of the power demand in a region is composed of such loads, their collective response can lead to fault-induced delayed voltage recovery behavior, which may have adverse effects on transmission system reliability and may require mitigation to avoid initiating system outages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quint|first=R.|last2=Kosterev|first2=D.|last3=Undrill|first3=J.|last4=Eto|first4=J.|last5=Bravo|first5=R.|last6=Wen|first6=J.|date=July 2016|title=Power quality requirements for electric vehicle chargers: Bulk power system perspective|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7741443/|journal=2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/pesgm.2016.7741443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Price Response ==

While frequency and voltage respond to physical phenomena on the electric system, grid-friendly price response is designed to address economic phenomena.  With the increasing application of electricity markets to manage the efficient distribution of electric power, more consumers are exposed to electricity prices that change over time, rather than fixed for months or years.  In general, higher prices occur at times when the electric system is running short of supply.  The purpose of grid-friendly price response is to promote [[demand response]] among electricity consumers.  Demand response is one means of reducing the [[market power]] of electricity suppliers when production runs short.  Grid-friendly response to price also allows consumers to reduce their energy costs by using less electricity when prices are high, and more electricity when prices are low.&lt;ref&gt;D.

==Demonstrated Results==

A demonstration of grid-friendly technology was conducted for the [[United States Department of Energy]] in 2006 and 2007 in the Northwest region of the United States.  Participants included local utilities, residential and commercial customers, industrial loads belonging to municipalities, and a number of vendors and researchers.  The grid-friendly technology demonstration showed that common residential appliances did automatically detect grid problems expressed as frequency deviations and reduced energy consumption at critical moments.  The Olympic Peninsula demonstration showed that residential, commercial, and industrial loads did adjust their consumption patterns based on price signals emanating from a distribution-level market operated as a double action.  Both of these projects showed how grid-friendly technologies can and do reduce pressure on the electric grid during time of peak demand.&lt;ref&gt;D. Hammerstrom et al. (2007).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">{{short description|Ancient Chinese name for cataclysmic variable stars}}
In [[Chinese astronomy]], a '''guest star''' ({{zh|c=客星|p=kèxīng|l=guest star}}) is a [[star]] which has suddenly appeared in a place where no star had previously been observed and becomes invisible again after some time. The term is a literal translation from [[Chinese astronomy#Early history|ancient Chinese astronomical]] records.

Modern astronomy recognizes that guest stars are manifestations of cataclysmic [[variable star]]s: [[nova]]e and [[supernova]]e. The term "guest star" is used in the context of ancient records, since the exact classification of an astronomical event in question is based on interpretations of old records, including inference, rather than on direct observations. 

In ancient Chinese astronomy, guest stars were one of the three types of highly transient objects (bright heavenly bodies); the other two (彗星, ''huixing'', “broom star”, a comet with a tail; and ''xing bo'', “fuzzy star”, a comet without a tail) being [[comet]]s in modern understanding.&lt;ref name=XUandPANKENIER/&gt; The earliest Chinese record of guest stars is contained in ''[[Han Shu]]'' (漢書), the history of [[Han Dynasty]] (206 [[Common Era|BCE]] &amp;ndash; 220 [[Common Era|CE]]), and all subsequent dynastic histories had such records.&lt;ref name=XUandPANKENIER&gt;Zhentao Xu, David W. Pankenier (2000) "East-Asian [[Archaeoastronomy]]: Historical Records of Astronomical Observations of China, Japan, and Korea", {{ISBN|90-5699-302-X}}, Chapter 6, "Guest Stars"&lt;/ref&gt; These contain one of the clearest early descriptions consistent with a supernova, posited to be left over by object [[SN 185]], thus identified as a supernova remnant of the exact year 185 CE.&lt;ref name=Zhao

From the 1990s to the present, Duncan has advocated for nuclear industrial development in Australia, specifically the development of facilities to store and dispose of [[Radioactive waste|nuclear waste]] and the legalization and development of [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear power plants]] for the generation of [[electricity]].

== Career ==
[[File:Olympic dam rd1.jpg|thumb|Monument marking the first hole drilled into the Olympic Dam IOCGU deposit (commenced 13 June 1975).]]
Duncan joined Western Mining Corporation (WMC Resources) in 1971 and remained with the company for 27 years. He commenced as operations manager of the company's exploration division, and rose to General Manager of the [[Olympic Dam mine]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessnews.com.au/article/Duncan-joins-Energy-Ventures|title=Duncan joins Energy Ventures|date=2005-10-11|work=Business News|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Nuclear power ==
During the 2000s and 2010s, Duncan advocated for the development of [[nuclear power in Australia]].  

In 2005, Duncan described the status of breeder reactors as seeing "little advancement". He told the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] that "There is abundant uranium to meet all future requirements for light water reactors that are planned around the world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That year he also became a non-executive director of Perth-based company, Energy Ventures Ltd.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As of 2017, the company owns various uranium and energy exploration and development projects in Australia and internationally. The most advanced of these is the Aurora Uranium project in Oregon, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/ASX:EVE/Energy-Ventures-/timeline/|title=Proactive Investors Limited - Energy Ventures Share Price - EVE, RNS News, Articles, Quotes, &amp; Charts (ASX:EVE, EVE.AX)|work=Proactiveinvestors UK|access-date=2017-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Duncan described opponents of nuclear power as often using the subject of nuclear waste as a "tool". He argued that "due to global progress and example, the disposal of nuclear waste need not be a showstopper for nuclear power in Australia."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

In 2009, Duncan told ''[[The Age]]'' that he thought it was "time to seriously think about nuclear power as part of the baseload electricity generation. It's time that we moved along from the caveman attitude of just picking up and burning things. We should move to a higher order of source of energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au//breaking-news-national/its-time-for-nuclear-power-experts-20090715-dlac.html|title=It's time for nuclear power: experts|last=Alexander|first=Cathy|date=2009-07-15|work=The Age|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also referred to nuclear power as clean electricity with virtually no greenhouse gas emissions. He estimated that Australia's first nuclear power station could cost $6-8 billion and take ten years to design, build and commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/garretts-beds-are-burning-critics-20090715-dkn5.html|title=Garrett's beds are burning: critics|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Duncan spoke at an event in Western Australia hosted by CEDA entitled "Assessing the Prospects of Nuclear Power in Australia". Michael Angwin of the [[Australian Uranium Association]] and Daniela Stehlik of the [[National Academies Forum]] also spoke at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceda.com.au/Events/Library/Past-Events1/W100419|title=CEDA - Assessing the Prospects of Nuclear Power in Australia|website=www.ceda.com.au|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Duncan told an Australian Institute of Energy Syposium held by the Perth Branch that he predicted that Australia's first nuclear reactors would be [[Light-water reactor|light-water reactors]] with a 600–1200 MWe capacity each, built in pairs, with sea water cooled condensers. They would be fueled with [[enriched uranium]] and [[spent nuclear fuel]] would ultimately be disposed of into ancient and stable underground rock storage facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aie.org.au/AIE/Documents/Vol28No3.pdf|title=Nuclear: The elephant in the energy room|last=Meaton|first=Claire|date=2010-09-01|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Fukushima ===
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear disaster]], Duncan remained optimistic about the prospect of nuclear power in Australia.

In 2013, he wrote that "if the economics for electricity generation is impacted by a carbon tax or a compulsory carbon capture and sequestration, then nuclear generation will be economically competitive."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atse.org.au/Documents/Events/nuclear-energy-australia/ab-duncan-ian.pdf|title=Nuclear Regulator for Australia|last=Duncan|first=Ian|date=|website=|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At a conference entitled "Nuclear Power for Australia?" held by ATSE in July of that year, he argued that if Australia were to aspire to produce electricity with nuclear power plants, a new Commonwealth agency 'inspectorate' with regulatory control over the choice of technology, siting, construction and operation should be established by 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He proposed the working title Nuclear Installations Regulator for Australia (NIRA) and presented a detailed timeline of potential milestones to achieve between 2013 and criticality for the first reactor in 2030. His presentation flagged "Restart nuclear debate" as a first step, during the period 2014-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atse.org.au/Documents/Events/nuclear-energy-australia/pr-duncan-ian.pdf|title=Nuclear Installations Regulator for Australia (NIRA)|last=Duncan|first=Ian|date=2017-07-01|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, a [[Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission]] commenced in South Australia tasked with investigating the opportunities and risks associated with South Australia's future role in the nuclear fuel cycle. Duncan's submission to the Royal Commission identified areas of the state's coastline he believed were potentially suitable for the siting of nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/the-nuclear-royal-commission-has-drawn-submissions-from-around-the-world-with-strong-opinions-on-both-sides-of-the-debate/news-story/ed38c38ffdef74da61ea134748b35224|title=SA Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission draws submissions from around the world|last=England|first=Cameron|date=2015-08-11|work=The Advertiser|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Nuclear waste ==
Duncan was a Member of the [[Synroc|SYNROC]] Steering Committee (whose work was based on research and development undertaken by ANSTO and the ANU).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

In 2002, after his retirement, Duncan completed a doctorate at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] considering the "interface between society and the disposal of radioactive waste". His publication was entitled "''Radioactive Waste: Risk, Reward, Space and Time Dynamics"'' and he followed it with opinion pieces and media commentary on the subject during the early 2000s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2003 he anticipated that "by far the biggest advancement will come from a better understanding of the public psyche by industry and not by a better understanding of the industry by the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atse.org.au/publications/focus/focus-duncan2.htm|title=What to do with Nuclear Waste|date=2003-10-08|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008170237/http://www.atse.org.au/publications/focus/focus-duncan2.htm|archivedate=2003-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he made the claim that "the Premier that supports the siting of a national repository will probably be remembered as the statesman who cleaned up Australia!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the mid-2000s Duncan was actively consulting in the area,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atse.org.au/index9729.html|title=ATSE - Duncan 140|website=pandora.nla.gov.au|access-date=2017-10-28|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/30565/20071029-0000/www.atse.org.au/index9729.html|archivedate=2007-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/expert/realexpert/nuclearpower/07.htm|title=Nuclear Power - Ask a Real Expert - Ask an expert - The Lab - Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Gateway to Science|website=www.abc.net.au|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was consulted during the Uranium Mining, Processing and Nuclear Energy Review (UMPNER) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=URANIUM MINING, PROCESSING AND NUCLEAR ENERGY — OPPORTUNITIES FOR AUSTRALIA?|last=|first=|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2006|isbn=0-9803115-0-0|location=Canberra, ACT|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Duncan maintained the view that Australia had an obligation to appropriately manage its own, domestically produced nuclear waste. In an article published in ''Focus'', the magazine of ATSE, he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is no justification for the importation of other countries’ radioactive waste, nor for participation in any so called ‘international attempts’ at nuclear waste disposal. Our moral obligation is to properly dispose of our own waste and that is achievable."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2015 Duncan was appointed to the Independent Advisory Panel of the National Radioactive Waste Management Project for the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]. 

In September 2016, Duncan gave a presentation on the work of the Royal Commission and the National Radioactive Waste Management Project to members of the Minerals, Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Division of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. During his talk he mentioned that 40 years had transpired since the [[Flower's Report]] was published in the UK, which prompted environmental consideration of the fate of nuclear wastes and their future management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iom3.org/sites/default/files/MP%26EM%20Newsletter_Issue%205_March%202017.pdf|title=MP&amp;EM Newsletter Issue 5 : March 2017|last=Brooks|first=Mike|date=2017-03-01|website=|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">In [[semiconductor]] manufacturing, a '''low-κ''' is a material with a small [[relative dielectric constant]] relative to [[silicon dioxide]]. Although the proper symbol for the relative dielectric constant is the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[Kappa|κ]] (kappa), in conversation such materials are referred to as being "low-k" (low-kay) rather than "low-κ" (low-kappa). Low-κ [[dielectric]] material implementation is one of several strategies used to allow continued scaling of microelectronic devices, colloquially referred to as extending [[Moore's law]]. In digital [[electrical network|circuits]], insulating dielectrics separate the conducting parts (wire [[interconnect]]s and [[transistor]]s) from one another. As components have scaled and transistors have gotten closer together, the insulating dielectrics have thinned to the point where charge build up and [[crosstalk]] adversely affect the performance of the device. Replacing the silicon dioxide with a low-κ dielectric of the same thickness reduces [[parasitic capacitance]], enabling faster switching speeds and lower heat dissipation.

==Low-κ materials==
The relative dielectric constant of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the insulating material still used in [[silicon]] chips, is 3.9. This number is the ratio of the [[permittivity]] of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; divided by permittivity of vacuum, ε&lt;sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;/ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,where ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.854×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; pF/μm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S. M. |last=Sze |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4unkmHBHb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Physics of Semiconductor Devices |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2007 |isbn=0-471-14323-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many materials with lower relative dielectric constants but few of them can be suitably integrated into a manufacturing process. Development efforts have focused primarily on the following classes of materials:

===Fluorine-doped silicon dioxide===
{{Main|Fluorosilicate glass}}
By doping SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with fluorine to produce fluorinated silica glass, the relative dielectric constant is lowered from 3.9 to 3.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-9317(01)00586-X|title=Integration of fluorine-doped silicon oxide in copper pilot line for 0.12-μm technology|year=2002|last1=Reynard|first1=J|journal=Microelectronic Engineering|volume=60|page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluorine-doped oxide materials were used for the [[180 nanometer|180 nm]] and [[130 nanometer|130 nm]] technology nodes.&lt;ref name=Ozin2006&gt;{{cite web |title=Materials chemistry for low-k materials |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702106713876 |website=Materials Today |pages=22–31 |language=en |doi=10.1016/S1369-7021(06)71387-6 |date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organosilicate glass or OSG (Carbon-doped oxide or CDO)===
By doping SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon, one can lower the relative dielectric constant to 3.0, the density to 1.4 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the thermal conductivity to 0.39 W/(m*K). The [[semiconductor industry]] has been using the organosilicate glass dielectrics since the [[90 nanometer|90]] nm technology node.&lt;ref name=Maex2004 /&gt;

===Porous silicon dioxide===
Various methods may be employed to create voids or pores in a silicon dioxide dielectric.&lt;ref name=Ozin2006 /&gt; Voids can have a relative dielectric constant of nearly 1, thus the dielectric constant of the porous material may be reduced by increasing the porosity of the film. Relative dielectric constants lower than 2.0 have been reported. Integration difficulties related to porous silicon dioxide implementation include low mechanical strength and difficult integration with etch and polish processes.

===Porous organosilicate glass (carbon-doped oxide)===
Porous organosilicate materials are usually obtained by a two-step procedure&lt;ref name="Maex2004"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shamiryan |first1=D. |last2=Abell |first2=T. |last3=Iacopi |first3=F. |last4=Maex |first4=K. |title=Low-k dielectric materials |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369702104000537 |website=Materials Today |publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the first step consists of the co-deposition of a labile organic phase (known as porogen) together with an organosilicate phase resulting in an organic-inorganic [[hybrid material]]. In the second step, the organic phase is decomposed by [[UV curing]] or [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] at a temperature of up to 400°C, leaving behind pores in the organosilicate low-κ materials. Porous organosilicate glasses have been employed since the [[45 nanometer|45]] nm technology node. &lt;ref name="Dubois2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Volksen |first1=W. |last2=Miller |first2=R.D. |last3=Dubois |first3=G. |title=Low Dielectric Constant Materials |journal=Chemical Reviews |date=2010 |volume=110 |issue=1 |page=58 |doi=10.1021/cr9002819 |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr9002819#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spin-on organic polymeric dielectrics===
Polymeric dielectrics are generally deposited by a spin-on approach, which is traditionally used for the deposition of [[photoresist]] materials, rather than [[chemical vapor deposition]]. Integration difficulties include low mechanical strength, [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE) mismatch and thermal stability. Some examples of spin-on organic low-κ polymers are [[polyimide]], [[polynorbornenes]], [[benzocyclobutene]], and [[PTFE]].

===Spin-on silicon based polymeric dielectric===
There are two kinds of silicon based polymeric dielectric materials, [[hydrogen silsesquioxane]] (HSQ) and methylsilsesquioxane (MSQ).

'''Mendelevium''' is a [[synthetic element]] with [[chemical symbol]] '''Md''' ([[#rename|formerly Mv]]) and [[atomic number]] 101. A metallic [[radioactive]] [[transuranic]] element in the [[actinide]] series, it is the first element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through [[neutron]] bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth [[transuranic element]]. It can only be produced in [[particle accelerator]]s by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen [[isotopes of mendelevium|mendelevium isotopes]] are known, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a [[half-life]] of 51&amp;nbsp;days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md (half-life 1.17&amp;nbsp;[[hour]]s) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.

Mendelevium was discovered by bombarding [[einsteinium]] with [[alpha particle]]s in 1955, the same method still used to produce it today. It was named after [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], father of the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements. Using available [[microgram]] quantities of the isotope einsteinium-253, over a million mendelevium atoms may be produced each hour. The chemistry of mendelevium is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced mendelevium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.

==Discovery==
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|left|upright|The 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, [[University of California, Berkeley]], in August 1939|alt=Black-and-white picture of heavy machinery with two operators sitting aside]]
Mendelevium was the ninth [[transuranic element]] to be synthesized. It was first [[discovery of the chemical elements|synthesized]] by [[Albert Ghiorso]], [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Gregory Robert Choppin]], Bernard G. Harvey, and team leader [[Stanley G. Thompson]] in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md ([[half-life]] of 77 minutes&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;) when they bombarded an &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;[[einsteinium|Es]] target consisting of only a [[1,000,000,000|billion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) einsteinium atoms with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium]] nuclei) in the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]]'s 60-inch [[cyclotron]], thus increasing the target's atomic number by two. &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time. In total, seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced.&lt;ref name=discovery&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.98.1518|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e53sNAOXrdMC&amp;pg=PA101|title=New Element Mendelevium, Atomic Number 101|date=1955|last1=Ghiorso|first1=A.|last2=Harvey|first2=B.|last3=Choppin|first3=G.|last4=Thompson|first4=S.|last5=Seaborg|first5=Glenn T.|journal=Physical Review|volume=98|pages=1518–1519|bibcode = 1955PhRv...98.1518G|isbn=9789810214401|issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery was part of a program, begun in 1952, that irradiated [[plutonium]] with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides.&lt;ref name="Choppin"&gt;{{cite journal|first = Gregory R.|last = Choppin|date = 2003 |title = Mendelevium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/mendelevium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements, [[neutron]] capture, could not work because of a lack of known [[beta decay]]ing [[isotopes of fermium]] that would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium, and also due to the very short half-life to [[spontaneous fission]] of &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;[[fermium|Fm]] that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;

To predict if the production of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal to the product of the number of atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the ion beam intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible to go ahead with the experiment.&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt; The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from irradiating [[plutonium]]: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week [[half-life]] meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target. However, it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; alpha particles per second; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt;

[[File:Md datasheet.jpg|thumb|left|The data sheet, showing stylus tracing and notes, that proved the discovery of mendelevium.]]
While Seaborg applied for funding, Harvey worked on the einsteinium target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using [[α-hydroxyisobutyric acid]] to separate the mendelevium atoms from those of the lighter actinides.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt; The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed on the opposite side of the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough [[momentum]] to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material.&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt; The recoil target consisted of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; atoms of &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]] [[alpha particle]]s in the [[Berkeley cyclotron]] with a very high beam density of 6×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; particles per second over an area of 0.05&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The target was cooled by water or [[liquid helium]], and the foil could be replaced.&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt;&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KcVj3xqsrAC&amp;pg=PA40|pages=40–42|title=On beyond uranium: journey to the end of the periodic table|author=Hofmann, Sigurd|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-415-28496-1|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial experiments were carried out in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by [[electron capture]] to [[fermium]] and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for [[spontaneous fission]] events.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt; The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt;

[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|right|The element was named after [[Dmitri Mendeleev]].]]
On the day of discovery, 19 February, alpha irradiation of the einsteinium target occurred in three three-hour sessions. The cyclotron was in the [[University of California]] campus, while the Radiation Laboratory was on the next hill. To deal with this situation, a complex procedure was used: Ghiorso took the catcher foils (there were three targets and three foils) from the cyclotron to Harvey, who would use [[aqua regia]] to dissolve it and pass it through an [[anion]]-exchange [[resin]] column to separate out the [[transuranium element]]s from the gold and other products.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt;&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&amp;pg=PA11|pages=9–11|title=The new chemistry|author=Hall, Nina|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2000|isbn=0-521-45224-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant drops entered a [[test tube]], which Choppin and Ghiorso took in a car to get to the Radiation Laboratory as soon as possible. There Thompson and Choppin used a [[cation]]-exchange resin column and the α-hydroxyisobutyric acid. The solution drops were collected on [[platinum]] disks and dried under heat lamps. The three disks were expected to contain respectively the fermium, no new elements, and the mendelevium. Finally, they were placed in their own counters, which were connected to recorders such that spontaneous fission events would be recorded as huge deflections in a graph showing the number and time of the decays. There thus was no direct detection, but by observation of spontaneous fission events arising from its electron-capture daughter &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Fm. The first one was identified with a "hooray" followed by a "double hooray" and a "triple hooray". The fourth one eventually officially proved the chemical identification of the 101st element, mendelevium. In total, five decays were reported up till 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. Seaborg was notified and the team left to sleep.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt; Additional analysis and further experimentation showed the produced mendelevium isotope to have mass 256 and to decay by electron capture to fermium-256 with a half-life of 1.5&amp;nbsp;h.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;

{{quotation|We thought it fitting that there be an element named for the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who had developed the periodic table. In nearly all our experiments discovering transuranium elements, we'd depended on his method of predicting chemical properties based on the element's position in the table.

Being the first of the second hundred of the chemical elements, it was decided that the element would be named "mendelevium" after the Russian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], father of the [[periodic table]].  Because this discovery came during the [[Cold War]], Seaborg had to request permission of the government of the [[United States]] to propose that the element be named for a Russian, but it was granted.&lt;ref name=Choppin/&gt; {{anchor|rename}}The name "mendelevium" was accepted by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in 1955 with symbol "Mv",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comptes rendus de la confèrence IUPAC|date=1955|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJhYAAAAYAAJ |author1=Chemistry |first1=International Union of Pure and Applied}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was changed to "Md" in the next IUPAC General Assembly (Paris, 1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comptes rendus de la confèrence IUPAC|date=1957|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5hYAAAAYAAJ |author1=Chemistry |first1=International Union of Pure and Applied}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[periodic table]], mendelevium is located to the right of the actinide [[fermium]], to the left of the actinide [[nobelium]], and below the lanthanide [[thulium]]. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible.&lt;ref name=Silva16345&gt;Silva, pp. 1634–5&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.&lt;ref name=Silva16345/&gt;

The lanthanides and actinides, in the metallic state, can exist as either divalent (such as [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have f&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configurations, whereas the latter have f&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the [[cohesive energy|cohesive energies]] ([[enthalpy|enthalpies]] of crystallization) of the metallic [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s, both as divalent and trivalent metals.&lt;ref name=Silva16268&gt;Silva, pp. 1626–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.11.2836|title=Generalized phase diagram for the rare-earth elements: Calculations and correlations of bulk properties|date=1975|last1=Johansson|first1=Börje|last2=Rosengren|first2=Anders|journal=Physical Review B|volume=11|pages=2836–2857|bibcode = 1975PhRvB..11.2836J|issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;6d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration over the [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration for mendelevium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], mendelevium, and [[nobelium]] were expected to be [[divalent metals]].&lt;ref name=Silva16268/&gt; The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1021/bk-1980-0131.ch012|title=Lanthanide and Actinide Chemistry and Spectroscopy|date=1980|isbn=9780841205680|author=Hulet, E.

===Chemical===
The chemistry of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution, in which it can take on the +3 or +2 [[oxidation state]]s. The +1 state has also been reported, but has not yet been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Silva16356&gt;Silva, pp. 1635–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Before mendelevium's discovery, [[Glenn T. Seaborg|Seaborg]] and Katz predicted that it should be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it [[elution|eluted]] just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble [[hydroxide]]s and [[fluoride]]s that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts.&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt; Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium.&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt; Mendelevium can form [[coordination complex]]es with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt;

In [[redox|reducing]] conditions, mendelevium(III) can be easily reduced to mendelevium(II), which is stable in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt; The [[standard reduction potential]] of the ''E''°(Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;→Md&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10&amp;nbsp;V or −0.20&amp;nbsp;V:&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt; later 2013 experiments established the value as {{val|−0.16|0.05|u=V}}.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Toyoshima |first1=Atsushi |last2=Li |first2=Zijie |first3=Masato |last3=Asai |first4=Nozomi |last4=Sato |first5=Tetsuya K. |last5=Sato |first6=Takahiro |last6=Kikuchi |first7=Yusuke |last7=Kaneya |first8=Yoshihiro |last8=Kitatsuji |first9=Kazuaki |last9=Tsukada |first10=Yuichiro |last10=Nagame |first11=Matthias |last11=Schädel |first12=Kazuhiro |last12=Ooe |first13=Yoshitaka |last13=Kasamatsu |first14=Atsushi |last14=Shinohara |first15=Hiromitsu |last15=Haba |first16=Julia |last16=Even |date=11 October 2013 |title=Measurement of the Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Md&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; Reduction Potential Studied with Flow Electrolytic Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''E''°(Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;→Md&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) should be around −1.74&amp;nbsp;V, and ''E''°(Md&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;→Md&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) should be around −2.5&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt; Mendelevium(II)'s elution behavior has been compared with that of [[strontium]](II) and [[europium]](II).&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt;

In 1973, mendelevium(I) was reported to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with [[samarium]](II). It was found to be stable in neutral water–[[ethanol]] solution and be [[Homology (chemistry) |homologous]] to [[caesium]](I). However, later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, not like the monovalent [[alkali metal]]s.&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt; Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the [[thermodynamics]] of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal [[chloride]]s, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing with them. The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt;

Although ''E''°(Md&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;→Md&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) was predicted in 1975 to be +5.4&amp;nbsp;V, suggesting that mendelevium(III) could be oxidized to mendelevium(IV), 1967 experiments with the strong oxidizing agent [[sodium bismuthate]] were unable to oxidize mendelevium(III) to mendelevium(IV).&lt;ref name=Silva16356/&gt;

===Atomic===
A mendelevium atom has 101 electrons, of which at least three (and perhaps four) can act as [[valence electron]]s. They are expected to be arranged in the configuration [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (ground state [[term symbol]] &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;7/2&lt;/sub&gt;), although experimental verification of this electron configuration had not yet been made as of 2006.&lt;ref name=Silva16334&gt;Silva, pp. 1633–4&lt;/ref&gt; In forming compounds, three valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind a [Rn]5f&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; core: this conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their [Rn]&amp;nbsp;5f&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first [[ionization potential]] of mendelevium was measured to be at most (6.58&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.07)&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] in 1974, based on the assumption that the 7s electrons would ionize before the 5f ones;&lt;ref name=NIST&gt;{{cite journal|first1=W.

Sixteen isotopes of mendelevium are known, with mass numbers from 245 to 260; all are radioactive.&lt;ref name=Silva16301&gt;Silva, pp. 1630–1&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, five [[nuclear isomer]]s are known: &lt;sup&gt;245m&lt;/sup&gt;Md, &lt;sup&gt;247m&lt;/sup&gt;Md, &lt;sup&gt;249m&lt;/sup&gt;Md, &lt;sup&gt;254m&lt;/sup&gt;Md, and &lt;sup&gt;258m&lt;/sup&gt;Md.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;&lt;ref name=unc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx |title=Universal Nuclide Chart |author=Nucleonica |date=2007–2014 |website=Nucleonica |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the longest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 51.5&amp;nbsp;days, and the longest-lived isomer is &lt;sup&gt;258m&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 58.0&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unc/&gt; Nevertheless, the slightly shorter-lived &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md (half-life 1.17&amp;nbsp;hours) is more often used in chemical experimentation because it can be produced in larger quantities from [[alpha particle]] irradiation of einsteinium.&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt; After &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md, the next most stable mendelevium isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 31.8&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 5.52&amp;nbsp;hours, &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 1.60&amp;nbsp;hours, and &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 1.17&amp;nbsp;hours. All of the remaining mendelevium isotopes have half-lives that are less than an hour, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 5&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt;&lt;ref name=unc/&gt;

The half-lives of mendelevium isotopes mostly increase smoothly from &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Md onwards, reaching a maximum at &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md.&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt;&lt;ref name=unc/&gt; Experiments and predictions suggest that the half-lives will then decrease, apart from &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Md with a half-life of 31.8&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt;&lt;ref name=unc/&gt; as [[spontaneous fission]] becomes the dominant decay mode&lt;ref name=NUBASE/&gt; due to the mutual repulsion of the protons posing a limit to the [[island of stability|island of relative stability]] of long-lived nuclei in the [[actinide]] series.&lt;ref name=Nurmia&gt;{{cite journal|first = Matti|last = Nurmia|date = 2003 |title = Nobelium|journal = Chemical and Engineering News|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/nobelium.html|volume = 81|issue = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendelevium-256, the chemically most important isotope of mendelevium, decays through [[electron capture]] 90.7% of the time and [[alpha decay]] 9.9% of the time.&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt; It is most easily detected through the [[spontaneous fission]] of its electron-capture daughter [[fermium-256]], but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission, alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium-256 (7.205 and 7.139&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]) can provide more useful identification.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt;

==Production and isolation==
The lightest mendelevium isotopes (&lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Md to &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Md) are mostly produced through bombardment of [[bismuth]] targets with heavy [[argon]] ions, while slightly heavier ones (&lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Md to &lt;sup&gt;253&lt;/sup&gt;Md) are produced by bombarding [[plutonium]] and [[americium]] targets with lighter ions of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The most important and most stable isotopes are in the range from &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Md to &lt;sup&gt;258&lt;/sup&gt;Md and are produced through bombardment of [[einsteinium]] isotopes with alpha particles: einsteinium-253, -254, and -255 can all be used. &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;Md is produced as a [[decay product|daughter]] of &lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;[[nobelium|No]], and &lt;sup&gt;260&lt;/sup&gt;Md can be produced in a [[Nuclear reaction#Transfer reactions|transfer reaction]] between einsteinium-254 and [[oxygen-18]].&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt; Typically, the most commonly used isotope &lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt;Md is produced by bombarding either einsteinium-253 or -254 with alpha particles: einsteinium-254 is preferred when available because it has a longer half-life and therefore can be used as a target for longer.&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt; Using available microgram quantities of einsteinium, [[femtogram]] quantities of mendelevium-256 may be produced.&lt;ref name=Silva16301/&gt;

The recoil [[momentum]] of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually [[beryllium]], [[aluminium]], [[platinum]], or [[gold]]) just behind the target in a vacuum.&lt;ref name=Silva16313&gt;Silva, pp. 1631–3&lt;/ref&gt; This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently [[helium]]), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; Using a long [[capillary tube]], and including [[potassium chloride]] aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of [[meter]]s to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined.&lt;ref name=book2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other [[fission product]]s by applying acid to the foil and then [[coprecipitation|coprecipitating]] the mendelevium with [[lanthanum fluoride]], then using a [[cation-exchange]] resin column with a 10% [[ethanol]] solution saturated with [[hydrochloric acid]], acting as an [[eluant]]. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in [[aqua regia]] before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using [[anion-exchange]] [[chromatography]], the eluant being 6&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;hydrochloric acid.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt;

Mendelevium can finally be separated from the other trivalent actinides using selective elution from a cation-exchange resin column, the eluant being ammonia α-HIB.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; Using the gas-jet method often renders the first two steps unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; The above procedure is the most commonly used one for the separation of transeinsteinium elements.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt;

Another possible way to separate the trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and [[nitric acid]] as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed from that of the cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.&lt;ref name=book2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt;

Another method to isolate mendelevium exploits the distinct elution properties of Md&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from those of Es&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The initial steps are the same as above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50&amp;nbsp;mg of [[chromium]] is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;hydrochloric acid with [[zinc]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using [[hydrogen peroxide]] and then isolated by selective elution with 2&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;hydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;hydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium).&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;hydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the [[alkaline earth metals]].&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt; Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium [[hexafluoroacetylacetonate]]: the analogous fermium compound is also known and is also volatile.&lt;ref name=Silva16313/&gt;

==Toxicity==
Although few people come in contact with mendelevium, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] has set annual exposure limits for the most stable isotope. For mendelevium-258, the ingestion limit was set at 9×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[becquerel]]s (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 6000 Bq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koch|first1=Lothar|title=Transuranium Elements, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley|date=2000|doi=10.1002/14356007.a27_167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7331">[[File:MMRTG schematic - english labels.png|thumb|Diagram of a MMRTG]]
The '''multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG)''' is a type of [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] developed for [[NASA]] space missions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/radioisotope-power-systems.pdf |format=PDF |title=Radioisotope Power Systems for Space Exploration |date=March 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] (MSL), under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Energy's Office of Space and Defense Power Systems within the [[Office of Nuclear Energy]]. The MMRTG was developed by an industry team of [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] and [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne Energy Systems]].

==Background==
Space exploration missions require safe, reliable, long-lived power systems to provide electricity and heat to spacecraft and their science instruments. A uniquely capable source of power is the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) – essentially  a nuclear battery that reliably converts heat into electricity.&lt;ref name="doe"/&gt; Radioisotope power has been used on eight Earth orbiting missions, eight missions travelling to each of the outer planets as well as each of Apollo missions following 11 to Earth's moon. Some of the outer Solar System missions are the [[Pioneer program|Pioneer]], [[Voyager program|Voyager]], [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]], ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'', ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' and ''[[New Horizons]]'' missions. The RTGs on ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' have been operating since 1977. Similarly, Radioisotope Heat Units (RHUs) were used to provide heat to critical components on Apollo 11 as well as the first two generations of Mars rovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bechtel|first=Ryan|title=Radioisotope Missions|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/pdf/MMRTG_RyanBechtel_DOE.pdf|publisher=US Department of Energy|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201232852/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/pdf/MMRTG_RyanBechtel_DOE.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, over the last four decades, 26 missions and 45 RTGs have been launched by the United States.

==Function==
RTGs convert the heat from the natural decay of a [[radioisotope]] into electricity. The MMRTG's heat source is [[Plutonium-238|plutonium-238 dioxide]]. Solid-state thermoelectric couples convert the heat to electricity.&lt;ref name="osti.gov"&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/display_accomp_bib?specfile=%2Fweb%2Fosti%2Fdocs%2Faccomplishments%2Fopentext%2Faccomplishments.p2w&amp;act=recquery&amp;index=1439480 SNAP-19: Pioneer F &amp; G, Final Report], Teledyne Isotopes, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike solar arrays, the RTGs are not dependent upon the Sun, so they can be used for deep space missions.

==History==
In June 2003, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) awarded the  MMRTG contract to a team led by Aerojet Rocketdyne. Aerojet Rocketdyne and Teledyne Energy Systems collaborated on an MMRTG design concept based on a previous thermoelectric converter design, [[SNAP-19]], developed by  Teledyne for previous space exploration  missions.&lt;ref name="jpl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/38246/1/04-0191.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216101915/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/38246/1/04-0191.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SNAP-19s powered ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' missions&lt;ref name="osti.gov"/&gt; as well as the [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2]] landers.

==Design and specifications==
The MMRTG is powered by 8 Pu-238 dioxide [[general-purpose heat source]] (GPHS) modules, provided by the Department of Energy. Initially, these eight GPHS modules generate about 2&amp;nbsp;kW thermal power.

The MMRTG design incorporates [[PbTe]]/TAGS thermoelectric couples (from Teledyne Energy Systems), where the TAGS material is a material incorporating Tellurium (Te), Silver (Ag), Germanium (Ge) and Antimony (Sb). The MMRTG is designed to produce 125 W electrical power at the start of mission, falling to about 100 W after 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMIECEC06_1309/PV2006_4187.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With a mass of 45&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;ref&gt;http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/docs/MMRTG_Jan2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the MMRTG provides about 2.8 W/kg of electrical power at beginning of life.

The MMRTG design is capable of operating both in the vacuum of space and in planetary atmospheres, such as on the surface of Mars. Design goals for the MMRTG included ensuring a high degree of safety, optimizing power levels over a minimum lifetime of 14 years, and minimizing weight.&lt;ref name="doe"/&gt;

==Usage in space missions==
[[File:MMRTG for the MSL.jpg|thumb|The multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator of [[Mars Science Laboratory]].]]
''[[Curiosity rover|Curiosity]]'', the MSL rover that was successfully landed in [[Gale (crater)|Gale Crater]] on August 6, 2012, uses one MMRTG to supply heat and electricity for its components and science instruments. Reliable power from the MMRTG will allow it to operate for several years.&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;{{NASA |article=Space Radioisotope Power Systems Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator |url=http://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/files/mep/MMRTG_FactSheet_update_10-2-13.pdf  |accessdate=2016-07-05}} (pdf) October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 20, 2015, a NASA official reported that there is enough plutonium available to NASA to fuel three more MMRTG like the one used by the ''Curiosity'' rover.&lt;ref name="Plutonium stockpile"&gt; {{cite news |last=Leone |first=Dan |url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-plutonium-stockpile-good-for-two-more-nuclear-batteries-after-mars-2020/ |title=U.S. Plutonium Stockpile Good for Two More Nuclear Batteries after Mars 2020 |work=Space News |date=11 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='blastr'&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Trent |url=http://www.blastr.com/2015-3-12/nasa-can-only-make-three-more-batteries-one-powers-mars-rover |title=NASA can only make three more batteries like the one that powers the Mars rover |work=Blastr |date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=2015-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One is already committed to the [[Mars 2020]] rover.&lt;ref name="Plutonium stockpile"/&gt; The other two have not been assigned to any specific mission or program,&lt;ref name='blastr'/&gt; and could be available by late 2021.&lt;ref name="Plutonium stockpile"/&gt;

== Metal  ==
In 2006, researchers produced metal nanofoams by igniting pellets of energetic metal bis(tetrazolato)amine complexes.  Nanofoams of [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[palladium]] have been prepared through this technique.  These materials exhibit densities as low as 11&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and surface areas as high as 258 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g.  These foams are effective catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdmag.com/ShowPR.aspx?PUBCODE=014&amp;ACCT=1400000100&amp;ISSUE=0509&amp;RELTYPE=R100&amp;PRODCODE=00000000&amp;PRODLETT=AO&amp;CommonCount=0 R&amp;D magazine 100 Awards].

The '''National Compact Stellarator Experiment''' ('''NCSX''') was a [[magnetic fusion energy]] experiment based on the [[stellarator]] design being constructed at the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]] (PPPL). NCSX was one of a number of new stellarator designs from the 1990s that arose after studies illustrated new geometries that offered better performance than the simpler machines of the 1950s and 1960s. Compared to the more common [[tokamak]], these were much more difficult to design and build, but produced far more stable plasma, the main problem with successful fusion. 

However, the design proved to be too difficult to build, repeatedly running over its budget and timelines. The project was eventually cancelled on 22 May 2008,&lt;ref name=Orbach2008&gt;[http://ncsx.pppl.gov//DOE_NCSX_052208.pdf Future of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL)], Statement by Dr. Raymond L. Orbach, Under Secretary for Science and Director, Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy, May 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; having spent over $70 M.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncsx.pppl.gov/CPR/Dec_07_CPR.pdf NCSX budget report Dec 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early stellarators===
Stellarators are one of the first [[fusion power]] concepts, originally designed by Princeton astrophysics Lyman Spitzer in 1952 while riding the [[chairlift]]s at [[Aspen Mountain (ski area)|Aspen]]. Spitzer, considering the motion of plasmas in the stars, realized that any simple arrangements of magnets would not confine a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] inside a machine - the plasma would drift across the fields and eventually strike the vessel. His solution was very simple; by bending the machine through a 180 degree twist, forming a figure-eight instead of a donut, the plasma would alternately find itself on the inside or outside of the vessel, drifting in opposite directions. The cancellation of net drift would not be perfect, but on paper it appeared that the delay in drift rates was more than enough to allow the plasma to reach fusion conditions.

In practice this proved not to be. A problem seen in all fusion reactor designs of the era was that the plasma [[ion]]s were drifting much faster than classical theory predicted, hundreds to thousands of times faster. Designs that suggested stability on the order of seconds turned into machines that were stable for microseconds at best. By the mid-1960s the entire fusion energy field appeared stalled. It was only the 1968 introduction of the [[tokamak]] design that rescued the field; Soviet machines were performing at least an [[order of magnitude]] better than western designs, although still far short of practical values. The improvement was so dramatic that work on other designs largely ended as teams around the world began to study the tokamak approach. This included the latest stellarator designs; the [[Model C stellarator|Model C]] had only recently started working, and was rapidly converted into the Symmetric [[Tokamak]].

By the late 1980s it was clear that while the tokamak was a great step forward, it also introduced new problems. In particular, the plasma current the tokamak used for stabilization and heating was itself a source of instabilities as the current grew. Much of the subsequent 30 years of tokamak development has focused on ways to increase this current to the levels required to sustain useful fusion while ensuring that same current does not cause the plasma to break up.

===Compact stellarators===
As the magnitude of the problem with the tokamak became evident, fusion teams around the world began to take a fresh look at other design concepts. Among a number of ideas noted during this process, the stellarator in particular appeared to have a number of potential changes that would greatly improve its performance.

The basic idea of the stellarator was to use the layout of the magnets to cancel out soon drift, but the simple designs of the 1950s did not do this to the degree needed. A greater problem were the instabilities and collisional effects that greatly increased the diffusion rates. In the 1980s it was noted that one way to improve tokamak performance was to use non-circular cross-sections for the plasma confinement area; ions moving in these non-uniform areas would mix and break up the formation of large-scale instabilities. Applying the same logic to the stellarator appeared to offer the same advantages. Yet, as the stellarator lacked, or lowered, the plasma current, the plasma would be more stable from the start.

When one considers the magnet layout needed to achieve both goals, a twisted path around the circumference of the device as well as many smaller twists and mixes along the way, the design becomes extremely complex, well beyond the abilities of conventional design tools. It was only through the use of [[massively parallel computer]]s that the designs could be studied in depth, and suitable magnet designs created. The result was a very compact device, significantly smaller outside than a classical design for any given volume of plasma, with a low [[Spherical tokamak#Aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]. Lower aspect ratios are highly desirable, because they allow a machine of any given power to be smaller, which lowers construction costs.

By the late 1990s the studies into new stellarator designs had reached a suitable point for the construction of a machine using these concepts. In comparison to the stellarators of the 1960s, the new machines could use [[superconducting magnet]]s for much higher field strengths, be only slightly larger than the [[Model C stellarator|Model C]] yet have far larger plasma volume, and have a plasma area inside that varied from circular to planar and back while twisting several times.

==NCSX design==
[[Image:NCSX modular coils and reference plasma.png|thumb|Modular coils and predicted plasma shape]]
;Plasma details: 
* Major radius : 1.4m, Aspect ratio : 4.4, &lt;ref name=Ellis2007/&gt;{{rp|3}}
* Magnetic field : 1.2 T - 1.7 T (Up to 2 T on axis for 0.2s&lt;ref name=Reiersen2007/&gt;)
* quasi-axisymmetric field, 3 field periods in all.&lt;ref name=Reiersen2007&gt;[http://ncsx.pppl.gov/Scientificconf/2007_SOFE/REIERSEN.pdf Progress in NCSX Construction Reiersen et al. 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Aims for [[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] &gt; 0.04.&lt;ref name=Reiersen2007/&gt;

;Magnet coils: 
* 18 modular coils (6 each of types A, B, C) of wound copper wire,  cooled with [[liquid nitrogen]] (LN2),
* 18 toroidal coils, solid copper cooled with LN2,
* 6 pairs of poloidal field coils, solid copper cooled with LN2,
* 48 trim coils.&lt;ref name=Ellis2007&gt;[ncsx.pppl.gov/Metrology/NCSXDimControl_EllisSOFE_070615.ppt Dimensional Control for the National Compact Stellarator Experiment. Ellis et al. June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  
&lt;br&gt;The 18 modular coils have a complicated 3D shape, ~ 9 different curves in different planes. Some of the coils would need 15 minutes to re-cool between high I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;t plasma runs.&lt;ref name=Elec&gt;[ncsx.pppl.gov/NCSX_Engineering/Technical_Data/SDDs/PDR_SDDs/SDD_WBS4_C.doc Electrical Power Systems (WBS 4). 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} 

;Plasma heating: Because the stellarator lacks the tokamak's plasma current as a form of heating, heating the plasma is accomplished with external devices. Up to 12&amp;nbsp;MW of external heating power would have been available to the NCSX chamber, consisting of 6&amp;nbsp;MW from tangential [[Neutral Beam Injection|neutral beam injection]], and 6&amp;nbsp;MW from [[radio-frequency]] (RF) heating (essentially a [[microwave oven]]). Up to&amp;nbsp;3 MW of [[electron]] [[cyclotron]] heating would also have been available in future iterations of the design.

Baseline total project cost of $102M for completion date of July 2009.&lt;ref name=Orbach2008/&gt;

First contracts placed in 2004.&lt;ref name=Reiersen2007/&gt;

==NCSX construction==
[[Image:NCSX modular coil in process.jpg|thumb|Construction of a modular coil for NCSX]]
With the design largely complete, the PPPL began the process of building such a machine, the NCSX, which would test all of these concepts. The design used eighteen fantastically complicated hand-wound magnets, which then had to be assembled into a machine where the maximum variation from the perfect placement was no more than {{convert|1.5|mm|inch}} across the entire device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncsx.pppl.gov/Scientificconf/2007_SOFE/CHRZANOWSKI.pdf NCSX Modular Coil Fabrication"], PPPL, Twenty-Second Symposium on Fusion Engineering, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The vacuum vessel surrounding all of this was likewise very complex, with the added complication of carrying all of the wiring to feed power to the magnets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncsx.pppl.gov/Scientificconf/2007_SOFE/LABIK.pdf "NCSX Vacuum Vessel External Flux Loops Design and Installation], PPPL, Twenty-Second Symposium on Fusion Engineering, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The assembly tolerances were very tight and required state of the art use of [[metrology]] systems including [[Laser Tracker]] and [[photogrammetry]] equipment. $50 million of additional funding was needed, spread over the next 3 years, to complete the assembly within tolerance requirements. Components for the Stellarator were measured with 3d laser scanning, and inspected to design models at multiple stages in the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3dscanco.com/clients/case-studies/us-dept-of-energy.cfm Case study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403072923/http://www.3dscanco.com/clients/case-studies/us-dept-of-energy.cfm |date=2010-04-03 }} by the US Department of Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

The required tolerances could not be achieved; As the modules were assembled, parts were found to be in contact, would sag once installed, and other unexpected effects made alignment very difficult.{{cn|date=December 2015}} Fixes were worked into the design, but each one further delayed the completion and required more funding.{{cn|date=December 2015}} (The 2008 cost estimate was $170M with an August 2013 scheduled completion.)&lt;ref name=Orbach2008/&gt; Eventually a go/no-go condition was imposed, and when the goal was not met on budget, the project was cancelled.&lt;ref name=Orbach2008/&gt;

It is published in [[Williston, North Dakota]]. The parent company is based out of [[Plymouth, Florida]].

Publication began in 1978 as the domestic oil industry flourished with rising energy prices. The cycle of high crude oil prices ended in the early 1980s and with it much of the oil exploration activity in the United States. As a result, the newsletter suspended publication in 1986.

Publication of ''Oil Patch Hotline'' resumed in June 2006 as worldwide energy demand generated renewed interest in domestic oil production.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oph.hotlineprinting.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Oil Patch Hotline |access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Orizuru.jpg|thumb|Origami paper and a traditional [[Thousand origami cranes|origami crane]]]]

'''Origami paper''' is used to fold [[origami]], the art of paper folding. The only real requirement of the folding medium is that it must be able to hold a crease, but should ideally also be thinner than regular paper for convenience when multiple folds over the same small paper area are required (e.g. such as would be the case if creating an origami bird's "legs", "feet", and "beak").

==Kami==
'''Kami''', or '''koiy''' paper, is the cheapest paper made specifically for origami, and the most widely available. It was developed for use in schools.&lt;ref name="lang traditional"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langorigami.com/paper/traditional_papers.php|title=Traditional Papers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''kami'' is simply Japanese for ''paper'', but it has acquired this specific meaning.&lt;ref name="lang traditional" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garibi kami"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://origamiusa.org/thefold/article/paper-review-12-kami|title=Paper Review #12: Kami|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kami is thin and easy to fold. It is usually printed only on one side, with a solid color or pattern. These patterns can be as simple as a gradation from red to blue, or as complex as a multi-colored [[kimono]] pattern of flowers and cranes with [[gold]] foil embellishments. Kami comes in several sizes, but standard sizes include 75&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;mm (about 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;inches), 6-inch squares and 10-inch squares.

==Paper-backed foil==
This medium is a slightly more expensive, flashier, paper that is good for retaining creases called paper-backed foil paper, Japanese foil, or simply foil. Foil paper is composed of a thin layer of foil adhered to an extremely thin sheet of paper. The most common colors are silver and gold, but any color is possible in foil paper including bright pink, blue and copper. In many multi-color packs, one sheet each of silver and gold paper is included. These are usually placed on the bottom end of the string if used in a [[thousand origami cranes]].

==Washi==
[[Washi|Washi (wa = Japanese and shi = paper · washi = Japanese paper)]] is traditionally a fine handmade thin paper coveted by artists and craftspeople. Washi is made with renewable long-fibered crops and is very strong even when thin. Some washi does not hold a sharp fold due to the extremely long and thick fibers of the paper. Occasionally you will find strands of the long fibers (often kozo) in washi. Washi is also accepting of ink, making it easy to print on as it holds very fine detail. Printed washi has a unique and occasionally transparent texture. Washi paper is not as commonly used as kami paper in origami.

==Chiyogami / Yuzen==
[[Chiyogami]] refers to Japanese hand-screened decorative kozo washi / paper consisting of repetitive patterns. In Japan “Chiyo” means 1,000 Generations &amp; “-Gami” means paper. Originally the design was applied to handmade kozo paper with wood blocks, but today most chiyogami is produced with silkscreen techniques.&lt;ref name="chiyo_yuzen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesepaperplace.com/wholesale/chiyo/about-chiyo-yuzen/faq_1-yuzen-chiyogami.htm|title=Yuzen and Chiyogami – what's the difference?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper was one of the major materials used in making toys and dolls. The brightly printed chino-gami of Edo (Tokyo) and Kyoto and the crisp strength of newly laid kozo paper were fully utilized. Many urban housewives and girls with the spare time for a hobby have taken up the making of sophisticated paper dolls and figurines – both traditional and modern – and provide a steady and major market for the makers of highly decorative colored papers.&lt;ref&gt;Sukey Hughes. Washi. The World of Japanese Paper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Banknotes==
[[File:Snail origami.jpg|thumb|An origami snail that is made out of a [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]].]]
Banknotes may be used to fold models as well.  Banknotes are common media for folding as the subject in the obverse of the banknote can make a striking appearance on the finished model.

{{Infobox telescope| locmapin=China}}
The '''Particle and Astrophysical Xenon Detector''', or '''PandaX''', is a [[dark matter#Detection|dark matter detection]] experiment at [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]] (CJPL) in [[Sichuan]], China.&lt;ref name="sjtu_main"&gt;{{cite web | title = PandaX Dark Matter Experiment | publisher = [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] | url = https://pandax.sjtu.edu.cn/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment occupies the deepest underground laboratory in the world, and is among the largest of its kind.

==Participants==
The experiment is run by an international team of about 40 scientists, led by researchers at China's [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]].&lt;ref name="phys.org_sept14"&gt;{{cite web | title = First dark matter search results from Chinese underground lab hosting PandaX-I experiment | publisher = [[Phys.org]] | date = September 30, 2014 | url = http://phys.org/news/2014-09-dark-results-chinese-underground-lab.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began in 2009 with researchers from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, [[Shandong University]], the [[Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics]] &lt;small&gt;([[:zh:中国科学院上海应用物理研究所|zh]])&lt;/small&gt;, and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="phys.org_july14"&gt;{{cite web | title = Chinese scientists search for evidence of dark matter particles with new underground PandaX detector | publisher = Phys.org | date = July 23, 2014 | url = http://phys.org/news/2014-07-chinese-scientists-evidence-dark-particles.html#inlRlv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Xiangdong | last1 = Ji | title = PandaX: Direct Dark Matter Search Experiment in China Jinping Underground Lab | booktitle = Shanghai Particle Physics and Cosmology Symposium 2013 | publisher = | date = June 5, 2013 | location = Shanghai Jiao Tong University | url = https://indico.cern.ch/event/234546/session/7/contribution/28/material/slides/1.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the [[University of Maryland]], [[Peking University]], and the [[University of Michigan]] joined two years later.&lt;ref name="phys.org_july14"/&gt; The PandaX team also includes members from the [[Ertan Hydropower Development Company]].&lt;ref name="sjtu_team"&gt;{{cite web | title = PandaX Dark Matter Experiment: Team | publisher = [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] | url = http://pandax.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/team-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists from [[University of Science and Technology of China]], [[China Institute of Atomic Energy]] and [[Sun Yat-sen University|Sun Yat-Sen University]] joined PandaX in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://tevpa2017.osu.edu/talks/ji.pdf|title=PandaX Dark Matter Search|last=Ji|first=Xiangdong |date=August 7-11, 2017 |conference-url=https://tevpa2017.osu.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|conference=TeVPA 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
PandaX is a direct-detection experiment, consisting of a dual-phase [[xenon]] [[time projection chamber]] (TPC) detector.&lt;ref name="sjtu_main"/&gt; The use of both liquid and gaseous phases of xenon, similarly to the [[XENON]] and [[Large Underground Xenon experiment|LUX]] experiments, allows the location of events to be determined, and [[gamma ray]] events to be vetoed.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt; In addition to searching for dark matter events, PandaX is designed to detect [[Xe-136]] [[double beta decay]].&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;

===Laboratory===
PandaX is located at [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]] (CJPL), the deepest underground laboratory in the world at more than {{convert|2400|m|mi}} below ground.&lt;ref name="phys.org_sept14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strickland"/&gt; The depth of the laboratory means the experiment is better shielded from [[cosmic ray]] interference than similar detectors, allowing the instrument to be scaled up more easily.&lt;ref name="reich"/&gt; The [[muon]] [[flux]] at CJPL is 66 events per square meter per year, compared with 950 events/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/year at the [[Sanford Underground Research Facility]], home of the LUX experiment, and 8,030 events/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/year at the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso lab]] in Italy, home to the XENON detector.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt; The [[marble]] at Jinping is also less radioactive than the rock at Homestake and Gran Sasso, further reducing the frequency of false detections.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strickland"/&gt; Wolfgang Lorenzon, a collaborating researcher from the University of Michigan, has commented that "the big advantage is that PandaX is much cheaper and doesn't need as much shielding material" as similar detectors.&lt;ref name="strickland"/&gt;

===Operational stages===
Like most low-background physics, the experiment is constructing multiple generations of detectors, each serving as a prototype for the next.  A larger size allows greater sensitivity, but this is only useful if unwanted "background events" can be kept from swamping the desired ones; ever more stringent limits on radioactive contamination are also required.  Lessons learned in earlier generations are used to construct later ones.

The first generation, PandaX-I, operated until late November, 2014.&lt;ref name=TPC2014&gt;{{cite conference |conference=7th symposium on large TPCs for low-energy rare event detection |date=15–17 December 2014 |location=Paris |conference-url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/340656/ |title=PandaX Results and Outlook |first=Karl |last=Giboni |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/340656/contribution/26/attachments/668435/918712/TPC_Paris14_Giboni.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|15}}  It used {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of xenon (of which {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}} served as a [[wikt:fiducial|fiducial]] mass)&lt;ref name=TAUP2015&gt;{{cite conference |title=The PandaX Experiment and the Results from the Full Exposure of PandaX-I |first=Jianglai |last=Liu |url=http://www.taup-conference.to.infn.it/2015/day2/parallel/dma/1_liu.pdf |conference=14th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics |date=7–11 September 2015 |location=Torino |conference-url=http://taup2015.to.infn.it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|7,10}} to probe the low-mass regime (&lt;10&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]]) and verify dark matter signals reported by other detector experiments.&lt;ref name="sjtu_main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reich"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reich |first=Eugenie Samuel |title=Dark-matter hunt gets deep |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=494 |issue=7437 |pages=291–292 |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |date=February 20, 2013 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/dark-matter-hunt-gets-deep-1.12455 |doi=10.1038/494291a |bibcode=2013Natur.494..291S |pmid=23426301}}&lt;/ref&gt; PandaX-I was the first dark matter experiment in China to use more than 100&amp;nbsp;kg of xenon in its detector, and its size was second only to the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment|LUX]] experiment in the United States.&lt;ref name="phys.org_sept14"/&gt;

The construction cost of PandaX is estimated at [[United States dollar|US$]]15 million, with an initial cost of $8 million for the first stage.&lt;ref name="reich"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strickland"/&gt;

PandaX-II produced some preliminary physics results from a brief commissioning run in late 2015 (November 21 to December 14)&lt;ref name=Commissioning/&gt; before the main physics run currently underway through 2018.&lt;ref name=Status2017.3&gt;{{cite journal |title=Current status of direct dark matter detection experiments |first1=Jianglai |last1=Liu |first2=Xun |last2=Chen |first3=Xiangdong |last3=Ji |doi=10.1038/nphys4039 |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |date=2 March 2017 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=212–216 |arxiv=1709.00688 |bibcode=2017NatPh..13..212L }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|213}}&lt;ref name=TAUP2015/&gt;{{Rp|24}}

The next stages of PandaX are called PandaX-xT. An intermediate stage with a four-ton target (PandaX-4T) is under construction in the second-phase CJPL-II laboratory. The ultimate goal is to build a third generation dark matter detector, which will contain thirty tons of xenon in the sensitive region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Initial results==
The majority of the PandaX experimental equipment was transported from Shanghai Jiao Tong University to China Jinping Underground Laboratory in August 2012, and two engineering test runs were conducted in 2013.&lt;ref name="phys.org_july14"/&gt; The initial data-collection run (PandaX-I) began in May 2014. Results from this run were reported in September 2014 in the journal ''[[Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy]]''. In the initial run, about 4 million raw events were recorded, with around 10,000 in the expected energy region for [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]] dark matter. Of these, only 46 events were recorded in the quiet inner core of the xenon target. These events were consistent with [[background radiation]], rather than dark matter. The lack of an observed dark-matter signal in the PandaX-I run places strong constraints on previously-reported dark matter signals from similar experiments.&lt;ref name="phys.org_sept14"/&gt;

==Reception==
Stefan Funk of the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] has questioned the wisdom of having many separate direct-detection dark matter experiments in different countries, commenting that "spending all our money on different direct-detection experiments is not worth it."&lt;ref name="reich"/&gt; Xiangdong Ji, spokesperson for PandaX and a physicist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, concedes that the international community is unlikely to support more than two multi-tonne detectors, but argues that having many groups working will lead to faster improvement in detection technology.&lt;ref name="reich"/&gt;  Richard Gaitskell, a spokesperson for the LUX experiment and a physics professor at [[Brown University]], commented, "I'm excited about seeing China developing a fundamental physics program."&lt;ref name="strickland"/&gt;

The '''pendulum rocket fallacy''' is a common fundamental misunderstanding of the mechanics of [[rocket]] flight and how rockets remain on a stable [[trajectory]]. The first [[liquid-fuel rocket]], constructed by [[Robert H. Goddard|Robert Goddard]] in 1926, differed significantly from modern rockets in that the [[rocket engine]] was at the top and the fuel tank at the bottom of the rocket. It was believed that, in flight, the rocket would "hang" from the engine like a [[pendulum]] from a pivot, and the weight of the fuel tank would be all that was needed to keep the rocket flying straight up. This belief is incorrect. In actuality, the stability of such a rocket is dependent on other factors. Basic [[Newtonian mechanics]] shows that Goddard's rocket is just as stable (or unstable) as it would be if the engine had been mounted below the fuel tank (as it is in most modern rockets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/pendrock.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018232320/http://geocities.com/jim_bowery/pendrock.html |archivedate=2009-10-18 |author="Jim Bowery"|title=The Pendulum Rocket Fallacy |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the engine kept pushing the nose straight up even as the rest of the rocket swung like a pendulum under it, the rocket would have a possibility to get pulled straight and be stable. However, the engines are fixed to the rest of the rocket, so when the rocket tilts, the engine won't apply an upward, stabilising force, but simply push forward in whatever direction the rocket happens to be pointing, not steering it one way or the other at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/5lmayz/is_it_true_that_robert_goddard_fell_for_the/dbx32fh/ |title=Bromskloss comments on Is it true that Robert Goddard fell for the "pendulum-rocket fallacy"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protectin D1''' also known as [[neuroprotectin]] D1 (when it acts in the nervous system) and abbreviated most commonly as PD1 or NPD1 is a member of the class of [[specialized proresolving mediators]]. Like other members of this class of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites, it possesses strong anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activity. PD1 is an [[aliphatic]] acyclic [[alkene]] 22 carbons in length with two hydroxyl groups at the 10 and 17 carbon positions and one carboxylic acid group at the one carbon position.&lt;ref name="lipidraft"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ariel A, Li PL, Wang W, Tang WX, Fredman G, Hong S, Serhan CN |title=The docosatriene protectin D1 is produced by TH2 skewing and promotes human T cell apoptosis via lipid raft clustering|journal= volume J.

Specifically, PD1 is an endogenous stereoselective lipid mediator classified as an [[autocoid]] protectin. Autacoids are enzymatically derived chemical mediators with distinct biological activities and molecular structures. Protectins are signaling molecules that are produced enzymatically from unsaturated fatty acids. Their molecular structure is characterized by the presence of a [[conjugated system]] of double bonds.&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt; PD1, like other protectins, is produced by the oxygenation of the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and it is found in many tissues, such as the retina, the lungs and the nervous system.&lt;ref name="oxidativestress"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukherjee PK, Marcheselli VL, Serhan CN, Bazan NG |title=Neuroprotectin D1: a docosahexaenoic acid-derived docosatriene protects human retinal pigment epithelial cells from oxidative stress|journal= Proc.

PD1 has a significant role as an anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective molecule. Studies in [[Alzheimer's disease]] animal models, in stroke patients and in human [[Retinal pigment epithelium|retina pigment epithelial cells]] (RPE) have shown that PD1 can potentially reduce [[inflammation]] induced by [[oxidative stress]] and inhibit the pro-apoptotic signal, thereby preventing cellular degeneration.&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt;&lt;ref name=survivalrescue/&gt;&lt;ref name="dephosphorylation"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Antony R, Lukiw WJ, Bazan NG |title=Neuroprotectin D1 induces dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL in a PP2A-dependent manner during oxidative stress and promotes retinal pigment epithelial cell survival|journal=J.

==Biosynthesis of PD1==

In vivo, PD1 is mainly produced as a response to inflammatory signals and it is found in various tissues, such as the [[Retinal pigment epithelium|retina pigment epithelial cells]], lung epithelial cells, [[peripheral blood mononuclear cell]]s (PBMC) and neural tissues. Studies in PBMC have shown that endogenous DHA, the main precursor of PD1, is released by the activity of [[phospholipase A2]].&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt;&lt;ref name=survivalrescue/&gt; According to these studies, PD1 is preferentially synthesized in PBMC cells skewed to the Type 2 [[T helper cell]] phenotype (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2).&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt; This suggests that T-cell differentiation plays an important role in the activation of the PD1 biosynthetic pathway. The interaction of PBMC with [[interleukin 4]] (IL-4), a potent inflammatory signal, leads to the differentiation of PBMC to T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 type lymphocytes.&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt; In addition, activated T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells further release IL-4, leading to the up-regulation of the enzyme 15-[[lipoxygenase]]-1 (15-LO-1).&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt; 15-LO-1 is a non-[[heme]] iron-carrying [[dioxygenase]] that adds oxygen atoms in a [[stereospecificity|stereospecific]] manner on free and esterified [[omega-3 fatty acid|ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids]] like DHA.&lt;ref name=survivalrescue/&gt; Overall, the biosynthesis of PD1 proceeds through three distinct steps throughout which the activity of 15-LO-1 is essential. In the first step of the biosynthetic pathway, the binding of 15-LO-1 to its [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] (DHA) leads to the formation of the (17''S'')-hydro(peroxy)-DHA intermediate. This intermediate is rapidly processed to form a 16(17)-epoxide-containing molecule, which is the second intermediate. Finally, in the third step of the pathway, [[enzymatic hydrolysis]] of the 16(17)-epoxide-containing intermediate leads to the formation of PD1.&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt;

==Functions of PD1==

In general, PD1 in vivo exhibits a potent anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activity in the tissues in which it is localized. DHA, the main PD1 precursor, is mostly found in tissues such as the retinal synapses, [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]], the lungs and the brain, suggesting that these tissues are more likely to be benefited from the protecting activity of PD1.&lt;ref name=lipidraft/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt;&lt;ref name=survivalrescue/&gt;&lt;ref name=dephosphorylation/&gt;&lt;ref name=virusreplication/&gt;&lt;ref name ="antiinflammatory"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Serhan CN, Gotlinger K, Hong S, Lu Y, Siegelman J, Baer T, Petasis NA |title=Anti-inflammatory actions of neuroprotectin D1/protectin D1 and its natural stereoisomers: assignments of dihydroxy-containing docosatrienes|journal=J. Immunol.|volume=176|issue=3|pages=1848–59|date=February 2006|pmid=16424216|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.176.3.1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activity of PD1 in the retina===

RPE are essential in the survival and renewal of the photoreceptors in the retina. These cells exhibit a potent [[phagocytosis|phagocytic activity]] that ensures the proper function of the retina. Therefore, oxidative stress can potentially damage the RPE cells and cause vision impairment. Studies in human RPE cells have suggested that the presence of oxidative stress triggering molecules, such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; causes the fragmentation of the DNA that in turn triggers [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt; These studies have proposed that PD1 acts as a signaling molecule and through its ligand-receptor interaction down-regulates the expression of genes, such as the [[transcription factor]] [[NF-κB]]. The inhibition of NF-κB results in the down-regulation of the pro-inflammatory gene COX-2 ([[cyclooxygenase-2]]) which is responsible for the release of [[prostaglandin]]s, a potent pro-inflammatory mediator.&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt; In addition, PD1 has an important role in regulating the expression of the [[Bcl-2]] family proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, Bax and Bad) that precedes the release of the [[cytochrome c]] complex from the mitochondria and the formation of the [[apoptosome]].&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt;&lt;ref name=survivalrescue/&gt;&lt;ref name=dephosphorylation/&gt; The presence of PD1 up-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, while it inhibits the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad.&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt; Specifically, PD1 regulates this protein family by promoting the [[dephosphorylation]] of Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; by [[protein phosphatase 2|protein phosphatase 2A]] (PP2A) at residue [[serine|Ser-62]] which in turn [[protein dimer|heterodimerizes]] with the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and inactivates it.&lt;ref name=dephosphorylation/&gt; Consequently, the activity of the Bcl-2 family proteins results in the inhibition of the [[caspase 3]] enzyme, thus preventing apoptosis and promoting RPE cell survival.&lt;ref name=oxidativestress/&gt;&lt;ref name=dephosphorylation/&gt;

===Effects of PD1 in Alzheimer's disease===

Among others, [[Alzheimer's disease]] is characterized by the reduced concentration of PD1 and by the increased concentration of the [[beta amyloid|amyloid-β peptide]] (Aβ42) that is responsible for the formation of [[senile plaques]] and also induces inflammation and apoptosis in neuronal tissues.&lt;ref name=neuronalsurvival/&gt;&lt;ref name ="amyloidpeptide"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clementi ME, Pezzotti M, Orsini F, Sampaolese B, Mezzogori D, Grassi C, Misiti F |title=Alzheimer's amyloid β-peptide (1–42) induces cell death in human neuroblastoma via bax/bcl-2 ratio increase: An intriguing role for methionine 35|journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun|volume=342|issue=1|pages=206–213|date=March 2006|pmid=16472763|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.01.137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aβ42 is generated by the enzymatic cleavage of the [[amyloid precursor protein|β-amyloid precursor protein]] (βΑPP) through β- and γ- secretases. Like other pro-inflammatory mediators, Aβ42 induces inflammation through the activation of the pro-inflammatory enzyme COX-2 and the release of prostaglandins. Moreover, the release of Aβ42 down-regulates the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and up-regulates the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad that ultimately lead to the formation of the apoptosome.&lt;ref name=neuronalsurvival/&gt;&lt;ref name =amyloidpeptide/&gt; PD1 in human [[neuroglia|neuronal glial cells]] (HNG) has been shown to trigger the down-regulation of βΑPP, thus decreasing the Aβ42 content in neuronal tissues and reducing inflammation and apoptosis.&lt;ref name=neuronalsurvival/&gt; Specifically, PD1 in Alzheimer's disease models has been shown to respond to the increased concentration of the pro-inflammatory molecule Aβ42 by binding and activating the [[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma]] (PPARγ) either directly or via other mechanisms. According to some models the activation of PPARγ leads to increased [[ubiquitin]]ation and degradation of βAPP, thus reducing the release of Aβ42.&lt;ref name=neuronalsurvival/&gt; Furthermore, PD1 inhibits the production of Aβ42 peptide by down-regulating β-secretase-1 (BACE1), while up-regulating the α-secretase ADAM10 and the secreted amyloid precursor protein-α (sAPPα). Overall, the above mechanism leads to the cleavage of βAPP protein though a non-amyloidogenic pathway that halts the formation of Aβ42 and prevents the premature neuronal degeneration.&lt;ref name=neuronalsurvival/&gt;&lt;ref name =amyloidpeptide/&gt;

===Antiviral activity of PD1===

Studies in cultured human lung epithelial cells infected with the [[influenza]] virus H1N1 or H5N1 have found that endogenous production of PD1 decreases dramatically during infection due to the inhibition of 15-LO-1.&lt;ref name=influenza/&gt;&lt;ref name=virusreplication/&gt; Furthermore, the same studies have shown that in vivo administration of PD1 to H1N1 infected mice can potentially inhibit both the proliferation of the virus and the inflammation caused by the infection, thus increasing survival. PD1 protects against viral infections by disrupting the virus life cycle. Specifically, PD1 inhibits the binding of viral RNA to specific [[nuclear transport|nuclear export factors]] in the host cells, thus blocking the export of viral [[RNA]] from the nucleus to the cytosol.&lt;ref name=influenza/&gt;&lt;ref name=virusreplication/&gt; The nuclear RNA export factor 1(NXF1) is of particular interest in the attenuation of viral infections via the activity of PD1. Specifically, the [[NXF1]] transporter through its middle and [[C-terminus|C-terminal domains]] binds to the phenylalanine/glycine repeats in the [[nucleoporin]]s (Nups) that line the [[nuclear pore]].&lt;ref name=virusreplication/&gt; In the absence of PD1, influenza viral RNA binds to the NXF1 transporter that later binds specifically to Nup62 nucleoporin and exports the viral RNA into the [[cytosol]]. However, the administration of PD1 has shown that this lipid mediator specifically inhibits the binding of the viral RNA to NXF1, thus disrupting the proliferation of the virus.&lt;ref name=virusreplication/&gt;

==Laboratory Synthesis of PD1==

The large scale industrial production of PD1 is of great interest for pharmaceutical companies in order to harvest the potent anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities of this lipid mediator. So far, very few stereoselective laboratory syntheses of PD1 have been reported, but with a relatively low yield.&lt;ref name ="stereoselective"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aursnes M, Tungen JE, Vik A, Dalli J, Hansen TV |title=Stereoselective synthesis of protectin D1: a potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving lipid mediator.|journal=Org Biomol Chem|volume=12|issue=3|pages=432–437|date=November 2013|doi=10.1039/c3ob41902a|pmc=3904955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="totalsynthesis"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogawa N, Kobayashi Y |title=Total synthesis of the antiinflammatory and proresolving protectin D1|journal=Tetrahedron Lett|volume=52|issue=23|pages=3001–3004|date=June 2011|doi=10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.03.152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convergent Stereoselective Synthesis===

According to one method, PD1 is synthesized in 15% yield through an 8-step [[convergent synthesis|convergent stereoselective process]].&lt;ref name =stereoselective/&gt; Initially, the [[alkyne]], (''Z'')-3-tertbutyldimethylsiloxy-oct-5-en-1-yne reacts with bromo-''E'',''E'',''Z'',''Z''-tetraene [[ester]] in a [[sonogashira coupling|Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction]] at room temperature in the presence of Pd-(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CuI using [[diethylamine]] as a solvent which produces the bis-hydroxyl-protected methyl ester. Removal of the two [[silyl ether|tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers]] (TBS-protecting groups) is attained with an excess of [[Tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride|TBAF]] in [[Tetrahydrofuran|THF]] at 0&amp;nbsp;°C which produces a [[diol]] containing a conjugated alkyne. The conjugated alkyne is reduced to the methyl ester. In addition, the diol is hydrogenated via a [[Lindlar catalyst]] to produce a highly stereoselective triene, while water is eliminated from the diol through a Boland reduction. Finally, the methyl ester undergoes [[saponification]] at 0&amp;nbsp;°C with dilute [[Lithium hydroxide|LiOH]] (aq.) in [[methanol]] followed by acidic [[Work-up (chemistry)|work-up]] with NaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq.) in order to produce PD1.&lt;ref name =stereoselective/&gt;

[[File:Convergent Stereoselective Synthesis of PD1.jpg|500px|Convergent Stereoselective Synthesis of PD1]]

===Alternative Stereoselective Synthesis===

Alternatively, PD1 laboratory synthesis proceeds through a different [[Stereoselectivity|stereoselective]] method.&lt;ref name =totalsynthesis/&gt; Initially, [[hydroboration]] of a TBS-protected [[acetylene]] with Sia&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH produces a TBS-protected [[Organoboron chemistry|vinylborane]]. The TBS-protected vinylborane reacts with vinyliodide in the presence of a Pd-catalyst, [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) and THF to produce a TBS-protected alcohol. Later treatment of the TBS-protected alcohol with TBAF removes the protecting group and produces a diol. Finally, the diol is hydrolyzed with LiOH in THF (aq.) to produce PD1.&lt;ref name =totalsynthesis/&gt;

While the omega oxidation of many bioactive fatty acid metabolites such as [[leukotriene B4]], [[5-HETE]], [[5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid]] (i.e. 5-oxo-ETE) results in a ~100-fold fall in their activity, the omega oxidized product of PD1 has been shown to possess potent ease exhibits potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions by inhibiting PMN chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro and decreased pro-inflammatory mediator levels in inflammatory exudates of an animal model at levels comparable to PD1.&lt;ref name="pmid25247845"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tungen JE, Aursnes M, Vik A, Ramon S, Colas RA, Dalli J, Serhan CN, Hansen TV | title = Synthesis and anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activities of 22-OH-PD1, a monohydroxylated metabolite of protectin D1 | journal = Journal of Natural Products | volume = 77 | issue = 10 | pages = 2241–7 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25247845 | pmc = 4208671 | doi = 10.1021/np500498j | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26545300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balas L, Durand T | title = Dihydroxylated E,E,Z-docosatrienes.

===Aspirin-triggered PD1===
Aspirin-triggered PD1 (AT-PD1 or 17-epi-PD1: i.e. 10''R'',17''R''-dihydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',11''E'',13''E'',15''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid) is the 10''R''-hydroxy isomer of PD1 (which has the 10''S'' hydroxy residue) (see [[specialized proresolving mediators#Protectins/neuroprotectins]]). AT-PD1 has been shown to '''a)''' reduce the infiltration of [[neutrophils]] into the peritoneum in a mouse model of inflammatory disease; '''b)''' stimulate the [[Efferocytosis]] (i.e. engulfment and removal) of neutrophils; and '''c)''' reduce brain infarction and stroke in a rodent model.&lt;ref name="pmid25139562"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Dalli J, Colas RA, Winkler JW, Chiang N | title = Protectins and maresins: New pro-resolving families of mediators in acute inflammation and resolution bioactive metabolome | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 397–413 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25139562 | pmc = 4324013 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.006 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajagopala Chidambaram''' (born 12 November 1936) is an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Physicist]] who is known for his integral role in [[India and weapons of mass destruction#Nuclear weapons|India's nuclear weapons program]]; he coordinated test preparation for the [[Operation Smiling Buddha|Pokhran-I]] (1975) and [[Pokhran-II]] (1998).

Previously served as the principal scientific adviser to the federal [[Government of India]], Chidambaram previously served as the director of the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC)— and later as chairman, [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Atomic Energy Commission of the Government of India]] and he contributed in providing national defence and energy security to India. Chidambaram was chairman of the board of Governors of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) during 1994–95.   He was also a member of the Commission of Eminent Persons appointed by the Director-General, IAEA, in 2008 to prepare a report on "The Role of the IAEA to 2020 and Beyond".

Throughout his career, Chidambaram played a key role in developing India's [[nuclear weapon]]s, being a part of the team conducting the first Indian nuclear test ([[Smiling Buddha]]) at [[Pokhran Test Range]] in 1974. He gained international fame when he led and represented the team of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) while observing and leading efforts to conduct the [[Pokhran-II|second nuclear tests]] in May 1998.

==Academic life==
Chidambaram completed his early education in [[Meerut]] and [[Chennai]], completing his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] with [[B.Sc. (Hons)|honors]] in [[physics]], having stood first rank at the departmental and the university level of the [[University of Madras|Madras University]] in 1956. After enrolling in master's program, Chidambaram taught introductory physics laboratory courses and obtained [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] in physics, writing a fundamental thesis on [[analog computer]]s from the same institution, in 1958.
He was accepted for the doctoral programme of the [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc), and was awarded the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]  in 1962. His thesis contained the research work on the development of [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]], and was conferred with the ''Martin Forster Medal'' for the best doctoral thesis submitted to the Indian Institute of Science. Chidambaram is a versatile scholar, interest first in physics. After graduating, his interest in nuclear physics diminished and his research interest in physics did not keep him motivated to contribute in his field. Instead, Chidambaram found himself interested in crystallography and condensed matter physics, writing scientific articles which later played an influential role in the development of modern [[materials science]]. His contribution to the enhancement of condensed matter physics and material science led him to be conferred with a [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]], in physics by the IISc after submitting his doctoral thesis on experiments which he conducted at IISc. He has been conferred doctoral degrees in physics by eight Indian universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tifac.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=226&amp;Itemid=37 |title=Profile of Dr. Rajagopala Chidambaram |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the test of the nuclear device at [[Pokhran-I|Pokharan]] in 1974, Chidambaram started ‘open research' in the area of high pressure physics. For this a complete range of instrumentation such as diamond anvil cells, and gas-gun for launching projectiles were indigenously built. He also laid the foundation of theoretical high-pressure research for calculation of equation of state and phase stability of materials by first principles techniques. The papers published by his high pressure group are also well cited. The one on ‘Omega Phase in Materials’ is considered a textbook by researchers in Condensed Matter Physics/  Materials Science. He is an excellent orator, brightest mind with understanding of diverse subjects.  A scientific visionary of India.

==Nuclear program==
After receiving his doctorate in physics, Chidambaram joined the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC). He served as the director of the physics group initiating research on physical aspects of nuclear weapons.
At BARC, he rose to become one of the senior nuclear scientists involved in various classified projects, and was one of the central figures building the nuclear programme. In 1967, Chidambaram joined the nuclear weapon designing effort along with his fellow scientists in constructing and building the metallurgical and physical aspects of the nuclear weapons. He and his colleagues worked out the equation of state of plutonium, which is still classified by all nuclear weapon states. He chose the [[Implosion nuclear weapon|implosion method]] and initiated research at BARC in very close interaction with the [[Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory]] (TBRL) of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO) to achieve this. Chidambaram also assisted the Indian Army to construct a nuclear test site at long-constructed Indian Army base, [[Pokhran Test Range]] in Rajasthan, Chidambaram was part of a team of scientists who  participated in and supervised  India's first nuclear test, codename Smiling Buddha, and was one of the scientists who were honoured by Indian Premier [[Indira Gandhi]]. Finally, in 1990, Chidambaram became Director of the BARC . His key participation in the design and successful execution of Operation Smiling Buddha saw him leading the DAE team of [[Operation Shakti]] in 1998. As the director of BARC, he initiated the development of  super-computers, which now have multi-teraflop speed capability. During his chairmanship of the Atomic Energy Commission, he accelerated the development of nuclear power. 
Upset by the secret manner in which the test was conducted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/india/pokharan-intell.htm |title=Pokaran-The U.S. Intelligence Failure |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/news/1998/05/980512-wt.htm |title=India blasts take U.S. intelligence by surprise |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given his instrumental role in the test, Chidambaram was not positively reciprocated when he approached the US for a visa to attend the 1998 annual conference of the [[International Union of Crystallography]], of which was the vice-president, which was followed by his withdrawal of the visa application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19980715/19650654.html |title=US denies visa to AEC Chairman |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/lsdeb/ls12/ses2/16170798.htm |title=US denies visa to AEC Chairman - Debate in Parliament |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Principal Scientific Adviser==
Dr. R. Chidambaram was Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India (until Dr. Krishnasamy VijayRaghavan replaced him in March 2018) and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory to the Cabinet of the Federal Government. Some of his initiatives as Principal Scientific Adviser, including the setting up of the Core Advisory Group for R&amp;D in the Automotive Sector (CAR) to increase academia-industry interaction, the creation of RuTAGs (Rural Technology Action Groups) for effective need based technology delivery in rural areas, the establishment of SETS (Society for Electronic Transactions and Security), are making significant impact. During the last few years, he along with National Informatic Center helped conceptualise and supervise the setting up of the high-speed 'National Knowledge Network' to connect about 1,500 educational and research institutions in India. He has emphasized the need for 'Coherent Synergy' (a phrase he has coined) in India's Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) efforts to take India on a sustained fast-growth path. He has also focused on the importance of 'Directed Basic Research' as an addition to (not a substitute for) self-directed basic research.

==Awards and honours==
Chidambaram is the recipient a number of awards and honours. The Indian Government acknowledged his contribution to the successful nuclear tests by awarding the [[Padma Shri]], the fourth highest Civilian honour of the nation, in 1975 and the [[Padma Vibushan]], the second highest civilian honour, in 1999. His other prominent awards are the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the Indian Institute of Science (1991), the C.V. Raman Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress Association (1995), the Distinguished Materials Scientist of the Year Award of the Materials Research Society of India (1996), the R.D. Birla Award of the Indian Physics Association (1996), the H. K. Forodia Award for Excellence in S &amp; T (1998), the Hari Om Prerit Senior Scientist Award (2000), the Meghnad Saha Medal of the Indian National Science Academy (2002), the INS Homi Bhabha Lifetime Achievement Award of the Indian Nuclear Society (2006), the Life Time Contribution Award in Engineering (2009) from Indian National Academy of Engineering, the C.V. Raman Medal of the Indian National Science Academy. 
He has been awarded D.Sc. degrees (Honoris Causa) by more than twenty universities in India and abroad. Chidambaram is a Fellow of all the science Academies in India and the [[Third World Academy of Science]] (TWAS), Trieste (Italy). 
He has also served as a member, chairman and president of a number of organizations which, among others, include [[Indian Institute of Technology Madras|IIT-Madras]], [[Indian Institute of Technology Bombay|IIT-Bombay]], the Materials Research Society of India, the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), and the International Union of Crystallography. In early 2008, the IAEA invited Chidambaram to be a member of the "Commission of Eminent Persons", for making recommendations to the Board of Governors, regarding long-term priorities and funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/02/28/stories/2008022850591200.htm |title=R.

A '''spindle''', in [[furniture]], is a [[rotational symmetry|cylindrically symmetric]] shaft, usually made of wood.  A spindle is usually made of a single piece of wood and typically has decoration (also axially symmetric) fashioned by hand or with a [[lathe]].  The spindle was common at least as early as the 17th century in [[Western Europe]] as an element of [[chair]] and [[table (furniture)|table]] legs, [[stretcher (furniture)|stretchers]], [[candlestick]]s, [[baluster]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allyourstairs.co.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt; and other pieces of [[cabinet making|cabinetry]].  By definition, the axis of a spindle is straight; hence, for example, a spindle-legged chair is a straight-legged design, even though cylindrical symmetry allows decoration of elaborate notches or bulbs, so long as the cylindrical symmetry is preserved.

The spindle leg design is characteristic of many Victorian and earlier Nursing chairs, exposed wood armchairs and a variety of cabinets and tables. In French furniture, the spindle leg may be found on [[Fauteuil]]s," chairs, a variety of tables and other pieces.

'''Staggered fermion''' is a technical subtlety that arises when [[fermion]]ic fields are included in [[lattice gauge theory]]. When one does so, many new unphysical fermionic excitations corresponding to alternating fermionic fields occur in the spectrum. This is known as the [[fermion doubling problem]]. A particular way to resolve this problem, first proposed by [[Leonard Susskind]] and [[John Kogut]] ( [[Kogut-Susskind fermion]]), is the staggered fermion approach where a new [[nonlocal Lagrangian|nonlocal action]] is constructed where the [[Dirac operator]] is treated as a square root.

The bonding between tantalum and carbon atoms in tantalum carbides is a complex mixture of ionic, metallic and covalent contributions, and because of the strong covalent component, these carbides are very hard and brittle materials.

'''Tonnage''' is a measure of the [[cargo]]-carrying capacity of a [[ship]]. The term derives from the taxation paid on ''[[Tun (unit)|tun]]s'' or casks of wine. In modern maritime usage, "tonnage" specifically refers to a calculation of the volume or cargo volume of a ship. Tonnage should not be confused with [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], which refers to the actual weight of the vessel. Tonnage is commonly used to assess [[fee]]s on [[commerce|commercial]] [[shipping]].

== Tonnage measurements ==
Tonnage measurements are governed by an IMO Convention (International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (London-Rules)), which applies to all ships built after July 1982.

'''[[Gross tonnage]]''' ('''GT''') is a function of the volume of all of a ship's enclosed spaces (from [[keel]] to [[funnel]]) measured to the outside of the hull framing. The numerical value for a ship's GT is always[*] smaller than the numerical values of ''gross register tonnage (GRT).'' Gross tonnage is therefore a kind of capacity-derived index that is used to rank a ship for purposes of determining manning, safety, and other statutory requirements and is expressed simply as GT, which is a unitless entity, even though it derives from the cubic feet of volumetric capacity. 

'''[[Net tonnage]]''' ('''NT''') is based on a calculation of the volume of all cargo spaces of the ship. It indicates a vessel's earning space and is a function of the moulded volume of all cargo spaces of the ship.

A commonly defined measurement system is important, since a ship's registration fee, harbour dues, safety and manning rules, and the like may be based on its gross tonnage (GT) or net tonnage (NT).

'''[[Gross register tonnage]]''' ('''GRT''') represents the total internal [[volume]] of a vessel, where one register ton is equal to a volume of 100 [[cubic foot|cubic feet]] (2.83168&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2,800&amp;nbsp;kg or 2.8 [[tonne]]s. The definition (and calculation) of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship's hold may be assessed for [[Bulk cargo|bulk grain]] (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for [[:wikt:bale#Etymology 3|bale]]s (omitting the spaces into which bulk, but not baled cargo, would spill). Gross register tonnage was replaced by ''gross tonnage'' in 1982 under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969, with all ships measured in GRT either scrapped or re-measured in GT by 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?dom=ontology&amp;xml=sectionL.xml ''CWP Handbook of Fishery Statistical Standards'']. Retrieved May 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=259&amp;doc_id=685 ''International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116151225/http://www.imo.org/Conventions/contents.asp?topic_id=259&amp;doc_id=685 |date=2008-01-16 }}, International Maritime Organisation. Retrieved May 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Net register tonnage]]''' ('''NRT''') is the volume of cargo the vessel can carry—that is, the gross register tonnage less the volume of spaces that do not hold [[cargo]] (e.g., [[engine]] compartment, [[Ship's wheel|helm]] station, and [[crew]] spaces, again with differences depending on which [[port]] or [[country]] does the calculations). It represents the volume of the ship available for transporting [[freight]] or [[passenger]]s. It was replaced by ''net tonnage'' in 1994, under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969.

The '''Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS)''' is based on ''net tonnage'', modified for Panama Canal purposes. PC/UMS is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel's total volume; one PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/general/peajes-en-el-canal.html ''Panama Canal Tolls''], from the [[Panama Canal Authority]]. Retrieved May 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suez Canal Net Tonnage (SCNT)''' is derived with a number of modifications from the former net register tonnage of the [[Moorsom System]] and was established by the International Commission of Constantinople in its Protocol of 18 December 1873. It is still in use, as amended by the ''Rules of Navigation'' of the Suez Canal Authority, and is registered in the Suez Canal Tonnage Certificate.

'''[[Thames Measurement|Thames measurement tonnage]] (TM)''' is another volumetric system, generally used for small vessels such as [[yacht]]s; it uses a formula based on the vessel's length and beam.

== Weight measurements ==
While not tonnage in the proper sense, the following methods of ship measurement are often incorrectly referred to as such:

'''Lightship or lightweight''' measures the actual weight of the ship with no [[fuel]], passengers, [[cargo]], water, and the like on board.

'''[[Deadweight tonnage]]''' (often abbreviated as '''DWT''', for deadweight tonnes) is the displacement at any loaded condition minus the lightship weight. It includes the crew, passengers, cargo, [[fuel]], water, and stores. Like displacement, it is often expressed in long tons or in metric tons.

'''Metric tonnes per centimetre immersion''' (usually abbreviated to '''TPC''' or '''TPCMI''') is the number of metric tonnes (1,000 kg) that need to be loaded on the ship for the salt water [[Draft (hull)|draft]] (draught) to increase by one centimetre. The TPCMI is used to calculate the draft of the vessel with a given deadweight tonnage of cargo loaded. For a typical Panamax bulk carrier with a TPCMI of 80, the ship will sink (i.e., its draft will increase) by one centimetre for every 80 tonnes of cargo loaded. 

'''Imperial tons per inch immersion''' (usually abbreviated to '''TPI''') is the number of imperial long tons (2,240 lb) that need to be loaded on a vessel for the draft to increase by one inch. Old imperial TPI measurements are still occasionally used within the United States and the Panama Canal. As no ship has been measured by a classification society since the 1950s using imperial measures, modern TPI figures are therefore a conversion from the original metric measurements and should not be relied upon to be accurate.

== Non-maritime usage of the term ''tonnage'' ==&lt;!--linked from [[PT boat]]--&gt;

Tonnage can refer to the quantity of a mineral or the mineral ore extracted from a mine. It may refer to the production of any commodity that is normally expressed in tons or tonnes. The term can also apply to the total weight drawn by a railway locomotive, or the total weight of freight passing over a railway line or road. 

The tonnage may be expressed in short tons (2,000 lb), metric tons or tonnes (1,000 kg), or in long tons (2,240 lb). Often this distinction is not of any importance, however sometimes it is critical to define the exact units in which the tonnage is expressed.

== Origins ==
Historically, tonnage was the tax on ''tuns'' ([[cask]]s) of [[wine]] that held 954 litres (252 gallons) of wine and weighed 1016 kilograms (2,240 [[pound (mass)|pounds]]). This suggests that the unit of weight measurement, the [[long ton]] (1,016 kg or 2,240&amp;nbsp;lb), and tonnage share the same etymology. The confusion between weight-based terms ([[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] and [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]]) stems from this common source and the eventual decision to assess dues based on a ship's [[Deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] rather than counting the tuns of wine. In 1720 the [[Builder's Old Measurement]] Rule was adopted to estimate deadweight from the length of [[keel]] and maximum breadth or [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of a ship. This overly simplistic system was replaced by the [[Moorsom System]] in 1854 and calculated internal volume, not weight. This system evolved into the current set of internationally accepted rules and regulations.

When steamships came into being, they could carry less cargo, size for size, than could sailing ships. In addition to spaces taken up by boilers and steam engines, steamships carried extra fresh water for the boilers and coal for the engines. Thus, to move the same volume of cargo as a sailing ship, a steamship would be considerably larger than a sailing ship.

Harbour dues are based on tonnage. In order to prevent steamships operating at a disadvantage, various tonnage calculations were established to minimize the disadvantage presented by the extra space requirements of steamships. Rather than charging by length, displacement, or the like, charges were calculated based on the viable cargo space. As commercial cargo sailing ships are now largely extinct, gross tonnage is becoming the universal method of calculating ships' dues, and is also a more straightforward and transparent method of assessment.

A '''water scoop''' is a simple [[hydropower]] [[machine]]&amp;ndash;that is, a machine used to extract power from the flow of water. Unlike a [[water wheel]] it operates intermittently, like a [[seesaw]]: A container (a bucket or cup) at the end of a lever is filled with water in the upper position. The container side becomes heavier, and so the lever with the filled container moves downward, which may be used to operate a machine drive. In the lower position the container is emptied, and the lever moves back into the upward position. 

Because of their inferior efficiency compared to a water mill, water scoops are less common, and have been used in the past mostly for applications where linear motion is required rather than rotation, for example [[hammer]]s in [[smithery|smitheries]], saws in [[sawmill]]s, and stamp mills in [[mining]]. They are also used for [[fulling]] and, nowadays, to operate animated sculptures in [[fountain]]s.

[[Image:Weatherhead.JPG|thumb|A weatherhead on a residence in Mount Vernon, Washington, USA]]

A '''weatherhead''', also called a '''weathercap''', '''service head''', '''service entrance cap''', or '''gooseneck''' (slang) is a [[wikt:weatherproof|weatherproof]] [[service drop]] entry point where overhead power or telephone wires enter a building, or where wires transition between overhead and underground cables.   At a building the wires enter a [[Electrical conduit|conduit]], a protective metal pipe, and the weatherhead is a waterproof cap on the end of the conduit that allows the wires to enter without letting in water.   It is shaped like a [[Hood (headgear)|hood]], with the surface where the wires enter facing down at an [[angle]] of at least 45°, to shield it from precipitation.  A [[rubber]]ized [[gasket]] makes for a tight [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] against the [[wire]]s.  Before they enter the weatherhead, a ''drip loop'' is left in the [[overhead wire]]s,  which permits [[Rain|rain water]] that collects on the wires to drip off before reaching the weatherhead.

A weatherhead termination is only used at low voltages (up to 600 volts), since higher distribution voltages require more insulation between conductors and metal enclosures. Higher voltage connections are made through a [[pothead]].  &lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pansini ''Guide to Electrical Power Distribution Systems'',The Fairmont Press, Inc., 2005 088173506X, page 138 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Weatherheads are required by [[electrical code]]s or [[building code]]s.  They are also used on [[utility pole]]s where [[Overhead wire| overhead power lines]] enter a conduit to pass underground.

The '''winged bean''' ('''''Psophocarpus tetragonolobus'''''), also known as the '''Goa bean''', '''four-angled bean''', '''four-cornered bean''', '''Manila bean''', and '''dragon bean''', is a tropical [[legume]] [[plant]] native to [[New Guinea]].

It grows abundantly in the hot, humid [[Equatorial region|equatorial]] countries of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. In Southeast Asia and [[Papua New Guinea]] it is widely known, but only cultivated on a small scale.&lt;ref name=Khan&gt;{{cite book|last=Khan|first=T.|title=Winged Bean Production in the Tropics|year=1982|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winged bean is widely recognised by farmers and consumers in southern Asia for its variety of uses and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]]. Winged bean is nutrient-rich, and all parts of the plant are edible. Leaves can be eaten like spinach, flowers can be used in salads, tubers can be eaten raw or cooked, seeds can be used in similar ways as the [[soybean]]. The winged bean is an underutilised species but has the potential to become a major multi-use food crop in the [[tropics]] of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref name =Khan /&gt;

The winged bean species belongs to the genus ''[[Psophocarpus]]'', which is part of the legume family, [[Fabaceae]].&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Species in the Psophocarpus genus are [[perennial plant|perennial]] herbs grown as [[annual plant|annuals]].&lt;ref name=Hym&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hymowitz|first=T|author2=Boyd, J. |title=Ethnobotany and Agriculture Potential of the Winged Bean|journal=[[Economic Botany]]|volume=31|issue=2|pages=180–188|doi=10.1007/bf02866589}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Psophocarpus'' species have tuberous roots and pods with wings.&lt;ref name =NRC1975&gt;[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] (U.S.).

[[U.S. National Academies]].&lt;/ref&gt; They can climb by twining their stems around a support.

==Appearance==
The winged bean plant grows as a vine with climbing stems and [[Leaf|leaves]], 3–4 m in height. It is an [[herb]]aceous [[Perennial plant|perennial]], but can be grown as an [[Annual plant|annual]]. It is generally taller and notably larger than the [[common bean]]. The bean pod is typically {{convert|15|–|22|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and has four wings with frilly edges running lengthwise. The skin is waxy and the flesh partially translucent in the young pods. When the pod is fully ripe, it turns an ash-brown color and splits open to release the seeds. The large [[flower]] is a pale blue. The beans themselves are similar to soybeans in both use and nutritional content (being 29.8% to 39% protein).

The appearance of the winged bean varies abundantly. The shape of its leaves ranges from ovate to deltoid, ovate-lanceolate, lanceolate, and long lanceolate.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; The green tone of the leaves also varies. The stem, most commonly, is green, but sometimes boasts purple.

The pods are usually rectangular, but sometimes appear flat. Pods may be coloured cream, green, pink, or purple. Pods may be smooth are appear smooth or rough, depending on the [[genotype]]. Seed shape is often round; oval and rectangular seeds also occur. Seeds may appear white, cream, dark tan, or brown, depending on growing and storage conditions.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

The entire winged bean plant is edible. The leaves, flowers, roots, and bean pods can be eaten raw or cooked; the pods are edible even when raw and unripe. The seeds are edible after cooking. Each of these parts contains [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[calcium]], and [[iron]], among other nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthaliciousness.com/nutritionfacts/nutrition-comparison.php?o=16135&amp;t=11597&amp;h=11599&amp;s=100&amp;e=100&amp;r=100|title=Side by Side Nutrition Facts Comparison for Winged beans mature seeds raw - Winged bean leaves raw - Winged bean tuber raw|work=healthaliciousness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tender pods, which are the most widely eaten part of the plant, are best when eaten before they exceed {{convert|2.5|cm|1}} in length. They are ready for harvest within three months of planting. The flowers are used to colour rice and pastry. The young leaves can be picked and prepared as a [[leaf vegetable]], similar to spinach.

The nutrient-rich, tuberous roots have a nutty flavour. They are about 20% protein; winged bean roots have more protein than many other [[root vegetable]]s.&lt;ref name=NRC1981 /&gt; The leaves and flowers are also high in protein (10–15%).&lt;ref name=NRC1981 /&gt;

The seeds are about 35% protein and 18% fat. They require cooking for two to three hours to destroy the [[trypsin inhibitor]]s and [[hemagglutinin]]s that inhibit digestion.&lt;ref name=NRC1981&gt;National Research Council.

Board on Science and Technology for International Development, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; They can be eaten dried or roasted. Dried and ground seeds make a useful [[flour]], and can be brewed to make a [[coffee]]-like drink.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The beans are rich not only in protein, but in [[tocopherol]]s (antioxidants that facilitate [[vitamin A]] utilisation in the body).&lt;ref&gt;[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] (U.S.), 1975&lt;/ref&gt; They can be made into milk when blended with water and an [[emulsifier]].&lt;ref name=Yang&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5943916&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5943916 | title=Winged Bean Milk | author=Yang, J., Tan, H. | journal=International Conference on New Technology of Agricultural Engineering, [[Zibo]] |date=May 2011  | pages=814–817 | doi=10.1109/ICAE.2011.5943916 | ISBN=978-1-4244-9574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winged bean milk is similar to [[soy milk]], but without the bean-rich flavour.&lt;ref name=Yang /&gt; The flavour of raw beans is not unlike that of [[asparagus]]. In Malaya, winged beans are used as an effective remedy for smallpox, and as a cure for vertigo.&lt;ref name =Hym /&gt;

Smoked pods, dried seeds, tubers (cooked and uncooked), and leaves have been sold in domestic markets in South East and South Asia.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Mature seeds can command a high price.&lt;ref name=NRC1975 /&gt;

===As animal feed===
Winged bean is a potential food source for ruminants, poultry,&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; fish, and other livestock.

For [[commercial fish feed]], winged bean is a potentially lower-cost protein source. In Africa, [[fish meal]] is especially scarce and expensive.&lt;ref name=Fag&gt;Fagbenro, A. (1999). Comparative evaluation of heat-processed Winged bean Psophocarpus tetragonolobus meals as partial replacement for fish meal in diets for the African catfish Clarias gariepinus. Aquaculture 170 (1999), 297-305.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clarias gariepinus|African sharptooth catfish]], a highly valued food fish in Africa,&lt;ref name=Fag /&gt; can eat winged bean.
In Papua New Guinea highlands region where winged beans thrive, the husks are fed to the domesticated pigs as part of the dietary supplements.

==Germination==
Winged bean is a self-pollinating plant but mutations and occasional outcrossing, may produce variations in the species.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; The pretreatment of winged bean seeds is not required in tropical climate, but scarification of seeds has shown to enhance the germination rate of seedlings.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Seed soaking may also increase speed to germination, as is typical, and may be used in conjunction with scarification. Seedlings under natural field conditions have been reported to emerge between 5–7 days.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

Winged bean can grow at least as fast as comparable legumes, including soy.[16] Plants flower 40 to 140 days after sowing.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Pods reach full-length about two weeks after pollination. Three weeks after pollination, the pod becomes fibrous; after six weeks, mature seeds are ready for harvest.&lt;ref name=NRC1975 /&gt; Tuber development and flower production vary according to genotype and environmental factors. Some winged bean varieties do not produce tuberous roots.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; The winged bean is a tropical plant, and will only flower when the day length is shorter than 12 hours, although some varieties have been reported to be day-length neutral.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.echobooks.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=s407&lt;/ref&gt; All varieties of winged bean grow on a vine and must grow over a support. Some examples of support systems include: growing against exterior walls of houses, huts, buildings; supporting against larger perennial trees; stakes placed in the ground vertically; and structures made from posts and wires.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

Because the early growth of winged bean is slow, it is important to maintain weeds. Slow early growth makes winged bean susceptible to weed competition in the first 4–6 weeks of development.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Khan (1982) recommends weeding by hand or animal drawn tractor two times before the support system of the winged bean is established.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

Winged bean can be grown without added fertiliser as the plant has a bacterium on the nodules of the roots that fixes nitrogen and allows the plant to absorb nitrogen.&lt;ref name=NRC1975 /&gt;  Factors that influence nitrogen fixation include, Rhizobium strain, interactions between strain and host genotype, available nutrients and soil pH.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

==Growing conditions==
[[File:WingedBean.jpg|thumb|alt=Four winged bean pods rest in the palm of a man's hand |Winged beans grown in a south-facing, raised compost bed in Alpine, New Jersey, USA]]

Although winged bean thrives in hot weather and favours humidity, it is adaptable.&lt;ref name= Khan /&gt; The plant's ability to grow in heavy rainfall makes it a candidate for the people of the [[Tropical Africa|African tropics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Village Earth]]. (2011). Appropriate Technology: Sustainable Agriculture. Appropriate Technology Library. Chapter: Tropical Legumes. Retrieved from http://villageearth.org/pages/sourcebook/sustainable-agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

Winged bean production is optimal in humidity, but the species is susceptible to [[moisture stress]] and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]].&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Ideal growing temperature is 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Lower temperatures suppress germination, and extremely high temperatures inhibit yield.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

Even moderate variations in the growing climate can affect yield. Growing winged bean in lower temperatures can increase tuber production.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Leaf expansion rate is higher in a warmer climate. For the highest yields, the soil should remain moist throughout the plant's life cycle.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; Although the plant is tropical, it can flourish in a dry climate if irrigated.&lt;ref name=NRC1975 /&gt; If the plant matures during the drier part of the growing season, yields are higher.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;

Winged bean is an effective [[cover crop]]; planting it uniform with the ground suppresses weed growth.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt; As a restorative crop, winged bean can improve nutrient-poor soil with nitrogen when it is turned over into the soil.&lt;ref name=Khan /&gt;
