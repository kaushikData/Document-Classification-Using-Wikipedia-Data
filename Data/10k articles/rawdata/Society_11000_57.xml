'''{{'}}Ole''', also called '''{{'}}Olekha''' or '''Black Mountain [[Monpa people|Monpa]]''', is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken by about 1,000 people in the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]] of [[Wangdue Phodrang District|Wangdue Phodrang]] and [[Trongsa District]]s in western [[Bhutan]]. The term 'Ole refers to a clan of speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Center of Nepal and Asian Studies Journal |title=In Quest of Mahākirānti |last=van Driem |first=George |author-link=George van Driem |volume=19 |number=2   |pages=241–247 |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_19_02_05.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-10-23 |date=July  1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
According to the ''[[Ethnologue]]'', Olekha is spoken in the following locations of [[Bhutan]].
*[[Trongsa District]]: 3 enclaves west of Mangde river
*[[Wangdue Phodrang District]]: Adha, Jangji, Rukha, Thrumzur, and Wangling villages

Dialects are separated by the [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]].

==Varieties==
Black Mountain Monpa is spoken in at least 6 villages. The variety spoken in Rukha village, south-central Wangdi is known as ’Olekha.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2016"&gt;Gwendolyn Hyslop. 2016. Worlds of knowledge in Central Bhutan: Documentation of 'Olekha. Language Documentation &amp; Conservation 10. 77-106.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a population of 100-150 people (about 15 households) in Rukha village, there is only one elderly female fluent speaker and two semi-fluent speakers of ’Olekha.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2016"/&gt;

George van Driem (1992)&lt;ref&gt;van Driem, George. 1992. ''The Monpa language of the Black Mountains''. Presented at ICSTLL 25.&lt;/ref&gt; reports a Western dialect (spoken in Rukha and Reti villages) and Eastern dialect (spoken in Cungseng village).

==History==
'Ole was unknown beyond its immediate area until 1990,{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} and is now highly endangered, and was originally assumed to be [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish]].&lt;ref name=BlenchPost13&gt;Blench, R. &amp; Post, M. W. (2013). [https://www.academia.edu/627686/Rethinking_Sino-Tibetan_phylogeny_from_the_perspective_of_North_East_Indian_languages Rethinking Sino-Tibetan phylogeny from the perspective of Northeast Indian languages]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George van Driem]] described 'Ole as a remnant of the primordial population of the Black Mountains before the southward expansion of the ancient East Bodish tribes.&lt;ref name=vanDriem93&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |author-link=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[SOAS, University of London]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101084255/http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo%3A3003 |archivedate=1 November 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Gwendolyn Hyslop (2016),&lt;ref name="Hyslop2016"/&gt; agreeing with van Driem, has suggested that 'Ole is an isolated Sino-Tibetan language heavily influenced by [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Driem |first=George L. |author-link=George van Driem |title=Tibeto-Burman subgroups and historical grammar |journal=Himalayan Linguistics Journal |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=31–39 |url=http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/HimalayanLinguistics/articles/2011/HLJ1001B.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112220623/http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/HimalayanLinguistics/articles/2011/HLJ1001B.html |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its small amount of cognates with East Bodish languages, Blench and Post provisionally treat 'Ole as an isolate.&lt;ref name=BlenchPost13/&gt;

==External relationships==
The distantly related [[Tshangla language]] of eastern Bhutan, also called "Monpa" and predating Dzongkha, also belongs to the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].&lt;ref name=vanDriem93/&gt;&lt;ref name=vanDriem1&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=van Driem |author-link=George van Driem |year=2001 |title=Languages of the Himalayas: An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayan Region |publisher=Brill |pages=915 ''et seq.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 'Ole is most closely related to the [[Bumthang language]], both being [[East Bodish languages]], Tshangla and related languages form a sister branch not to the East Bodish group, but to its parent [[Bodish languages|Bodish branch]]. Thus the ambiguous term "Monpa" risks separating languages that should be grouped together, while grouping languages together that are quite separate.&lt;ref name=Andvik&gt;{{cite book |title=A Grammar of Tshangla |volume=10 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |series=Tibetan Studies Library |first=Erik E. |last=Andvik |year=2010 |pages=4–7 |isbn=9004178279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerber (2018)&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Pascal. 2018. ''[https://www.academia.edu/36564118/Areal_features_in_Gongduk_Bjokapakha_and_Black_Mountain_M%C3%B6npa_phonology_Draft_ Areal features in Gongduk, Bjokapakha and Black Mountain Mönpa phonology]''. Unpublished draft.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Black Mountain Mönpa has had extensive contact with [[Gongduk language|Gongduk]] before the arrival of [[East Bodish languages]] in [[Bhutan]]. The following comparative vocabulary table from Gerber (2018: 13-16) compares Gongduk, Black Mountain Mönpa, and Bjokapakha, which is a divergent [[Tshangla language|Tshangla]] variety.

==Vocabulary==
Hyslop (2016)&lt;ref name="Hyslop2016"/&gt; notes that Olekha has borrowed heavily from [[East Bodish languages|East Bodish]] and [[Tibetic languages]], but also has a layer of native vocabulary items. Numerals are mostly borrowed from East Bodish languages, while body parts and nature words are borrowed from both Tibetic and East Bodish languages. Hyslop (2016) lists the following Olekha words of clearly indigenous (non-borrowed) origin.
{{div col}}
*six: ''wok''
*head: ''peː''
*face: ''ék''
*rain: ''gø''
*earth: ''tʰabak''
*ash: ''tʰækʰu''
*stone: ''loŋ''
*fire: ''ámik''
*grandfather: ''tana''
*grandmother: ''ʔɐˈpeŋ''
*chicken: ''ˈkɤgɤ''
*mustard: ''pekoŋ''
*cotton: ''ʔɐˈpʰɪt''
*eggplant: ''ˈpandala''
*[[foxtail millet]]: ''ʔamet''
{{div col end}}

The pronouns and lexical items for all foraged plants are also of indigenous origin. Additionally, the [[Close-mid back unrounded vowel|central vowel]] /ɤ/ and [[voiced uvular fricative]] /ʁ/ are only found in non-borrowed words.&lt;ref name="Hyslop2016"/&gt;

Words whose origin is not certain (i.e., may or may not be borrowed) are:&lt;ref name="Hyslop2016"/&gt;
{{div col}}
*nose: ''ná'' (perhaps borrowed from East Bodish?)
*arm: ''lok'' (perhaps borrowed from Tibetic?)
*wind: ''lǿ''
*water: ''cø''
*mother: ''ʔɔmɔ''
*father: ''ʔɔpɔ''
*dog: ''tʃylɔ''
*sheep: ''lu''
*barley: ''nápʰa''
*[[bitter buckwheat]]: ''máma''

The '''2011 Haimen protest''' of December 2011 occurred in the Chinese town of [[Haimen, Guangdong|Haimen]], [[Guangdong province]]. The protests, which drew thousands of participants, were met with detentions and tear gassing by authorities.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Michael Wines, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/world/asia/china-jails-rights-activist-chen-wei-for-9-years.html?_r=3 Police Fire Tear Gas at Protesters in Chinese City], New York Times, 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Protests were ignited over plans to expand a coal-fired power plant in the town—a plan that residents opposed, arguing that existing coal-fired plants had caused environmental and health damage.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/simp/chinese_news/2011/12/111220_haimen_protest.shtml 广东海门逾万民众抗议反对建电厂] BBC中文網，2011年12月20日&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrations began on Tuesday, 20 December when thousands of residents barricaded a freeway and surrounded government offices in an attempt to block the project.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; 

According to AFP, the riot police fired tear gas into the crowd and beat protesters with riot sticks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iZA9mo9YrWEbDFUhj-4_QNjh8fvg?docId=CNG.26ca44d2792efc30a1d45b7e1da3908a.251 Police in China fire tear-gas, beat protesters: witnesses] Google News:AFP，20 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Late on 20 December, the state-run [[Xinhua News Agency]] said that five residents had been detained on vandalism charged, and published a declaration from the Shantou city council announcing that the "Shantou deputy and municipality already decided to stop the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapress.com.my/node/278881 華電發電項目暫停] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419022028/http://www.chinapress.com.my/node/278881 |date=19 April 2012 }} 中國報，20 December 2011: 「汕頭市委、市政府已決定暫停上馬這一項目」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;《[https://web.archive.org/web/20120109032522/http://www.dahuawang.com/strb/html/2011-12/21/content_277192.htm 市委、市政府妥善处置潮阳区海门镇部分群众堵塞深汕高速公路的行为]》(汕頭日報，2011/12/21)&lt;/ref&gt; Unconfirmed reports of two deaths circulated online following the first day of protests, though authorities denied these reports.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;Reuters, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/21/china-protest-plant-idUSL3E7NL0KR20111221 Chinese official denies reports of deaths at Haimen protest], 21 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions cooled by 23 December, after [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] officials declared that the plant expansion plans would be temporarily suspended, and authorities agreed to release detained protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Presse, [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iA8Bsv0H3uV5csLrwZpvqjvJbsgA?docId=CNG.1b4291d697ee9c20c9e8e44453865af5.361 South China town unrest cools after dialogue], 23 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although the protests in Haimen were unrelated to demonstrations in nearby [[Protests of Wukan|Wukan]],  Haimen residents told Reuters that they had followed developments in Wukan closely, regarding it as a good model of how citizens might negotiate with authorities.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;

The '''2012–15 unrest in [[Romania]]''' refers to a prolonged period of [[civil unrest]] and political scandals in Romania, which took magnitude after the second half of the 2000s. The wave of civil demonstrations started in January 2012, once with the introduction of a new health reform legislation. The protests were fueled by the austerity measures applied in May 2010, but also by the unpopularity of [[Traian Băsescu|Băsescu]]-backed [[Boc Cabinets|Boc government]]. The demonstrations were characterized by widespread rioting and acts of vandalism. The political situation precipitated, so Prime Minister [[Emil Boc]] decided to step down on 6 February 2012.

In the first six months of the year, three governments have been changed. The summer of 2012 was marked by a large-scale [[2012 Romanian political crisis|political crisis]], fed by [[Victor Ponta#Plagiarism controversy|accusations of plagiarism]] to PSD-backed Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]] and culminating with the suspension of President [[Traian Băsescu]]. Although the [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|presidential impeachment referendum]] showed that over 80% of the voters wanted his dismissal, the referendum was invalidated by the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]] due to presence below 50% at polls. During this period, Romania was warned by Western powers about the state of democracy, inasmuch as the dismissal of the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies was made in a shady manner, and prominent figures of PSD, including Vice-President [[Liviu Dragnea]], were accused of vote rigging in the referendum.

After sweeping victory in [[Romanian legislative election, 2012|legislative election on 9 December 2012]], Victor Ponta – supported by the [[Social Liberal Union]] – was named [[Prime Minister of Romania]]. His mandate was marked by corruption scandals and street protests. The demonstrations had various causes, among them the tax hikes, the exploitation of [[shale gas]] through [[hydraulic fracturing]] and the [[Roșia Montană Project]]. Hundreds of thousands of people, including doctors, teachers, students and laborers, took to the street to shout their dissatisfaction regarding his policies. Employees in transport and health system triggered several strikes in this period. Although mainly peaceful, the protests degenerated in some cases in clashes between demonstrators and law enforcers. Ponta Government was accused by national and international organizations of excessive use of force in the [[2012–14 Romanian protests against shale gas#Revolt of Pungești|Revolt of Pungești]]. Ethnic Hungarians started a series of protests for the autonomy of [[Szeklerland]], while the unionist movements (see ''[[Unification of Romania and Moldova|Action 2012]]'') demanded the [[unification of Romania and Moldova]], both in Romania and over the [[Prut]].

In the winter of 2014, the ruling alliance collapsed, after internal tensions between PSD and PNL. The [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] left the alliance and merged with the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] to form the largest right-wing party in Romania in the post-revolutionary period. In the summer of the same year, [[Victor Ponta]] from PSD and [[Klaus Iohannis]] from PNL launched their candidatures for the [[Romanian presidential election, 2014|presidential election]]. To everyone's surprise, ethnic German [[Klaus Iohannis]] won the election. Ponta's failure was mainly due to irregularities concerning the voting process in diaspora and numerous corruption scandals involving figures from the party he leads. During the electoral campaign, people protested against Victor Ponta and members of his government, inasmuch as thousands of Romanian citizens in diaspora were prevented from exercising their right to vote due to bad organization of the election process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandul.info/voteaza/mesajul-romanilor-din-diaspora-demisia-lui-ponta-reconstruirea-romaniei-depinde-de-noi-toti-iohannis-a-primit-girul-dar-suntem-cu-ochii-pe-el-13578118 |title=Mesajul românilor din diaspora: "Demisia Lui Ponta.

== Background ==

=== Social issues ===
Romania is the country with the highest poverty levels in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nineoclock.ro/romania-the-country-with-the-highest-poverty-levels-in-the-eu/ |title=Romania, the country with the highest poverty levels in the EU |newspaper=Nine O'Clock |author =Anca Bernovici |date=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 30% of the population lives on less than $5 per day. In a report conducted by the Presidential Commission for the Analysis of Social and Demographic Risks is specified that there are visible discrepancies between social strata, privileged groups benefiting of higher wages and pensions in comparison with the rest of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ro/static/CPARSDR_raport_extins.pdf |title=Riscuri și inechități sociale în România |work=Presidential Administration |date=September 2009 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bankruptcy of many companies thickens the unemployment rate, in July 2013 reaching the value of 7.6%, highest since onset of the [[Great Recession in Europe|economic crisis]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/social/nivel-record-al-somajului-in-ultimii-ani-cati-someri-sunt-in-romania-11184401 |title=Nivel RECORD al șomajului în ultimii ani.

After application of drastic austerity measures in 2010, the Romanian economy recovered. Thus, in 2013, Romania recorded the highest economic growth in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101205409 |title='Tiger' of Eastern Europe is waking up: Romanian PM |newspaper=CNBC |author =Holly Ellyatt |date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this growth, the [[standard of living]] is decreasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-13-008/EN/KS-SF-13-008-EN.PDF |title=Living standards falling in most Member States |work=Eurostat}}&lt;/ref&gt; many Romanians being unable to endure everyday expenses. Poor working conditions, mass layoffs and tax hikes displease the population that is filling the squares of main cities to shout their grievances.

=== Political turmoil ===
Over the past 25 years, Romania has experienced a complex process of democratization with moments of crisis, economic stagnation, radical nationalism and extreme polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bunce |first1=Valerie |last2=Wolchik |first2=Sharon |date=October 2006 |title=Favorable Conditions and Electoral Revolutions |url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/favorable-conditions-and-electoral-revolutions |publisher=Journal of Democracy |pages=5–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soare |first=Sorina |date=2011 |title=Bulgaria e Romania, vent'anni dopo: il peso del passato, le sfide del presente |trans-title=Bulgaria and Romania, two decades later: the weight of the past, the challenges of the present |url=https://www.academia.edu/1030094/Bulgaria_e_Romania_ventanni_dopo_il_peso_del_passato_le_sfide_del_presente |language=Italian |location=Bologna |publisher=Il Mulino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Romania–NATO relations|Romania's admission into NATO in 2004]], and [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|into the European Union in 2007]], the political situation remained unstable, with recurrent institutional clashes between the President, Prime Minister and Parliament, such as in 2007 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gherghina |first1=Sergiu |last2=Mișcoiu |first2=Sergiu |date=2013 |title=The Failure of Cohabitation: The Institutional Crises in Romania |url=http://eep.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/05/13/0888325413485621.full.pdf |publisher=East European Politics and Societies |pages=668–684}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tough austerity measures that fuelled social tensions.

These were the first events of the two-year civil unrest. They were triggered by the introduction of a new health reform legislation and worsening standard of life. President [[Traian Băsescu]]'s popularity collapsed mainly after imposing austerity measures in 2010, year when Romania also confronted with short living but large street demonstrations. The attempted privatization of [[SMURD]] and the denigration by Traian Băsescu of [[Raed Arafat]], its founder, was vehemently criticized by people on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16570860 |title=Romania protests: PM Emil Boc calls for dialogue |newspaper=BBC News |date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests started with a 3,000-large demonstration in [[Târgu Mureș]] on 12 January, as a sign of solidarity with Raed Arafat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfi.ro/articol/stiri/social/manifestatie-sustinere-doctorului-arafat-targu-mures |title=Manifestație de susținere a doctorului Arafat la Târgu Mureș |work=Radio France Internationale |date=13 January 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following weeks, protests spread to other sixty Romanian cities and dozens of cities in the [[Romanian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/15/world/europe/romania-protests/ |title=Protesters gather for fourth straight day in Romania |work=CNN |author =Liliana Ciobanu |date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bucharest]], the largest protest took place on 19 January, when up to 20,000 people expressed their disagreements with Băsescu regime. Several days, Bucharest faced widespread rioting and acts of vandalism. Thousands of policemen and gendarmes were deployed on the streets to confront angry demonstrators that stoned the vehicles of the law enforcers, vandalized shops and burned cars. Riot police used tear gas and flares to repel demonstrators who blocked traffic in the center of Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/world/europe/romanians-protest-austerity-measures.html?_r=0 |title=Protests Over Austerity Measures Turn Violent in Romania |newspaper=The New York Times |date=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Gendarmerie, destructions were caused by football ultras infiltrated among peaceful demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20120116-unrest-romania-violent-rioters-fight-peaceful-protester-demonstration-bucharest-basescu-health-care-austerity |title=Unrest in Bucharest: protesters say a minority of violent rioters were 'out for a fight' |newspaper=France 24 |date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these days of turmoil, several protesters entered the [[Romanian Television]] headquarters to blame the broadcaster for [[media censorship|censorship]].

On the morning of 6 February 2012, Prime Minister [[Emil Boc]] announced his resignation, in an attempt "to ease the social situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/06/romanian-pm-emil-boc-resigns |title=Romanian prime minister Emil Boc resigns |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During weeks of protests, Băsescu stated nothing and didn't appear in public.

Soon after government led by [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]] fell in [[motion of no confidence|no confidence vote]], [[Victor Ponta]] took in office. Ponta is an ardent Băsescu's opponent. In June 2012, they were the protagonists of a major political crisis, starting with conflicting views on Romania's representative to the [[European Council]] reunion of 28 June and escalating with the suspension of President Traian Băsescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/07/us-romania-politics-idUSBRE86609I20120707 |title=Germany, U.S: Romania power struggle hurts democracy |newspaper=Reuters |date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, Prime Minister Victor Ponta was accused of plagiarism in his doctoral thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/19/victor-ponta-plagiarism-romania-prime-minister_n_1609410.html |title=Victor Ponta, Romania Prime Minister, Accused of Plagiarism in Doctoral Thesis |newspaper=The Huffington Post |author =Alison Mutler |date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations fed the political instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romaniatv.net/reuters-acuzatiile-de-plagiat-la-adresa-lui-ponta-alimenteaza-instabilitatea-in-romania_34369.html |title=Reuters: Acuzațiile de plagiat la adresa lui Ponta alimentează INSTABILITATEA în România |work=România TV |date=29 June 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July, the Romanian Parliament, at the proposal of majority represented by [[Social Liberal Union]], voted the dismissal of [[President of the Senate of Romania|President of the Senate]] and [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|President of the Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capital.ro/usl-cere-revocarea-din-functie-a-robertei-anastase-si-a-lui-vasile-blaga-168644.html |title=USL cere revocarea din funcție a Robertei Anastase și a lui Vasile Blaga |newspaper=Capital |date=3 July 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an Emergency Ordinance, the government restricted the attributions of the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]], restoring them to the 2010 status. Likewise, USL leaders Victor Ponta and Crin Antonescu started procedures to dismiss President Traian Băsescu. These measures irritated the international politicians which expressed concerns over the state of democracy and the rule of law in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-concerned-over-romanian-parliament-impeachment-of-president-basescu-a-843382.html |title=The World from Berlin: A 'Humiliating Show Trial' in Romania |newspaper=Der Spiegel |date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 July, Băsescu was suspended after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/06/world/europe/romania-impeachment/index.html |title=Romanian president suspended |work=CNN |author =Liliana Ciobanu |date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion passed with 256 votes, 39 more than the minimum required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18742734 |title=Romanian parliament votes to suspend President Băsescu |work=BBC News |date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; USL leaders argued their action by saying that President Traian Băsescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority.

On 9 July, the Constitutional Court ascertained President Băsescu's suspension and confirmed [[Crin Antonescu]] as Interim President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.hotnews.ro/stiri-top_news-12753163-romania-39-constitutional-court-decides-procedure-suspend-president-basescu-was-constitutional-crin-antonescu-becomes-interim-president.htm |title=Romania's Constitutional Court decides procedure to suspend President Băsescu was constitutional.

In the following days, Crin Antonescu cut Băsescu's special phone line, after the Senate's Defence Committee found out that the Special Telecommunication Agency illegally deployed the secret phone line at Băsescu's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nineoclock.ro/antonescu-cuts-basescu%E2%80%99s-special-phone-line-suspended-president-denounces-new-%E2%80%98coup%E2%80%99/ |title=Antonescu cuts Băsescu's special phone line, suspended president denounces new 'coup' |newspaper=Nine O'Clock |author =Rodica Pricop |date=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Băsescu accused USL of dismantling all national security institutions and cataloged them as "a gang of traitors".

The [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|presidential impeachment referendum]] took place on 29 July. On 21 August, the Constitutional Court decided that the referendum is invalid due to presence under 50%. However, 87.52% of those present in the referendum voted for Băsescu's impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.becreferendum2012.ro/DOCUMENTE%20BEC/Rezultate/Rezultate%20finale.pdf |title=Comunicat privind rezultatele referendumului național din data de 29 iulie 2012 pentru demiterea Președintelui României |work=Central Electoral Bureau |date=1 August 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDL boycotted the referendum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/pdl-boicoteaza-referendumul-alegatorii-sa-nu-participe-la-vot-pe-29-iulie-9899083 |title=PDL boicotează referendumul: Alegătorii să nu participe la vot pe 29 iulie |work=Mediafax |date=24 July 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] exhorted ethnic Hungarians in Romania to stay away from the polls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politics.hu/20120730/romanian-pm-claims-outrage-over-hungarian-counterparts-comments-on-impeachment-referendum/ |title=Romanian PM claims "outrage" over Hungarian counterpart's comments on impeachment referendum |work=Politics.hu |date=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fact that explains the low turnout in Hungarian majority counties of [[Harghita County|Harghita]] and [[Covasna County|Covasna]].

The summer of 2012 in Romania was marked not only by political instability, but by civil unrest. In early July, on the background of plagiarism scandal, demonstrations took place in several locations in Bucharest. The demonstrations, entitled suggestively the "Protest of inverted commas" ({{lang-ro|Protestul ghilimelelor}}), were attended by hundreds of people, among them former Prime Minister Ungureanu, aiming Victor Ponta's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romania-insider.com/protests-in-pta-universitatii-and-pta-victoriei-against-romanias-entire-political-scene/60195/ |title=Protests downtown Bucharest against Romania's entire political scene |work=Romania-Insider.com |author =Ioana Toader |date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-referendum period, several demonstrations in support of President Traian Băsescu took place throughout the country. In [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and [[Timișoara]], clashes between pro- and anti-Băsescu demonstrators erupted, but were quickly dispersed by gendarmes. On 6 July, 2,000 people gathered at a rally in Bucharest to support President Băsescu. The rally was attended by prominent members of PDL and degenerated towards evening in altercations with anti-Băsescu demonstrators that infiltrated among supporters of the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/proteste-contra-basescu-in-piata-universitatii-cativa-manifestanti-s-au-luat-la-bataie.html |title=Proteste pro și contra Băsescu în Capitală.

Invalidation of the referendum infuriated Băsescu's opposers that gathered in their thousands in front of the [[National Theatre Bucharest|Bucharest National Theatre]]. Protesters shouted messages against CCR decision to invalidate the referendum and asked Traian Băsescu to resign. Likewise, many people have come up with anti-US placards, considering that Băsescu was reinstated at Americans desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ziare.com/stiri/proteste/proteste-pro-si-contra-basescu-in-pietele-din-bucuresti-dupa-decizia-ccr-1185549 |title=Proteste anti-Băsescu și anti-SUA la Universitate – Decizia CCR a scos sute de oameni în stradă |work=Ziare.com |author =Alexandra Șandru |date=22 August 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards evening things got out of control, people breached fences and entered on the carriageway, blocking traffic.

=== 2013 social protests ===
Worsening working conditions, mass layoffs and poor payroll have taken to the streets thousands of employees even in the early days of 2013. Probably the most dramatic and publicized case is [[Oltchim S.A.|Oltchim Râmnicu Vâlcea]], one of the largest chemical companies in Romania. The company recorded losses of €90.3&amp;nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2011, thus ending the year with a negative result of 270 million lei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cotidianul.ro/statul-a-pierdut-135-mil-euro-datoria-oltchim-a-fost-convertita-in-actiuni-175398/ |title=Statul a pierdut 135 mil. euro: Datoria Oltchim a fost convertită în acțiuni |newspaper=Cotidianul |author =Dan Zăvăleanu |date=8 March 2012 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://media.hotnews.ro/media_server1/document-2013-03-13-14407961-0-oltchim-raport-privind-cauzele-care-generat-starea-insolventa.pdf |title=Raport privind cauzele și împrejurările care au dus la apariția stării de insolvență a debitoarei S.C.

The deplorable situation of the company triggered mass unrest, also fueled by several failed attempts to privatize the plant. Protests took place throughout the year, one of the largest being organized on 28 March, when nearly 1,500 employees refused to start work and blocked the traffic on national road DN64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/economie/companii/protestele-de-la-oltchim-iau-amploare--angajatii-au-blocat-din-nou-dn-64--un-protestatar--lovit-de-o-masina-297449 |title=Protestele de la Oltchim iau Amploare.

==== CFR crisis ====
The deplorable situation of the [[Romanian Railways|national railway company]] took to the streets thousands of employees under the threat of job loss or salary reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realitatea.net/ceferistii-protesteaza-la-ministerul-transporturilor_1233560.html |title=2.500 de ceferiști au protestat la Guvern și la Ministerul Transporturilor |work=Realitatea.net |date=26 July 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2014, the company was shaken by two major strikes.

A larger strike took place on 23 April 2014, when, for two hours, rail traffic was paralyzed in major train stations in the country. According to syndicalists, the protest took place after failed negotiations on a new collective agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.evz.ro/greva-la-cfr-niciun-tren-nu-va-circula-miercuri-intre-700-si-900-.html |title=Greva de la CFR.

==== Protests of teachers and students ====
Protests and strikes were launched by teachers and students throughout the year, centered mainly on Ponta's poor policies regarding education. They claim that the education system is underfunded and require allocation of at least 6% of GDP to education. High school students also protested for bad settlement of commuting subscriptions.

On 21 May, over 2,000 students in [[Covasna County]] went on Japanese strike, inasmuch as the Ministry of Education hasn't settled, since October 2012, money for commuting subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.curierulnational.ro/Actualitate/2013-05-21/2.000+de+elevi+din+Covasna,+in+greva+japoneza+pentru+ca+nu+le-au+fost+decontate+abonamentele+pentru+naveta&amp;hl=Auto&amp;tip=toate |title=2.000 de elevi din Covasna, în grevă japoneză pentru că nu le-au fost decontate abonamentele pentru navetă |newspaper=Curierul Național |date=21 May 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those 2,000 students that went on Japanese strike, wearing white banderoles on arm, are from 15 high schools in the cities of [[Sfântu Gheorghe]], [[Târgu Secuiesc]], [[Covasna]] and [[Baraolt]]. Furthermore, students in Covasna organized a protest meeting. The Ministry of Education has accumulated, from October to March, a debt of more than 1.6&amp;nbsp;million lei for settlement of students commuting subscriptions in Covasna County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amosnews.ro/2000-de-elevi-din-covasna-greva-2013-05-21 |title=2.000 de elevi din Covasna, în grevă |work=Amos News |date=21 May 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, around 150 students from high schools throughout the [[Mureș County]] went on indefinitely Japanese strike, in solidarity with the colleagues which were not settled money for commuting subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/targu-mures/mures-elevi-greva-japoneza-decont-naveta-covasna-1_51a3521bc7b855ff562f1203/index.html |title=150 de elevi din Mureș sunt în grevă japoneză, din cauza banilor de navetă nedecontați.

On 13 November, thousands of students from 11 universities in [[Bucharest]], [[Timișoara]], [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Iași]], [[Constanța]], [[Galați]], [[Baia Mare]], [[Sibiu]], [[Suceava]], [[Oradea]] and [[Alba Iulia]] took to the streets to protest the underfunding of the education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-16016588-studentii-din-bucuresti-din-principalele-centre-universitare-ale-tarii-ies-strada-pentru-protesta-impotriva-subfinantarii-din-educatie-mitingul-din-capitala-incepe-ora-14-00-piata-universitatii-restri.htm |title=Studenții protestează față de "subfinanțarea" din educație.

Teachers' wages is a problem wherewith the education system confronts. In Romania, a teacher is paid 9.3 lei net (2.09 euros) per hour, compared to other European countries, where wages are up to 40 times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/societate/educatie/comparatie-%C5%9Eocanta-intre-salariile-profesorilor-din-europa--dascalii-din-romania--umili%C5%A2i-306603 |title=Comparație Șocantă între salariile profesorilor din Europa.

==== Doctors' strike ====
[[File:Marşul Tăcerii.jpg|thumb|March of Silence, 2 November]]
Situation in hospitals, poor payroll and lack of staff pushed the doctors to launch an ample program of protests aimed to alarm the minister [[Eugen Nicolăescu]] over collapse of Romanian health system. In September were held for two weeks picketings in front of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capital.ro/au-inceput-protestele-medicilor-din-toata-tara-186674.html |title=Au început protestele medicilor: pentru ce au ieșit în stradă |newspaper=Capital |author =Nicoleta Bănilă |date=18 September 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests are the largest since 1998&lt;ref name="Medicii si asistentii"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Sanatate/Medicii+si+asistentii+ies+in+strada+Protestul+halatelor+albe |title=Medicii și asistenții au ieșit în stradă.

==== Duty of 7 cents ====
There was a rough dispute between President Băsescu and Premier Ponta on fuel price rise by 7 cents, measure adopted since 1 April 2014. The head of state asked Victor Ponta to waive the fee he deems an unnecessary and discriminatory tax burden. Likewise, Traian Băsescu is convinced that the measure will lead to tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Economie/Stiri/Scumpiri+carburanti+1+aprilie+benzinarii+cozi+comunism+gaze |title=Carburanți supraaccizați și scumpiri în lanț de la 1 aprilie.

Protesters also accused the poor coverage of the protests by Romanian media.

There were also protests in support of the mining project. Organized only in the exploitation area, the largest protest attracted up to 5,000 locals and 33 miners blocked underground, who were fighting for the jobs promised by Roșia Montană Gold Corporation, inasmuch as the unemployment rate in the area is very high. In an attempt to defuse the tense situation of Roșia Montană, Prime Minister Victor Ponta descended into the underground to discuss with miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/15/us-romania-goldmine-protest-idUSBRE98E0FJ20130915 |title=Romanian gold miners end underground protest after PM's visit |work=Reuters |author =Radu Marinaș |date=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during massive protests against Roșia Montană Project, Ponta – main target of protests – didn't conduct any conversation with the representatives of the protesters.

Amendments to the Penal Code were strongly contested by President [[Traian Băsescu]], who said that he will return to the Parliament the law through which the president and MPs are removed from the category of civil servants. The Head of State said that the amendments to the Penal Code adopted by the Chamber are "dramatic" and "tear down ten years of work and activity of anticorruption institutions" such as [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] (DNA) or National Integrity Agency (ANI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.realitatea.net/basescu-modificarile-la-codul-penal-dramatice-darama-10-ani-de-munca-a-institutiilor-anticoruptie_1336819.html |title=Băsescu: Modificările la Codul penal, dramatice, dărămă 10 ani de muncă a instituțiilor anticorupție |newspaper=Realitatea.net |date=10 December 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President mentioned in a TV show about the [[dissolution of Parliament]], invoking the breach of the [[Copenhagen criteria]] through these amendments to the Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-16189858-traian-basescu-invitat-adevarul-live-despre-modificarea-codului-penal-invitatie-furt-fara-teama-consecintele-legii.htm |title=Traian Băsescu vorbește despre dizolvarea Parlamentului, în cazul în care se mențin modificările aduse Codului penal: Am văzut reacția CE și a aliaților noștri, cu aceste modificări am ieși din criteriile de la Copenhaga, ceea ce ar fi extrem de grav.

Baer, said, on 20 December, that the United States are concerned about the recent amendments to the Penal Code and warned that ratification of these amendments will result in weakening the [[rule of law]] in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.realitatea.net/sua-critica-dur-modificarea-codului-penal-statul-de-drept-va-fi-slabit_1344728.html |title=SUA critică dur modificarea Codului Penal: Statul de drept va fi slăbit |newspaper=Realitatea.net |date=20 December 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|EU}} Similar reactions also came from the [[European Commission]]. The European Commission warns that public officials, regardless of the institution they work for, must obey rules against conflict of interest and corruption. "This change was not raised at any time. From our point of view, it's a decision that we didn't expect", said Mark Stephen Gray, spokesman for the European Commission.
* {{flagicon|UK}} British Ambassador to Bucharest, Martin Harris, says he is "worried" for changes to the Penal Code. "It is very discouraging that these changes were adopted without any consultation, any debate and any opportunity for the representatives of the judiciary authority and members of civil society to comment about the proposed amendments", shows the reaction of the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Stiri/Ambasada+SUA+despre+modificarea+Codului+Penal+O+indepartare+de+l |title=Modificarea Codului Penal.

* {{flagicon|Germany}} The German Embassy took a stand against the amendments to the Penal Code, announcing that seeks "with attention and concern the current legislative measures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/politica/ambasada-germaniei-ingrijorata-de-modificarea-codului-penal-320259.html |title=Ambasada Germaniei, "îngrijorată" de modificarea Codului Penal |newspaper=România Liberă |date=11 December 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|Netherlands}} The Netherlands Embassy in Bucharest stated that seeks with concern the amendments to the Penal Code and expects the future developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/olanda-urmareste-cu-ingrijorare-amendamentele-la-codul-penal-care-dau-imunitate-parlamentarilor-11755156 |title=Olanda "urmărește cu îngrijorare" amendamentele la Codul Penal care dau imunitate parlamentarilor |newspaper=Gândul |author =Cătălina Mihai |date=11 December 2013 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a press release, [[Transparency International]] demands the immediate repeal of legal changes granting immunity to Romanian politicians. According to the organization, "these developments risk opening the door for corrupt politicians to act with impunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/transparency_international_demands_repeal_of_legal_changes_granting_immunit |title=Transparency International demands repeal of legal changes granting immunity to Romanian politicians |work=Transparency International |date=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-February 2014, the [[government of Romania|Romanian government]] entered into [[deadlock]] after PNL, constituent party of the government, announced the reshuffling of four ministers. [[Victor Ponta]] repeatedly refused [[Klaus Iohannis]]' proposal as Deputy Premier and Minister of Interior, fact that inflamed the spirits inside PNL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cotidianul.ro/ponta-refuza-in-continuare-sa-mearga-in-parlament-pentru-numirea-lui-klaus-iohannis-232572/ |title=Ponta refuză în continuare să meargă în Parlament pentru numirea lui Klaus Iohannis |newspaper=Cotidianul |author =Ioana Radu |date=21 February 2014 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, on 25 February, PNL decided in an overwhelming majority to leave the ruling coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.romania-insider.com/its-official-romanias-ruling-coalition-collapses-as-pnl-leaves-government-asks-pm-to-resign/116075/ |title=It's official: Romania's ruling coalition collapses as PNL leaves Government, asks PM to resign |newspaper=Romania-Insider.com |date=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, all PNL ministers resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/politic/live-ora-17-30-pe-stirileprotv-ro-premierul-victor-ponta-sustine-o-declaratie-de-presa-la-palatul-victoria.html |title=USL, divorț urât.

A major political conflict also erupted in August, when the Parliament adopted an emergency ordinance allowing local authorities to [[party switching|switch between political parties]] without sanctions. The event, marked in Romanian press as "Black Thursday"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.puterea.ro/politica/joia-neagra-guvernul-ponta-ataca-din-nou-democratia-99068.html |title=Joia Neagră.

In a TV show, President Traian Băsescu reacted to declarations of PSD senator, [[Gabriela Firea]], stating: „She better stays in her seat and would handle what happens on the estate of her husband. Because she could no longer find him at home, if she is not careful.

After the scandal of [[Mehedinți County]] Council chairman, Adrian Duicu, where prosecutors say Duicu made [[lobbying|influence peddling]] from Victor Ponta's office at [[Victoria Palace]], in the presence of Interior Minister [[Radu Stroe]], the Premier decided to move his office to the Ministry of National Defence, with "military security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/dupa-scandalul-duicu-ponta-isi-muta-biroul-de-la-palatul-victoria-la-ministerul-apararii-nationale-cu-paza-militara-ca-sa-se-fereasca-de-traficul-de-influenta-12465203 |title=După scandalul Duicu, Ponta își mută biroul de la Palatul Victoria la Ministerul Apărării Naționale, cu "pază militară", ca să se ferească de Traficul de Influență |newspaper=Gândul |date=14 April 2014 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Ponta vehemently denied his involvement in this case, claiming that this scandal is only a frame-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/politic/ponta-duicu-nu-a-fost-la-mine-iar-pentru-a-evita-alte-inscenari-mi-am-mutat-biroul-la-mapn.html |title=Ponta: Duicu nu a fost la mine, iar pentru a evita alte înscenări, mi-am mutat biroul la MApN |newspaper=Știrile Pro TV |date=14 April 2014 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/victor-ponta-invitat-romania-tv-incepand-ora-2100-1_534c05c00d133766a8c7e0f0/index.html |title=Ponta și-a mutat biroul, după scandalul cu baronul Duicu: Va fi mai bine păzit la MApN.

==== Presidential election protests ====
An apparent discrepancy between the number of polling stations and the estimated voters in most European countries (in Germany only five stations were open for more than 200,000 expats), voters saw this as an ideologically selective denial of exercising the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/11249449/Romanian-presidential-election-does-Klaus-Iohanniss-victory-prove-social-media-can-win-an-election.html |title=Romanian presidential election: does Klaus Iohannis's victory prove social media can win an election? |work=The Telegraph |author =Ria Ivandic |date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact attracted Romanians' angry at Ponta's policies, who began a "campaign" of protests and civil demonstrations within the country and abroad. Protests first broke out on 8 November when thousands gathered in city squares in support of compatriots living abroad who were turned away as they tried to vote in the first round,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2014/11/08/romania-election-protest/ |title=Thousands protest presidential election across Romania |work=Mashable |author =Brittany Levine |date=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting Romania's foreign minister [[Titus Corlățean]] to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/14/us-romania-election-protests-idUSKCN0IY29920141114 |title=Thousands protest in Romania ahead of presidential run-off vote |work=Reuters |date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long queues and bureaucratic hurdles made the voting process lengthy at Romanian embassies across the [[European Union]] and elsewhere in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/elections/irregularities-cloud-romanian-election-runoff-309726 |title=Irregularities cloud Romanian election runoff |work=EurActiv |author =Andrei Schwartz |date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were unable to cast their ballots before voting ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/11/15/romania-sees-protests-ahead-of-elections/ |title=Romania sees protests ahead of elections |work=Euronews |date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has taken measures to ensure 16 November vote runs smoothly, increasing the number of voting booths and staff abroad. But it has not increased the number of polling stations, as Romanian diaspora groups had demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/elections/romania-rocked-protests-ahead-presidential-election-runoff-309884 |title=Romania rocked by protests ahead of presidential election runoff |work=EurActiv |author =Andrei Schwartz |date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day before the presidential runoff, large demonstrations were held across the country, with 15,000 attendees in [[Cluj-Napoca]] and 5,000 in [[Timișoara]]. The protests targeted PSD candidate and PM [[Victor Ponta]], blamed for poor organization of the voting process in diaspora. The irregularities in the first round repeated in the runoff. Then, tens of thousands of Romanians abroad were attacked with [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]]s and [[tear gas]] by law enforcers, while voters forced the entrance into embassies to cast their vote. In [[Bucharest]], up to 20,000 people gathered to protest against Victor Ponta, destroying the electoral posters with him.

Iohannis celebrated the victory with demonstrators in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]]. The result of the vote was seen in media as a "small revolution", given that Victor Ponta controlled the government since 2012, and PSD is the largest party in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-18/east-europe-elections-surprise-as-voters-reject-authority.html |title=East Europe Elections Surprise as Voters Reject Authority |work=Bloomberg |author =Zoltan Simon |date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Protests against MP immunity ====
In March 2015, a dispute arouse between ruling alliance PSD–UNPR–PC and main opposition party, PNL.

The '''Anambé''' are an [[indigenous people of Brazil]], living in the state of [[Pará]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==History==
The Anambé have been in contact with non-natives since the 1842. In the 1940s, their population was 60. The population decreased due to the introduction of measles. Also many Anambé women married outside the tribe. The tribe has increased in population since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Language==
Anambé people speak the [[Anambé language]], which is a [[Tupi language]], belonging to the [[Tupi–Guarani language]] family, Subgroup VIII. Its [[ISO 639-3]] language code is "aan". Only approximately seven people still speak Anambé today.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

'''Anna Maria van Schurman ''' (November 5, 1607 &amp;ndash; May 4, 1678) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter, engraver, poet, and scholar, who is best known for her exceptional learning and her defence of [[female education]].

==Life==
Van Schurman was born in [[Cologne]], a bright daughter of wealthy parents, Frederik van Schurman, from Antwerp (d. 1623) and Eva von Harff de Dreiborn. At four years old she could already read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0149.htm Anna Maria Schuurmans biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1613 and 1615, her family moved to [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and about ten years later, they moved again, this time to Franeker, in Friesland. From about 11 years old, Schurman's father started teaching her Latin and other subjects along with his sons, an unusual decision at a time when girls in noble families were not generally tutored in the classics.&lt;ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman"&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/71389 Anna Maria van Schurman] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; To learn Latin she was given [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] to read by her father. The private education and self-study was complemented through correspondence and discussions with notables such as [[André Rivet]] and [[Friedrich Spanheim]], both professors of [[Leiden University]], and the family's neighbour [[Gisbertus Voetius]], a professor at the [[University of Utrecht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|authors=Laurie J. Churchill, Phyllis R. Brown &amp; Jane E. Jeffrey|isbn=9781135377564|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also excelled at painting, paper-cutting, embroidery, and wood carving. After her father's death, the family moved back to Utrecht in 1626.&lt;ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman"/&gt; In her 20s Schurman's home became a meeting point for intellectuals. Among her friends were [[Constantijn Huygens]], [[Johan van Beverwijck]], [[Jacob de Witt]], [[Cornelius Boy]], [[Margaret Godewijck]] and [[Utricia Ogle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Republic of Women: Rethinking the Republic of Letters in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 2012|author=Carol Pal|isbn=9781139510752|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1630s she studied engraving with [[Magdalena van de Passe]].&lt;ref name="Anna Maria van Schurman"/&gt;

In 1634, due to her distinction in Latin, she was invited to write a poem for the opening of the [[University of Utrecht]]. In the poem she celebrated the city of Utrecht and the new University. She noted the potential for the university to help the city cope with the economic impacts of the floods and the shifting course of the river [[Rhine]]. But she also challenged the exclusion of women from the university. In response to her complaint the university authorities allowed her to attend professor Voetius' lectures.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|authors=Laurie J. Churchill, Phyllis R. Brown &amp; Jane E. Jeffrey|isbn=9781135377564|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 1636 she became the first female student at the university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Classical Scholars: Unsealing the Fountain from the Renaissance to Jacqueline de Romilly|last=Frade|first=Sofia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780198725206|editor-last=Wyles|editor-first=Rosie|location=Oxford|pages=|chapter=Ménage's Learned Ladies: Anne Dacier (1647-1720) and Anna Maria van Schurman (1607-1678)|editor-last2=Hall|editor-first2=Edith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women at that time were not permitted to study at a university in Protestant Netherlands and for the lectures she attended she sat behind a screen or in a curtained booth so that the male students could not see her.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beek 2010: 60 and n. 97, who points out that we know this from reports by Van Schurman's fellow students Descartes and Hoornbeeck.&lt;/ref&gt; At the university she also studied Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldee, Syriac and Ethiopian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This made her the first woman to study at a Dutch university. Her interest in philosophy and theology, and her artistic talent contributed to her fame and reputation as the "Star of Utrecht". By the 1640s she was fluent in 14 languages and wrote in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, French, Arabic, Persian, Ethiopian, German and Dutch.&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

According to her contemporary [[Pierre Yvon]], Schurman had an excellent command of mathematics, geography and astronomy. The pious young scholar appeared to have had a number of suitors. After his wife had died in 1631 [[Constantijn Huygens]] asked for Schurman's hand in marriage and wrote 10 poems in three languages to her in 1634. Huygens was teased by other Dutch intellectuals. Schurman's commitment to celibacy and her studies seemed to be unwavering. When she chose the phrase ''Amor Meus Crucifixus Est'' (''My Love Has Been Crucified'') as her motto, her intellectual friends were finally convinced that her choice not to marry was rooted in her piety, rather than her scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Republic of Women: Rethinking the Republic of Letters in the Seventeenth Century |publisher=Cambridge University Press|date= 2012|author=Carol Pal|isbn=9781139510752|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schurman also produced delicate engravings by using a diamond on glass, sculpture, wax modelling, and the carving of ivory and wood. She also painted, especially portraits, becoming the first known Dutch painter to use pastel in a portrait. She gained honorary admission to the [[Guild of Saint Luke|St. Luke Guild of painters]] in 1643, signalling public recognition of her art.

Schurman corresponded with the Danish noblewoman [[Birgitte Thott]], who translated classical authors and religious writings. Thott's translation of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s philosophical works included a preface in which she agitated for women's right to study. Thott stated that she translated classical works because few women were able to read Latin. Schurman publicly praised Thott and called her the "tenth Muse of the North".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|authors=Laurie J. Churchill, Phyllis R. Brown &amp; Jane E. Jeffrey|isbn=9781135377564|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schurman through correspondence established a network of learned women across Europe. She corresponded in Latin and Hebrew with [[Dorothea Moore]], in Greek with [[Bathsua Makin]], in French, Latin and Hebrew with [[Marie de Gournay]] and [[Marie du Moulin]], in Latin and French with [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth of Bohemia]], and in Latin with [[Queen Christina of Sweden]]. A frequent topic in this correspondence was the education of women. Schurman in the correspondence expressed her admiration for educated women like [[Lady Jane Gray]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women Writing Latin: Early Modern Women Writing Latin |publisher=Routledge|date= 2014|authors=Laurie J. Churchill, Phyllis R. Brown &amp; Jane E. Jeffrey|isbn=9781135377564|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unauthorised version of Schurman's writings on women's education was published in 1638 in Paris under the title ''Dissertatio De Ingenii Muliebris ad Doctrinam, &amp; meliores Litteras aptitudine''. As the unauthorised collection of her writings circulated, Schurman decided to publish an authoritative Latin treatise in 1641. In 1657 the treatise was published in English under the title ''The Learned Maid or, Whether a Maid may be a Scholar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reading Early Modern Women: An Anthology of Texts in Manuscript and Print, 1550-1700|publisher=Psychology Press|date= 2004|author=Melissa Smith|isbn= 9780415966467|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Labadists ==
[[File:AnnaMaria vanSchurman.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Self portrait, 1632]]
In her 60s Schurman emerged as one of the principal leaders of the [[Labadists]].&lt;ref name="Routledge 2014 65"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1660s Schurman had become increasingly disillusioned with the [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made the reformation of the church her goal. Aside from corresponding with ministers she travelled throughout the country and organised meetings with them. She lamented the lack of spiritual devotion, and "exhibits of the ecclesiastics" that occupied the church's pulpits.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2014 63"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1661 Schurman's brother studied theology with the Hebrew scholar [[Johannes Buxtorf]] in Basel, and got to know about the defrocked French priest [[Jean de Labadie]]. He travelled to [[Geneva]] to meet him.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2014 63"/&gt; In 1662 he corresponded with Schurman at length about Labadie's teachings. When Labadie and a small number of followers stopped over in Utrecht on the way to [[Middelburg]], they lodged in Schurman's house. Labadie became the pastor of [[Middelburg]], preaching [[millenarianism]], arguing for moral regeneration, and that believers should live apart from unbelievers. Schurman supported him, even when he was removed as a pastor. When in late 1669 Labadie settled in [[Amsterdam]] to establish a separatist church Schurman sold her house and part of her library. She joined Labadie's sectarian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1669 she had broke with the Reformed Church when she published a 10-page pamphlet ''On the Reformation necessary at present in the Church of Christ''. She denounced the church men for trampling on "celestial wisdom", arguing that the people of God should be separated from the "mondains" through "hatred of the world" and "divine love".&lt;ref name="Routledge 2014 65"/&gt;

A public smear campaign followed, Schurman was attacked by her intellectual friends, including Huygens and Voetius. Her writing style became forthright and confident. When the Labadists had to leave Amsterdam Schurman secured an invitation from her friend [[Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], who in 1667 had become abbess at the [[Lutheran]] ''Damenstift'' of [[Herford Abbey]]. The 50 Labadists lived there between 1670 and 1672. At Herdford Schurman continued her art work and the Labadists maintained a printing press. Schurman was referred to by the Labadists as ''Mama'', Labadie as ''Papa''. Rumours had it that Labadie and Schurman had married, however he married Lucia van Sommelsdijck. In 1772 the Labadists moved to [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in [[Denmark]], Elisabeth of Bohemia had advocated on their behalf in correspondence with the King of Denmark. In 1673 Schurman published ''Eukleria, or Choosing the Better Part'', a reference to Luke 10:42 when Mary chooses the better part by sitting at the feet of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it she derided [[Gisbertus Voetius]]'s opposition to her admiration for [[Saint Paula]], a disciple of [[St Jerome]], who had helped to translate the [[Bible]] into [[Latin]]. Voetius argued that women should have a limited public role, anything else was feminine impropriety.&lt;ref name="Routledge 2014 63"/&gt; ''Eukleria'' was well received by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and prominent prietists, including [[Johann Jacob Schütz]], [[Philipp Jakob Spener]] and [[Eleonore van Merlau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R. Larsen|date= 2014|author=Routledge|isbn=9781317180708|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Labadie died in 1674 Schurman investigated the possibility of moving to [[England]], corresponding with the Latin scholar [[Lucy Hutchinson]] and the theologian [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]] on the matter. But the Labadists moved to the village Wieuwerd in [[Friesland]] and attracted numerous new members, including [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]. About 400 Labadists practiced absolute detachment from worldly values. They attempted to return to early church practices, sharing all property. In the final years of her life Schurman was housebound due to severe [[rheumatism]]. She continued to write, keeping up correspondence and working on the second part of ''Eukleria''. She died aged 70 in 1678.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anna Maria Van Schurman, 'The Star of Utrecht': The Educational Vision and Reception of a Savante |publisher=Anne R.

== Published writings ==
[[File:1659 van Schurman Learned Maid.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The title page and frontispiece of van Schurman's ''The learned maid'', printed in 1659.]]
Many of Schurman's writings were published during her lifetime in multiple editions, however some of her writings have nevertheless been lost. Her most famous book was the ''Nobiliss. Virginis Annae Mariae a Schurman Opuscula Hebraea Graeca Latina et Gallica, Prosaica et Metrica'' (''Minor works in Hebrew, Greek, Latin and French in prose and poetry by the most noble Anne Maria van Schurman''). It was published 1648 by [[Friedrich Spanheim]], professor of theology at [[Leiden University]] through the Leiden-based publisher [[House of Elzevir|Elzeviers]].&lt;ref name="Routledge"/&gt;

Schurman's ''The Learned Maid or, Whether a Maid may be a Scholar'' had grown out of her correspondence on women's education with theologians and scholars across Europe. In it she advances [[Jane Grey]] as an example of the value of female education. Schurman argued that educating women in languages and the Bible will increase their love of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Reading Early Modern Women: An Anthology of Texts in Manuscript and Print, 1550-1700|publisher=Psychology Press|date= 2004|author=Melissa Smith|isbn= 9780415966467|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; While an increasing number of royal and wealthy families chose to educate their daughters, girls and women did not have formal access to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Equality and Non-Discrimination under International Law|publisher=Routledge|date= 2017|author=Stephanie Farrior|isbn= 9781351568036|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schurman argued that "A Maid may be a Scholar... The assertion may be proved both from the property of the form of this subject; or the rational soul: and from the very acts and effects themselves. For it is manifest that Maids do actually learn any arts and science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Concept of Woman|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|date= 2017|author=Sister Prudence Allen R.S.M.|isbn= 9780802868435|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing that women had rational souls she foreshadowed the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] argument for human reason, and it underpinned her assertion that women had a right to be educated. Schurman and [[René Descartes]] corresponded and while they disagreed on the interpretation of the Bible they both thought that reason was central in the human identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Concept of Woman|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|date= 2017|author=Sister Prudence Allen R.S.M.|isbn= 9780802868435|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Learned Maid'' included correspondence with the theologian [[André Rivet]]. In her correspondence with Rivet Schurman explained that women such as [[Marie de Gournay]] had already proven that man and woman are equal, so she will not "bore her readers with repetition". Like Rivet, Schurman argued in ''The Learned Maid'' for education on the basis of moral grounds, because "ignorance and idleness cause vice". But Schurman also took the position that "whoever by nature has a desire for arts and science is suited to arts and science: women have this desire, therefore women are suited to arts and science". However, Schurman did not advocate for [[universal education]], or the education for women of the lower classes. She took the view that ladies of upper classes should have access to higher education. Schurman made the point that women could make a valuable contribution to society, and argued that it was also necessary for their happiness to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and the [[sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women's History as Scientists: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= 2003|author=Leigh Ann Whaley|isbn= 9781576072301|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to ''The Learned Maid'' Rivet cautioned her in a letter that "although you have shown us this with grace, your persuasions are futile... You may have many admirers, but none of them agree with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Women's History as Scientists: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= 2003|author=Leigh Ann Whaley|isbn= 9781576072301|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arabela''' is a nearly extinct [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] American [[language]] of the [[Zaparoan]] family spoken in two [[Peru]]vian villages in tropical forest along the Napo tributary of the [[Arabela river]].

Also known as '''Chiripuno''' and '''Chiripunu''', it is spoken by fewer than 50 people out of an ethnic population of about 500.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

Since there are so few speakers of Arabela left, its speakers speak either [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Quechua language|Quechua]] as a [[second language]]. The [[literacy rate]] for Arabela as a [[first language]] is about 10–30%, and about 50–75% for a [[second language]]. It uses a [[subject–object–verb|SOV word order]].&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

Like all native languages in [[Peru]], it has an [[official language|official]] status in areas where it is spoken.&lt;ref name="pdba.georgetown.edu"&gt;{{cite web

==The language and its speakers==
Arabela is a language of the [[Zaparoan languages|Zaparoan]] family of languages. Zaparoan tongues were once widely spoken in the [[rain forest]] of north-eastern [[Peru]], but Zaparoan-speaking people have been decimated by diseases, wars with neighboring native groups, and by quasi-enslavement during the [[rubber boom]]. Most Zaparoan communities have [[language shift|shifted]] to [[Lamas Quechua]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], while others have been incorporated into [[Shuar people|Shuar]] groups. The few surviving Zaparoan languages are all severely endangered. Among those, Arabela is most closely related to [[Zaparo language|Zaparo]] (the only one still spoken), [[Andoa language|Andoa]] and [[Conambo language|Conambo]].

==Current situation==
The dominant languages of the area are [[Kichwa]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and they are both widely spoken by [[Arabela people|Arabelas]]. Kichwa has been the default language for native communities in the area since the rubber boom era, and has spread through trade mixed marriages. It is, however, losing ground to Spanish in the younger generations. The use of Arabela is restricted to a small elderly fraction of the population. The language is official per the [[Constitution of Peru]], but this did not stop its decline. There is no written literature in Arabela, but the language has been used in education by the Peruvian government, which has issued some school material in it. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] has been translated into Arabela in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{UDHR|arl|Arabela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialectal divisions==
There is no dialectal division among known Arabela speakers. A small group, called ''Pananuyuri'', separated from other Arabelas roughly a century ago. Their fate is unknown but they may have survived, in which case their dialect is likely to have somewhat diverged from the other speakers'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Phonology==
The Arabela phonemic inventory is quite typical for a Zaparoan language. It has five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] and a vowel inventory of five [[vowel]]s common within the family.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Morphology==

===The noun===
Arabela has no [[grammatical gender]] but for a few words, mostly describing persons, the sex can be specified by adding a suffix :

*'''Cua niya-nu''' : my son
*'''Cua niya-tu''' : my daughter

Arabela has two [[grammatical number]]s, singular and plural. The plural is generally added by adding a suffix to the singular, the nature of this suffix varying according to the pluralized word.

*'''tia''' : house yields '''tiaca''' : houses
*'''maaji''' : woman, yields '''maajipohua''' : women
*'''niyacoo''' : unmarried girl yields '''niyacoojori''' : unmarried girls.

In a few cases, however, the plural can be formed through suffix substitution, or by using a different root altogether.

*'''caya''' : man yields '''canuu'''
*'''maanu''' : group yields '''maapue'''
*'''nucua''' : mother yields '''nuhuocuaca'''

A number of other words form their plural by removing a singular specific suffix

*'''saijia''' stone yields '''sai''' stone

===Pronouns===
Arabela has a complex pronominal system, similar to the one of the other [[zaparoan languages]] and distinguishes between active and passive personal pronouns. Active pronouns act as subjects in independent clause and as objects in dependent ones.

====Personal pronouns====
{| class="wikitable"
|+ '''[[Personal pronoun]]s'''
|-
!
!First singular
!Second singular
!Third singular
!First plural inclusive
!First plural exclusive
!Second plural

| na &lt;br&gt; quinio
| pa
| canaa
| nia
| nojori&lt;br&gt;na&lt;br&gt;-no
|}

====Anaphoric pronouns====
The verbal ending '''-no''' is used as an [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]]. It can also mark the subject of a subordinate sentence when it refers to the object of the main sentence.

====Demonstrative pronouns====
Arabela has three kinds of [[demonstrative pronoun]]s :

* '''noo''' indicates an object close to the speaker
* '''nio''' indicates an object further away from the speaker (''Nio-te quia panishano'' - is it what you want)
* '''cuno''' indicates a contrast between objects or persons (''cuno-cuaja cua sare'' - this is my dog)

====Interrogative pronouns====
Arabela has a rather restricted of interrogative pronouns, composed of:

* '''cana''' : who
* '''canapue''' : who (plural)
* '''casaa''' : what
* '''taa''' : how, how much
* '''taamueca''' : how
* '''tee''' : where
* '''teje''' : where from
* '''teyano''' : who, which

The '''Barnesville Pumpkin Festival''' is an annual festival in [[Barnesville, Ohio]], dedicated to the growing and harvesting of [[pumpkin]]s and other fall harvests. The festival, which has been held since 1964, is conducted by a locally appointed committee and attracts an average of 100,000 people during the 4 day event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barnesvilleohio.com/ Barnesville, Ohio Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtov9.com/best9/11958301/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917101102/http://www.wtov9.com/best9/11958301/detail.html |archivedate=2009-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates==
The Pumpkin Festival is held the last full week in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofea.org/view.php?fest_id%3D47 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307143751/http://www.ofea.org/view.php?fest_id=47 |archivedate=2009-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official ribbon cutting is held on Thursday, but the local citizens are encouraged to preview the festival on Wednesday.

==Locations==
The Pumpkin Festival begins preparations the Monday before the festival and restricted areas are placed from the center of town at the junction of Chestnut Street and Main Street, west along Main Street to the junction of Main Street and Gardner Street; and from where W. Church Street and N. Broadway Street meet, south to the junction of South Broadway and South Street. This however only comprises the downtown section, several other events and locations dot the town. There is abundant parking, but most is private and requires a parking and safety fee.

==History==
The Barnesville Pumpkin Festival began in 1964 as the Ohio Fall Festival and was held in the basement of the Church of the Assumption. The name changed to the Ohio Pumpkin Festival and the event was held out of doors in the center of town in the 1970s and changed to the Barnesville Pumpkin Festival later that same decade.

== Traditions==
The Barnesville Pumpkin Festival holds its annual weigh-in on the Wednesday preceding the event. The event has seen pumpkins with weights breaking and matching state and local records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesleaderonline.com/page/content.detail/id/512770.html?nav=5010&lt;/ref&gt; The King Pumpkin contenders are too heavy to be weighed on a conventional scale, weighing in at over 650kg (1400 lbs), and thus a local funeral home scale is used. The official ribbon cutting is held the following day and is done by either the committee president, city mayor, parade marshal or other notable local figure. The Annual Pumpkin Auction is held on the last day, Sunday, where the local business compete bids to display the winning pumpkin and sell off the seeds as they see fit.

The [[Olney Friends School]] is famous for bringing over 700 loaves of pumpkin bread to sell from their booth, baked by the students.

There are many games, rides, and other activities set up during the festival. Some of the usual rides are the G-Force, The Pumpkin Ride, The Umbrellas, and the Monkey Cages.

'''''Black Magic''''' is a 1949 [[film adaptation]] of [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s novel ''Joseph Balsamo''. It was directed by the Russian-born [[Gregory Ratoff]].  Set in the 18th century, the film stars [[Orson Welles]] in the lead role as [[Joseph Balsamo]], a [[hypnotist]], [[Illusionist|magician]], and [[charlatan]] who also goes by the alias Count Cagliostro, and [[Nancy Guild]] as Lorenza/[[Marie Antoinette]]. [[Akim Tamiroff]] has a featured role.

== Plot ==
Alexandre Dumas, Sr. ([[Berry Kroeger]]) tells his son [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexandre Dumas, Jr.]] ([[Raymond Burr]]) the story of Joseph Balsamo ([[Orson Welles]]) aka Cagliostro. Through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] we learn that Balsamo was a French [[Fictional representations of Romani people|gypsy]] boy who endured much hardship. He was tortured under the command of Viscount de Montagne ([[Stephen Bekassy]]) and his parents were ordered to hang. He was rescued by some gypsies led by Gitano and swears revenge on de Montagne.

Some years later, he learns the secrets of [[hypnosis]] from [[Franz Mesmer|Dr. Mesmer]] ([[Charles Goldner]]). Ignoring the doctor's advice that he use his powers for healing, he exploits his new talent to the full, gaining [[wealth]], [[celebrity|fame]] and prestige. After changing his name to Count Cagliostro, he becomes famous throughout Europe.

Things begin to go downhill when he enters a plot to substitute a young girl called Lorenza ([[Nancy Guild]]) for Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] along with gypsies Gitano ([[Akim Tamiroff]]) and Zoraida ([[Valentina Cortese]]). The plot is organised by de Montagne in association with Madame du Barry. They plan for Lorenza to impersonate the Queen and buy a frivolous necklace.

Zoraida becomes jealous of Lorenza, who has fallen under Cagliostro's power, forgetting her true love, Gilbert. Gilbert runs away with Lorenza. Cagliostro recaptures her and marries her, hypnotised.

King Louis XV dies and Marie Antoinette becomes queen. She orders Cagliosto to leave the country. Cagliostro gets Lorenza to impersonate the Queen and pretend to be in love with de Montagne. He buys the necklace and the queen's reputation is damaged.

Zoraida brings Lorenza to Marie Antoinette and reveals Cagliostro's plot. Lorenza agrees to testify against Cagliostro, but at the trial, Cagliostro hypnotizes her into stating that she knows nothing. Cagliostro hypnotizes Gilbert into testifying against the queen.

However, Memser then uses the necklace to hypnotize Cagliostro into confessing. Cagliostro awakens from his trance and escapes with the hypnotized Lorenza. Gilbert pursues them and kills Cagliostro in a sword fight.

==Production==
The movie was originally known as ''Cagliostro''. Producer [[Edward Small]] went through a number of directors and stars in trying to get this film off the ground, starting in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;DRAMA AND FILM: Ann Blyth Adolescent Song Joust Contender College Professor Battling Illiterates; 'Cagliostro' Once Again Coming to Life

Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 14 June 1943: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Boyer]] was to star with Akim Tamiroff, and [[Irving Pichel]] directing, then in early 1944 [[J. Carrol Naish]] was reported to play Alexandre Dumas, Sr.  Later that year, [[George Sanders]] was announced as the star with [[Douglas Sirk]] directing.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Russell Touted as Mexico's Sinatra: Bing Crosby Will Fill Guest-Star Spot in Filmization of 'Duffy's Tavern'

In 1947, Small was to make the film in Mexico, but dropped those plans when it turned out to be more expensive to shoot there than he expected &amp;ndash; so the location of shooting was changed to Italy, where Small could use blocked lira.&lt;ref&gt;BURLESQUE' AGAIN TO BE MADE A FILM: Fox Purchases Screen Rights to 1928 Play -- Jessel Named to Produce New Version

Charles Bennett, who wrote the script, said [[Jose Ferrer]] was supposed to play the lead but he demanded a three picture contract from Small who refused. Bennett later said Ratoff and Welles rewrote the film, but he admired Welles' performance.

[[Orson Welles]] said Small ("no mean master of suggestion, by the way") approached him "very cleverly with the role of Cagliostro. He waited til I had reread the Dumas novels and become so 'hypnotised' by the scoundrel that I felt I had to play him. Then Small announced casually, '[[Gregory Ratoff]] is going to direct'. That cinched it. Gregory is a great friend, and more fun to work with than anybody I know."&lt;ref&gt;OUT OF A TRANCE By ORSON WELLES. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 17 Apr 1949: X4.&lt;/ref&gt;

United Artists were so enthusiastic about the film they agreed to distribute the film for 25% of the profits as opposed to their usual fee of 27 1/2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/variety173-1949-03|title=Variety (March 1949)|first=|last=Variety|date=7 April 2018|publisher=New York, NY: Variety Publishing Company|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Welles allegedly directed several scenes in the film, which was released on 18 August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|68897|Black Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reviews were mixed.&lt;ref&gt;All Over Town

The '''Bonda language''', also known as '''Bondo''' or '''Remo''', is an indigenous language spoken in [[Odisha]], formerly known as Southern Odisha, in [[India]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It had 2,568 speakers, all in Odisha, according to the 1951 Census of India,&lt;ref name="LSI"&gt;N. Gopalakrishnan, ''[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-Documents/LSI/lsi_Orissa/18_orissa_vol_page_no_257_272.pdf Linguistic Survey of India]'', p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; increasing to approximately 9,000 speakers in 2002 according to [[SIL International|SIL]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/18/language/bfw/|title=Bondo|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Bonda language is an indigenous language belonging to the Southern subgroup of the [[Munda languages|Munda]] branch of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language family]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;  Bonda is a [[spoken language]] with no traditional written system recorded. Bonda is a part of the Gutob-Remo branch, due to the similarities Bonda shares with another Southern Munda Language named [[Gutob language|Gutob]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Munda Languages|last=Anderson|first=Gregory|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9780415328906|location=New York|pages=557–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Bonda language derives its name from the tribe of the [[Bonda people]], an indigenos group located in Odisha known as the Bonda Highlanders. In their native language, the Bonda people regard themselves as "Remo', which translates to human, and derive their language name from that root, calling their language as the human language or 'Remosam' in their native tongue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tribal and Indigenous People of India: Problems and Prospects|last=Dash|first=Jagannatha|last2=Pati|first2=Rabindra|publisher=APH Publishing Corperation|year=2002|isbn=8176483222|location=New Delhi|pages=136–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
The language differs slightly, classified according to whether it can be categorized as Plains Remo (Bonda) or Hill Remo (Bonda).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Plains Remo===
This is a subdivision of Bonda, localized in 35 villages throughout the Khairpat within the [[Malkangiri district]] in Odisha. In 1941, 2,565 people categorized the Plains Remo. That number nearly doubled in 1971, with 4,764 people classifying themselves as Plains Remo. The increase in population was not correlated with language extension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are 3,500 speakers as of 2002, but few are monolingual.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Hills Remo===
This is a subdivision of Bonda, localized in the Jeypore Hills region of Odisha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are 5,570 speakers as of 2002.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Phonology==
===Stress===  
In Bonda, [[primary stress]] is placed on the last syllable in a word, syllables with [[diphthong]]s, [[glottal stop]]s, or checked consonants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swain|first=Rajashree|date=1998|title=A Grammar of Bonda Language|jstor=42930587|journal=Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute|volume=58/59|pages=391–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plains Remo primarily stresses the second syllable in a word.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bonda words can have a maximum of 5 syllables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Diphthongs===
Diphthongs are placed either in the beginning or middle of a word, usually used in combination of two different vowel types.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''Caravan to Vaccarès''''' is a 1974 British-French [[action film]] directed by [[Geoffrey Reeve]] and starring [[David Birney]], [[Charlotte Rampling]] and [[Michael Lonsdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/28730|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=10 November 2012|location=London|title=Caravan to Vaccarès}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was loosely based on the novel ''[[Caravan to Vaccarès]]'' by [[Alistair MacLean]].

==Plot==
In the south of France, a mysterious assassin shoots one man, then another.

A wandering young American adventurer, Bowman (David Birney), meets a pretty young British photographer, Lila (Charlotte Rampling) when she hitches a ride. They run into the assassin while helping a couple who have broken down by the side of the road.

When they arrive in town they meet a French duke (Michel Lonsdale) who invites them to dinner. David reveals that the duke had met him in Paris and offered him a job for $3,000 and a return ticket to New York but he doesn't know what for. He is driving a car lent by the duke. That night a man breaks into a place where they are staying but Bowman fights him off.

The duke appears and hires Bowman to smuggle a Hungarian scientist (Michael Bryan) out of France to the United States. Bowman is reluctant but the duke says if he won't do it he will report the car as being stolen.

The scientist escaped the [[Iron Curtain]] by hiding with a caravan of gypsies, but is being pursued by an unscrupulous gang bent on capturing him for sale to the highest bidder.

A woman who helps Bowman is murdered at a bull fight. She turns out to be the Duc's daughter.

Lila and the scientist are kidnapped, but Borman rescues them. Lila and Bowman sleep together.

Bowman is driving the scientist to safety in a car when a helicopter chases after them. The helicopter drives the car off the road. It seems the scientist has fallen into quicksand; a rope is dropped from the helicopter to retrieve him. However it turns out the man is Bowman in disguise. He overpowers one of the men in the helicopter then is dropped into a bull ring. Bowman defeats a bull fighter and is about to be killed by a charging bull but is rescued when the Duc shoots it dead.

The Duc farewells Bowman and Lila at the airport with the scientist.

'''Daewoo dissolution and corruption scandal''' refer to the 1999-2006 scandal in [[South Korea]] involving the bankruptcy of [[Daewoo]], then-country's second largest company, and a subsequent corruption investigation, involving arrests, escapes and eventual conviction of dozens of company's top executives. The resulting scandal has been described as one of the biggest scandals in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Dowling2008"/&gt;

==Background==
[[Daewoo]] was a major South Korean conglomerate. Prior to the [[Asian financial crisis]], Daewoo was the second largest conglomerate in Korea. By 1999, Daewoo went bankrupt, with debts of about US$50&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/233562 |title=South Korea: The death of Daewoo |work=The Economist |date= 19 August 1999|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;-80 billion.&lt;ref name="Dowling2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=John Malcolm |last=Dowling|title=Future Perspectives on the Economic Development of Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfBoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA305|year=2008|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-270-609-6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption scandal==
Soon after the demise, South Korean prosecutors filed chargers against over 40 top executives, in what BBC described as the Daewoo corruption scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1149061.stm|title=Daewoo corruption scandal deepens|last=|first=|date=2 February 2001|publisher=BBC News|access-date=28 August 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was related to the discovery that company's auditors concealed the amount of debt, and that bribes of about 470 million won were involved (close to US$400 million). Loss from bribery and corruption has been estimated to over US$1 billion.&lt;ref name="Dowling2008"/&gt;

Daewoo Chairman [[Kim Woo-jung|Kim Woo-Jung]] fled to Vietnam, and former Daewoo factory workers put up [[Wanted posters|"Wanted" posters]] with his picture. Kim returned to Korea in June 2005 and was promptly arrested.

'''Development communication policy sciences''' is the study of policy issues related to [[development communication]]s. These two branches of social sciences are regarded as distinct and mutually exclusive areas of study but are said to be inextricably linked.&lt;ref name= flor&gt;Flor, A. (1991). "Development Communication and the Policy Sciences." Asian Institute of Development Communication (Kuala Lumpur). Journal of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nora C. Quebral (2012), the University of the Philippines Los Baños defines Development Communication as the interaction of two social process—development and communication—in any given environment. Quebral, being the "mother of development communication", initially articulated that, in 1971, Development Communication was tentatively defined as "the art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and larger fulfillment of the human potential" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, N. C., (2012). Development communication primer. Penang, Malaysia: Southbound.&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales (no date) defines development as a "quest for an improved quality of life for all"&lt;ref&gt;Velasco, 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and communication is used to facilitate changes in people and society so that their full potential will be realised. Grounded on the mentioned basic meanings of development and communication, development communication is defined as "the use of communication in development work".&lt;ref&gt;Velasco, 1999, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Guru (1997) adds that development communication provides a conceptual and practical framework which is meant to accelerate the process of development in all spheres of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Guru, Mahesh Chandra B.P. (1997) Ambedkar as a Journalist, Communicator, XXXII (2):33-38&lt;/ref&gt; It is also meant to break the wall of ignorance, thus, breaking the bonds of poverty and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development Communication: Theory and Practice|last=Narula|first=Uma|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=1994|isbn=|location=New Delhi, India|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Alexander Flor suggested to refine the definition of development communication including the perspective of [[cybernetics]] and [[Systems theory|general systems theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander (1993). "Upstream and Downstream Interventions in Environmental Communication". Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Alexander Flor claimed development communication as the Fifth Theory of the Press. According to the author, it is the suitable system given "the social and political structures" of the Third World and its present universal environment.&lt;ref name=flor1991&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flor|first1=Alexander G.|title=Development Communication and the Policy Sciences|journal=Journal of Development Communication|date=1991|url=https://www.academia.edu/578845/Development_Communication_and_the_Policy_Sciences|location=Asian Institute of Development: Kuala Lumpur}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In UNESCO's approaches to development communication, Jan Servaes cited "while communication on its own will not bring about change and development, neither will change happen without development communication. We need to integrate all our efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/approaches_to_development_communication.pdf |title=Approaches to development communication |newspaper=Unesco.org |date=2002 |editor=Jan Servaes |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flor &amp; Ongkiko (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Asian Institute of Development: Kuala Lumpur&lt;/ref&gt; describe development communication in the book titled 'Introduction to Development Communication' as purposive as it primarily uses communication not merely to give information but practically to influence the people- the receivers of information. Nair (1993) adds that development communication brings change, education and inspiration toward development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Development Communication Process: A Reconceptualization|last=Nair|first=K.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1993|isbn=|location=New Delhi, India|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Quebral redefined development communication as the "art and science of human communication linked to a society's planned transformation from a state of poverty to one of dynamic socio-economic growth that makes for greater equity and the larger unfolding of individual potential".&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, N.C. (1971). "What Do We Mean by 'Development Communication'?" International Development Review. 15(2): 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank views development communication as the "integration of strategic communication in development projects" based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities.&lt;ref&gt;Manyozo, Linje (March 2006).

People, Land, and Water: Participatory Development Communication for Natural Resource Management. London: Earthscan and the International Development Research Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the Rome Consensus gave this definition: "Communication for Development is a social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about seeking change at different levels including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating and learning for sustained and meaningful change. It is not public relations or corporate communication."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDEVCOMMENG/Resources/RomeConsensus07.pdf|title=The Rome Consensus Communication for Development A Major Pillar for Development and Change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Florangel Rosario-Braid, a communication expert in the Philippines, development communication is defined as a "purposive approach to communication" that intends to bring about social and economic change in the lives of the greatest number of the population. Braid says Development Communication involves three key elements: (1) Communication involves people's participation, (2) Stakeholders are in active dialogue and consultation, (3) End goal should be to uphold the rights and needs of the people and to achieve "self-reliance and autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;Rosario-Braid, Florangel (1993) .Social Responsibility in Communication Media.

Braid states that communication involves three key elements, had the government (then under the presidency of Benigno Aquino III and Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala) and the farmer groups by observing or following these communication elements through policy sciences, tensions would not escalate.

Development communication as a field is defined by: (1) World Bank as "an interdisciplinary field based on empirical research that helps to build consensus while it facilitates the sharing of knowledge to achieve positive change in development initiatives. It is not only about effective dissemination of information but also about using empirical research and two-way communication among stakeholders" and key management tool in assessing socio-political risks and opportunities; and (2) First World Congress of Communication for Development in Rome on October 2006 as "a social process based on dialog using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about seeking change at different levels, including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating, and learning for sustained and meaningful change.

In addition,  Paolo Mefalopulos of the World Bank, believes  that  a four-phase methodological framework can help formulate appropriate communication strategies in development communication  through (1) research, often referred to as communication-based assessment, or CBA; (2) inputs for the strategy design; (3) production of the materials and implementation of the planned activities; and (4) evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Mefalopulos, P.

The interface of development communication and policy sciences is the common ground for social and political actions such as reforms in order to: (1) blur discriminatory tensions, (2) reckon the benefit of change, and (3) configure disarrays of allocating equities between the government, corporations, and social sectors.

The policy sciences study the process of deciding or choosing and evaluate the relevance of available knowledge for the solution of particular problems. When policy scientists are concerned with government, law, and political mobilization, they focus on particular decisions. Policy scientists also study the choosing process of nongovernmental organizations and individuals and consider the significance of the current stock of knowledge for specific issues.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"&gt;International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences .

According to Laswell (1971), an adequate strategy of problem solving in policy sciences encompasses five intellectual tasks. These five tasks are performed at varying levels of insight and understanding: goal clarification; trend description; analysis of conditions; projection of developments; and invention, evaluation, and selection of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H.

Nair (1987) emphasized that communication can be utilized in providing service to the people. It is essential for mobilizing initiatives and providing information required for action in all fields of development such as agriculture, health and family planning, education and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, K., White, S. (1987) Participation is the Key to Development Communication, Media Development.&lt;/ref&gt; However, MacBride Commission (1980) highlighted that adequate financing must be given to development projects.

The term "policy sciences" was originally coined by [[Harold Lasswell|Harold D. Lasswell]] and [[Daniel Lerner]] as an approach to understanding and solving problems that draw on and contribute to all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, N.C. (2001). "Development Communication in a Borderless World". "Paper presented at the national conference-workshop on the undergraduate development communication curriculum, "New Dimensions, Bold Decisions"". Continuing Education Center, UP Los Banos: Department of Science Communication, College of Development Communication, University of the Philippines Los Banos, pp&amp;nbsp;15–28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a set of procedures in an integrated and comprehensive form to help clarify and secure common interests. The term "policy sciences" is in plural form to emphasize its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1978), cited in Flor, Alexander (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser (1998) elucidated the purposive nature of both development communication and policy sciences, thus intertwining their functions. Policies will greatly aid in the successful implementation of projects as they provide directions on what necessary steps to take.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fraser, C. (1998). Communicating for Development: Human Change for Survival. New York, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work of Alexander Flor, the term "development communication policy sciences" was not used as a whole phrase but was mentioned separately as development communication and policy sciences. He discussed the term according to the linkage of development communication and policy sciences as fundamental and traceable even before either area was afforded the status of science.&lt;ref name=flor /&gt;

Communication policy research evolved from the outset as a multi-disciplinary field and domain of various academic disciplines from sociology and political science to law and economics, resulting in the coverage of a myriad of multi-faceted topics. The choice of subjects in communication policy research is affected by sociocultural, political, economic and technological forces that determine the overall framework for communication policy and regulation as well as by the many regulatory objectives in communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Just|first1=Natascha|last2=Puppis|first2=Manuel|title=Trends in Communication Policy Research: New Theories, Methods and Subjects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J70K-zhMxZwC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2012|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of communication in the development process was given a boost when Lerner (1958) {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} wrote his famous treatise 'The Passing of the Traditional Society', in which he acknowledged that mass media growth was one of the three phases of democratic political development (Moemeka, n.d). He pointed out that the mass media had the power to create opportunity for empathy which 'disciplined western men in skills that spell modernity'.

Development communication is basically communication for social change to achieve one's potential. This is embodied in Nora Quebral's (1971) definition which states that development communication is the "art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equity and the larger fulfillment of the human potential." Quebral (2001) redefined development communication to "the art and science of human communication linked to a society's planned transformation from a state of poverty to one of dynamic socio-economic growth that makes for greater equity and the larger unfolding of individual potential."

McKee (1992) emphasized that people's involvement is the key to the desired changes. Unless people see themselves as the driving force of their own development, no amount of investment or provision of technology and inputs will bring about any lasting improvements in their living standards.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;McKee, N. (1992). Social Mobilization and Social Marketing in Developing Countries: Lessons from Communicators. Malaysia: Southbound.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and founding impetus for communication policy research came from Harold D. Lasswell, who also figures prominently as a founding father of communication science and policy science (Rogers 1994). He argued that future advances in communication study depended upon the development of a policy focus and upon being a third voice supplying 'a competing appraisal of the images spread by self-serving sources' (Lasswell 1972:307).

The conception of the policy sciences on the other hand, is more refined and extended today than at any time in the colorful history of man (Lasswell, 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf |title=A Pre-View of Policy Sciences |newspaper=Policysciences.org |date=1971 |author=Harold D. Lasswell |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving a working definition for it, he noted that policy sciences are concerned with knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order.

==Development communication and the policy sciences==
Although development communication and the policy sciences, according to Flor (1991), are generally regarded as two distinct and mutually exclusive fields of study, the two stem from the same principle: the need to actively apply knowledge from and principles of the social sciences in solving societal problems under the conditions of social change.

Flor and Ongkiko (1998), in their book- Introduction to Development Communication, state that development communication is purposive as it primarily uses communication not merely to give information but practically to influence the people- the receivers of information.  Coyle (2008), in his article- Theory of Development Communication, articulates that where people have options to change their ways of life, communication becomes important in informing, persuading, listening, data gathering, educating, training and managing change.  Communication then becomes an instrument in facilitating changes in people in order for them to realize their full potentials. Through it, people would improve their ways of thinking, their ways of acting and their ways of living resulting in a higher quality of life. In agreement, McKee (1992) explicated that the central objective of policy sciences is helping people make better decisions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, policy sciences are purposive as these are anchored on the fulfillment of the aim of improving policy making to provide, as highlighted by Flor (1991), as much "lead time" as necessary in the solution of societal problems.  Policy analysts or policy scientists have to be driven in their pursuit of effectively designing, formulating, analyzing, evaluating policies and most importantly of studying the policy making process in order to create a substantive impact on policymakers. Through communication, they would be able to exert a great influence in the decision making process of the policy makers who are responsible in making policies that would become the guiding principles in resolving concerns, dilemmas or issues with the end in view of effecting societal changes.

Communication is therefore central to development communication and policy sciences.  As Allen (1978), cited by Flor (1991), states:

"Since communication permeates every facet of a person's behavior, the study of communication is no less than one way to study policy making. Communication is a useful concept, precisely because it is one more handle whereby we can effectively study policy making. Communication is one of those few variables through which any policy decision is dependent."&lt;ref&gt;Ongkiko, I. and Flor, A. (1998). Dev Com and the Policy Sciences. ''Introduction to Development Communication''. UP Open University and South East Asian Ministers of Education Organization (SEAMEO) Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture.&lt;/ref&gt; Awa (1989) adds that communication sparks participation. Apart from having good policies which will direct projects to the grass roots level, people's participation is becoming the central issue of our time.&lt;ref&gt;Awa, N. (1989). Participation and Indigenous Knowledge in Rural Development, Knowledge, Creation, Diffusion, Utilization 10(4):304-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication and policy sciences link in societal change==

Undeniably, development communication and the policy sciences are generally regarded as inextricable links in recognizing change in the society. Their engaged roles encourage and support research, practice, and education, and disseminate knowledge and information for the people through various means of communication. Such engagement leads to this further focus on these two's main target: Change. The Rome Consensus emphasized that for significant progress, development policies should integrate communication for development and strengthen communication capacity within countries and development organisations at all levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It has been widely established that mass media could fetch and cater education, essential skills, social harmony, and a desire to reach modernization. As stipulated in Walt Rostow's theory in Boado's&lt;ref&gt;Boado, P. G. (2000). The Need for Self-Directed Learning. Phil: CLSU Research Vista&lt;/ref&gt; (2000) article, societies progress through specific stages of development on their way to modernity, "the age of high mass consumption." Meanwhile, Lerner suggested that exposure to media would generate empathy for modern culture, and a desire to move from long-established to contemporary ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, D. (1958) "The Passing of Traditional Society: Modernizing the Middle East." New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, one needs to be made to understand the fallacy of the notion that communication is an all-embracing area.

Being the most used tool for development communication, mass media technologies have become the eyes and hands of the society in examining its social conditions, and to dissect and plot solutions through policy sciences, accordingly. In fact, in some instances, mass media technologies, including television, have been magic multipliers of development benefits. Educational television has been used effectively to supplement the work of teachers in classrooms in the teaching of literacy and other skills, but only in well designed programs which are integrated with other educational efforts. This insight regarding the integration of technology in the education set up basically creates a step-on-the-ladder of achieving change and development. Consequently, media play a significant role in the conduct of development communication projects. Communication media are agents of social change and indicators of national development.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatnagar, S. (2000). Information and Communication Technology in rural development. Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development communication, policy advocacy, and governance==

Since media and communication play a critical role in development, relevant communication policies are important for good governance to succeed. People engagement and participation in policy advocacy through dialogue are important to gain trust, acceptance, and cooperation from all stakeholders. According to Jan Servaes (2010), since public policies must be viewed as an integral part of the social and economic development process, the kind of advocacy that is ideal is that which is participatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Servaes|first1=Jan|last2=Mai|first2=Chiang|title=Media for Social Transformation: Advocacy for Peace|url=https://www.academia.edu/2808366/Media_for_Social_Transformation_Advocacy_for_Peace|website=www.academia.edu|date=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus in this approach is on 'listening' and 'cooperation' rather than on 'telling what to do' and presumes a dynamic two-way approach to communication.

In general, one can distinguish between (a) advocacy for policy design and decision-making aimed at ensuring political, social and legislative support for development issues (e.g. protection of the environment); and (b) advocacy for policy implementation which requires intensive efforts for mobilizing social forces, individuals and groups for development actions. Both are important and must be addressed. The aim in advocacy strategies is to foster political and public engagement as well as professionals in development issues through the process of social mobilization. There is no universal approach which can be used in all circumstances, flexibility is required in selecting appropriate strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Servaes, 1993. Development communication in action: Report of the Inter-Agency Meeting on Advocacy Strategies for Health and Development. WHO Conference, Geneva, 9–13 November 1992, World Health Organisation (WHO), Geneva, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The communication media are critical in creating awareness, generating public interest and demand, and placing the issue on the public agenda and building social support. They can play two kinds of advocacy roles: (a) they can support development initiatives by the dissemination of messages that encourage the public to support development-oriented projects; and (b) they can provide decision makers with the information and feedback needed to reach a decision. Policymakers usually respond to popular appeal, to pressure groups, and to their own social network of policy- and decision-makers. Therefore, advocacy, political commitment, and supportive policies are often themselves a product of social support systems and empowerment of people. Advocacy should, therefore, be viewed in conjunction with social support and empowerment strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, 2009, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Servaez (2009) affirms that the importance of a free and balanced flow of information to an engaged civil society, through independent media and transparent government, has long been acknowledged. He sees that communication plays a pivotal role in improving governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, 2009, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Schramm (1964) stated that the task of mass media for information and the new media for education is to speed up and ease the long social transformation required for economic development, and, in particular, to speed up and smoothen the task of mobilizing human resources behind the national effort.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Schramm, Wilbur (1964). Mass Media and National Development: The Role of Information in the Developing Countries, California, USA: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governance may be defined as: (1) the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced, (2) the capacity of the government to formulate and implement sound policies effectively, (3) the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic, political, and social interactions among them, and (4) the capacity for active and informed economic, social, and political dialogue among citizens within a public sphere.&lt;ref name=servaes64&gt;Servaes, 2009, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governance implies the ways through which citizens and groups in a society voice their interests, mediate their differences and exercise their legal rights and obligations. Good governance includes notions of greater participation by civil society in decision making, instituting the rule of law, anti-corruption, transparency, accountability, poverty reduction and human rights. Good governance links government to the notion of responsibility for and to the citizenry as opposed to the traditional idea of authority over a nation—legitimacy emanating from popular assent to and participation in government, which is concerned with the welfare of its citizens.&lt;ref name=servaes64 /&gt;

The role of the media in promoting good governance is clear. All aspects of good governance are facilitated by a strong and independent mediascape within a society. Only when journalists are free to monitor, investigate and criticize the public administration's policies and actions can good governance take hold. Independent media are like a beacon that should be welcomed when there is nothing to hide and much to improve. Indeed, this is the concrete link between the functioning of the media and good governance—the media allow for ongoing checks and assessments by the population of the activities of government and assist in bringing public concerns and voices into the open by providing a platform for discussion. Instead, all too often governments devise laws and informal means of keeping their activities hidden from public view or only available to media favorable to their viewpoint. In recent years, many governments have tried to co-opt journalists by paying part of their salaries or by giving them certain kinds of access on the condition that they will not report from other perspectives. If the media are to function in the public interest, governments have to protect the independent functioning of the media and allow various viewpoints to flourish in society.&lt;ref&gt;Barry James (2005).

Newspapers, radio and television are found to be effective media in information dissemination and education of people. They serve as instruments in bridging the government, non-government organizations and the people for project implementation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In India, television is used as a medium for social education, weapon against ignorance and awareness among the people, through its different programs like Educational Television (ETV), Countrywide Classroom (CWC) and Teleconferencing.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Anwar, R. (1975). A Catalyst for Development Media Asia. Indonesia: Rural Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from traditional media, today, social media have gained popularity in all social classes. They have gained a great deal of attention and research for their ability to raise awareness on issues, improve monitoring of environmental and social realities and as social networking for better governance and development. Social media have been used extensively by social movements to communicate, educate, organize, share cultural products of movements and build coalitions.&lt;ref&gt;Willard, T. (2009). Social Networking and Governance for Sustainable Development, International Institute for Sustainable Development. Retrieved from https://www.iisd.org/pdf/2009/social_net_gov.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networking sites (SNS) offer news and opinion, promote discussion and a sense of community, and connect users with similar interests and viewpoints. They have enabled individuals to learn about new ideas and social movements as their friends and colleagues become involved in them.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Ramirez, R. (1998).

Guardian (2011) reports that Facebook has revolutionized communication by bridging distances and other factors which has impeded the process of communication in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian (2011).  Facebook buys mobile startup snaptu, Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/21/facebook-buys-snaptu&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Hashtags on Twitter added a new dimension to the process of participatory communication across the globe. While YouTube (2011) has been committed to the localization of its services.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A key aspect of governance is how citizens, leaders, and public institutions relate to each other in order to make change happen (Haider Huma, et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Huma, 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Communication structures ensure the two-way exchange of information between state and citizens, It allows the citizens to enter into dialogue with the state on policies issues that matter to them. This environment develops trust between state and society which lays the foundation of good governance.

Development communication has brought to the fore the evolution of communication for development (C4D)which has mirrored broader shifts in theories and models of economic and social development. For much of the post-World War II period, C4D was informed by the 'modernization' paradigm, which sought to transform 'traditional' societies into modern, Western societies through the transmission of attitudes, practices and technologies. Correspondingly, communication initiatives adopted a diffusion approach, which uses communication to carry out a transfer of information. It is seen as a way to amplify voices, facilitate meaningful participation and foster social change.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This includes large-scale media campaigns, social marketing, dissemination of printed materials, 'education-entertainment' and other forms of one-way transmission of information from the sender to the receiver. Proponents of diffusion theory recognised the limitations of mass media, however, in promoting sustained behavioral change. The theory also incorporated interpersonal communication: face-to-face communication that can either be one-on-one or in small groups. The objectives are to share information, respond to questions, and motivate specific behavioral practices. The belief is that while mass media allows for the learning of new ideas, interpersonal networks encourage the shift from knowledge to continued practice.&lt;ref&gt;Huma, 2011, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the interpersonal communication skills of field workers is very important in attaining triumph in projects.&lt;ref&gt;Read, H. (1972). Communication Methods for All Media Campaign. USA: University of Illinois, Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The interpersonal relationship of the project owner and the intended recipients will pave the way for participatory development—a two-way, dynamic interaction between grass roots receivers and the information source mediated by the development communicators.&lt;ref&gt;Gujral, I. (1975). Role of Communication in Developing Society, Indian Press, 24(4):15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of the modernization paradigm grew in the 1970s and 1980s. The one-way flow of information and communication from the North to the South was criticized alongside calls for greater representation of voices from the South. At the same time, there was a push for more 'participatory' approaches to development. This triggered the emergence also of participatory development communication, which aims to empower the community towards collective decision-making and action through enhanced knowledge and skills to identify, prioritise and resolve problems and needs. Communication for development has thus come to be seen as a way to amplify voice, facilitate meaningful participation, and foster social change. The 2006 World Congress on Communication for Development defined C4D as 'a social process based on dialogue using a broad range of tools and methods. It is also about seeking change at different levels including listening, building trust, sharing knowledge and skills, building policies, debating and learning for sustained and meaningful change'. Such two-way, horizontal approaches to communication include public hearings, debates, deliberations and stakeholder consultations, participatory radio and video, community-based theatre and storytelling,and web forums. Diffusion and participatory approaches have been increasingly integrated or adopted in parallel in C4D initiatives. Such combinations allow agencies to reach broad audiences through large-scale campaigns while promoting local community development, empowerment and ownership through participation.&lt;ref&gt;Huma, 2011, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while the role of communication in supporting development, and stimulating economic growth has increasingly been recognized in international policy statements, communication is relatively under-prioritized in the 'good governance' agenda. Some attribute this to a lack of robust evidence demonstrating communication's impact on governance, others argue it is more fundamentally a question of whether giving support to communication – which typically encompasses the development of an independent media sector, improving access to information, and the strategic use of media and political communication tools to influence behavior and social change – is a legitimate area for donor funding, given the often highly political nature of such interventions. What is clear is that the available research on the role of communication in governance is fragmented across multiple disciplines with often conflicting priorities (including political science, communications, media studies, and development studies). At the same time, there has been a dearth of practical guidance available to policymakers on understanding and using communication in governance reform.&lt;ref name=huma9&gt;Huma, 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of its relative under-prioritisation in development assistance, few dispute the power of communication, and in particular the catalytic role of the media, in influencing governance relationships and processes: communication is widely seen as vital for connecting states with society, facilitating inclusive political systems, giving 'voice' to poor and marginalised groups, and enabling citizen participation and social accountability. Communication advocates also argue that the strategic use of political communication tools and methodologies can influence the attitudes, opinions and behaviour of key stakeholders and secure the political will necessary for reforms to be successful on the ground. With the recent rise of the fragile states agenda, there has been increased academic and donor interest in how communication can contribute to state-building by improving state-citizen relationships and helping to (re)build social contracts in conflict-affected states.&lt;ref name=huma9 /&gt;

The process of development is expedited by mobilizing human resources. The Development Support Communication (DSC) states that an organization plans the use of information and communication resources to help achieve its goals.&lt;ref&gt;Gecolea, R. (1982). Primer on Development Support Communication Asia and Pacific Programme for Development Training and Communication Planning. UNDP, Bangkok.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intertwining relationship of development communication, policy advocacy, and governance is aptly described in the concept of strategic communication of GIZ, a Germany-based international non-governmental organization. In 2006, the GIZ, (then the GTZ) published in 2006 an article on Strategic Communication for Sustainable development: A Conceptual Overview which is summarized here below:&lt;ref&gt;GIZ (2006) [http://www.gsdrc.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=3755 Strategic Communication for Sustainable development: A Conceptual Overview.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic communication is not just disseminating information; it is the active gathering of stakeholders' views. It is a pre-requisite and an instrument of effective policy making and public participation, facilitating information exchange and establishing consensus among divergent opinions and interests. It facilitates the building of know-how, decision making and action capacities at the heart of the delicate cooperation between government, civil society groups, and the private sector. Both internal and external factors influencing human communication require consideration. Internal factors include norms and values, attitudes and behaviour. External factors include the 'vehicles' that bring the material to the target audience. Five branches of strategic communication are particularly applicable to sustainable development:

Development and environmental communication: Breaking down complex information into understandable elements in a socio-culturally relevant way for different audiences is a prerequisite for consensus building and change. A particularly successful model is the problem-oriented, participatory and focused Strategic Extension Campaign (SEC) developed by FAO.
Social marketing: This involves gathering input from intended beneficiaries to design communication campaigns promoting socially beneficial practices or products in a target group. Audience segmentation is a crucial element.
Non-formal and environmental education: These involve promoting awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behaviour for sustainable development and effective participation in decision-making.
Civil society mobilisation: This involves listening as well as 'talking', and combines vertical and horizontal social interaction through community-controlled media.
Conflict management and negotiation: Mediation, conciliation or arbitration can help to address communication deadlocks and power imbalances, and increase trust.
In 2007, Coffey International Development of London published The Role of Communication in Governance: Detailed Analysis.&lt;ref name=coffey2007&gt;[http://www.gsdrc.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=3757 "The Role of Communication in Governance: Detailed Analysis"], Coffey International Development, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper analyses the positive and negative contributions of communication to governance. In theory, effective communication can help to promote good governance; however, a solid evidence base is lacking and a positive correlation should not be assumed. Existing studies suggest that it is not enough to create the means of communication; enabling factors must be in place so that voices can be heard and citizens can hold the government to account. Here below is the summary of this paper:

"If good governance requires an inclusive public space based on informed dialogue and debate, a positive relationship between communication and governance seems plausible. However, communication can further poor governance (when used to protect the state rather than serve as a voice for the people, for example, or when subject to elite capture). In addition, it is difficult to establish a clear evidence base to support positive connections between communication and governance. There are also challenges relating to causality where the link between communication and governance is thought to be reciprocal; for example, communication may help to promote good governance, but a freer government may also promote participation and communication."&lt;ref name=coffey2007 /&gt;

==Policy engagement in development communication==
Policy engagement in development communication is essential. From the start, development communication practitioners must build relationships with those they seek to inform, influence, and work together with for change. Policy scientists, in turn, must constantly look at how they will move their knowledge not just outward to broad audiences, but directly into practice.

The rationale for policy engagement in development communication is well understood:
* Decision makers are more likely to consider the recommendations if they have been consulted and involved at various stages.  
* Building awareness in the public leads to both advocacy for and receptivity to policy changes.

The participatory approach in policy engagement is key in ensuring that the public and stakeholders have been involved at various stages. Waisbord (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Waisbord, S. 2002. Family Tree of Theories, Methodologies and Strategies in Development Communication. The Rockefeller Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="panos.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://panos.org.uk/wp-content/files/2011/03/heart_of_change_weby2wvJO.pdf |title=At the heart of change |website=Panos.org.uk |author=Mark Wilson|date=2007 |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented the paradigm shift of development communication from the dominant paradigm of Modernism theories which focus on behavior change models to the more critical Dependency and Participatory theories and approaches. According to Waisbord (2002), participatory theories considered necessary a redefinition of development communication and one set of definitions stated that it (development communication) is the "systematic utilization of communication channels and techniques to increase people's participation in development and to inform, motivate, and train rural populations mainly at the grassroots." Further, a decisive role can be played by communicating policies in promoting human development in today's climate of social change. It is vital to stimulate their awareness, participation and capabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Mefalopulos (2008), author of the book "Development Communication Sourcebook: Broadening the Boundaries of Communication" points out the importance of "meaningful and significant participation" which is made possible mainly through communication. The author observes that "many development programs, including community-driven ones seem not to pay similar attention to participation and communication." He notes that "while paying attention to participation,communication which is intended as the professional use of dialogic methods and tools to promote change as an aspect is overlooked" (p.&amp;nbsp;7).  These views further advance that dialogues and interactions among various stakeholders are crucial in the participatory approach of policy making.

Wilson (2007) further stated that, "All forms of participation are essentially communication processes."&lt;ref name="panos.org.uk"/&gt; In a society, communication contributes to healthy political processes whether in drafting policies or keeping governments in check. Flor (2011)&lt;ref name=flor1991 /&gt; identified that the interplay of interests of "the government, the education sector, the communication industry, the private sector, the church, foreign vested interests and the consumers" make up the stakeholders of communication policy. In line with this, the inter-relatedness of societal problems using the problematique technique points out that the different sectors of the society should be encouraged to participate in policy-making. In this manner, policy-making becomes participatory in nature.

Consequently, Lagerwey's (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Lagerwey, F. C. (1990). ''Introduction to development communication:
Its philosophy and approach''. In Communication Foundation for Asia: Media for
Total Human Development. Retrieved &lt;nowiki&gt;http://cfamedia.org/main/?p=2427&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; assertion on the importance of DevCom as a 'discipline born out of people's need for information and education that brought about planned growth intended for human think critically, cultivate proper attitudes, skills and values, and contribute to the welfare of the community development' paves way for policy scientists to come into picture, utilize these information and communication to improve society's desire for social, economic, and political changes and engage in the decision-making process with sound judgment. As it assists developmental and national goals, the scope of DevCom motivates individuals to become productive and engaged stakeholders.

Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, n.d).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld |title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform |website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org |date=2015  |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the convening of the high-level representatives and heads of states from the different part of the world that gave birth to the so-called '[[Sustainable Development Goals]]' or SDGs in 2015 seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom, is resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty, heal and secure our planet, and is determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.

The need to translate the principles of policy sciences into the helm of development is a challenge to policy makers. As coined by Harold Lasswell, policy sciences draw on and contribute to all fields of knowledge (PSC, Inc).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysciences.org/ |title=Policy Sciences |website=Policysciences.org |accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the variety of problems and issues to which the policy sciences have been applied is vast and thus, helping people make better decisions is the central objective of the policy sciences, it pointed out.

==Communication policy science==
The history of communication policy-making can be traced back from the rise of telegraphy, telephony and wireless communication.&lt;ref&gt;Just, N. &amp; Puppis, M. (2012). Trends in Communication Policy Research: New Theories, Methods and Subjects.&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Braman (2003c),&lt;ref&gt;Braman, S. (2003a), 'Introduction', in S. Braman (3d.). Communication Researchers and Policy-Making, Cambridge and London: MIT Press, p. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea originated from the emergence of the bureaucratic welfare state in the late nineteenth century, where telegraph and postal service are prominent. Consequently, problems about technological change comprise the bulk of communication policy (Rowland, 1984).&lt;ref name="Rowland, W.D. 1984 pp. 423-435"&gt;Rowland, W.D. (1984), ' Deconstructing American Communications Policy Literature,' Critical Studies in Media Communication, 1:4, pp. 423-435&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "most of the discussions of public policy for the mass media during the past fifteen years have been driven by questions about the role and promises of the "new technologies" (Rowland 1984:426).

Communication policy science involves the communication policy making of an organization intended members of a society, mostly the media consumer.  It can initiate media education in the formal or non-formal modes; facilitate in the conduct of research and development outfits; establish a network involving the church, academic, communities and cause-oriented groups; and can be used by politicians as "think tanks" serving the government.

==Communication policy==
Communication policy pertains to the set of norms established to guide, regulate, and influence the communication processes to include various interpersonal communication activities within the context of various development sectors such as health and education and also the behavior of mass communication media.  Such policies do not only guide the behaviors and activities of institutions operating various media channels but also other services and factors involved in interpersonal and social communications.

Communication policy and media is made for the benefit of the public (McCann, 2013).&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"&gt;McCann, K. (2013). The Diversity Policy Model and Assessment of the Policy: Debates  and Challenges of (Media) Diversity. Sage, 2, 1-12. Retrieved May 4, 2017, from SAGE Open Web Site: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244013492780&lt;/ref&gt; The public is a social creation that is not biased toward government administrative goals nor individual freedom, but the product that reflects consequences of social, political, and economic considerations we all share (Dewey, 1927).&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1927). The public and Its Problems. Chicago: Swallow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by MCann (2013), she highlights that the general components of public interest should encompass social, political and economic considerations, which are necessary for guiding communications policy. In the same study, McCann proposes an integrative policy model that offers a platform for the analysis of the policy implications and decisions, analyzes the existing policy imposed to achieve diversity goals, and suggests alternative ways of responding to current regulatory challenges in communication policy for strengthening policymaking.&lt;ref name="journals.sagepub.com"/&gt;

"Communication policy" is the merging of two concepts: communication and policy' According to Mwaura (1980)&lt;ref&gt;Maura, P. (1980). Communication Policies in Kenya, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; and Udomisor (2009 in Udomisor and Akoje (2013),&lt;ref&gt;Udomisor, I. W., and Akoje, S.P.E. (2013). Religion as a repository of Nigeria national communication policy. In ''New Media and
Mass Communication'', 16, 88-94.&lt;/ref&gt; communication policy refers to the "''sets of principles and norms established to guide the behaviour of communication systems. They are shaped over time in the context of society's general approach to communication and to the media. Emanating from political ideologies, the social and economic conditions of the country and the values on which they are based, they strive to relate these to the real needs for and the prospective opportunities for communication"''. A framework that ensures the members and stakeholders of the organization of their roles and responsibilities as fully informed individuals and communication practitioners, this policy reflects not only the communication infrastructure&lt;ref&gt;Hirschman, A. (1958). [http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g97814051319958_ss78-1 10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x ''International encyclopedia of communication''].&lt;/ref&gt; and channel but more on its supporting capability in the 'systematic planning, development and use of the communication system, and its resources and possibilities, and for ensuring that they function efficiently in enhancing national development' (National Resource Management and Environment Department, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;National Resource Management and Environment Department. (2002, April). "Methodologies for Designing and Implementing Multimedia Communication Strategies and National Communication Policies". In The Design and Implementation of National Information and Communication Policies for Sustainable Development in Africa: Issues and Approaches . A bilingual regional workshop conducted at Niamey, Niger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (1972). Working Paper for the Meeting of Experts on Communication Policies and Planning. Paris: UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Communication policy needs conscious involvement at several levels: Government executive, legislative bodies, authorities in charge of social and economic planning, individual, ministries and their planning boards, communication enterprises, professional organizations, the citizen, the social scientist, and economists.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, John A. R. (1976). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000165/016578eo.pdf "Towards realistic communication policies : recent trends and ideas"].The UNESCO Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digitalisation needs an active communications policy because it will serve as tools for an effective and efficient delivery of service in both the private and public sector. Today, there is an increasing attention to the utilisation of information and communications technology and digital services in the promotion of employment and economic growth.

===Analysis===
In the performance of development communication and policy science studies, a communication policy analysis is developed. The analyst performs proactive posture, focusing on development communication. Several methods were mentioned in the works of Flor (1991) such as: communication technology assessment, social cost benefit analysis, problematique analysis, scenario construction, and policy delphi.

One of the policy analysis methods discussed by Flor (1991) is the Communication Technology Assessment (CTA) technique which measures the impact of a particular technology to the individuals and society. The result of the assessment serves as the basis for qualifying which technology can be adopted, which ones are constructive, and which are deemed damaging to the society.&lt;ref name=flor1991 /&gt; On the other hand, the [[Collingridge dilemma]] questions the impact of technology assessment in general. It argues that we can only predict the effect of technology if they are extensively developed and widely used in the society. However, the implication of such wide testing and application can lead to difficulties in controlling and changing the technology that has already been embedded in the society.

According to Flor (1991), Scenario Construction and Analysis could be used in analysing communication policy. Scenario is a description technique that has been attracting a lot of attention from practitioners and from researchers. Several disciplines have been using scenarios for some time now, but recently the information system community has dedicated special attention to the possibilities that this description technique provides to enhance understandability of task-related descriptions and communicability among stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Leite, J., Hadad, G., Doom, J &amp; Kaplan, G."A Scenario Construction Process. Requirements Engineering, July 2000, Volume 5, Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenario construction is an assessment of what could happen in the future based on input assumptions. It is not a prediction of what will happen in the future, and is therefore an ideal tool to use to create thought provoking content in markets and sectors that have many variable influences. A scenario report can be deterministic or stochastic, historical or hypothetical. Analysis based on deterministic scenarios typically considers just a few scenarios which might be historical or hypothetical. Although, scenarios tend to be mostly quantitative, they can be used to develop alternative views of the future that are meant to offer strategic thinking about how a company might best respond to rapid changes in the business environment. These scenarios, developed through an internal and external review process, are qualitative and descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;"Scenario Construction and Analysis." Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.eliteeconomics.com/services/scenario-construction-analysis&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
The coinage of the terminology "communication policy research" was done by Harold D. Lasswell, the founding father of communication science and policy science (Rogers, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1994), A History of Communication Study. A Biographical Approach, New York: The Free Press. Rowland, W.D. (1984), 'Deconstructing American Communications Policy Literature, Critical Studies in Media Communication&lt;/ref&gt; Policy-related research flourished after World War II (Braman 2003c:38; McQuail 1994:40).&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, D. (1994). MediaPolicy Research: Conditions for Progress, in C.J. Hamelink and O. Linne (eds.), Mass Communication Research: On Problems and Policies. The Art of Asking the Right Questions, Norwood: Ablex, pp. 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The war encounters resulted to the interest in applying science in the service of transforming society. For Bar and Sandvig (2008:532),&lt;ref&gt;Bar, F. and Sandvig, C. (2008), 'US Communication Policy After Convergence', Media, Culture &amp; Society, 30:4, pp. 531-550&lt;/ref&gt; the "history of communication policy is characterized as 'a story of inertia and incrementalism'".

Lasswell asserts that the future progress in communication study rests on the development of a policy focus and on acting as third voice supplying 'a competing appraisal of the images spread by self-serving sources' (Lasswell 1972:307).&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H.D. (1972), 'Communication Research and Public Policy', Public Opinion Quarterly, 36:3, pp. 301-310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since communication policy research springs forth as a multi-disciplinary field, its focus and framework also largely depends on various forces multi-faceted fields such as sociocultural, political, economic and technological forces.&lt;ref&gt;Just, N. &amp; Puppis, M. (2012). Trends in Communication Policy Research: New Theories, Methods and Subjects&lt;/ref&gt; For Lasswell (1970),&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H.D. (1970). The Emerging Conception of the Policy Sciences,' Policy Sciences, 1:1, pp. 3-14&lt;/ref&gt; communication policy research performs twofold functions, first, it concerns the subject(s) of communication policy research and second, it informs communication policy-makers (Harms 1980:5)&lt;ref&gt;Harms, L.S. (1980). Appropriate Methods for Communication Policy Science: Some Preliminary Considerations', Human Communication Research, 7:1, pp. 3-13&lt;/ref&gt; [touches upon the role of communication policy research in communication policy-making).

Rowland (1984:423)&lt;ref name="Rowland, W.D. 1984 pp. 423-435"/&gt; defines communication policy research as the "investigation of those issues centering around the way in which – and – why societies and governments make choices they do regarding the purpose, ownership, control, support and guidance of their media institutions and services".

Kunkel and Farinola (2001:413)&lt;ref&gt;Kunkel, D. and Farinola, W. J. M. (2001). Underestimating Our Own Weight? The Scope and Impact of Communication Research on Public Policy', in W.B. Gudykunst (ed.), Communicatino Yearbook 24, Thounsand Oaks, London and New Delhi: Safe, pp. 411-431&lt;/ref&gt; claim that research into communication policy traditionally implies studying the policy-making process and examining the patterns and trends in communication policy over the years. It further involves providing pragmatic, action-oriented recommendations and making information available to decision-makers (Majchrzak 1984:12)&lt;ref&gt;Majchrak, A. (1984). Methods for Policy Research, Newbury Park: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;
For these communication researches to be utilized and implemented, a close communicative relationship between the policy researcher and policymaker must exist (Majchrzak, 1984).&lt;ref name="Majchrzak, A. 1984"&gt;Majchrzak, A. (1984). Methods for Policy Research. Applied Social Research Methods Series Volume 3. Sage Publications. The International Professional Publishers Newbury Park, London, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the maximization of communication policy research output, the following benefits are also bound to happen if constructive, open, active and productive communication between parties will occur:

*Policymakers will appreciate constraints and realities of research to reduce the skepticism with which research is viewed;
*Policy researchers will learn about constraints and realities of the policy-makers' world;
*Policymakers will be knowledgeable about information that may be relevant at future times; and
*Policy researchers will be knowledgeable about changes in the policy arena that may affect the study.

To increase the likelihood of research utilization, the communication policy researchers are advised to follow these guidelines when communicating their recommendations (Majchrzak, 1984):&lt;ref name="Majchrzak, A. 1984"/&gt;

*Communicate throughout the study;
*Communicate to different study users; 
*Presentation may mean everything in effective communication; and
*Oral communication is generally more effective than written.

==Bridging research and policy==
There is a need to bridge research and policy especially the science-policy interface. Research and Policy in Development (RAPID) programme focuses to increase the use of research in development policy. John Young, one of the originators of RAPID, states that "Research, policy and practice is complex, multifactoral, non-linear, and highly context specific."&lt;ref&gt;Overseas Development Institute. (2013). "[http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/about_research_and_policy_in_development_-_brochure_0.pdf Research &amp; Policy Development]."&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and Walsh (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Nicola and Walsh, Cora, (2008). Policy Briefs as a communication tools for development research. Background Note, Overseas Development Institute, 8 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a research which focused on how information is accessed for development policy making. In this work Jones and Walsh (2008) identified 11 major obstacles to making use of available scientific information in development policy making: scientific understanding of policy makers is low, limited openness by politicians, lack of dissemination of research findings, lack of incentives, lack of institutional channels for incorporation, economic and social data more relevant to policy making, scientific research findings not relevant to policy, scientific data not perceived as credible evidence, jargon does not correspond with policy environment, too little scientific information available, and too much scientific information available. McQuail (2003) elucidated that effective policies must adhere to measures and means of implementation (mainly embodied in laws, regulations, self-regulation or market practices).&lt;ref&gt;McQuail, D. (2003). Media Accountability and Freedom of Publication. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dimensions of development communication policy science; models of development-policy science interface ==

Dimensions of development communication policy science (Bellu, 2011):
#Economic – Development geared towards improvement of the way  products and services are utilized by or within a system to generate new  products and services  in order to provide additional consumption and/or investment possibilities to the members of the system.
#Human – people-centric development where the focus is placed on enhancing various dimensions of well-being of individuals and their relationships with society (health, education, entitlements, capabilities, empowerment, etc)
#Sustainable – development which factors in a longitudinal perspective of the socio-economic system, and ensuring that the benefits run beneficial for the present as well as predicted future progress or development in the social, environmental, financial aspects
#Territorial – development specific to a locality or space achievable by exploring the comprehensive institutional factors in relation to external situational scenarios

===Models of sustainable development===

Sustainable development (SD) is a highly  intricate socio-ecological endeavor, for the simple reason that the science-policy interface (SPI) is often underdeveloped or totally non-existent, as the latter is oftentimes unprioritized and neglected at the level of country-level policy-making.  The dynamics of science-policy interface for SD policies can be classed into 7 models in a comprehensive typology developed by Kaaronen (2016):

# Independent model – Heterogeneous group or panel of experts from various fields conduct scientific advice, assessments and monitoring;  the  strength  of this model is impartiality as a watchdog, with  the true impact of their reporting is subject to further scrutiny.
# Integrated model – The players are diverse groups from both scientific and non-scientific stakeholders, who work in proximity with government officials and often give ear to muted voices
# Assignment model – Usually these are demand-driven scientific support done by task forces for short-term remedies, but generally lacks comprehensiveness sufficient to act as major solutions to problems
# Nested  model – Scientific support is organized around institutionalized arrangements of nested expert hierarchies. The strength is that it occurs within a highly professional milieu (Kaaronen, R (2016) Scientific Support for Sustainable Development Policies: a typology of Science-Policy Interfaces with Case Studies, media.sitra.fi, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9) with high-level impact yet confronted with challenges of external network capabilities
# Adviser model – Scientific experts directly inform the top political actors via advisory offices, wherein the selection process is not transparent and therefore is not appropriate for complicated high-profile issues.
# Platform model – This model incorporates deliberative and co-productive knowledge brokering arenas for science-policy interaction , often organized by third parties ; the interaction may be too short-lived to provide credibility to results and outcomes
# Mixed/hybrid model – There are models in which a combination of above frameworks operate,  which may be inevitable if the solutions demand complex responses and occur in unpredictable scenarios.

== Approaches to evaluating impacts and outcomes ==
The task of evaluating impacts and outcomes of development communication, or its new form, communication for development (C4D) is as complex as the issues it tries to solve. It requires a shift from the traditional results-based approaches that put premium on accountability to funding  institutions to more innovative, complexity-based approaches that allow for greater stakeholder participation.  Evaluating C4D calls for more flexible techniques other than the quantitative and linear evaluation approaches.

The new approach acknowledges the contextual challenges and  issues attendant to development interventions. Among the issues identified are
the changing information and communication landscape, geographic and cultural barriers, need for compliance to requirements of funding agencies, political instability, among others.

Other issues identified from the survey responses for the [[Inter-Agency Resource Pack]] includes insufficiency of time, funding and resources, highlighting the need for more time to design evaluation tools for diverse programs, lack of capacity, awareness of research, evaluation and  social change and for designing and implementing M&amp;E, and the prevailing preference for more quantitative approaches even if these are found wanting  in surfacing answers to deeper,fundamental questions.

Lennie noted that there are also issues with attribution, because impacts cannot readily be attributed to C4D given the complexity of issues, and because the programs are shared by a number of partner agencies  working together towards a larger development initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Lennie, J. and J. Taachi (2015). Tensions, Challenges and Issues in Evaluating Communication for Development. Nordic Review, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flemish Sign Language''' ({{lang-nl|Vlaamse Gebarentaal}}, '''VGT''') is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Belgium]], a country in Western Europe.  It and [[French Belgian Sign Language]] are varieties of the same language.  The Flemish [[deaf]] community is estimated to include approximately 6,000 sign-language users (Loots et al., 2003).

==History==
When the first deaf schools were established in Flanders, the teachers were directly or indirectly influenced by the methods used at the [[Paris deaf school]] (and consequently by [[French Sign Language]]); either by following training programs in Paris, or by following training programs in two deaf schools in the Netherlands ([[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and [[Sint-Michielsgestel]]), which were themselves influenced by the Paris school.

However, as with neighbouring countries, the education of deaf children was strongly influenced by the resolutions that took place at the [[1880 Milan Conference|Milan Conference in 1880]]. These resolutions banned the use of signs in the education of deaf children in favour of an oral approach. It has been viewed as a dark day in the history of sign language.

By the beginning of the 20th century there was a deaf school in every major town in Flanders, and in some towns there were even two: one for boys and one for girls. Most of the schools were residential and pupils only went home during the holidays, and later on also during the weekends. As a result, regional sign language varieties started to develop around every school.

==Regional variation==
It is now generally accepted and confirmed by research, that Flemish Sign Language consists of five regional varieties which have developed in and around the different Flemish deaf schools: 
[[West Flanders]], [[East Flanders]], [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]], [[Flemish Brabant]], and [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] (De Weerdt et al., 2003).

Next to the differences between the regions, there is intra-regional variation. One example is [[gender]] related variation. Until the 1970s, there were separate schools for deaf boys and girls and this has led to gender variation: some of the signs which are generally used today were boys’ signs or girls’ signs in origin. There are more reasons for the relatively high degree of intra-regional variation.

At the moment there is no [[standardization|standardized]] sign language in Flanders, although there is an ongoing process of spontaneous standardization (mostly due to increasing contacts between deaf people from different regions).

==Federalization==
Another important aspect influencing the language is the [[federalization]] process which has taken place in Belgium along ethnic lines as [[Flemish people|Flemish]] or [[Walloons|Walloon]]. Today every Belgian belongs to a certain linguistic group and the same goes for deaf people. Ironically they are also considered Flemish or [[Walloons|Walloon]], part of the linguistic majority of speakers of Dutch or French, despite the sign language they use and the linguistic minority to which they belong.

The federalization was a fact in 1993, but this was the result of a long process. In the 1970s, the national deaf federation, '''NAVEKADOS''', split up into a Flemish and a Walloon federation and Fevlado (''Federatie van Vlaamse Dovenorganisaties'' or the "Association of Flemish Deaf Organizations") was founded in 1977.
As a result, cultural activities have been organized separately since then, and the Flemish and the Walloon deaf clubs have been subsidized from different sources. Contacts between Flemish and Walloon deaf people have become less and less frequent and this has had its effect on the development of the sign languages in both communities which are deviating from each other as they go through separate standardization processes.

Therefore, the name for the sign language has changed over time from "Belgian Sign Language", to "Flemish-Belgian Sign Language", to the now preferred "Flemish Sign Language" on the Flemish side, and to "[[French Belgian Sign Language]]" or "Walloon Sign Language" on the other.

==Legal recognition==
On 26 April 2006, the [[Flemish Parliament]] unanimously [[Legal recognition of sign languages|recognised]] the Flemish Sign Language as a language in Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/docs/stukken/2005-2006/g729-3.pdf Decreet houdende de erkenning van de Vlaamse Gebarentaal]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Decree (Belgium)|decree]] consists of three major parts:
;Recognition
:The Flemish Sign Language is recognised as a language in the [[Flemish Community]], including the [[Brussels-Capital Region]].
;Advisory committee
:An advisory committee on the Flemish Sign Language is instated, with a maximum of fifteen members, half of which have to be deaf. Advise can be requested by the Flemish Government or the Flemish Parliament, but the committee can also formulate advises autonomously.
;Knowledge and information centre
:The decree arranges the recognition of a knowledge and information centre which has to: coordinate and stimulate linguistic research, support the further development of VGT, develop educational tools for use in teaching VGT and be the first point of contact.

==Usage==
Since December 2012, the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]] news broadcast is available in the Flemish Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.een.be/programmas/het-journaal/vlaamse-gebarentaal Het journaal: Vlaamse Gebarentaal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flemish Parliament had sign language interpreters for the parliamentary debates while [[Helga Stevens]], who is deaf, was member of the parliament.

'''Franco-Seychellois''' are people of [[French people|French]] origin living in the [[Seychelles]]. They form the country's second-largest ethnic group {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}.

==Origins==
Many Franco-Seychellois settled on the islands during the period of [[France|French]] rule over the archipelago. During this time, [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] slaves were also brought to the Seychelles. Franco-Seychellois were allowed to retain their culture after the British took control of the Seychelles.

==Economic role==
Franco-Seychellois play an important role in the country's economy. They are employed in all sectors, including government, business and education.

==Language and religion==
The majority of Franco-Seychellois speak [[Seychellois Creole]], the country's most widely spoken language. They also often speak [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. Of the religiously affiliated, the large majority are [[Roman Catholic]], with a minority belonging to other [[Christian]] denominations.

==Notable people==
*[[France-Albert René]] -  long-time socialist President of Seychelles from 1977 to 2004
*[[James Alix Michel]] - President of Seychelles
*[[Gérard Hoarau]] - opposition leader in the Seychelles as head of the Seychelles National Movement, assassinated in 1985 in London.
*[[James Mancham]] -  the first President of Seychelles from 1976 to 1977.
*[[Jean-Paul Adam]] - Politician, Foreign Minister of Seychelles

'''German settlement in the Philippines''' began during the [[Colonial era]] when the [[German colonial empire|German Empire]] attempted to acquire the Philippines. This article also refers to the choice of Filipino citizenship and/or settlement in the Philippines by persons of either pure or mixed German descent who continued to reside in the country for a significant number of years or decades.

==History==
===Spanish Rule===
The first Germans to arrive to the Philippines were colonists. [[Otto von Bismarck]]’s Germany was one of the United States' rivals in replacing Spanish rule in the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnnetherlands.com/dir/_page/100965/index.php : Munting Nayon News Magazine - The German Philippines that never was ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006071320/http://www.mnnetherlands.com/dir/_page/100965/index.php |date=2011-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1890 to the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, there was a lull in Germany’s colonial campaigns. Like other colonialist nations, Germany sought to protect its overseas nationals and trade interests to the extent of safeguarding free access to markets. A German squadron arrived in Manila and engaged in maneuvers which [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[George Dewey]] seeing this as obstruction of his blockade, offered war — after which the Germans backed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wionzek|2000|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Philippine Republic===
The [[Battle of Manila Bay]] took place on 1 May 1898, following the outbreak of the Spanish–American War. The German Emperor expected an American defeat, with Spain left in a sufficiently weak position for the revolutionaries to capture Manila—leaving the Philippines ripe for German picking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wionzek|2000|p=xvi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the American victory in the war, the Philippines and the Far East were brought to the attention of the world and Germany recognized the great potentialities of the islands as a major commercial market.

On 12 June, the day the Philippines [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared its independence from Spain]], Vice-Admiral [[Otto von Diederichs]] arrived in [[Manila Bay]]. The number of German war vessels in Philippine waters increased to three. Earlier, on 6 and 9 May, respectively, the German ships ''[[SMS Irene|Irene]]'' and the ''[[SMS Cormoran (1892)|Cormoran]]'' arrived in the bay with a separate instruction from the German government, mainly to protect German nationals in Manila. German’s interest in the Philippines was cut short with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on 10 December 1898. The Philippines was finally annexed by the United States in 1899.

===American period===
The Philippines was part of the United States between 1898 and 1946. During the era of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]], 1935–1946, Jewish refugees including [[German Jew]]s from Europe sought a safe haven in Manila. The migration of Jews escaping Europe between 1935 and 1941 was the last major immigration of Jews to the Philippines. The first German Jews to arrive in Manila actually came from the Jewish community in Shanghai. With the occupation of [[Peking]] by the Japanese in 1937, the four million inhabitants of Shanghai were endangered. Germany's shift of alliance from China to [[Japan]] at this time alarmed German Jews in Shanghai, fearing German pressure on Japan to adopt Nazi anti-Jewish policies. Fearing for them as well, the Jewish Community in Manila, led by the Frieder Brothers of Cincinnati,&lt;ref name=pdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquirer.net/globalnation/col_gln/2005/mar08.htm |title=Global Nation &amp;#124; INQ7.net |publisher=Inquirer.net |date=March 8, 2005 |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729041141/http://www.inquirer.net/globalnation/col_gln/2005/mar08.htm |archivedate=July 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; organized the Jewish Refugee Committee of Manila (JRC) with the intention of rescuing German members of the Shanghai Jewish community.&lt;ref name=pamilyangfrieder&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095053/http://www.holocaustandhumanity.org/chhe_philippinesstory.html Philippines story]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Era===
In recent years, several German businesses have set up shops in the Philippines, and a number of Germans have chosen the Philippines as their new residence. In the Philippines, since its formation in January 1906, the German Club has provided a place of respite and interaction for Germans and Filipinos alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnation.inquirer.net/features/people/view/20090717-215922/The-Philippine-German-connection :Inquirer Global Nation - The Philippine-German connection ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720193904/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/features/people/view/20090717-215922/The-Philippine-German-connection |date=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past century, it has stood witness to the country’s unfolding history and today enjoys the regular patronage of members and guests at its current location in Legaspi Village, [[Makati City]].

The '''Gezira Sporting Club''' ({{lang-ar|نادى الجزيرة الرياضى}}, [[Arabic transliteration|transliteration]]:''nādī al-ǧazyrah al-reyādī'') is the largest multi-sport facility in [[Egypt]]. It was founded in 1882 and was originally called '''Khedivial Sporting Club'''.&lt;ref name="gezira"&gt;{{cite web |title=Four clubs, four communities: The Gezira Sporting Club |website=Egypt Independent |date=3 March 2012 |accessdate=11 July 2014 |url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/four-clubs-four-communities-gezira-sporting-club|last=Helmy |first=Heba}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the island of [[Zamalek]] in [[Cairo]].

==History==
The {{convert|150|acre|km2|adj=on}} grounds of the Gezira Sporting Club were initially carved out of the ''Khedivial Botanical Gardens'', and as a result acacias and gardens continue to decorate the area. After the land had been formally leased to the [[British military]] command in 1882, club rules were licensed and the land was divided into several recreational playing grounds. At first, the club was for the exclusive use of the [[British Army]].

Membership was restricted to applicants elected by the committee, on the recommendation of two members, although [[British army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] were automatically enrolled. There were about 750 members. The entrance fee was [[Egyptian Pound|E£]] 2. The various subscriptions were as follows:

* Life members: E£50.
* Resident members (married): E£5.
* Resident members (unmarried): E£3.6.
* Country members (those living outside a radius of 23 kilometers from the Cairo Post Office in Attaba Square): E£2.

Guests could visit the club whenever accompanied by those members by purchasing Day Passes for 5 [[Egyptian piastre|piastres]].

In 1906, the club members asked the [[Egyptian government]] for ownership, but their request was refused. Instead, they were granted a 60-year lease.

The exclusive character of the club continued until after [[World War II]]. In January 1952, the club was [[nationalized]] and became a public club. By this point, most members of the Gezira Sporting Club were [[Egypt]]ians, but the club's members were from society's elite. As a result of nationalization, the ethos and structure of the club were to be altered during the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser regime]]. Half of its eighteen-hole [[golf course]] were given over to a youth club built by the [[Egyptian government]] on the club premises (making it a nine-hole course).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Huffington Post]]|date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2014|title=Is the Gezira Club Still the "In" Place in Cairo?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/magda-abufadil/is-the-gezira-club-still_b_3690755.html|last=Abu-Fadil|first=Magda}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of what was deemed as a traditionally [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] asset was nationalized for the benefit of the poorer majority. These actions made the Egyptian president at the time, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], loved and popular among the middle and lower classes of [[Egypt]].

During [[Anwar Al Sadat]]'s presidency, a new [[elevated highway]] (the [[6th October Bridge]]) was built over the remaining nine-hole golf course and six-furlong [[Horse racing|racecourse]] causing the size of the club to further erode.

Despite suffering vandalism, the Gezira Sporting Club still offers most of the sports and games practiced by its founders: [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[croquet]], [[horse riding]] and [[cricket]].

What had started as a [[United Kingdom|British]] military club evolved into one of [[Egypt|Egypt's]] greatest outdoor attractions. Over the next five decades Gezira Sporting Club remained both a landmark and one of [[Cairo|Cairo's]] greatest assets continuing to this day.

As of 2012, membership was estimated to consist of 43,000 families.&lt;ref name="gezira"/&gt;

==Basketball==
{{Main article|Gezira (basketball club)}}

==Golf==

The 125-year-old par 70 [[golf course]] was the first in [[Egypt]], and was once its best. Before the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser Era]], it was an 18-hole course used only by British nationals.

==Tennis==
Since 1907, Gezira Sporting Club has been the official home of Egypt's [[lawn tennis]] with open tournaments and championships regularly held on its [[clay court]]s. From 1925, international celebrities took part in these widely attended events as it staged the [[Egyptian Open (tennis)|International Championships of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EGYPT HOPES FOR BIG TENNIS SEASON.|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/42565087?searchTerm=International%20Championships%20of%20Egypt%2C%20tennis&amp;searchLimits=|accessdate=20 October 2017|work=Cairns Post (Qld. : 1909 - 1954)|date=22 December 1947|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the launch of the Egyptian Lawn Tennis Association Championship in 1934, Gezira Sporting Club continued to offer its two cups:

* The Doherty: awarded for the [[Tennis|singles]].
* The Slazenger: awarded for the [[Tennis|doubles]].

==Swimming==
The Gezira swimming team was founded in the early 20th century. Now is one of the stronger swimming teams in the Egyptian Premier National Championships. It is ranked 13th out of 33 clubs.

The '''Goldenberg scandal''' was a [[political scandal]] where the [[Kenya]]n government was found to have subsidised exports of gold far beyond standard arrangements during the 1990s, by paying the company Goldenberg International 35% more (in [[Kenyan shilling]]s) than their foreign currency earnings. Although it notionally appears that the scheme was intended to earn [[hard currency]] for the country, it is estimated to have cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10% of the country's annual Gross Domestic Product,&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3495689.stm Moi 'ordered' Goldenberg payment]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is possible that no or minimal amounts of gold were actually exported. The scandal appears to have involved [[political corruption]] at the highest levels of the government of [[Daniel Arap Moi]]. Officials in the former government of [[Mwai Kibaki]] have also been implicated.

==Background==
Similar to most countries, Kenya encourages [[international trade]] by granting tax-free status to commercial enterprises involved in the export of goods and sometimes subsidises these exports. The Goldenberg scandal was based on the fact that exporters who deposited US$ earnings with the Kenya [[central bank]] received in exchange the equivalent in Kenyan shillings plus 20 percent.

However, [[gold mining]] represented a tiny portion of Kenya's GDP, with only one operational gold mine (at [[Kakamega]]). Goldenberg International therefore developed a scheme of smuggling gold into Kenya from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], so that they could legally export it at the higher export price offered by the Kenyan government.

==Details==
The chief architect behind the scheme was a relative of the Kenyan businessman [[Kamlesh Manusuklal Damji Pattni|Kamlesh Pattni]]. However, it was Pattni who established Goldenberg International to implement the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;East African Standard [http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=35939 Faces behind the Goldenberg scam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216231347/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=35939 |date=16 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the politicians in the Moi government and a considerable percentage of the [[Mwai Kibaki|Kibaki]] government have been accused. The judicial system also appears to have been deeply involved, with twenty-three of Kenya's senior judges resigning after evidence indicated their involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theindependent.co.zw/news/2004/February/Friday20/2089.html Corruption conventions lack clout] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028193121/http://www.theindependent.co.zw/news/2004/February/Friday20/2089.html |date=28 October 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme began in 1991, almost immediately after the Kenya government, following directions from the IMF, introduced measures to reform the economy and increase international trade and investment, and seems to have stopped in 1993 when it was exposed by a [[whistleblower]], [[David Munyakei]]. As a result of this, Munyakei was fired from his position at the Central Bank of Kenya, and remained largely unemployed until his death in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mamboafrica.com/index.php?id=1031&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |title=Death of a Whistle blower |publisher=Mambo Africa |date=27 September 2010 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two investigations on the scam, one under the Moi government and the other under the current government. The gold, if there was any, was likely imported from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

==Bosire report==
On 3 February 2006, following an investigation under the Kibaki government, a report by Mr Justice Bosire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/africa/4676690.stm |title=Moi 'knew about' Kenya gold scam |publisher=BBC News |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended that the Education Minister at that time, [[George Saitoti|Prof. George Saitoti]] should face criminal charges for his actions and that former President [[Daniel arap Moi]] should be further investigated. Saitoti was both vice-president and finance minister under Moi in the early 1990s. On 13 February Saitoti's resignation was announced by President Kibaki in a television address.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4710138.stm Kenyan 'graft' ministers resign]&lt;/ref&gt;

The report said that records presented at the inquiry showed that Lima Ltd, which is associated with Mr Gideon Moi, Mr [[Nicholas Biwott]], and two other people received Sh6.3 million from Goldenberg. However, the Commission concluded that in respect of Nicholas Biwott, who had not been in government at the time, "no moneys of Goldenberg were involved", the matter was outside the terms of reference and the commission could enquire into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tikenya.org/documents/Goldenberg%20Report.pdf |title=Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the Goldenberg Affair, paragraph 694 |format=PDF |publisher=Tikenya.org |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709214312/http://www.tikenya.org/documents/Goldenberg%20Report.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also said Sh158.3 billion of Goldenberg money was transacted with 487 companies and individuals. A list of exhibits compiled by the commission puts Goldenberg International Ltd at the top of the primary recipients of the money, at Sh35.3 billion. The directors of Goldenberg were named as Mr Pattni and Mr Kanyotu. Although Mr Kanyotu was the director of the Special Branch (intelligence unit of the Kenya Police, now known as National Intelligence Services, NIS) and a director of First American Bank, he described himself as a farmer in Goldenberg documents. President Moi was named by Mr Pattni as having been a shareholder of GIL by nominee. However, President Moi himself was never called to present evidence despite this alleged link.

===Cost===
In response to a query by [[Joseph Lekuton]], on 16 December 2008, [[Orwa Ojode]] the Assistant Minister for Provincial Administration and Internal Security confirmed to [[National Assembly of Kenya|parliament]] that the commission had cost the [[Kenya]] Government Kshs 511,569,409.90.&lt;ref name="Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kenya National Assembly Official Record (Hansard)|url=https://books.google.co.ke/books?id=6pEheyUSVnkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=16 December 2008|page=4107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel restrictions===
Shortly after, Saitoti along with 20 several others suspected to be involved in the scandal were prohibited from leaving the country and ordered to surrender any weapons they possessed. Among those named were

* Gideon Moi, Retired President Moi's son, also the Baringo Central MP
* Mr Philip Moi, Retired President Moi's son
* Mr Moi's lawyer, Mr [[Mutula Kilonzo]]
* Mr Moi's former personal assistant, Mr [[Joshua Kulei]]
* Former Central Bank of Kenya governor [[Eric Kotut]]
* former Central Bank of Kenya deputy governor [[Eliphas Riungu]]
* former Central Bank of Kenya employee [[Job Kilach]].
* former Central Bank of Kenya employee [[Tom Werunga]]
* former Central Bank of Kenya employee [[Michael Wanjihia]]
* [[Philip Murgor]], the former director of public prosecutions
** Mr Murgor's law firm represented the Central Bank of Kenya during the two-year public inquiry headed by Mr Justice Bosire.
* Former Treasury permanent secretary Charles Mbindyo
* former Treasury permanent secretary Wilfred Karuga Koinange
* former Treasury permanent secretary Joseph Magari
* Prof [[George Saitoti]], who resigned as Education minister.
* Goldenberg architect [[Kamlesh Manusuklal Damji Pattni|Kamlesh Pattni]]
* Pattni's business partner and former Special Branch chief [[James Kanyotu]]
* former commissioner of Mines and Geology [[Collins Owayo]]
* Mr Arthur Ndegwa, senior mining engineer in the Commissioner of Mines Nairobi office
* former commissioner of Customs and Excise [[Francis Cheruiyot]].
* former Kenya Commercial Bank general manager Elijah arap Bii

Former president Moi himself was not listed.

The Law Society of Kenya chairman Tom Ojienda criticised Police Commissioner Hussein Ali's move to seize travel documents. He described the decisions as "a total violation of the law and the Constitution". Ojienda regretted that individuals had been charged, tried and convicted by the court of public opinion and the media or through political statements. He commended three Cabinet ministers who resigned to pave way for investigations into the Anglo Leasing and Goldenberg scandals. "The resignation of three members of Cabinet signifies the maturity of our democracy, where leaders whose reputations are besmirched would opt to resign pending investigations to clear their names rather than hold the Government hostage. Such resignations are no pointers to guilt."&lt;ref&gt;East African Standard: [http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=36571 LSK criticises minister on graft assets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010045715/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=36571 |date=10 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecutions==
Two transactions stand out – one for Sh5.8 billion from the Central Bank to Goldenberg International in 1993, personally authorised by then-president [[Daniel Arap Moi]], and another for Sh13.5 billion. The then CID director Joseph Kamau told reporters on 9 March 2006 that files on Pattni, Kanyotu, Koinange, Kotut, Bii, Riungu and Werunga had been passed to attorney-general [[Amos Wako]]. Wako has been attorney-general since 1991, when Moi was in power.

Wako is recommending that the country's chief justice consider overturning a previous court order exempting Mr Saitoti from prosecution. All except Werunga are to be charged.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]]: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/africa/4808276.stm Kenyans facing Goldenberg charges]&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution hopes that Werunga will be their witness.&lt;ref&gt;The Standard: [http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=37978 AG orders prosecution of Goldenberg suspects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174929/http://www.eastandard.net/hm_news/news.php?articleid=37978 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006 it was reported that a [[list of constitutional courts|constitutional court]] had ruled that Saitoti could not be charged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/kenya/story/0,,1836018,00.html Former vice-president escapes graft charges] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Kenyan media reacted negatively to the decision.

A '''green company''' claims to act in a way which minimizes [[Environmental degradation|damage to the environment]].

As [[global warming]] continues apace and becomes an increasingly prevalent topic amongst world governments, many companies are doing their part to become environmentally more responsible or "green".

==Examples==

===Automotive===
A number of major auto companies have developed [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s and all-electric vehicles in a move to reduce  petroleum consumption. Technologies include [[compressed natural gas]], [[Fuel cell vehicle]]s, [[Battery electric vehicle]]s, and [[Hybrid electric vehicle]]s.

===Aviation===
The [[environmental impact of aviation]] is significant, though a number of companies are working on [[mitigation of aviation's environmental impact]] through new technologies including [[aviation biofuel]].

===Doors and Garage Doors===
[[Pella]], [[Masonite International|Masonite]], Marvin, [[Jeld Wen|Jeld-Wen]] and other top door manufacturers claim that their entry doors meet [[Energy Star]] requirements. [[Doors|Entry doors]] represent an important source of energy waste in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/doors "Doors"]; Energy.gov, USA&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, doors are an important cause of [[carbon emissions]] (buildings account for about 41% of our primary energy consumption and an almost equivalent amount of CO2 emissions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/ChapterIntro1.aspx "Building Energy Data Book"]; US Department of Energy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petroleum===
[[Suncor]], &lt;!-- see discussion page --&gt;a Canadian-based oil company, was named a top performer among 23 global petroleum-producing firms with its environmentally responsible greenhouse gas management programs.

===Household===
[[S.C. Johnson]] Company, maker of household items such as [[Windex]] and [[Ziploc]] plastic bags was environmentally aware long before it became popular to be so. Using its innovative "Greenlist" process which serves to evaluate what environmental impact certain raw materials used in producing its products can have, S.C. Johnson has been able to eliminate some 1.8 million pounds of [[volatile organic compounds]] and 4 million pounds of [[polyvinylidene chloride]] from commonly used household items.{{fact|date=May 2016}}

===Small-business partnerships===
In 2009, [[Atlanta]]'s [[Virginia-Highland]] became the first [[carbon-neutral]] zone in the United States. This partnership, developed by Verus Carbon Neutral, links 17 merchants of the historic [[Virginia-Highland commercial districts|Corner Virginia-Highland]] shopping and dining neighborhood retail district, through the [[Chicago Climate Exchange]], to directly fund the Valley Wood [[Carbon Sequestration]] Project (thousands of acres of forest in rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Jay | first = Kate | title = First Carbon Neutral Zone Created in the United States | date = November 14, 2008 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS164153+14-Nov-2008+PRN20081114 | work = Reuters | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090907024146/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS164153+14-Nov-2008+PRN20081114 | archivedate = September 7, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Auchmutey | first = Jim | title = Trying on carbon-neutral trend | newspaper = [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date = January 26, 2009 | url = http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/01/26/carbon0126b.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Supporters of green companies claim that it is far more economical to [[go green]] than it is to continue adding harmful chemicals to the atmosphere and the environment in general.

Opponents believe that the environmental claims of "green companies" are often exaggerated and have variously raised accusations of [[greenwash]]ing.  In 2013, [[The Coca-Cola Company]] was accused of [[greenwashing]], after marketing a new line of plastic bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/coca-cola-company-ko-busted-greenwashing-plantbottle-marketing-exaggerated-1402409|title=Coca-Cola Company (KO) Busted For ‘Greenwashing’: PlantBottle Marketing Exaggerated Environmental Benefits, Says Consumer Report|publisher=International Business Times|first=Christopher |last=Zara|date=September 3, 2013|access-date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gẹlẹdẹ''' spectacle of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] is a public display by colorful masks which combines art and ritual dance to amuse, educate and inspire worship.&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=The Gèlèdé spectacle : art, gender, and social harmony in an African culture|year=1996|publisher=University of Washington press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-97599-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelede celebrates “Mothers” (''awon iya wa''), a group that includes female ancestors and deities as well as the elderly women of the community, and the power and spiritual capacity these women have in society. However, this power may also be destructive and take the form of witchcraft; therefore, Gelede serves the function of appeasing this power, as well.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann |first=William C. |title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum |year=2009 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=978-3791343211 |author2=Adande, Joseph |author3=Dumouchelle, Kevin D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gelede in the context of Yoruba belief==
The Gelede social agenda rests on the Yoruba maxim ''Eso l'aye'' (The world is fragile). In other words, life is delicate and should be lived with caution and with an emphasis on diplomacy, consideration, respect and harmony.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

==The origins of Gelede==
Most Yoruba myths of origin can be found in the divination narratives knows at [[Odu Ifa]]. There are approximately 256 Odu Ifa, each of which contains a number of poems called [[ese Ifa]]. A typical ese Ifa is a narrative about a person or animal with a problem and the steps to resolve that problem. An ese Ifa explains the origins of Gelede as beginning with [[Yemoja]], "The Mother of all the orisa and all living things." Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, who advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed "Efe" (the humorist); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed "Gelede" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.

After getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals- dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet- they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and was perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelebe. An outdated theory states that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

==Gelede spectacle==
Although Gelede ceremony may be staged at any time of the year (to better the lot of an individual, to cleanse the society of pestilence, to induce rain, to enrich human fertility, to enlist the support of supernatural forces and the "powerful mothers" in wartime, and to honor the dead), the most elaborate performance occurs during the annual festival.

Once the exact dates of the festival are fixed, usually through divination, the Iyalase notifies the head of the community and the important chiefs. Messages then go out to all members of the Gelede society outside the town or working far away to return home for the celebration.

The festival begins with an all-night concert called efe, which features the Efe male mask, who uses satire to entertain and educate. Given the concern of the Gelede society with peace and social stability, it is not surprising that didactic themes recur in ''efe'' songs.

After the efe dance, most of the attendees spend the morning sleeping in preparation for the afternoon dance, which takes place in the marketplace and features pairs of male dancers who perform to fast-paced music with a vigorous beat.

The Gelede ceremony involves carefully choreographed dance, singing and music, and especially drumming. The performances are given by men, wearing masks that feature sculpted images of scenes including animals and people or sewing machines and drums. The pairs of men masquerade as women to amuse, please and placate the mothers who are considered very powerful, and who may use their powers for good or destructive purposes. These powers are especially linked to childbirth. The abilities they possess may be activated either consciously or unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 71 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-07-01 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171150/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | archivedate = 2011-09-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gelede costume and headdress==

Gelede masks are worn with a costume consisting of layers of elaborate, colorful cloth.

The Gelede "mask" is more accurately a headdress, since it rests on top of the head and the wearer's face is covered by a cloth veil. The headdress takes the form of a human head, on top of which are motifs that are intended to entertain onlookers but, in addition, usually address social concerns that may also be expressed in songs that are part of the masquerade. The headdresses are usually brightly painted.&lt;ref name=Siegmann /&gt;

Individuals or families will usually go to any length to make their headdresses as attractive and humorous as possible. The endless variety of the motifs and their combinations makes it difficult to attempt to construct a typology of Gelede headdresses.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

Most of the headdresses have facial adornments, ranging from lineage marks to decorative tattoos, which are either incised or painted.

[[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: "The headdress is to the costume what the [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|head (ori)]] is to the human body. It is an index of identification and the essence of the masker's personality as long as he is inside the mask. In spite of the comical representations that often appear on the headdress, the face below the superstructure remains serene, as if stressing the paradox that is life-and the need to live life with special care."&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

On August 29 2016, a murder-suicide took place close to the town of [[Ballyjamesduff]] in [[County Cavan]], [[Ireland]]. A family of five consisting of three young boys, Ryan, Niall and Liam, their mother Clodagh and their father Alan were all found dead inside a house in Oakdene at approximately 11:00 am. At 10:45 am Clodagh's mother called to the house and contacted [[Garda Síochána]] to raise the alarm. The family were identified as the Hawe Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/gardai-treating-deaths-five-family-8730096|title=Gardai treating deaths of 5 family members in Cavan as murder-suicide|last=Brennan|first=Colin|date=2016-08-29|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anglocelt.ie/news/roundup/articles/2016/08/29/4125715-garda-investigate-deaths-of-five-members-of-one-ballyjamesduff-family-/|title=Anglo Celt - Gardaí investigate deaths of five members of one Ballyjamesduff family|access-date=2016-08-29}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/schools-pay-tribute-to-cavan-family-who-died-in-suspected-murder-suicide-1.2772011|title=Schools pay tribute to Cavan family who died in suspected  murder-suicide|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Breaking:-Five-bodies-discovered-at-a-house-in-Cavan|title=Murder-suicide suspected after Cavan family are found dead in house|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;It was later determined that Alan Hawe, the owner of the home, had committed the murder. He had stabbed his wife and three children with various knives before hanging himself. This was met by immediate shock, as Alan was deemed a pillar in the community, a deputy principal and teacher at a local primary school who helped out with the local GAA club. Hawe had written a note, asking whoever were to knock at the door to not common but rather ring the Gardaí.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/clodagh-boys-never-stood-chance-9367017|title='Clodagh and boys never stood a chance': Clodagh Hawe's mother|last=Beattie|first=Jilly|date=2016-12-01|work=irishmirror|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inquest into the deaths took place in December 2017. Psychiatrist Harry Kennedy concluded that Alan Hawe was suffering from severe depression and had been going through a psychotic episode at the time of the killings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7631">The '''history of [[pathology]]''' can be traced to the earliest application of the [[scientific method]] to the field of [[medicine]], a development which occurred in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].

Early systematic human [[dissection]]s were carried out by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] physicians [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus of Chios]] in the early part of the third century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Staden |first1=H |title=The discovery of the body: human dissection and its cultural contexts in ancient Greece |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=223–41 |year=1992 |pmid=1285450 |pmc=2589595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first physician known to have made [[Autopsy|postmortem]] [[dissection]]s was the [[Arab]]ian physician [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] (1091–1161).  [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902) is generally recognized to be the father of microscopic pathology.  Most early pathologists were also practicing [[physician]]s or [[surgeon]]s.also see Egyptian mummification as pre modern necropsy might suggest as early embalming and post mortem organ removal.

==Origins of pathology==
Early understanding of the origins of diseases constitutes the earliest application of the [[scientific method]] to the field of [[medicine]], a development which occurred in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Toby E. Huff (2003), ''The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West'', p. 54, 246-247, 216-218. [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Histpath"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/PTHL312abc/312a/01/Reader/reader_set.html] History of Pathology, at the USC School of Dentistry&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]], the founder of scientific medicine, was the first to deal with the anatomy and the pathology of human spine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=1999&amp;issue=07010&amp;article=00018&amp;type=abstract Hippocrates: The Father of Spine Surgery : Spine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen]] developed an interest in anatomy from his studies of [[Herophilus]] and [[Erasistratus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_galen.html Greek Medicine - Galen]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of studying disease through the methodical dissection and examination of diseased bodies, organs, and tissues may seem obvious today, but there are few if any recorded examples of true [[autopsies]] performed prior to the [[2nd millennium|second millennium]]. Though the pathology of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] was understood by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] since the time of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) who described it in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (c. 1020),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/history/islam-science-technology-health/sub12.html Medicine And Health], "Rise and Spread of Islam 622-1500: Science, Technology, Health", ''World Eras'', [[Thomson Gale]].&lt;/ref&gt; the first physician known to have made [[Autopsy|postmortem]] [[dissection]]s was the [[Arab]]ian physician [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] (1091–1161) who proved that the skin disease [[scabies]] was caused by a [[parasite]], followed by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (b. 1213) who used dissection to discover [[pulmonary circulation]] in 1242.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Islamic+medicine Islamic medicine], ''[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, anatomic dissection was repeatedly used by the Italian physician [[Antonio Benivieni]] (1443-1502) to determine cause of death.&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt; Antonio Benivieni is also credited with having introduced necropsy to the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin's Pathology, Fifth Edition.  2008.   Ed. R. Rubin and D.S. Strayer&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous early gross pathologist was [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] (1682-1771). His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomem Indagatis'', published in 1761, describes the findings of over 600 partial and complete autopsies, organised anatomically and methodically correlated with the symptoms exhibited by the patients prior to their demise. Although the study of normal anatomy was already well advanced at this date, ''De Sedibus'' was one of the first treatises specifically devoted to the correlation of diseased anatomy with clinical illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacs.unica.it/biblio/lesson6.htm] A History of Medicine from the Biblioteca Centrale dell'Area Biomedica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgagni |first1=GB |title=Founders of Modern Medicine: Giovanni Battista Morgagni. (1682-1771) |journal=Medical library and historical journal |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=270–7 |year=1903 |pmid=18340813 |pmc=1698114}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1800s, an exhaustive body of literature had been produced on the gross anatomical findings characteristic of known diseases. The extent of gross pathology research in this period can be epitomized by the work of the Viennese pathologist (originally from Hradec Kralove in the Czech Rep.) [[Carl Rokitansky]] (1804-1878), who is said to have performed 20,000 autopsies, and supervised an additional 60,000, in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/981.html] Karl von Rokitansky at Whonamedit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of microscopic pathology==
[[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821-1902) is generally recognized to be the father of microscopic pathology. While the compound [[microscope]] had been invented approximately 150 years prior, Virchow was one of the first prominent physicians to emphasize the study of manifestations of disease which were visible only at the cellular level.&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/912.html] Rudolf Virchow at Whonamedit.com&lt;/ref&gt; A student of Virchow's, [[Julius Cohnheim]] (1839-1884) combined [[histology]] techniques with experimental manipulations to study [[inflammation]], making him one of the earliest [[experimental pathology|experimental pathologists]].&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt; Cohnheim also pioneered the use of the [[frozen section procedure]]; a version of this technique is widely employed by modern pathologists to render diagnoses and provide other clinical information intraoperatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=660&amp;letter=C&amp;search=Julius%20Cohnheim] Jewish Encyclopedia entry on Julius Cohnheim&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern experimental pathology==
As new research techniques, such as [[electron microscopy]], [[immunohistochemistry]], and [[molecular biology]] have expanded the means by which biomedical scientists can study disease, the definition and boundaries of investigative pathology have become less distinct. In the broadest sense, nearly all research which links manifestations of disease to identifiable processes in cells, tissues, or organs can be considered [[experimental pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asip.org/about/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043556/http://www.asip.org/about/about.htm |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }} Mission of the American Society for Investigative Pathology&lt;/ref&gt;

{{broader|Catholic Church and homosexuality}}

The Christian tradition has generally proscribed any and all noncoital genital activities, whether engaged in by couples or individuals, regardless of whether they were of the same or different sex.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Siker, Homosexuality and Religion&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been maintained through the centuries by the Roman Catholic Church, to the present day. The Catholic Church's position specifically on homosexuality developed from the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]], which was in stark contrast to Greek and Roman attitudes towards same-sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yyrao0dadqAC&amp;pg=PA160 David Sacks, Oswyn Murray, Lisa R.

In Spain the Inquisition tried nearly a thousand individuals for [[sodomy]], and a number were executed.&lt;ref name="HaggertyGeorge"/&gt;

==Early Church==

===Influence of the Church Fathers===

The Catholic Church's position specifically on homosexuality developed from the teachings of the [[Church Fathers]], which was in stark contrast to Greek and Roman attitudes towards same-sex relations including the "(usually erotic) homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or adolescent male" that is called [[pederasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yyrao0dadqAC&amp;pg=PA160 David Sacks, Oswyn Murray, Lisa R.

The early 2nd century treatise, the ''[[Didache]]'' (which influenced thinking by some of the Church Fathers), includes in a list of commandments: "You shall not corrupt boys."&lt;ref group=note&gt;The literal Greek phrase is "ou ''paidophthorēseis''", which means,"You shall not '''corrupt''' boys.&lt;/ref&gt; David F. Greenberg gives it as one example of the early Christian writings of the first two centuries that were "unequivocably opposed to male prostitution and pederasty — probably the most visible forms of homosexuality in their time".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=didache+homosexuality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4jiLU4GBCszY7AaAvoHgBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=didache%20homosexuality&amp;f=false David F. Greenberg, ''The Construction of Homosexuality'' (University of Chicago Press 1990)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Alexandria]] (c. 150–c. 215) rebuked heathens for worshipping gods who indulged in debauching of boys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYHjz6J3OrYC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=clement+of+alexandria+%22debauching+of+boys%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9Jm-0CgSRR&amp;sig=k8HM6SSGpX2FUv5kz5hOrAD3nnU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cE1yUrfnJ9SR7Ab1mIHoCA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=clement%20of%20alexandria%20%22debauching%20of%20boys%22&amp;f=false Clement of Alexandria, ''Exhortation to the Heathen'', chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (c. 260/265–339/340) wrote of God "having forbidden all unlawful marriage, and all unseemly practice, and the union of women with women and men with men".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/fathers/eusebius_de_06_book4.html Eusebius of Caesarea, ''Demonstratio Evangelica'', book 4, chapter 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Apology'' of [[Aristides of Athens]], presented to Emperor Hadrian around 117–138 CE, scorned the practices and acts of the Greek pagans who worshipped gods some of whom "polluted themselves by lying with males".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/aristides-kay.html|title=The Apology of Aristides the Philosopher|website=www.earlychristianwritings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Robert Grant in ''The Anchor Bible Dictionary'' argues that the language in the Syriac version against homosexuality is stronger, probably because it was presented to [[Antoninus Pius]] rather than the homosexual [[Hadrian]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Krans, Joseph Verheyden (editors), ''Patristic and Text-Critical Studies: The Collected Essays of William L. Petersen'' (BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-90-0419613-1}})., p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Basil of Caesarea]] (329 or 330 – 379) was among the first to talk about penalties, advising in a letter that, "He who is guilty of unseemliness with males will be under discipline for the same time as adulterers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.ccxviii.html|title=NPNF2-08. Basil: Letters and Select Works - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking Basil's lead, [[Gregory of Nyssa]]'s Canonical Letter to Letoius of Mytilene (Epist. canonica 4, 390 CE) also prescribes the same period of penance for adultery and for "craving for the male".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/102.pdf Gregory of Nyssa, The Letters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214115509/http://ixoyc.net/data/Fathers/102.pdf |date=14 December 2013 }}, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Chrysostom===

[[John Chrysostom]] (c. 347–407), the Archbishop of Constantinople, was particularly vocal on the subject - loathing homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Allen, ''The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia'', (2006) p.187&lt;/ref&gt; His most notable discourse in this regard is his fourth [[homily]] on {{Bibleverse||Romans|1:26–27|ESV}}, where he argues that those who have sex with the same gender must do so because they are insane: "''All of these affections then were vile, but chiefly the mad lust after males; for the soul is more the sufferer in sins, and more dishonored than the body in diseases. ... [The men] have done an insult to nature itself. And a yet more disgraceful thing than these is it, when even the women seek after these intercourses, who ought to have more shame than men.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxchurchfathers.com/fathers/npnf111/npnf1177.htm#TopOfPage|title=John Chrysostom: Homilies on Romans: Homily IV|website=orthodoxchurchfathers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He went on to describe homosexuality as the worst of sins (greater than murder). Punishment will be found in [[hell]] for such transgressors, and that women can be guilty of the sin as much as men (although the former disrupt the [[patriarchal]] hierarchy through such as act). Chrysostom argues that the male passive partner has effectively renounced his manhood and become a woman – such an individual deserves to be "driven out and stoned". Chrysostom was particularly influential in shaping early Christian thought that same-sex desire was an evil that ultimately resulted in social injustice – altering the traditional interpretation of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a place of inhospitality, to one where the sexual transgressions of the Sodomites became paramount.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carden, ''Sodomy: A history of a Christian Biblical Myth'', Routledge, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Allen describes the sermon as the "climax and consummation of homophobia in the late classical world".&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Allen, ''The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia'', (2006) p.187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Church Councils===

Canon law regarding same-sex sexual activity has mainly been shaped through the decrees issued by a number of ecclesiastical councils.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick S. Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'', London, Longmans, Green, 1955, p185&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, canons against sodomy were aimed at ensuring clerical or monastic discipline, and were only widened in the medieval period to include laymen.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick S. Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'', London, Longmans, Green, 1955, cited in [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/lgbcathbib1.asp Paul Halsall, "Homosexuality and Catholicism Bibliography"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 4th-century [[Council of Elvira]] (305-306) was the first church council to deal with the issue directly, excluding from communion anyone who had sexual intercourse (''[[stuprum]]'') with a boy:&lt;ref name=Elvira&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm Canon 71] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm |date= 5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/main/elvira/canons_of_elvira_04.shtml|title=Canons of the Council of Elvira - Page 4 of 4|website=www.earlychurchtexts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=Greenberg+Elvira&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Vm5yUp2-BMWu7Ab13YCoAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Greenberg%20Elvira&amp;f=false David F. Greenberg, ''The Construction of Homosexuality''] (University of Chicago Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-22630628-5}}), p. 227, with a note that says: "Not too much should be made of the restriction of the prohibition to boys."&lt;/ref&gt;

Canons 16 and 17 of the [[Council of Ancyra]] (314), which "became the standard source for medieval ecclesiastical literature against homosexuality",&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; impose on "those who have been or who are guilty of bestial lusts" penances whose severity varies with the age and married status of the offender, allowing access to communion only at death for a married man over fifty years old (canon 16); and impose a penance also on "defilers of themselves with beasts, being also leprous, who have infected others [with the leprosy of this crime]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3802.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Council of Ancyra (A.D. 314)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century, the Greek chronicler [[John Malalas]] wrote about Isaiah, Bishop of Rhodes and Alexander, Bishop of Diospolis who had been punished by the Prefect of Thrace (Victor) for "homosexual practices". Isaiah was tortured severely and exiled, while Alexander had his genitals amputated and was subsequently paraded around the city on a litter. As a result the Christian Emperor [[Justinian]] (c.e 482 – 565) decreed that all caught for pederasty should have their genitals amputated. Many homosexual men were arrested in the wake of this, and died from their injuries. An atmosphere of fear followed.&lt;ref&gt;The Chronicle of John Malalas, 18:18&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iberia, the Visigothic ruler [[Egica]] of Hispania and Septimania demanded that a church council confront the occurrence of homosexuality in the kingdom. In 693, the [[Sixteenth Council of Toledo]] issued a canon condemning guilty clergy to degradation and exile and laymen to a hundred lashes. Egica added an edict imposing the punishment of castration (as already in the secular law promulgated for his kingdom by his predecessor King Chinawith).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RKhFRgR-1awC David F. Greenberg, ''The Construction of Homosexuality''] (University of Chicago Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-22630628-5}}), pp. 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilization''] (Harvard University Press 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-67403006-0}}), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne Fone, ''A history of homophobia'', Picador, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was also dealt with at the Council of Paris—in canons 34 and 69 (AD 829),&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; which went beyond Elvira and Ancyra in explicitly endorsing the death penalty for sodomy—claiming that it had led God to destroy [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and send the [[Noah's Flood|Great Flood]]&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, ''Homosexuality and Civilisation''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;(John Boswell has called the canons a forgery in [https://books.google.com/books?id=v-MR5_AdG68C John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality''] (University of Chicago Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-22606714-8}}), P. 177 arguing in fact that "attitudes towards homosexuality grew steadily more tolerant in the early Middle Ages").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPq0sITjL8QC Allen J. Frantzen, ''Before the Closet''] (University of Chicago Press 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-22626092-1}}), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The concern at Paris was that toleration of sodomy might provoke God to give victory to the enemies of Christianity (i.e. Islam). At about the same time, the set of forged [[capitularies]] produced by the deacon [[Benedict Levita]] implied that [[Charlemagne]] had likewise supported the death penalty.  Meanwhile canon 15 of the Council of Trolsy (AD 909) warned against "pollution with men or animals".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Alongside this, penances for such sexual transgressions may increasingly be found in a few of the penitential books which first emerged in the 6th century in monastic communities in Ireland (including for women having sex with other women).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Pierre Player (editor), ''Book of Gomorrah: Eleventh century treatise against clerical homosexual practices'', Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1982, notes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ngP831kjAIsC Michael D. Jordan, ''The Invention of Sodomy''] (University of Chicago Press 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-22641040-1}}), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Early Modern period==
By the late Middle Ages, the term "sodomy" had come to cover copulation between males, bestiality, and non-vaginal heterosexual intercourse,&lt;ref name="HaggertyGeorge"/&gt; [[coitus interruptus]], masturbation, [[fellatio]] and anal sex (whether heterosexual or homosexual);&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt; and it increasingly began to be identified as the most heinous of sins by authorities of the Catholic Church. In Italy, [[Dominican order|Dominican]] monks would encourage the pious to "hunt out" sodomites and once done to hand them to the Inquisition to be dealt with accordingly: "These clerical discourses provided a language for secular authorities to condemn sodomy... By persecuting sodomites as well as heretics, the Church strengthened its authority and credibility as a moral arbiter".&lt;ref&gt;Anna Clark, ''Desire: A history of European Sexuality'', pp74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaits writes: "From the twelfth century on, outsiders came under increasing verbal and physical attack from churchmen, allied secular authorities, and, particularly in the case of Jews, from the lower strata of the population"; and among "outsiders" he considers Jews, heretics, homosexuals, and magicians as having been among the most important.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Klaits, ''Servants of Satan: The Age of Witch Hunts'', Indiana University Press, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-25335182-1}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Leo IX]] (d. 1054) labeled homosexuality "filthy", "execrable vice" and "obscene". Likewise around 1051, [[Saint Peter Damian]] wrote the ''[[Liber Gomorrhianus]]'' in which he argued for stricter ecclesiastical punishment for clerics guilty of "sins against nature".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/homo-damian1.asp Pierre J. Payer, ''Book of Gomorrah'' (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1982), p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PETRI DAMIANI Liber gomorrhianus , ad Leonem IX Rom.

The [[Council of London in 1102]] in 1102, called at the urging of English Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], explicitly denounced homosexual behavior as a sin for the first time at an English council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"&gt;Rictor Norton, ''My Dear Boy: Gay love letters through the centuries'', Leyland, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Anselm felt that sodomy was widespread and was not condemned strongly enough or regarded with the seriousness that it should have. Confessors were urged to take account of such ignorance when hearing confessions for sodomy, and to take into account mitigating factors such as age and marital status before prescribing penance; and counselling was generally preferred to punishment. In Canons 28 and 29 the Council decreed that the people should be informed of the gravity of the sin, and their obligation to confess (particularly if they derived pleasure from it). Nevertheless, Anselm deferred publication of the proceedings, arguing further time was needed to clarify certain matters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1998"/&gt; Boswell argues the decrees were never published at all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;dq=%22be+deprived+of+his+legal+status+and+dignity+in+the+whole+realm+of+England%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MKNBl9nWEk&amp;sig=sfKvq5cRA4il8QUXuU6lnA0VG3A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gKegUpWEAeey7Aad9YGYAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22be%20deprived%20of%20his%20legal%20status%20and%20dignity%20in%20the%20whole%20realm%20of%20England%22&amp;f=false James Neill, ''The Origins and Role of Same-sex Relations in Human Societies''] (McFarland 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-78645247-7}}), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372 James Neill, ''The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies''] (McFarland 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-78645247-7}}), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1179, [[Pope Alexander III]] presided over the [[Third Lateran Council]] in Rome which decreed (canon 11) that all those guilty of sodomy be removed from office or confined to penitential life in a monastery, if clergy; and be strictly excommunicated, if laity: "Let all who are found guilty of that unnatural vice for which the wrath of God came down upon the sons of disobedience and destroyed the five cities with fire, if they are clerics be expelled from the clergy or confined in monasteries to do penance; if they are laymen they are to incur excommunication and be completely separated from the society of the faithful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/LATERAN3.HTM|title=Under Pope Alexander|website=www.ewtn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French theologian [[Alain de Lille]] (d. 1202) echoed the punishment of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] in his works - complaining that "''such a great body of foul men roam and riot along the breadth of the whole earth''", spreading perversion and impurity with "monstrous acts" endangering the wider community.&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372 James Neill, ''The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies''] (McFarland 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-78645247-7}}), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the German Abbess [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (d.1179), in her book ''Scivias'' detailing her visions which she attributed to God, condemned same-sex intercourse (including lesbianism): "A man who sins with another man as if with a woman sins bitterly against God ... a woman who takes up devilish ways and plays a male role in coupling with another woman is most vile in My sight, and so is she who subjects herself to such a one in this evil deed".&lt;ref&gt;''Scivias'', translated by Columba Hart and Jane Bishop, 1990; p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon 14 of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 stated that if a priest suspended for unchastity of any kind — especially the vice that "on account of which the anger of God came from heaven upon the children of unbelief" (sodomy) — dared to celebrate Mass then he was to be deposed permanently from the priesthood.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"That the morals and general conduct of clerics may be better let all strive to live chastely and virtuously, particularly those in sacred orders, guarding against every vice of desire, especially, so that in the sight of Almighty God they may perform their duties with a pure heart and chaste body. But lest the facility to obtain pardon be an incentive to do wrong, we decree that whoever shall be found to indulge in the vice of incontinence, shall, in proportion to the gravity of his sin, be punished in accordance with the canonical statutes, which we command to be strictly and rigorously observed, so that he whom divine fear does not restrain from evil, may at least be withheld from sin by a temporal penalty. If therefore anyone suspended for this reason shall presume to celebrate the divine mysteries, let him not only be deprived of his ecclesiastical benefices but for this twofold offense let him be forever deposed."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|website=www.fordham.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 13th century (time of the Fourth Lateran Council) the Church determined that "secular authorities, as well as clergy, should be allowed to impose penalties on 'sodomites' for having had sexual relations", and by the end of this period, "Sodomites were now [regarded as] demons as well as sinners."&lt;ref&gt;William E. Burgwinkle, ''Sodomy, Masculinity and Law in Medieval Literature'', University of Cambridge, 2004, p32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Civil authorities were in parallel trying the crime of sodomy in their own courts, although in practice applying even more severe punishments (Roman civil law had prescribed death by burning for those found guilty of sodomy).&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt;

In 1232, [[Pope Gregory IX]] established the [[Roman Inquisition]] which investigated claims of sodomy - arguing that sodomites were "abominable persons despised by the world... more unclean than animals".&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372 James Neill, ''The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies''] (McFarland 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-78645247-7}}), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Thomas Aquinas===

In the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated that "the unnatural vice" is the greatest of the sins of lust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3154.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The parts of Lust (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 154)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', traditionally dated to 1264, he argued against what he called "the error of those who say that there is no more sin in the emission of the semen than in the ejection of other superfluous products from the body" by saying that, after murder, which destroys an existing human being, disordinate emission of semen to the preclusion of generating a human being seems to come second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/etext/gc3_122.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: GC 3.122|website=www2.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this, the German Dominican [[Albertus Magnus]] described  homosexuality as a "foulness" that was both addictive and contagious.&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372 James Neill, ''The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies''] (McFarland 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-78645247-7}}), p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1424, [[Bernardino of Siena]] preached for three days in Florence, Italy against homosexuality and other forms of lust, calling for sodomites to be ostracized, and these sermons alongside measures by other clergy of the time strengthened opinion against homosexuals and encouraged the authorities to increase the measures of persecution.&lt;ref&gt;R. Moore, The Formation of a Persecuting Society: Power and Deviance in Western Europe, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987, p138&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Inquisition and homosexuality===
In 1451, [[Pope Nicholas V]] enabled the Inquisition to prosecute men who practiced sodomy. Handed over to the civil authorities, those condemned were frequently burned in accordance with civil law.&lt;ref name=SBS&gt;"Bologna, parts of Portugal and other regions embracing Roman civic law prescribed death by fire for convicted sodomites" - [https://books.google.com/books?id=JpjBdA7iFokC&amp;pg=PT79 Kim M. Phillips, Barry Reay, ''Sex Before Sexuality: A Premodern History''] (John Wiley &amp; Sons 2013 {{ISBN|978-0-74563726-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1478, with the papal bull ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', [[Pope Sixtus IV]] acceded to the request of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], granting them exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The [[Spanish Inquisition]] thus replaced the [[Medieval Inquisition]] which had been set up under direct papal control, and transferred it in Spain to civil control. In 1482, in response to complaints by relatives of the first victims, Sixtus wrote that he had not intended his grant to be abused in that way. However, strong pressure brought to bear on him prevented him from revoking it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5B3S6zOCpIEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=P%C3%A9rez+%22acted+too+hastily%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rMSUUvTcKsqh7AaF0IGQAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=P%C3%A9rez%20%22acted%20too%20hastily%22&amp;f=false Joseph Pérez, ''The Spanish Inquisition''] (Profile Books 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-86197622-2}}), pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torquemada.jpg|thumb|[[Tomas de Torquemada]] was a prominent leader of the Spanish Inquisition. 150 sodomites were executed by burning in Spain from 1570–1630.]]
The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Spain was therefore under the control of its monarchs and the initial direction of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] friar [[Tomas de Torquemada]]. At first it seems to have been reluctant to take on responsibility for trying those accused of sodomy, and that the Suprema (the governing body) ruled in 1509 that such cases were for the secular courts, which already punished sodomy with death. However, in 1524 the Suprema requested papal authorisation to prosecute sodomites. [[Pope Clement VII]] granted permission but only within the Kingdom of Aragon and on condition that trials be conducted according to the civil laws, not the standard inquisitorial procedure.&lt;ref name="HaggertyGeorge"&gt;Haggerty, George E.

Within Aragon and its dependent territories, the number of individuals that the Spanish Inquisition tried for sodomy,&lt;ref name="HaggertyGeorge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt; between 1570 and 1630 was over 800&lt;ref&gt;Anna Clark, ''Desire: A history of European Sexuality'', p83&lt;/ref&gt; or nearly a thousand.&lt;ref name="HaggertyGeorge"/&gt; In Spain, those whom the Spanish Inquisition convicted and had executed "by burning without the benefit of strangulation" were about 150.&lt;ref&gt;Diarmuid MacCulloch, ''Reformation:Europe's House Divided'', Penguin, 2004, p623&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition was harsh to sodomizers (more so for those committing bestiality than homosexuality), but tended to restrict death by burning only to those aged over twenty-five. Minors were normally whipped and sent to the galleys. Mildness was also shown to clergy, who were always a high proportion of those arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kamen, ''The Spanish Inquisition: An historical revision'', p152&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, conviction and execution for sodomy was easier to obtain from the civil courts in other parts of Spain than from the tribunals of the Inquisition in Aragon, and there executions for sodomy were much more numerous.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ROnDOB-HHVIC&amp;pg=PA93 E.

The Portuguese Inquisition was established in 1536; and in 1539 [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry]], Archbishop of Braga (later cardinal and king of Portugal) became Grand Inquisitor. (An earlier appointment as Portuguese Grand Inquisitor was Friar Diogo da Silva.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFvIGilXkVQC&amp;pg=PA24 Charles Ralph Boxer, ''João de Barros, Portuguese Humanist and Historian of Asia''] (Concept Publishing Company, 1981), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It received 4,419 denunciations against individuals accused of sodomy, of whom 447 were subjected to a formal trial, and thirty were burnt at the stake, in accordance with the pre-1536 civil laws enacted under Kings [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] and [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], and many others were sent to the galleys or to exile, temporary or permanent.&lt;ref name="HaggertyGeorge"/&gt;

In England, the accused were originally tried by church courts, which almost never punished homosexual behaviour.&lt;ref name=SBS/&gt; This changed when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], while still a member of the Roman Catholic Church, enacted the [[Buggery Act 1533]], as part of his campaign to break the power of the Catholic Church in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedrummersrevenge.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/reflections-on-bna-part-6-british-law/|title=Reflections on BNA, part 6: British Law|first=Hamish|last=Copley|date=25 July 2007|work=The Drummer's Revenge|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Council of Trent===

Although homosexuality was not directly discussed at the [[Council of Trent]], it did commission the drawing up of a [[Catechism of the Council of Trent|catechism]] (following the successful lead of some Protestants) which stated: "Neither fornicators nor adulterers, nor the effeminate nor sodomites shall possess the kingdom of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/romancat.html Council of Trent: Catechism for Parish Priests] (electronic easily searchable one-page edition; for a printed book, see [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Trent+%22Neither+fornicators+nor+adulterers%2C+nor+the+effeminate+nor+sodomites+shall+possess+the+kingdom+of+God.%22#hl=en&amp;q=Trent+%22nor+the+effeminate+nor+sodomites+shall+possess+the+kingdom+of+God.%22&amp;tbm=bks ''Catechism of the Council of Trent'', J.

==Modern Age==

===Vatican Councils===

Neither the [[First Vatican Council]] nor the [[Second Vatican Council]] directly discussed the issue of homosexuality; but nor did they alter the judgement of earlier councils. However, homosexual activity was frequently referred to in general church documents as ''crimen pessimum'' (the worst crime).&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=75670|title=Henry VIII: September 1535, 26-30 - British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/compendiumtheolo00gabr#page/264/mode/2up/search/%22crimen+pessimum%22 Gabriel de Varceno, ''Compendium theologiae moralis" (Marietti, Turin 1873), p. 264]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=izRAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22+theologia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCOsU4DcB6_Q7AbegYHYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%20theologia&amp;f=false Maurus Hagel, ''Demonstratio Religionis Christianae Catholicae'' (Vienna, 1831), p. 52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For instance in documents of [https://books.google.com/books?id=6FTcpQXsQRMC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=83tyUsKXHsa47QbKx4HwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false 1390], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kONiZS-QJp4C&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qnhyUu-AG6yI7Abt_4DgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false 1525], [https://books.google.com/books?id=0borAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qnhyUu-AG6yI7Abt_4DgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false 1591], [https://books.google.com/books?id=GSVUNxerfbYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA112&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=83tyUsKXHsa47QbKx4HwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false 1622], [https://books.google.com/books?id=fnLQ4hmhYOsC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qnhyUu-AG6yI7Abt_4DgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false 1851]&lt;/ref&gt; including that codified in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYkUAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=83tyUsKXHsa47QbKx4HwCg&amp;redir_esc=y Theological Studies, vol. 9 (1948), p. 630]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=oPnP4edaOrUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=83tyUsKXHsa47QbKx4HwCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false Document of the Holy Office in 1962]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=kg69-0OfqSkC&amp;pg=PA308&amp;dq=%22crimen+pessimum%22%7C&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VH9yUtivKM6d7gbOsICACA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crimen%20pessimum%22%7C&amp;f=false ''Periodica'' 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-day popes===

====Pope Paul VI====

In 1976 [[Pope Paul VI]] became the first pontiff in modern history to deny the accusation of [[Homosexuality and Catholicism|homosexuality]]. In January 1976, he had published a homily, ''Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions concerning Sexual Ethics'', that outlawed pre or extra-marital sex, condemned homosexuality, and forbade masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Christopher Hitchens on the death of Pope Paul VI |work=New Statesman |date=28 February 2013 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/religion/2013/02/christopher-hitchens-death-pope-paul-vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Roger Peyrefitte]], who had already written in two of his books that Montini had a longtime homosexual relationship, repeated his charges in a magazine interview with a French gay magazine that, when reprinted in Italian, brought the rumors to a wider public and caused an uproar. He said that Montini was a hypocrite who had a longtime sexual relationship with a movie actor.&lt;ref&gt;Peyrefitte, Roger ''Mea culpa?

In a brief address to a crowd of approximately 20,000 in St. Peters Square on 18 April, Montini called the charges "horrible and slanderous insinuations" and appealed for prayers on his behalf. Special prayers for Montini were said in all Italian Roman Catholic churches in "a day of consolation".&lt;ref name="Observer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Posner" /&gt;{{efn|In 1984, [[Paul Hofmann]], a former correspondent for the ''[[New York Times]]'', repeated the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffman |first= Paul | title=Oh Vatican!

In 1994, Franco Bellegrandi, a former Vatican honour chamberlain and correspondent for the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', alleged that Montini had been blackmailed and had promoted fellow homosexuals to positions of power within the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellegrandi |first= Franco |title=Nichita Roncalli - Controvita di un Papa| location= Rome |publisher= Editizioni Internazionale di Letterature e Scienze | date= 1994 |pages= 85–86, 91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the newspaper ''L'Espresso''  confirmed the blackmail story based on the private papers of police commander General Giorgio Manes.

====Pope John Paul II====
[[File:Pope John Paul II (1979).jpg|thumb|left|Pope John Paul II in Old Yankee Stadium, 1979]]

Homosexuality received no mention in papal [[encyclicals]] until [[Pope John Paul II]]'s ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'' of 1993, which "specifically proclaims the intrinsic evil of the homosexual condition"&lt;ref&gt;John L. Allen, Benedict XVI: A Biography, Continuum, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected the view of some theologians who questioned the basis upon which the church condemns as morally unacceptable "direct sterilization, autoeroticism, pre-marital sexual relations, homosexual relations and artificial insemination".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html Encyclical ''Veritatis splendor'', 47]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] has written that the pontificate of John Paul II increasingly saw sexual morality as a paramount concern, and homosexuality, alongside [[contraception]], divorce and illicit unions, as a dimension of "the 'culture of death' against which he taught and preached with increasing vehemence".&lt;ref name="cornwell-winter"&gt;John Cornwell, ''The Pope in Winter'', Viking 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In John Paul II's teaching, homosexual intercourse is regarded as an utilization of another's body, not a mutual self-giving in familial love, physically expressed by the masculine and feminine bodies; and such intercourse is also performed by a choice of the will, unlike homosexual orientation, which he acknowledged is usually not a matter of free choice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jjGwZ_38gSAC&amp;pg=PA178 Charles E. Curran, Richard A. McCormick (editors), ''John Paul II and Moral Theology''] (Paulist Press 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-80913797-8}}), p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 1979, John Paul praised the bishops of the United States for stating that "homosexual activity ... as distinguished from homosexual orientation, is morally wrong". He said that, instead of "[holding] out false hope" to homosexuals facing hard moral problems, they had upheld "the true dignity, the true human dignity, of those who look to Christ's Church for the guidance which comes from the light of God's word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1979/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19791005_chicago-usa-bishops_en.html|title=To Bishops of the United States of America (October 5, 1979) - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he criticized the inaugural [[WorldPride]] event scheduled for Rome in that year as "an affront to the [[Great Jubilee]] of the year 2000" and as "an offence to the Christian values" of Rome, and recalled the Church's teaching that homosexual acts are contrary to the natural law, while every sign of unjust discrimination against homosexuals should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/angelus/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_ang_20000709_en.html|title=Angelus, 9 July 2000 - John Paul II|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/10/world/pope-declares-his-bitterness-over-gay-event.html Alessandra Stanley, "Pope Declares His 'Bitterness' Over Gay Event", ''New York Times'', 10 July 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=83223&amp;page=1|title=Pope Rips Gay Parade|first=A.

In response, the Dutch gay magazine, ''Gay Krant'', and its readership initiated a case against the pope in the Dutch law courts, arguing that his comment that homosexual acts are contrary to the laws of nature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/dutch-dismiss-case-against-homophobic-pope-1.43699#.U-25sGOumSo "Dutch dismiss case against homophobic pope"] (IOL News, quoting [[Agence France Presse]])&lt;/ref&gt; "give rise to hatred against, and discrimination of certain groups of people" in violation of Dutch law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectator.org/articles/51781/diabolizing-pontiff George Neumayr, "Diabolizing the Pontiff" in ''The American Spectator'', 23 May 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; This came to end when the court ruled that he was immune from prosecution as a head of state (the Vatican).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JxcbOmGsM6kC&amp;pg=PA64 Matthew D.

In his last personal work, ''[[Memory and Identity]]'', published in 2005, John Paul II he referred to the "pressures" on the [[European Parliament]] to permit "homosexual 'marriage'". He wrote: "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jrvwOMLL4DUC&amp;pg=PA1-IA3 John Paul II, ''Memory and Identity''] (Hachette UK 2012) {{ISBN|978-1-78022569-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=afw-tLWOuuUC&amp;pg=PA57 Ailbe O'Reilly, ''Conjugal Chastity in Pope Wojtyla''] (Peter Lang 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-43310611-8}}), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benedict XVI====

On 9 March 2012, Pope [[Benedict XVI]], denouncing "the powerful political and cultural currents seeking to alter the legal definition of marriage", currents that the ''Washington Post'' described as a "cultural shift toward gay marriage in U.S.", told a group of United States bishops on their ''[[ad limina]]'' visit to Rome that "the Church's conscientious effort to resist this pressure calls for a reasoned defense of marriage as a natural institution consisting of a specific communion of persons, essentially rooted in the complementarity of the sexes and oriented to procreation. Sexual differences cannot be dismissed as irrelevant to the definition of marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/pope-benedict-xvi-denounces-cultural-shift-toward-gay-marriage-in-us/2012/03/09/gIQAs6bh1R_story.html|title=Pope Benedict XVI denounces cultural shift toward gay marriage in U.S.|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20120309_us-bishops_en.html Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Bishops of the United States of America from Region VIII on their ''ad limina'' visit]&lt;/ref&gt;

An essay by the French Chief Rabbi [[Gilles Bernheim]] taking a clear position against gay marriage and denouncing the theory of acquired gender was quoted at length by Pope Benedict XVI in his 2012 Christmas address to the Roman Curia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2012/12/21/97001-20121221FILWWW00363-benoit-xvi-dans-la-lutte-pour-la-famille-l-homme-est-en-jeu.php|title=Benoît XVI: "Dans la lutte pour la famille, l'Homme est en jeu"|work=Le Figaro|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20121221_auguri-curia_en.html|title= Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI on the occasion of Christmas greetings to the Roman Curia|work=Clementine Hall, Vatican City|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC reported that shortly before the resignation of Pope [[Benedict XVI]] in February 2013, the Italian media in particular used unsourced reports to suggest that there was a "gay lobby" of clergy inside the Vatican who had been collaborating to advance personal interests, thereby opening the Holy See to potential blackmail, and even to suggest that this may have been one of the factors influencing Benedict's decision to resign.&lt;ref name="bbcrumours"/&gt;

====Francis====
{{main|Pope Francis and homosexuality}}
[[Pope Francis]] has repeatedly spoke about the need for the church to welcome and love all people, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Speaking about gay people in 2013, he said that "the key is for the church to welcome, not exclude and show mercy, not condemnation."&lt;ref name=latino/&gt; In July of that year, he said "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?" "The problem," he said, "is not having this orientation. We must be brothers."&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;  

Several LGBT groups welcomed the comments, noting that this was the first time a pope had used the word "gay" in public, and had also accepted the existence of gay people as a recognizable part of the Catholic Church community.&lt;ref name=McGarry/&gt; The Pope's attitude towards homosexuality earned him a place on the cover of the US gay news magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;  In October 2016, Francis said that "When a person (who is gay) arrives before Jesus, Jesus certainly will not say, 'Go away because you are homosexual'".&lt;ref name=embraced/&gt;

Francis has also spoken of the importance of education in the context of the difficulties now facing children, indicating that the Church had a challenge in not being welcoming enough of children brought up in a multiplicity of household arrangements, specifically including the children of gay couples.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;  Francis presided over the [[Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|2014 Synod on the Family]], where the working document called for less judgment towards people that are gay and more understanding towards same-sex couples in civil unions or marriages, as well as an equal welcome for children of such couples (including conferring baptism), while still rejecting the validity of same-sex marriage itself.&lt;ref name=judgemental/&gt;&lt;ref name=softens/&gt;   

In the post-synodal [[apostolic exhortation]]  ''[[Amoris Laetitia]]'', issued in 2016, Francis encouraged better understanding from all members of the Church on the acceptance of gay people, without suggesting any specific doctrinal changes. He reiterated the need for every person to be respected regardless of their sexual orientation, and to be free from threats of aggression and violence.&lt;ref name=eagerly/&gt; During [[Pope Francis's visit to Ireland]] in August 2018 he built on this theme.  The pontiff made clear that gay people had always been present throughout human history, and that it was essential for parents to remember that gay children remained part of the families and it was important for them to engage positively. In an accompanying press statement, he made clear that homosexuality should not be viewed by Catholics as an illness.&lt;ref&gt;"Pope Francis: gay kids' parents shouldn't condemn them", 27 August, in ''Sydney Morning Herald'': https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/pope-francis-gay-kids-parents-shouldn-t-condemn-them-20180827-p4zzyd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of pro-gay movements within the Church===

====1960s====

[[DignityUSA]] was founded in the United States in 1969 as the first group for gay and lesbian Catholics shortly after the [[Stonewall riots]]. It developed from the ministry of Father Patrick Xavier Nidorf, an Augustinian priest. It set out the belief that gay Catholics can "express our sexuality physically, in a unitive manner that is loving, life-giving, and life-affirming."&lt;ref name=Statement/&gt; It also seeks to "work for the development of sexual theology leading to the reform of [the Church's] teachings and practices regarding human sexuality, and for the acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender peoples as full and equal members of the one Christ."&lt;ref name=Statement/&gt;   Meetings were initially held in [[San Diego]] and [[Los Angeles]], before the organization ultimately became headquartered in [[Boston]]. It later spread to [[Canada]].

====1970s====

Following the US Bishops’ 1976 Call To Action conference in [[Detroit]], a group called [[Call to Action]] (CTA) was established to advocate a variety of changes in the [[Catholic Church]], including in the church's teaching on [[Human sexual behavior|sexual matters]] such as homosexuality. In addition to the US bishops' conference, it drew its mission from the [[Second Vatican Council]], and in particular to its challenge to lay Catholics who had tended to defer initiatives entirely to the clergy.&lt;ref name=Mission/&gt; 

[[New Ways Ministry]] was set up in 1977 in the United States of America by the [[Salvatorian]] priest Robert Nugent and the School Sister of Notre Dame nun [[Jeannine Gramick]].&lt;ref name=ja181/&gt; This was in response to Bishop [[Francis Mugavero]] of Brooklyn who had invited them to reach out in "new ways" to lesbian and gay Catholics. As early as February 1976, Mugavero issued a pastoral letter entitled "Sexuality: God's Gift," defending the legitimate rights of all people, including those who were gay and lesbian. He said that they had been "subject to misunderstanding and at times unjust discrimination."&lt;!-- REFERENCE WAS NEVER DEFINED - NEEDS A FULL CITATION&lt;ref name=Integrity/&gt;--&gt;  In addition to gay and lesbian Catholics, the letter also spoke to the widowed, adolescents, the divorced, and those having sexual relations outside of marriage, stating: "we pledge our willingness to help you ...to try to find new ways to communicate the truth of Christ because we believe it will make you free."&lt;!-- REFERENCE WAS NEVER DEFINED - NEEDS A FULL CITATION&lt;ref name=Mugavero/&gt;--&gt;  These sentiments inspired the pastoral efforts by the co-founders to build bridges between differing constituencies in Catholicism.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

====1980s====

In 1980, the Association of Priests in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] honored the Chicago branch of Dignity as the organization of the year. With the publication in 1987 of "[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]]," which instructed bishops not to provide facilities for organizations that did not uphold official Catholic teaching on homosexuality, Catholic bishops in Atlanta, Buffalo, Brooklyn, Pensacola and Vancouver immediately excluded Dignity chapters, and "within a few months the organization was unwelcome on church property anywhere."&lt;!-- REFERENCE WAS NEVER DEFINED - NEEDS A FULL CITATION&lt;ref name="allen-benedict"/&gt;--&gt;

In 1981, New Ways Ministry held its first national symposium on homosexuality and the Catholic Church, but Archbishop [[James Aloysius Hickey|James Hickey]] of Washington, D.C. wrote to Catholic bishops and communities, asking them not to support the event. Despite this, more than fifty Catholic groups endorsed the program.&lt;!-- REFERENCE WAS NEVER DEFINED - NEEDS A FULL CITATION&lt;ref name="allen-benedict"/&gt;--&gt;

====1990s====

In 1996, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lincoln|bishop of Lincoln]], [[Fabian Bruskewitz]], [[excommunication|excommunicated]] all members of Call to Action within his diocese. An appeal by the Nebraska Chapter was rejected by the [[Congregation for Bishops]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=confirms/&gt;&lt;ref name=cta/&gt;

The [[Rainbow Sash Movement]] was established in [[Melbourne]], Australia in 1998. It has been most active in the United States, England, and Australia. The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow colored fabric which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|mass]]. At the appropriate time, members go up to receive the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name=rainbow/&gt; If denied, they go back to pews and remain standing,&lt;!-- REFERENCE WAS NEVER DEFINED - NEEDS A FULL CITATION&lt;ref name="alliance" /&gt;--&gt; but if the Eucharist is received then they go back to the pew and kneel in the traditional way.&lt;ref name=cpcsm/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh/&gt; Cardinal [[Francis Arinze]], Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, said that members of the Rainbow Sash Movement disqualified themselves from Communion by making reception of it a display of opposition to the Church's teaching.&lt;ref name=Thavis/&gt;  The [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], a sign of unity,&lt;ref name=acbc/&gt; can be denied when receiving it would be seen as an act of division or protest.&lt;ref name=Thavis/&gt;

Both Nugent and Grammick of New Ways Ministry were formally disciplined in 1999 when the Vatican imposed lifetime bans on any pastoral work involving gay people, declaring that the positions they advanced "do not faithfully convey the clear and constant teaching of the Catholic Church" and "have caused confusion among the Catholic people."&lt;ref name=Notification/&gt; The move made Nugent and Gramick "folk heroes in liberal circles," where official teaching was seen as outdated and lacking compassion.&lt;ref name=ja181/&gt; Similarly, the American bishops [[Thomas Gumbleton]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Detroit]] and Matthew Clark of [[Rochester, New York]] were criticized for their association with New Ways Ministry, and their distortion of the theological concept of the "Primacy of Conscience" as an alternative to the actual teaching of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=lead/&gt;

====2000s====

In 2013, members of the Rainbow Sash Movement in Illinois planned to hold a prayer service in a cathedral for legalization of same-sex marriage, an initiative that Bishop Paprocki of Springfield called blasphemous.&lt;ref name=bans/&gt;&lt;ref name=blocks/&gt;

In 2010 the [[U.S. Department of State]] reported that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Eritrea]] is a source country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and, to a lesser extent, forced prostitution. During the reporting period, acts of forced labor occurred in Eritrea, particularly in connection with the implementation of the country's national service program. Under the parameters set forth in Proclamation of National Service (No. 82/1995), men aged 18 to 54 and women aged 18 to 47 are required to provide 18 months of military and non-military public works and services in any location or capacity chosen by the government....

Eritrean children work in various economic sectors, including domestic service, street vending, small-scale factories, and agriculture; child laborers frequently suffer abuse from their employers and some may be subjected to conditions of forced labor. Some children in prostitution are likely exploited through third party involvement....

Each year, large numbers of Eritrean workers migrate in search of work, particularly to the Gulf States and Egypt, where some become victims of forced labor, primarily in domestic servitude. Smaller numbers are subjected to forced prostitution. In 2009, for example, five Eritrean trafficking victims were identified in the United Kingdom and one in Israel. In addition, thousands of Eritreans flee the country illegally, mostly to Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya, where their illegal status makes them vulnerable to situations of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Eritrea". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. U.S. Department of State (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In late 2013, the [[BBC]] reported the results of a study by activist Ms. Meron Estefanos and Dutch educators from [[Tilburg University]]. Among its conclusions: up to 30,000 Eritreans have been abducted since 2007&amp;mdash;mostly refugees fleeing the country&amp;mdash;and taken to Egypt's Sinai.   At least $600m (£366m) in [[ransom|ransom payments]] has been extorted.&lt;ref name=BBC12-4-13&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Eritreans 'abducted to Sinai for ransom'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25222336|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=Dec 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nesru Jamal of ERTA said that the report, entitled "The Human Trafficking Cycle: Sinai and Beyond" was presented to EU home Affairs Commissioner Cecilia Malmström in the [[European Parliament]] on Dec. 4, 2013. Jamal says the report accuses Eritrea's Border Surveillance Unit (commanded by General [[Tekle Kiflay]]) of being central to the trafficking.&lt;ref name=NJemal12-04-13&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea: Report - Eritrea's Military Involved in Trafficking Country's Children|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201312050086.html|publisher=Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency / AllAfrica.com|accessdate=5 December 2013|author=Nesru Jemal|date=Dec 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years many abductions, blamed on [[Rashaida people|Rashayida Bedouin]], happened along the Sudan border. Physicians for [[Human rights|Human Rights]]-Israel estimates that, between 2008 and 2012, as many as 4,000 refugees died.&lt;ref name=DCon10-9-13&gt;{{cite news|last=Connell|first=Dan|title=The Rerouted Trafficking in Eritrean Refugees|url=http://www.asmarino.com/articles/1879-the-rerouted-trafficking-in-eritrean-refugees|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Asmarino Independent|date=9 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 3"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The human rights record of Eritrea is considered poor.&lt;ref name="US STATE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2011humanrightsreport/index.htm?dynamic_load_id=186194#wrapper|publisher=US State Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/18/eritre12307.htm Eritrea Human Rights Overview] Human Rights Watch&lt;/ref&gt; Since Eritrea's conflict with [[Ethiopia]] in 1998–2001, Eritrea's human rights record has worsened.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Eritrea's human rights record comes under fire at United Nations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/25/eritrea-human-rights-united-nations|accessdate=30 October 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several [[Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War|human rights violations]] are committed by the government or on behalf of the government. [[Freedom of speech]], [[News media|press]], [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[Interpersonal relationship|association]] are limited. Those that practise "unregistered" religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into [[prison]].&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;  Domestic and international human rights organizations are not allowed to function in Eritrea.&lt;ref name="US STATE" /&gt; In 2009 Human Rights Watch said that the government was turning the country into a 'giant prison'.&lt;ref name="BBCTimeline 6-13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eritrea profile: A chronology of key events|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13349395|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 December 2013|date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All denominations of Christianity enjoyed freedom of worship until 2002 when the government outlawed worship and assembly outside the 'registered' denominations. All groups who [[house church|worship secretly in a house]] or any other unregistered place of [[right to assemble|assembly]] are arrested and imprisoned without charge or trial. Religious prisoners are often tortured in Eritrea.&lt;ref name="CSW"&gt;[http://www.cswusa.org/news/eritrea CSW-USA on Eritrea] CSW&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country. There are thousands of Eritrean [[refugees]] in Ethiopia and Sudan seeking asylum in Europe or another region of the West.&lt;ref name="hrw"/&gt; Eritrea is a [[one-party state]] in which national legislative elections have been repeatedly postponed.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080724164739/http://www.grassrootsonline.org/what-we-do/partnerships/where-we-work/eritrea Eritrea]. Grassroots International&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
U.S. Department of State, 2010:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 605 of the Eritrean Transitional Criminal Code prohibits trafficking in women and young persons for sexual exploitation, which is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment, or from three to 10 years' imprisonment if aggravating circumstances are present; these penalties are not commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Article 565 prohibits enslavement and prescribes punishment of five to 20 years' imprisonment, penalties which are sufficiently stringent. Forced labor and slavery are prohibited, except where authorized by law under Article 16 of the ratified, but suspended, Eritrean Constitution. Proclamation 11/199 prohibits the recruitment of children under 18 years of age into the armed forces. Nevertheless, the government has never used these statutes to prosecute cases of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Protection==
U.S. Department of State, 2010:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The government did not appear to provide any significant assistance to victims of trafficking during the reporting period. During the reporting period, the government reportedly operated a program to identify children involved in commercial sexual exploitation and reintegrate them with their families. The government did not make available information on the program's accomplishments in 2009. The Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare oversees the government's trafficking portfolio, but individual cases of transnational human trafficking are reportedly handled by the Eritrean embassy in the country of destination; information regarding embassy efforts to assist trafficking victims was not provided. The government has no known facilities dedicated to trafficking victims and does not provide funding or other forms of support to NGOs for services to trafficking victims.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Prevention==
U.S. Department of State, 2010:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The government made no known efforts to prevent future incidences of trafficking during the reporting period. Eritrean media, all state-owned, made neither public announcements nor media presentations regarding human trafficking during the reporting period. There were no anti-trafficking education campaigns. The government reportedly warned students at Sawa military school and Mai Nefi, a local college, of the dangers of leaving the country, including the prospects of being sold into slave labor or sexual servitude. Although the government does not publicly acknowledge human trafficking as a problem, an office exists within the Ministry of Labor to handle labor cases, including human trafficking; the accomplishments of this office during 2009 are unknown.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Icelandic Order of Freemasons''' ({{lang-is|Frímúrarareglan á Íslandi}}) ([[abbreviation|abbr.]]: '''FaI'''), in English also known as '''the Grand Lodge of Iceland''', is the governing body of [[Regular Masonic jurisdiction|regular]] [[Freemasonry in Iceland]].

The history of [[Freemasonry]] in [[Iceland]] began when a "society of brothers“, Edda, was established in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik in 1913. Edda became a lodge of instruction in 1918. The following year, on January 6, 1919, it became a fully warranted lodge.&lt;ref name=edda&gt;http://www.masonrytoday.com/index.php?new_month=2&amp;new_day=27&amp;new_year=2015&lt;/ref&gt;. Since 1919, there have been a total of twelve warranted lodges and six lodges of instruction established in Iceland. Membership in the Order was at 3,379 as of March 15, 2011&lt;ref&gt;https://frimurarareglan.is/english/&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelandic Freemasonry was under the jurisdiction of the [[Danish Order of Freemasons]] ({{lang-da|Den Danske Frimurerorden}}) until 1951 when the Grandlodge of Denmark constituted the Grand Lodge of Iceland as a sovereign Order.&lt;ref&gt;https://methvenlodge51.org/methven/international-visiting/iceland-grand-lodge/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Page About Masonry, News &amp; Notes: Iceland |url=http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/masonry/Reports/icel.html |website=web.mit.edu |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Icelandic Freemasonry operates according to the [[Swedish Rite]] which is the dominant system in [[Scandinavia]]. Unlike other forms of Freemasonry, the Swedish Rite consists of eleven degrees, all of which are recognized by regular Freemasonry. As part of the Swedish Rite, the Icelandic Order of Freemasons requires its members to profess a belief in Christianity. The Order additionally requires its members to be over the age of twenty-one, to have a clean criminal record, and to have received the sponsorship of at least two members of the Order.

There are 17 lodges in Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iceland - The Methven Lodge No. 51 |url=https://methvenlodge51.org/methven/international-visiting/iceland-grand-lodge/ |website=The Methven Lodge No. 51 |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grand Lodge of Iceland at masonic lodge info - 117 |url=http://www.masonic-lodge.info/MLI/mli117.htm |website=www.masonic-lodge.info |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northern Aslian languages''' (formerly called '''Jehaic''' or '''Semang''') are a group of [[Aslian languages]] spoken by about 5,000 people in inland areas of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], with a few pockets in southern [[Thailand]]. The most distinctive language in the group is the outlier [[Cheq Wong language|Cheq Wong]], which is spoken south of the Central Aslian language [[Semai language|Semai]]. The other languages apart from [[Tonga language (Thailand)|Tonga]] can be split into two divisions:

*[[Cheq Wong language|Cheq Wong]]
*Northern Aslian proper
**Eastern
***[[Batek language|Batek]] (Batek Deq and Batek Nong), [[Mintil language|Mintil]] (Batek Tanɨm)
***[[Jahai language|Jahai]] (Jehai), [[Minriq language|Minriq]] (Menriq)
***[[Jedek language|Jedek]]
**Western
***[[Kintaq language|Kintaq]]
***[[Kensiu language|Kensiu]] (Maniq)

(unclassified) [[Ten'edn]] (Mos, Maniq)

The name Maniq (Məniʔ, Maniʔ) can refer to either Kensiu or Tonga, both of which also go by the name of Mos.

Some Aslian languages are already extinct, such as [[Wila' language|Wila']] (also called Bila' or Lowland Semang), a language or various languages recorded having been spoken on the [[Province Wellesley]] coast opposite [[Penang]] in the early 19th century. Another extinct language is Ple-Temer, which was previously spoken near [[Gerik]] in northern [[Perak]] (Benjamin 2011).

The '''kodjabashis''' ({{lang-el|κοτζαμπάσηδες|kotzabasides}}; singular κοτζάμπασης, ''kotzabasis''; {{lang-sh|kodžobaša, kodžabaša}}; from {{lang-tr|kocabaṣı, hocabaṣı}}) were local Christian notables in parts of the [[Ottoman Balkans]], most often referring to [[Ottoman Greece]]{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=273}}{{sfn|Zakythenos|1976|p=}} and especially the [[Peloponnese]]. They were also known in Greek as ''proestoi'' or ''prokritoi'' (προεστοί/πρόκριτοι, "primates") or ''demogerontes'' (δημογέροντες, "elders of the people"). In some places they were elected (such in the islands for example), but, especially in the Peloponnese, they soon became a hereditary [[oligarchy]], who exercised considerable influence and held posts in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration.{{sfn|Stavrianos|2000|p=273}}

During the [[Greek War of Independence]], the antagonism between the Peloponnesian kodjabashis, who sought to retain their previous preponderance and power, and the military leaders drawn from the [[klephts]], was one of the main driving forces behind the outbreak of the [[Greek civil wars of 1824–1825]], in which the "aristocratic" faction comprising the kodjabashis, the wealthy shipowners of [[Hydra Island|Hydra]] and the [[Phanariotes]], prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A Concise History of Greece | edition=Revised | first = Richard | last = Clogg | authorlink = Richard Clogg | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0521004799 | pages =35ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legal terms, [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII of England]] had only three wives, because three of his putative marriages were annulled. Unlike a divorce, where a married couple chooses to end their union, [[annulment|annulments]] essentially declare that a true marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11358279/Henry-VIII-didnt-really-have-six-wives-why-everything-you-know-about-the-Tudors-is-wrong.html|title=Did Henry VIII really have six wives?

==Overview==
The six women who were married to Henry VIII were, in chronological order:

{| class="wikitable" 
|- 
! No. !! Name !! Married from - through !! Fate of marriage !! Fate of wife and issue 
|- 
| 1 || [[Catherine of Aragon]] || 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 || Annulled || Died 7 January 1536 while detained in [[Kimbolton Castle]].&lt;br&gt;Mother of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Carolly |title=Great Harry: A Biography of Henry the VII |date=2007 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |isbn=0-312-16858-6 |page=48 |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Henry's first marriage lasted nearly 24 years; the five that followed less than 10 years combined.

A common [[mnemonic device]] to remember the fates of Henry's consorts is "Divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived". There are also two rhymes:{{cn|date=June 2017}}{{year needed|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;King Henry VIII,
To six wives he was wedded.
One died, one survived,
Two divorced, two beheaded.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

and

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Boleyn and Howard lost their heads,
Anne of Cleves he would not bed,
Jane Seymour gave him a son – but died before the week was done,
Aragon he did divorce,
Which just left Catherine Parr, of course!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

It is often noted that [[Catherine Parr]] "survived him." In fact, [[Anne of Cleves]] also survived the king, and was the last of his queens to die. Of the six queens, [[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]], [[Anne Boleyn]], and [[Jane Seymour]] each gave Henry one child who survived infancy: two daughters and one son. All three of these children would eventually ascend to the throne: [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].

Catherine Howard and Anne Boleyn, the two of Henry's queens who were beheaded, were first cousins. Several of Henry's wives worked in at least one of his other wives' service, typically as [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]: Anne Boleyn worked in Catherine of Aragon's service, Jane Seymour worked in Catherine of Aragon's and Anne Boleyn's, and Catherine Howard worked in Anne of Cleves's.

Henry and at least four of his wives (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, and Catherine Parr) were portrayed in [[List of historical opera characters|opera]].

[[Catherine of Aragon|Katherine of Aragon]] (16 December 1485{{spaced ndash}}7 January 1536; {{lang-es|link=no|Catalina de Aragón}}) was Henry's first wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although her name is sometimes spelled ''Catherine'', Katherine of Aragon spelled and signed her name with a "K," which was the accepted spelling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_of_Aragon#Spelling_of_her_name|title=Catherine of Aragon|last=Wikipedia|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{circular inline|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|last=Davies|first=C.S.L.|last2=Edwards|first2=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=England|pages=|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891|chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-4891|doi-access=Free|chapter=Katherine [Catalina, Catherine, Katherine of Aragon] (1485-1536)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]], her first husband and Henry's brother, a [[papal dispensation]] was obtained to enable her to marry Henry, though the marriage did not take place until after he came to the throne in 1509. Prospects were looking good when Katherine became pregnant in 1510, just 4 months after their marriage, but the girl was stillborn. Katherine became pregnant again in 1511, and gave birth to a boy, [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall]], who died almost two months later. In 1513, Katherine gave birth to a stillborn boy, and gave birth to a boy who died within hours in 1515. Finally, Katherine bore him a healthy daughter in 1516, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. It took her two years to conceive again. This pregnancy ended in a short-lived girl. It is said that Henry truly loved Katherine of Aragon, as he himself professed it many times in declarations, etc.

Henry, at the time a Roman Catholic, sought the Pope's approval for an [[annulment]] on the grounds that his marriage was invalid because Katherine had first been his brother's wife, using a passage from the Old Testament (Leviticus Chapter 20 Verse 21) to justify his stance: "If a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an impurity; he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.” 
Henry had begun an affair with [[Anne Boleyn]], who is said{{by whom|date=July 2016}} to have refused to become his mistress (Henry had already consummated an affair then dismissed Anne's sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], and most historians believe that Anne wanted to avoid the same treatment){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. Despite the pope's refusal, Henry separated from Katherine in 1531. In the face of the Pope's continuing refusal to annul his marriage to Katherine, Henry ordered the highest church official in England, [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to convene a court to rule on the status of his marriage to Katherine. On 23 May 1533,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacey Baldwin Smith, Henry VIII: The Mask of Royalty, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cranmer ruled the marriage to Katherine null and void. On 28 May 1533, he pronounced the King legally married to Anne (with whom Henry had already secretly exchanged wedding vows, probably in late January 1533). This led to the break from the Roman Catholic Church and the later establishment of the [[Church of England]].
 
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] called Katherine "The Queen of Earthly Queens."

Marriage to Henry VIII: 11 June 1509 – 23 May 1533 (23 years, 11 months, 19 days); marriage annulled.

[[Anne Boleyn]] (c.1501/1507{{spaced ndash}}19 May 1536) was Henry's second wife and the mother of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. Henry's marriage to Anne, and her subsequent execution, made her a key figure in the political and religious upheaval that was the start of the [[English Reformation]]. The daughter of Sir [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|Thomas Boleyn]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Lady Elizabeth Boleyn]] (born Lady Elizabeth Howard), Anne was of nobler birth than [[Jane Seymour]], Henry's later wife. She was dark-haired, with beautiful features and lively manners; she was educated in Europe, largely as a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]].

Anne resisted the King's attempts to seduce her in 1526 and she refused to become his mistress, as her sister, [[Mary Boleyn]], had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of the King's desires to secure a divorce from his wife, [[Catherine of Aragon]], so he could marry Anne. Evidence of intimacy between the King and Anne is found in a love letter written by the King, in which he expressed admiration for her "pretty duckies" (breasts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/henrytoanne.htm|title=Love Letter of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn, 1533.|website=www.luminarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that [[Pope Clement VII]] was unlikely to give the king an annulment, the breaking of the power of the Roman Catholic Church in England began.

Henry had [[Thomas Wolsey]] dismissed from public office and later had the Boleyn family's chaplain, [[Thomas Cranmer]], appointed [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In 1533, Henry and Anne went through a secret wedding service.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn"&gt;"Anne Boleyn 1507–1536." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant and there was a second, public wedding service, which took place in London on 25 January 1533. On 23 May 1533, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Catherine null and void. Five days later, Cranmer declared the marriage of Henry and Anne to be good and valid. Soon after, the Pope launched sentences of [[excommunication]] against the King and the Archbishop. As a result of Anne's marriage to the King, the [[Church of England]] was forced to break with Rome and was brought under the king's control.&lt;ref name="wbe-boleyn" /&gt;
Anne was crowned [[List of English consorts|Queen Consort of England]] on 1 June 1533. Later that year, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. When Anne failed to quickly produce a male heir, her only son being stillborn, the King grew tired of her, annulled their marriage, and a plot was hatched by [[Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex|Thomas Cromwell]] to execute her.

Although the evidence against her was unconvincing, Anne was beheaded on charges of [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[high treason]] on 19 May 1536. Following her daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s coronation as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of [[John Foxe]]. Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous [[Anne Boleyn in popular culture|artistic and cultural works]].

==Jane Seymour==

[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Jane Seymour]]
[[Jane Seymour]] (c.roughly 1508{{spaced ndash}}24 October 1537) was Henry's third wife. She served [[Catherine of Aragon]] and was one of [[Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn's]] ladies-in-waiting.&lt;ref&gt;Jokinen, Anniina. "[http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/sixwives.htm The Six Wives of King Henry VII]" 2007. Web. 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongly believed{{who|date=December 2014}} that she is the mistress who disposed of Anne, who was executed just 10–11 days before Jane's marriage to the king. The daughter of a knight, she was of lower birth than most of Henry's wives. Finally, a year later, Jane gave birth to a healthy, legitimate male heir, [[Edward VI of England|Edward]], but she died twelve days later, presumably because of post-natal complications. This apparently caused her husband genuine grief, as she was the only queen to receive a proper Queen's burial; when the King died in 1547, he was buried next to her.

==Anne of Cleves==
{{Main article|Anne of Cleves}}
[[File:AnneCleves.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Anne of Cleves]]
[[Anne of Cleves]] (22 September 1515{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1557) was Henry's fourth wife, for only six months in 1540, from 6 January to 9 July. Anne of Cleves was a German princess.&lt;ref&gt;"Anne of Cleves." World Book Encyclopedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been stated that Henry referred to her as "''A Flanders Mare''", which may or may not be true; nevertheless, the label has stuck with Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett "History of the Reformation of England" Print&lt;/ref&gt; Her pre-contract of marriage with [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]], was cited as grounds for an annulment. Anne agreed to this, claiming that the marriage had not been consummated, and because she hadn't resisted the annulment, was given a generous settlement, including [[Hever Castle]], former home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns. She was given the name "The King's Sister", and became a friend to him and his children until his death. She outlived both the King and his last two wives, making her the last of the six wives to die.

[[Catherine Howard]] (c.1521{{spaced ndash}}13 February 1542) was Henry's fifth wife between 1540–1542, sometimes known as "the rose without a
thorn". Henry was informed of her alleged adultery with [[Thomas Culpeper]] on 1 November 1541.&lt;ref&gt;"Catherine Howard." World Book Encyclopaedia. "19th ed". 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catherine Parr==
{{Main article|Catherine Parr}}
[[File:Catherine Parr from NPG.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Catherine Parr]]
[[Catherine Parr]] (1512{{spaced ndash}}5 September 1548), also spelled Kateryn, was the sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, 1543–1547. She was the daughter of [[Sir Thomas Parr]] of Kendal and his wife [[Maud Green]]. Through her father, Catherine was a descendant of [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. Through John of Gaunt's daughter [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmoreland]] (Henry's great-great grandmother), she was Henry's third cousin, once removed. By Henry's paternal descent from another of John of Gaunt's children, [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset]], the two were also fourth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/e274.htm |title= e274.htm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine showed herself to be the restorer of Henry's court as a family home for his children. Catherine was determined to present the royal household as a close-knit one in order to demonstrate strength through unity to Henry's opposers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Perhaps Catherine's most significant achievement was Henry's passing of an [[Third Succession Act|act]] that confirmed both [[Mary I of England|Mary]]'s and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s line in succession for the throne, despite the fact that they had both been made illegitimate by divorce or remarriage. Such was Henry's trust in Catherine that he chose her to rule as Regent while he was attending to the [[Italian War of 1542–46|war in France]] and in the unlikely event of the loss of his life, she was to rule as Regent until nine-year-old [[Edward VI of England|Edward]] came of age.

Catherine also has a special place in history as she was the most married queen of England, having had four husbands in all; Henry was her third. She had been widowed twice before marrying Henry. After Henry's death, she married [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], uncle of [[Edward VI of England]], to whom she had formed an attachment prior to her marriage with Henry. She had one child by Seymour, [[Mary Seymour|Mary]], and died shortly after childbirth. Lady Mary's history is unknown, but she is not believed to have survived childhood.

==Ancestry==
Henry was distantly related to all six of his wives through their common ancestor, King [[Edward I of England]],&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Fraser, ''The Wives of Henry VIII'', genealogical tables&lt;/ref&gt; through more than one ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tudorqueen6.com/2012/09/22/english-ancestry-of-the-six-wives-descent-from-edward-i/|title=English Ancestry of The Six Wives: Descent from Edward I|date=22 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinister supporter was inherited from her maternal grandfather William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh.

The House of Parr has assumed as a badge "a maiden's head, couped below the breasts, vested in ermine and gold, her hair of the last, and her temples encircled with red and white roses." This they inherited from the badge of Ross, of Kendal.&lt;ref name="Willment 75"&gt;Willement p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Kipyator Kiprono arap Biwott''' (1940 – 11 July 2017) was a [[Kenya]]n businessman, politician and philanthropist. Biwott served as a civil servant, Member of Parliament and government minister, during which time he held eight senior ministerial positions during the presidency of [[Daniel arap Moi]].

==Early life==

Biwott was born in Chebior village, [[Keiyo District]], [[Rift Valley Province]] in 1940 to Cheserem Soti, a market trader and cattle herder in [[Eldoret]], and Maria Soti. He attended Tambach Intermediate School from 1951 to 1954, after which he joined [[Kapsabet High School]].

After finishing secondary school in 1959, Biwott began working at the Department of Information in [[Eldoret]], after which he published the ''Kalenjin Monthly'' newsletter with Kendagor Bett.

He attended the [[University of Melbourne]], Australia, from 1962 to 1964, where he took a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Economics and Political Science, as well as a Diploma in Public Administration.

Biwott then served as a District Officer in [[Nkubu]] in the South Imenti Division of Meru District from 1964 to 1965, returning to the University of Melbourne in 1966 to study for a Masters Degree in Economics under a Commonwealth scholarship.

==Political career==

Biwott was a member of parliament for 28 years. In 1974 he ran unsuccessfully as a prospective MP for the Keiyo South Constituency. At the next election in 1979 he was successful, standing on KANU ticket in Keiyo-Marakwet, retaining the seat in 1983 and 1988. In 1992, 1997, and 2002 he was elected the MP for Keiyo South Constituency. In the Parliamentary elections held on 27 December 2007, running on a KANU ticket, he lost his seat to Jackson Kiptanui arap Kamai of the Orange Democratic Party (ODM). The ODM swept to victory in all but one of KANU's seats on the Rift Valley.

Following the 2002 election, Biwott served on the Devolution Committee of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission. Biwott was the only Member of Parliament who abstained on the Constitutional Referendum held in 2005, stating that the Draft Constitution 'would divide the country along ethnic lines'. The draft Constitution was rejected at the Referendum.

More recently, Biwott has fought an election for leadership of KANU, the former party of government and now the official opposition, following years of decline in KANU political fortunes but lost the post to Uhuru Kenyatta following a decision by the Kenyan High Court.

==Service in government of Kenya==

===District Officer===

Biwott entered government service in 1965 as the District Officer in South [[Imenti]] and [[Tharaki]], [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]] District (Jan 1965–66). As District Officer Biwott instituted, on a 'harrambe' basis, community fund-raising programmes to aid the development of local irrigation projects and roads, to build a health centre at Nkwene and schools at [[Nkubu]] and [[Kanyakini]], develop employment at the [[Egoji]] quarries and promote the planting of coffee and tea. He was also actively involved in the resettlement of previously European owned land through the 'Land Transfer' programme, part of the 'Million Acres' scheme, and played a central role in the rehabilitation of the [[Mau Mau]], many of whom still remained in the Mau Forest four years after the end of the 'Emergency', helping to persuade them to give up violence and organising the resettlement of many on to their own land.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Ministry of Agriculture===

Having completed his master's degree in Australia in 1968, Nicholas Biwott returned to public service in the Ministry of Agriculture, GOK, Personal Assistant to Minister Bruce MacKenzie (1968–70). He coordinated cereal production, the marketing of cereal crops and the management of the Ministry's fertiliser policy, and helped develop research into new strains of wheat and maize more suited to the growing conditions in Kenya. He played a similar co-ordinating role for the Ministry's work with the East African Council of Ministers (MacKenzie was also a member of the Council), guiding Kenya's policy in the region in the development of ports, railways and the East African Airways.

===Treasury===

In 1971 Nicholas Biwott moved to the Treasury as Senior Secretary under the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Mwai Kibaki. In 1972 he created and headed the External Aid Division and technical assistance program dealing with external resources, bringing in experts and arranging cultural exchanges. Notably he helped facilitate the establishment of the French School in Nairobi (now called the Lycee Denis Diderot), the French Cultural Centre with the Alliance de Francais, and the German Friederich Ebert Stiftung Foundation in co-operation with the Goethe Institut.

===Ministry of Home Affairs===

In late 1972 Nicholas Biwott transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs on the personal recommendation of President Kenyatta to work with his Vice-President and the Minister of Home Affairs, Daniel arap Moi.

In 1974 Biwott stood as a candidate for the Keiyo South constituency in the general election of that year but was narrowly defeated.

Following the 1974 election Nicholas Biwott was recalled to the Ministry of Home Affairs as Under Secretary (1974–78) to Minister Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's Vice-President. With the ageing President Kenyatta unable to fulfil all the functions of the presidency, Moi took a leading role in the East African region with the result that Nicholas Biwott spent much of the next four years dealing with the [[Organisation of African Unity]], the Commonwealth, the 'non-aligned' states and promoting the 'good neighbourliness' policy with states bordering Kenya.

Kenyatta's death in 1978 saw Daniel arap Moi elevated to the presidency and Nicholas Biwott promoted to Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/hist/1979.htm Statehousekenya.go.ke], Minister of State 1978–79&lt;/ref&gt; (1978–79).

===Minister of State===

Following the election of 1979 (in which he was elected Member of Parliament for [[Keiyo South Constituency|1979 Keiyo South election]], a seat he retained until December 2007), Nicholas Biwott returned to the Office of the President but now promoted to Minister of State (1979–82) with responsibility for science and technology, cabinet affairs, land settlement and immigration.

Under his auspices the Kenya Medical Research Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kemri.org/|title=HOME|website=www.kemri.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in the same year to carry out health science research in Kenya. (Now in its 31st year, KEMRI continues its work as “a leading centre of excellence in the promotion of quality health”).

===Minister of Regional Development, Science and Technology===

In September 1982 he was appointed Minister of Regional Development, Science and Technology. Learning from examples of other regional development policies, notably in Australia and Tennessee in the USA, he created two regional development authorities, the Lake Basin Development Authority and the Kerio Valley Development Authority.

===Minister of Energy===

In September 1983, Nicholas Biwott was made Minister of Energy and Regional Development and in March 1988 (following a reorganisation of ministry portfolios) he became Minister of Energy, a post he held until January 1991.

Over the next seven years he was instrumental in establishing the National Oil Corporation, the building of National Oil storage facilities near Nairobi and connecting them to the Mombasa refinery, and extending the pipeline from Nairobi to [[Kisumu]] and [[Eldoret]]. This period that saw rapid advances in efforts to improve Kenya's electricity supply and delivery with a rural electrification programme, work beginning on the Sondu Miriu Dam, and the completions of the Masinga Multi Purpose Dam, the [[Kiambere]] Hydro Electric Dam and the Turkwell Hydro Electric Multi Purpose Dam.

===Minister of East African and Regional Co-operation===

Although he remained a member of parliament, Biwott held no position in the Government of Kenya from 1991 until he re-entered government as Minister of State in the Office of the President of East Africa in 1997 before, in January 1998, he established and was appointed Minister of the new Ministry of East African and Regional Co-operation (1998–99).

Nicholas Biwott played a central role in COMESA — the Common Market for East and Central Africa, co-ordinating with COMESA partner Ministers legislation for an East African Road network, legislation for an East African Legislative Assembly, and becoming Chairman of both COMESA and of the East Africa Council of Ministers.

===Minister of Trade and Industry, Tourism and East African Cooperation===

In September 1999 Biwott's ministerial portfolio was expanded when he became Minister of Trade and Industry, Tourism and East African Cooperation (1999–2001), a post he held for the next three years during which he established a Tourist Trust Fund&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttfkenya.org Tourist Trust Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120919151835/http://www.ttfkenya.org/ |date=19 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[European Union]], set up the Tourist Police and re-introduced the East Africa Safari Rallies.

Biwott's promotion of Kenyan tourism met with some praise. He was variously described as "the hardest working minister of tourism Kenya has ever had"&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000604mag-kenya.html ''New York Times''] magazine, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the best minister of tourism in 25 years".&lt;ref&gt;[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000604mag-kenya.html Mahmud Jan Mohamed], Chairman of Kenya Tourism Federation, quoted in ''New York Times'' magazine, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001 (following a further reorganisation of Ministry responsibilities) Nicholas Biwott continued as the Minister of Trade and Industry and East African Tourism (2001–02). Over the next eighteen months he established the Small Medium Trade Trust Fund with the European Union, introduced an Intellectual Property bill which was passed as an Act, accomplished a free trade area with COMESA, established the Africa Trade Insurance Agency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issafrica.org/AF/RegOrg/unity_to_union/pdfs/comesa/11commay01.pdf African Trade Insurance Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; to cover foreign investments against political risk, and served as Chairman of the African Caribbean Pacific Group (ACP) at the [[World Trade Organization]].

==Businessman==

Biwott led an active business life and was regarded as one of Kenya's most successful entrepreneurs.

As a teenager in the late 1950s Biwott worked alongside his father who had established a successful fruit and vegetable business in Eldoret. The young Biwott also borrowed small amounts of money from a local bank with which to expand his own business sideline selling meat products and eggs. Nicholas Biwott continued to expand his own business and in the late 1960s formed ABC Foods selling food and animal feed products.
 
Within a few years Nicholas Biwott was able to invest in farms and businesses, taking advantage of the post-independence banking policies at the time by which Kenyans were granted loans on favourable terms. In 1969, aged 29, Biwott purchased the Eldoret Town International Harvester (IH) dealership (now FMD trading as Lima Ltd). He also purchased a dairy farm in the same year, started an importer exporter business in 1972, purchased two wheat farms in 1974, invested in the sole agency for IH in Kenya for agricultural tractors and implements in 1975, and purchased a local air operator in 1977 (now Air Kenya).

Biwott's business philosophy of purchasing small or failing businesses, investing and re-investing in them over many years, appears to have paid dividends. He is now regarded as one of Kenya's wealthiest businessmen.

Biwott's businesses in Kenya employ thousands of people and one company of which he is the major shareholder, has for many years been listed among Kenya's top 10 corporate taxpayers.

==Philanthropy==

Mr Biwott supported a number of projects in the areas of education, health and medicine, and assisting small businesses. In 2008 he established the [http://www.mbegutrust.org/ Mbegu Trust)] 'to develop education and opportunity in Kenya'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbegutrust.org The Mbegu Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas Biwott raised and contributed funds for the building of a number of schools, and hospitals in Keiyo. A full list can be found [http://www.nicholasbiwott.com/nicholas-biwott-biography/ here]

== Controversy ==

Nicholas Biwott’s name has been raised, ‘perhaps unfairly ’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phombeah |first=Gray |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4490163.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Nicholas Biwott: Kenya's comeback king |publisher=BBC News |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by his detractors both inside and outside Kenya regarding several controversies all which have date their origins to the years 1990–91. His supporters maintain that the allegations, none of which have ever been proved, arose from the campaign at the time to introduce multi-party democracy in Kenya coupled with Biwott's association with President Moi.

Biwott was named by [[Scotland Yard]] detective [[John Troon]] as a person of interest in the 1990 murder of Kenya's Foreign Affairs minister [[Robert Ouko (politician)|Robert Ouko]]. Troon's theories and the basis for them as to the motives for the murder have since been criticised.

Ten government officials, including Biwott, were held in police custody for questioning for two weeks in November 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=880|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko?..and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a Kenyan Police investigation concluded that there was no 'evidence to support the allegations that Biwott was involved in the disappearance and subsequent death of the late minister Dr. Robert John Ouko'.&lt;ref&gt;Kenya Police, Report on Further Investigations into the Disappearance and Subsequent Death of the Late Hon. Dr Robert John Ouko&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2003, Biwott issued a formal complaint against New Scotland Yard through his lawyer on the basis that Troon's investigation was 'fundamentally flawed and, in many cases erroneous' and called on New Scotland Yard 'to investigate Troon' and to issue an apology. The request was ultimately turned down in December 2004 by the Metropolitan Police as the original investigation 'did not involve any UK "victim", potential suspect, or even witnesses', and because 'the resources of the Metropolitan Police are limited'. Another reason given for the refusal by the Metropolitan Police to review the case was that the Kenyan Parliamentary Select Committee was investigating the death of Dr Robert Ouko and that it was 'open to Mr Biwott to make any representations he wishes to that Inquiry'. The Select Committee's proceedings, however, were abruptly terminated as Nicholas Biwott began to give his testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=901|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko?..and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, the allegation that Biwott was involved in the murder of Dr Robert Ouko has never been factually substantiated. In a recent broadcast (March 2017)  [http://murderatgotalila.com/?cat=7 Episode Six "Lingering Doubts and Further Investigations"] it is explained why the allegations against Nicholas Biwott were false, and summarise "It may be a hard truth for many Kenyans to swallow, but Nicholas Biwott clearly had no involvement in the murder of [[Robert Ouko (politician)|Robert Ouko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=895|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko? ...and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, a Nairobi court awarded Mr Biwott record damages of Sh30 million arising from a case in which he sued a British journalist, Chester Stern, and others for linking him to the Ouko murder in a book entitled 'Dr Iain West's Casebook'. Chester Stern and the book's publishers, Little Brown, stated that they would "vigorously defend" the action but ultimately they did not do so and the case was uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/559672/-/u3td4x/-/index.html ‘It’s Our Turn to Eat’ now in electronic bookshop] ''Daily Nation''&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Biwott won Sh10 : million from Bookpoint, a popular Nairobi bookshop, for stocking copies of the book ''Dr Ian West's Casebook''.

In 1993 the 'Goldenberg scandal' came to light in which the Kenyan government was found to have subsidised exports of gold by paying a company, Goldenberg International Ltd (GIL), 35 percent more (in Kenyan shillings) than the foreign currency earnings supposedly derived from the sale of gold. The scheme had begun in 1991 and is estimated to have cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10 percent of its annual Gross Domestic Product. A Commission of Inquiry headed by Mr Justice Bosire reported its findings in October 2005 stating that Sh158.3 billion [$2.1 billion] of Goldenberg money had been transacted through 487 companies and individuals. 1,559 'Adverse Notices' were issued against companies and individuals but although Nicholas Biwott was included on that list he was only mentioned directly or indirectly in three of the reports 847 paragraphs and the report, together with subsequent revelations would seem to absolve Biwott of any involvement in the scandal.

[http://kenyalaw.org/kl/fileadmin/CommissionReports/Report-of-the-Judicial-Commission-of-Inquiry-into-the-Goldenberg-Affair.pdf The Report of the Judicial Commission of Enquiry into the Goldenberg Affair] (to which Nicholas Biwott was not summoned to appear) [http://www.kenyadocex.com/wiki/report-of-the-judicial-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-goldenberg-affair-para-511/ states on para 511] that Lima Limited, of which Biwott was shareholder and director, was 'said (to) have received Kshs.6,300,000.00 [$84,000] from GIL'. However, it was subsequently revealed that the payment to Lima Ltd, a company that sold farm machinery and equipment, was made not from GIL but by Tandui Estates Ltd for the purchase of farm equipment, including a number of tractors and other machinery. [http://www.kenyadocex.com/wiki/report-of-the-judicial-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-goldenberg-affair-para-693/ Paragraph 693] of the same report mentions Biwott in conjunction with a payment of KShs. 6,000,000 [$80,000], which involved Trade Bank Ltd, Pan-African Bank Ltd and Liabilities of H.Z. &amp; Co. Ltd. The Commission concluded however, that 'no moneys of Goldenberg were involved'.

'''Nyakyusa''', or '''Nyakyusa-Ngonde''', is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Tanzania]] and [[Malawi]] spoken by the [[Nyakyusa people]] around the northern end of [[Lake Malawi]]. There is no single name for the language as a whole; dialects are Nyakyusa, Ngonde (Konde), Kukwe, Mwamba (Lungulu), and Selya (Salya, Seria) of Tanzania. Disregarding the Bantu language prefixes ''Iki-'' and ''Ki-,'' the language is also known as Konde ~ Nkhonde, Mombe, Nyekyosa ~ Nyikyusa, and Sochile ~ Sokili.

Sukwa is often listed as another dialect, but according to Nurse (1988) and Fourshey (2002) it is a dialect of [[Lambya language|Lambya]].

In Malawi Nyakusa and Kyangonde are spoken in the northern part of [[Karonga District]], on the shore of Lake Malawi close to the border with Tanzania, while Nkhonde is spoken the centre of the district, including in the town of [[Karonga]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unima-cls.org/Docs/MappingNorthernMalawi/mw-north-a4.jpg Centre for Language Studies map of Northern Malawi Languages].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi carried out by the Centre for Language Studies of the University of Malawi, "Nyakyuska, though spoken by very few people, mainly at Iponga in Sub T/ A Mwakawoko’s area, is regarded as the parent language from which Kyangonde and Chinkhonde originated. Kyangonde, on the other hand, is regarded as the most prestigious and standard language/dialect of the district. ... Chinkhonde is seen as a dialect of Kyangonde which has been heavily influenced by Citumbuka."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unima-cls.org/Docs/MappingNorthernMalawi/lm-northernmalawi.pdf Language Mapping Survey (2006)], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same Survey contains a folktale (the Tortoise and the Hare) in Chinkhonde and other languages of Northern Malawi, as well as some comparative vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Language Mapping Survey p.63 and 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The diadem was brought to [[Poland]] by one of the Hungarian princesses. Later  assigned to [[Konrad I of Masovia]], [[Duke of Masovia]] it served as the personal crown of the Dukes of Masovia and was kept in the [[Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral|Płock Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="sw_zygmunt" /&gt;

In 1601 by order of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] the diadem was placed by a goldsmith Stanisław Zemelka on reliquary of [[Sigismund of Burgundy|St. Sigismund]] (patron saint of the King, also kept in the [[Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral|Płock Cathedral]]). This reliquary takes the form of a bust and it was established by King [[Casimir III the Great]] in the 14th century to comprise relics of that saint.&lt;ref&gt;''Najcenniejsza jest Herma św.

The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Šebková | first1 = Hana | last2 = Žlnayová | first2 = Edita | year = 1998 | url = http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf | title = Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely) | place = Ústí nad Labem | publisher = Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J.

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. It shares many phonetic features with [[Marwari (language)|Marwari]], while its grammar is closest to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="hub1995"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Milena|last=Hübschmannová|title=Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku|journal=Bulletin Muzea romské kultury|issue=4/1995|year= 1995 |publisher= Muzeum romské kultury|place=Brno|quote=Zatímco romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.livescience.com/40652-facts-about-roma-romani-gypsies.html|title=5 Intriguing Facts About the Roma|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of [[North India|northern]] [[India]], traditionally referred to collectively as the [[Ḍoma]], are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rai | first1 = N | last2 = Chaubey | first2 = G | last3 = Tamang | first3 = R | last4 = Pathak | first4 = AK | last5 = Singh | first5 = VK  | year = 2012 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | title = The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 Reveals the Likely Indian Origin of the European Romani Populations | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | number = 11 | page = e48477 | DOI = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | pmid=23209554 | pmc=3509117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Indian Minister of External Affairs]] stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India.

The '''Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy''' began on February 29, 2012, when American [[Conservative talk radio|conservative talk-show]] host [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s remarks about [[contraceptive mandate]]s included statements labeling [[Georgetown University Law Center]] student [[Sandra Fluke]] as a "slut" and "prostitute". Limbaugh was commenting on Fluke's speech the previous week to House Democrats in support of mandating insurance coverage for [[Contraception|contraceptives]]. Despite disapproval from major political figures, Limbaugh made numerous similar statements over the next two days, which led to the loss of several of his national sponsors and Limbaugh apologizing on his show for some of his comments. Fluke rejected the apology as dubious and inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/georgetown-president-defends-student-blasts-limbaugh/2012/03/02/gIQAnE20mR_story.html |title=Georgetown president defends Sandra Fluke, blasts Rush Limbaugh |first=Jenna |last=Johnson |date=March 2, 2012 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sponsors Pull Ads From Rush Limbaugh's Radio Show Over 'Slut' Comments |first=Amy |last=Bingham |publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/advertisers-pull-funds-from-rush-limbaughs-radio-show-over-slut-comments/ |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carbonite message"&gt;{{cite web |last=Friend |first=David |title=A Message from Carbonite CEO, David Friend Regarding Ads on Limbaugh |publisher=[[Carbonite (online backup)|Carbonite]] |url=http://www.carbonite.com/en/blog/A-Message-from-Carbonite-CEO-David-Friend-Regarding-Ads-on-Limbaugh |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYMag"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/03/rush-limbaughs-slut-attack-costs-him-advertisers.html |title=Rush Limbaugh's 'Slut' Attack Costs Him Advertisers|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |first=Andre |last=Tartar |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP_twitter"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-boycott-reddit-twitter-facebook_n_1317698.html |title=Rush Limbaugh Boycott: Reddit, Twitter, Facebook Users Take Part |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Catharine |last=Smith |date=March 3, 2012 |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Sandra Fluke]], then a 30-year-old law student at [[Georgetown University]], was invited by Democrats to speak at a hearing by the [[House Oversight and Government Reform Committee]] on the new Administration rules on Conscience Clause exceptions in health care.&lt;ref name=natjourn&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/healthcare/how-contraception-became-a-train-wreck-for-republicans-20120304 |title=How Contraception Became A Train Wreck For Republicans |last=McCarthy |first=Meghan |work=[[National Journal]] |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307224837/http://www.nationaljournal.com/healthcare/how-contraception-became-a-train-wreck-for-republicans-20120304# |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exception applies to church organizations themselves, but not to affiliated nonprofit corporations, like hospitals, that do not rely primarily on members of the faith as employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Contraception and Insurance Coverage (Religious Exemption Debate)|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/contraception/index.html|publisher=THe New York Times|accessdate=16 July 2012|first=Adam|last=Liptak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, another exception was created for religious institutions in which an employee can seek birth control directly from the insurance company instead of the religious based nonprofit.&lt;ref name=divides&gt;{{cite news|author=Donna Cassata |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/09/obama-birth-control-mandate-divides-congress_n_1266755.html |title=Obama Birth Control Mandate Divides Democrats |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= February 9, 2012|accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats requested the committee add Sandra Fluke to the first panel, which was composed of clergy and theologians. Committee chairman [[Darrell Issa]] (R-California) refused, stating that Fluke lacked expertise, was not member of the clergy, and her name was not submitted in time.&lt;ref name=natjourn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/rep-darrell-issa-bars-minority-witness-a-woman-on-contraception-2 |first=Tom |last=Shine |date=February 16, 2012 |title=Rep.

[[File:The Testimony Chairman Issa Doesn't Want You to Hear.ogv|thumbtime=56|thumb|left|Sandra Fluke reading a prepared statement for U.S. Congressional testimony, 16 February 2012.]]
The next week, the [[Steering and Policy Committees of the United States House of Representatives#House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee|House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee]] convened a meeting to invite Fluke to speak. Fluke put forward reasons that her school, Georgetown, should be compelled to offer contraceptive drugs without co-pay, in spite of the Catholic University's moral opposition to artificial birth control.&lt;ref name=natjourn/&gt; She said that during the time spent as a law student, [[birth control]] could cost $3,000 or more. She also stated that 40% of Georgetown Law School's female population suffered financial hardship as a result of birth control not being covered by the student health insurance plan, and that the lack of contraception coverage in the university insurance plans would induce many low income students to go without contraceptives. She then shared the stories of friends affected by such policies, citing a friend with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. Fluke said this friend needed contraceptive hormones costing over $100 per month in order to treat this disease, and that while [[polycystic ovary syndrome|PCOS]] was covered by Georgetown insurance, the insurance company repeatedly denied contraceptives, because they suspected the purpose of the medication was contraception. Fluke explained that the friend was a lesbian, and therefore did not need birth control. Due to the friend being unable to afford the necessary treatment for her disease, complications arose, requiring surgery and the removal of one ovary. Subsequently, the friend then went through premature ovarian failure, a condition that causes infertility, seriously impacts health, and must be treated for years to come.&lt;ref name=testimony&gt;{{cite speech |last=Fluke |first=Sandra |title=Statement to Congress |url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/statement-Congress-letterhead-2nd%20hearing.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/obama-backs-student-sandra-fluke-over-slut-charge-by-rush-limbaugh/story-e6frg6so-1226287998672 "Obama backs student Sandra Fluke over 'slut' charge by Rush Limbaugh"] March 03, 2012 ''[[The Australian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler Kingkade, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/16/steve-landsburg-rochester-university-professor-rush-limbaugh_n_1353319.html?ref=college "Steve Landsburg, University Of Rochester Professor, Defends Rush Limbaugh To Students' Outrage"] 03/16/2012 ''[[The Huffington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remarks by Limbaugh==
On February 29, 2012, after referencing Fluke's statement that "contraceptives can cost a woman over $3000 during law school", Limbaugh stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/29/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-slut_n_1311640.html|title=Rush Limbaugh: Sandra Fluke, Woman Denied Right To Speak At Contraception Hearing, A 'Slut'|publisher=The Huffington Post |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate= March 3, 2012 |first=Jack |last=Mirkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sfgetscall"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17241803 | title= Limbaugh slut slur student Sandra Fluke gets Obama call | publisher=BBC News | date=March 3, 2012 | accessdate= March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/post/rush-limbaughs-attack-on-sandra-fluke-was-hate-speech/2012/03/02/gIQAZVxrmR_blog.html |title= Rush Limbaugh's attack on Sandra Fluke was hate speech | publisher=The Washington Post | date=March 2, 2012 | accessdate= March 3, 2012 | first=Jamila | last=Bey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnewsobamacalls"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57389692-503544/obama-calls-sandra-fluke-to-offer-support-over-limbaugh-comments/ | title=Obama calls Sandra Fluke to offer support over Limbaugh comments | publisher= CBS News| date=March 2, 2012 | accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Limbaugh: Student Denied Spot At Contraception Hearing Says "She Must Be Paid To Have Sex", So She's A "Slut" And "Prostitute" |url=http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201202290008 |publisher= [[Media Matters for America]]| accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;What does it say about the college co-ed Susan Fluke {{sic}}, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex, what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us? We're the pimps. (interruption) The johns? We would be the johns? No! We're not the johns. (interruption) Yeah, that's right. Pimp's not the right word. Okay, so she's not a slut. She's "round heeled". I take it back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |credits=Host: [[Rush Limbaugh]] |airdate=February 29, 2012 |series=[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]] |transcripturl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050417/http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/02/29/butt_sisters_are_safe_from_newt_and_rick |transcript=Transcript|title=Butt Sisters are Safe from Newt and Rick |&lt;!--accessdate=March 6, 2012--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He continued that day and stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Slut": The Voice Of A Right-Wing Bully|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/201203010005|accessdate=March 5, 2012|publisher= Media Matters for America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Can you imagine if you're her parents how proud of Sandra Fluke you would be? Your daughter goes up to a congressional hearing conducted by the Botox-filled [[Nancy Pelosi]] and testifies she's having so much sex she can't afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should provide them, or the Pope.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 1, 2012, Limbaugh offered what he said was a "compromise" to contraception coverage: purchasing "all the women at [[Georgetown University]] as much aspirin to put between their knees as possible". He continued that he "[ran] some numbers" on contraception costs and argued that contraception coverage was "flat-out thievery" that would force taxpayers to pay to "satisfy the sexual habits of female law students at Georgetown". Later, he dismissed concerns over lack of access to contraception coverage and mocked Fluke's congressional testimony, affecting a baby's voice and pretending to cry, saying: "I'm going broke having sex. I need government to provide me condoms and contraception. It's not fair." He asked, "Ms. Fluke, have you ever heard of not having sex? Have you ever heard of not having sex so often?"&lt;ref name="media_matters"/&gt; After mentioning that Washington, D.C., Department of Health "will send you free condoms and lube", Limbaugh included the "[[feminazi]]" term he has popularized and said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So, Ms. Fluke and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it, and I'll tell you what it is. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.&lt;ref name="media_matters"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the same show, Limbaugh remarked that Fluke is "having so much sex, it's amazing she can still walk",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Limbaugh: Fluke Is "Having So Much Sex, It's Amazing She Can Still Walk |url=http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201203010013 |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued on to suggest that Georgetown should establish a "[[Personal life of Wilt Chamberlain#Love life and “20,000 women” claim|Wilt Chamberlain]] scholarship ... exclusively for women". He also asked, "Who bought your condoms in junior high? Who bought your condoms in the sixth grade? Or your contraception. Who bought your contraceptive pills in high school?"&lt;ref name="media_matters"&gt;{{cite web|title=UPDATED: Limbaugh's Misogynistic Attack On Georgetown Law Student Continues With Increased Vitriol|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/201203010012#wednesday| publisher= Media Matters for America| accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described Fluke as "a woman who is happily presenting herself as an immoral, baseless, no-purpose-to-her life woman. She wants all the sex in the world whenever she wants it, all the time, no consequences. No responsibility for her behavior."&lt;ref name="media_matters"/&gt;

On March 2, 2012, Limbaugh defended his previous comments about Fluke, saying, "not one person says that, 'Well, did you ever think about maybe backing off the amount of sex that you have?'" Limbaugh said that requiring insurance companies to cover contraception is "no different than if somebody knocked on my door that I don't know and said, 'You know what? I'm out of money. I can't afford birth-control pills, and I'm supposed to have sex with three guys tonight.'" Limbaugh commented on Fluke receiving a call from President Obama, who stated that her parents should be proud of her, saying, "I'm gonna button my lip on that one." He went on to say that if his daughter had testified that "she's having so much sex she can't pay for it and wants a new welfare program to pay for it," he would be "embarrassed" and "disconnect the phone", "go into hiding", and "hope the media didn't find me". He continued later, "Oh! Does she have more boyfriends? They're lined up around the block. They would have been in my day." He continued that Fluke testified that her "sex life is active. She's having sex so frequently that she can't afford all the birth-control pills that she needs. That's what she's saying."&lt;ref name="media_matters"/&gt;

==Reaction to Limbaugh's remarks==
[[File:Ms. magazine Cover - Spring-Summer 2012.jpg|thumbnail|Sandra Fluke on the cover of ''[[Ms. magazine]]'' in 2012]]
Many public figures and organizations of all political stripes rejected Limbaugh's comments as sexist. Georgetown University president John DeGioia said Limbaugh's description of Fluke was "misogynistic, vitriolic"; 130 members of the faculty signed a letter supporting Fluke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20120303/NEWS07/203030435/Limbaugh-s-verbal-attack-law-student-sparks-backlash "Limbaugh's verbal attack on law student sparks backlash"], Detroit Free Press, March 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Organization for Women]] called Limbaugh a "bigoted bully" using "hate-filled speech" to "shame a young woman" for her views. They also called on Clear Channel to drop his show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rush Limbaugh Goes After Sandra Fluke Again; NOW Wants Him Gone |author=Peter Voskamp |url=http://sg.news.yahoo.com/rush-limbaugh-goes-sandra-fluke-again-now-wants-010715927.html |newspaper=The Wrap |date=March 3, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Maddow]] said Limbaugh was trying to fan outrage, and his attacks seemed to be based on the idea that the cost of birth control pills is proportional to the amount of sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/03/rachel-maddow-rush-limbaugh-birth-control-sandra-fluke_n_1318354.html Rachel Maddow: Rush Limbaugh A 'Dummy' Who 'Doesn't Know What Birth Control Is'], ''The Huffington Post'', March 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Gabriel]] requested that Limbaugh no longer play his song "[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)|Sledgehammer]]" on his show, saying he was "appalled" that the song was played while Limbaugh disparaged Fluke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57391348-10391698/peter-gabriel-pulls-his-music-from-rush-limbaughs-show/|title=Peter Gabriel wants his music pulled from Rush Limbaugh's show|author=Jessica Derschowitz |publisher=CBS News.com|date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]] also requested the use of their songs, including "[[Tuff Enuff]]", be discontinued on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wappler|first=Margaret|title=Rush, Peter Gabriel, Fab Thunderbirds want off Limbaugh's show|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/03/rush-peter-gabriel-fabulous-thunderbirds-rush-limbaugh.html|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frontman [[Kim Wilson]] was "mortified by his (Limbaugh's) attack on this young woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fabulous Thunderbirds want its music off Rush Limbaugh's show|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57393324-10391698/fabulous-thunderbirds-want-its-music-off-rush-limbaughs-show/|accessdate=November 5, 2012|newspaper=CBS|date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan MacMillan Emry]], a Californian who previously had not been politically active, founded a public relations campaign called [[Rock the slut vote|Rock the Slut Vote]] in response to Limbaugh's comments about Fluke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/rock-slut-vote-site-aims-fight-women-issues-november-election-article-1.1090276|title=‘Rock the Slut Vote’ site aims to fight for women’s issues in November election  - NY Daily News|last=DUERSON|first=MEENA HART|work=nydailynews.com|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic===

Democrats characterized both the hearing at which Fluke did not testify, and Limbaugh's comments, as part of a "war on women", [[War on Women|a frequent catchphrase]] used to refer to what are seen as the Republican Party's restrictions on [[women's rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/01/war-on-women-house-democrats-raise-million_n_1314661.html |title=House Democrats Raise $1.1 Million In 'War On Women' Campaign |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= March 1, 2012|accessdate=2013-08-06 |first=Jennifer |last=Bendery}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank |first=Nathaniel |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/hilary_rosen_ann_romney_the_birth_adolescence_and_death_of_the_democrats_war_on_women_talking_point_.html |title=Hilary Rosen, Ann Romney: The birth, adolescence, and death of the Democrats’ "war on women" talking point. - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=2013-08-02 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy-five [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] lawmakers signed a letter expressing outrage at the remarks labeling them as "sexually charged, patently offensive, obscene", "indecent" and "an abuse of public airwaves".&lt;ref name="HP_aspirin"/&gt;

Rep. [[Carolyn B.

Michigan state Sen. [[Gretchen Whitmer]] asked if Limbaugh would have made similar comments if Fluke had been a man, describing him as a "[[male chauvinism|chauvinist]]" and his words hate speech.

Obama campaign advisor [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] said Limbaugh's comments were "predicated on a lie" that taxpayers would have to pay for contraceptive coverage, when in fact it is insurance companies that will have to pay.&lt;ref name = "Will" /&gt;

Democratic political analyst for Fox News [[Kirsten Powers]] agreed that Limbaugh was a misogynist and deserved to be boycotted, but expanded her position further stating, "the liberals who led the charge need to start holding their own side accountable."  She then cited specific examples of crude and vulgar language being directed toward women by [[Chris Matthews]], [[Ed Schultz]], [[Keith Olbermann]], [[Matt Taibbi]], and [[Bill Maher]]. Powers went on to say, "when it comes to high-profile campaigns to hold these men accountable—such as that waged against Limbaugh—the real fury seems reserved only for conservatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/04/rush-limbaugh-s-apology-liberal-men-need-to-follow-suit.html|title=Rush Limbaugh Isn’t the Only Media Misogynist|author=Kirsten Powers|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limbaugh's apology==

On March 3, Limbaugh repeated his previous attacks against Fluke and insurance coverage for contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/article/20120303/NEWS07/203030435/Limbaugh-s-verbal-attack-law-student-sparks-backlash "Limbaugh's verbal attack on law student sparks backlash"] ''Detroit Free Press''. March 3, 2012. Retrieved March 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day he released an apology on his official website:&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/03/obama-vs-limbaugh-money-and-politics/1 USA Today] Limbaugh apologizes to Sandra Fluke by David Jackson, March 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke. I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level. / My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On March 5, 2012, Limbaugh repeated parts of his apology on his show, but criticized the reaction he received, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;I acted too much like the leftists who despise me. I descended to their level, using names and exaggerations. It's what we've come to expect from them, but it's way beneath me.&lt;ref name="losesmore"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same day, Fluke responded to his latest apology on ABC's ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;I don't think that a statement like this, saying that his choice of words was not the best, changes anything, and especially when that statement is issued when he's under significant pressure from his sponsors who have begun to pull their support from the show. / I think any woman who has ever been called these types of names is [shocked] at first. / But then I tried to see this for what it is, and I believe that what it is, is an attempt to silence me, to silence the millions of women and the men who support them who have been speaking out about this issue and conveying that contraception is an important healthcare need that they need to have met in an affordable, accessible way.&lt;ref name="losesmore"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17266985 "Rush Limbaugh loses more advertisers over 'slut' remarks"] ''BBC News''.

Six months after the controversy began, in response to Fluke's being considered for [[Time's Person of the Year]], Limbaugh said in part that his comments were a mistake: "If anybody is going to be named Person of the Year on that basis, it ought to be me. It’s not an 'honor' I would appreciate because it represents a little bit of a screw up." ...

&lt;blockquote&gt;Exactly one month after the conservative radio host sparked outrage ... stations are standing by him, advertisers are trickling back to his program and the news media have moved on ...

They are totally professionally created and executed Democrat Party opposition research-type attacks."&lt;ref name=Grier/&gt; Clear Channel's CEO said there has been no major move among stations to drop the show.

===Impact on other networks===
Limbaugh earned an unlikely ally when [[Ed Schultz]], the nation's most widely syndicated [[progressive talk radio]] host, came out in opposition to the boycott and urged Media Matters to drop its efforts, which Media Matters refused to do. According to Schultz, "If we start attacking advertisers because of what somebody said&amp;nbsp;— it’s the wrong thing to do (...) There’s a lot of people getting hurt. This is going to too far."&lt;ref&gt;Rothman, Noah (June 13, 2012).

''Mediaite''. Retrieved June 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thom Hartmann]], another progressive talk host who competes in Limbaugh's time slot (and who is heard on many of the same stations as Schultz), noted that the Media Matters campaign had caused the [[unintended consequence]] of driving sponsors away from not just Limbaugh, but political talk in general, including progressive talk, in an interview with the talk show ''[[Reliable Sources]]'' in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2013/08/04/liberal-radio-host-media-matters-anti-limbaugh-campaign-hurt-progressive-talk-radio/ Liberal radio host: Media Matters' anti-Limbaugh campaign hurt progressive talk radio].

Lew Dickey, the CEO of  [[Cumulus Media Networks]], stated that it cost his company "a couple of million bucks in the first quarter and a couple of million bucks in quarter two." He claimed that the losses accounted for one percent of the 3.5 percent loss in revenue that Cumulus suffered over this period.  He said things looked like they would be back to normal in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioink.com/Article.asp?id=2451234&amp;spid=24698 |title=Radio Ink Magazine |publisher=Radioink.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh announced that when his 2013 contract with Cumulus expires, he would revisit dropping the distributor, due to Dickey's repeated attempts to blame ratings problem on the Limbaugh show.&lt;ref name="Limbaugh drops Cumulus"&gt;{{cite news|last=Byers|first=Dylan|title=Rush Limbaugh may leave Cumulus|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/05/rush-limbaugh-may-leave-cumulus-163282.html|accessdate=2013-05-05|newspaper=Politico|date=2013-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Premiere, Limbaugh's primary distributor, stated that his advertising sales were recovering well.&lt;ref&gt;Weinger, Mackenzie (June 6, 2013).

The advertiser boycott effectively created a [[blacklist]] of stations that carry Limbaugh's program, and other shows on those stations were adversely affected; advertisers were unwilling to advertise on a show on the same station, lest its barter advertisements (commercials that air at a different time of day) be heard on Limbaugh's program.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Fox News Radio]] and the [[Wall Street Journal Radio Network]], both of which share a majority of their affiliates with Limbaugh's, both lost an estimated 40% of their revenues due to being carried on many of the same stations as Limbaugh; the revenue loss forced the latter network to fold in December 2014.&lt;ref name=darrylparks&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Darryl|url=http://darrylparks.com/2015/05/27/the-business-of-being-rush-limbaugh/|title=The Business of Being Rush Limbaugh|date=May 27, 2015|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This station blacklist was also speculated as the impetus behind a number of affiliate changes Limbaugh experienced over the following several years, as stations were unable to sell enough airtime on a blacklisted station to cover Limbaugh's very high rights fee; ownership groups were thus forced to spin Limbaugh and other blacklisted programs (the ''[[Glenn Beck Radio Program]]'', also distributed by Premiere and [[Glenn Beck Program#Boycotts|itself the subject of boycotts]]) off to less prominent stations and clear their schedules of controversial programming to get off the blacklist.&lt;ref name=darrylparks/&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2015|reason=Paragraph source is a self-published blog}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">The term '''Russian soul''' ({{lang-ru|Русская душа}}, ''Rússkaya dushá''; also ''great Russian soul'', ''mystifying Russian soul'') has been used in [[literature]] to describe Russian identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thekompass.co.uk/article/203 "Decoding the mysterious Russian soul"], an interview with professor Michael Hughes from the [[University of Lancaster]], June 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of many Russian writers such as [[Nikolai Gogol]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] offer descriptions of the Russian soul. 

==The term==
The concept of a Russian soul arose in the 1840s chiefly as a literary phenomenon.  Famous author [[Nikolai Gogol]] and literary critic [[Vissarion Belinsky|Vissarion Belinskii]] jointly coined the term upon the publication of Gogol’s masterpiece ''[[Dead Souls]]'' in 1842.  At the time landowners often referred to their [[serfs]] as “souls” for accounting purposes, and the novel’s title refers to the protagonist’s scheme of purchasing claims to deceased serfs.  Apart from this literal meaning, however, Gogol also intended the title as an observation of landowners’ loss of soul in exploiting serfs.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Robert C. Williams, "The Russian Soul: A Study in European Thought and Non-European Nationalism," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 31 (1970): 573-588, accessed November 27, 2010, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2708261&lt;/ref&gt;

Vissarion Belinskii, a notedly radical critic, took Gogol’s intentions a few steps farther and inferred from the novel a new recognition of a national soul, existing apart from the government and founded in the lives of the lower class.  Indeed, Belinskii used the term “Russian soul” several times in his analyses of Gogol’s work, and from there the phrase grew in prominence, and eventually became more clearly defined through the writings of authors such as [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].  This famous brand of nationalism, however, was the product of a continuous effort by Russia’s various classes to define a national identity.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

Gogol and his contemporaries established literature as Russia’s new weapon of choice, the tool by which it could inform itself of its greatness and urge the nation to its destined position as a world leader.  Gogol may not have had such grand notions, but with the help of [[Vissarion Belinsky]] he paved the way for a new concept of Russian identity - the great Russian soul.  As opposed to the preceding “Russian spirit” (Русский дух), which focused on Russia’s past, “Russian soul” was an expression of optimism.  It stressed Russia’s historical youth and its ability, by following the wisdom of the peasant, to become the savior of the world.  Indeed, although the concept of the Russian soul grew upon Western ideas, its advocates believed that Russia had made those ideas its own and would use them to save Europe from itself.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

==Culmination of the concept==
===Dostoyevsky===
The Russian soul evolved and entered into Western consciousness in the following decades, most famously through the work of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].  In his novels and stories, Dostoyevsky exhibited an often anti-European nationalism and frequently suggested a "people's spirit" held together by "unexpressed, unconscious ideas which are merely strongly felt". By Dostoyevsky's death in 1881, the "Russian soul" had completed its evolution in Russia.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

===After Dostoyevsky===
From about 1880 to 1930, largely thanks to Dostoyevsky, the "Russian soul" concept spread to other countries and began to affect foreign perception of the Russian people.  For many Europeans the idea offered a positive alternative to the typical view of Russians as backward, instead depicting the Russian people as an example of the innocence the West had lost.  The popularity of the "Russian soul" continued into the 20th century but faded as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] power increased.  By the 1930s the concept was slipping into obscurity, but it would survive in the work of the numerous writers who devised it.&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;

It may result from a variety of circumstances including physical, mental, emotional, social, or religious/spiritual barriers. It may also derive from not being satisfied during sex, which may be due to issues such as [[anorgasmia]], [[anaphrodisia]], [[premature ejaculation]], [[delayed ejaculation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hatzimouratidis |first=Konstantinos |displayauthors=1 |first2=Edouard |last2=Amar |first3=Ian |last3=Eardley |first4=Francois |last4=Giuliano |first5=Dimitrios |last5=Hatzichristou |first6=Francesco |last6=Montorsi |first7=Yoram |last7=Vardi |first8=Eric |last8=Wespes |title=Guidelines on male sexual dysfunction: erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation |journal=European Urology |volume=57 |issue=5 |year=2010 |pages=804–814 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2010.02.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[erectile dysfunction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/11/prisonsandprobation-sexual-health |title=Erwin James: Sexual frustration plagues prison life &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winch |first=Guy |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201109/marriage-and-sexual-frustrations-inevitable-or-solvable |title=Marriage and Sexual Frustrations: Inevitable or Solvable? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an incompatibility or discrepancy in libido.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reece |first=Rex |title=Causes and Threatments of Sexual Desire Discrepancies in Male Couples |journal=Journal of Homosexuality |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |year=1987 |pages=157–172 |doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual frustration can result from an individual's lacking one or more of the organs needed for sexual release but still having one or more of the organs that cause a sex-drive. For males it could be that they have testicles and no penis; a male might be born without a penis ([[aphallia]]) or be born with one and have it removed ([[penis removal]] or [[penectomy]]). Men can still ejaculate via [[prostate]] stimulation in that case. For females they might not have a clitoris which causes sexual pleasure; a female might have had her clitoris forcibly severed ([[female genital mutilation]]) or voluntarily removed (female [[Circumcision|circumcusion]]) as part of a medical procedure.

[[Involuntary celibacy]] is a form of sexual frustration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/minority-report/201706/involuntary-celibacy Involuntary Celibacy] Published by [[Psychology Today]] on June 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southwestern Mandarin''' ({{Zh|s=西南官话|t=西南官話|p=Xīnán Guānhuà}}), also known as '''Upper Yangtze Mandarin''' ({{Zh|s=上江官话|t=上江官話|p=Shàngjiāng Guānhuà}}), is a primary branch of [[Mandarin Chinese]] spoken in much of central and southwestern China, including in [[Sichuan]], [[Yunnan]], [[Chongqing]], [[Guizhou]], most parts of [[Hubei]], the northwestern part of [[Hunan]], the northern part of [[Guangxi]], and some southern parts of [[Shaanxi]] and [[Gansu]]. Some forms of Southwest Mandarin are not entirely [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Standard Chinese]] or other forms of Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra-Linguistic Data for Understanding Dialect Mutual Intelligibility|url=https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/a-reworking-of-chinese-language-classification/|last=Cheng|first=Chin-Chuan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Varieties of Southwestern Mandarin are spoken by roughly 260 million people.&lt;ref name="LAC2"/&gt; If considered a language distinct from Mandarin, it would have the eighth-most native speakers in the world, behind Mandarin itself, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Arabic]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

==Overview==
[[File:Southwestern Mandarin.ogg|thumb|Two speakers of the [[Guiyang]] variant of Southwestern Mandarin speak in the dialect]]
Modern Southwestern Mandarin was formed by the waves of immigrants brought to the regions during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]&lt;ref name="Holm2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holm|first=David|authorlink=David Holm|title=Mapping the Old Zhuang Character Script: A Vernacular Writing System from Southern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ0zAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2013|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-24216-6|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsung2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsung|first=Linda|title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XUeBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239|year=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-5574-0|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties.&lt;ref name="Chew2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chew|first=Phyllis Ghim-Lian|title=Emergent Lingua Francas and World Orders: The Politics and Place of English as a World Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GebbugVBeEAC&amp;pg=PA162|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-23557-0|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this comparatively recent move, these dialects show more similarity to modern Standard Mandarin than to other [[varieties of Chinese]] like [[Cantonese]] or [[Hokkien]].  For example, like most southern Chinese dialects, Southwestern Mandarin does not possess the [[retroflex consonant]]s (zh, ch, sh, r) of Standard Mandarin, but nor does it retain the [[checked tone]], as most southern dialects do. The [[Chengdu]]-[[Chongqing]] and Hubei dialects are believed to reflect aspects of the Mandarin ''lingua franca'' spoken during the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou and Xu 周及徐, 2005. "The pronunciation and historical evolution of '虽遂'-class characters in Ba-Shu dialects" 《巴蜀方言中“虽遂”等字的读音及历史演变》, ''Zhonghua Wenhua Luntan'' 中华文化论坛.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some scholars believe its origins may be more similar to [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang Qing 王庆, 2007. "Consonants in Ming Dynasty Repopulation Area Dialects and Southern Mandarin" 《明代人口重建地区方言的知照系声母与南系官话》, Chongqing Normal University Journal 重庆师范大学学报.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though part of the Mandarin group, Southwestern Mandarin has many striking and pronounced differences with Standard Mandarin such that, until 1955, it was generally categorized alongside Cantonese and [[Wu Chinese]] as a branch of Chinese varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Liu Xiaomei 刘晓梅 and Li Rulong 李如龙, 2003. "Special Vocabulary Research in Mandarin Dialects" 《官话方言特征词研究》, ''Yuwen Yanjiu'' 语文研究.&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwestern Mandarin is commonly spoken in [[Kokang]] district in northern [[Myanmar]], where the population consists largely of the [[Kokang people|Kokang]]. Southwestern Mandarin is also one of two official languages of the [[Wa State]], an unrecognized autonomous state within [[Myanmar]], alongside the [[Wa language]]. Because Wa has no written form, Chinese is the official working language of the Wa State government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stimson.org/programs/myanmar-map/ Interactive Myanmar Map], The Stimson Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infomekong.com/peoples/wa/ Wa], Infomekong&lt;/ref&gt; Some of its speakers, known as the [[Chin Haw]], live in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Clyne1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clyne|first=Michael G.|authorlink=Michael G.

==Phonology==

===Tones===
Most Southwestern Mandarin dialects have, like Standard Mandarin, only retained four of the original eight tones of [[Middle Chinese]].  However, the entering tone has completely merged with the light-level tone in most Southwestern dialects, while in Standard Mandarin it is seemingly randomly dispersed among the remaining tones.

===Syllables===
Southwestern Mandarin dialects do not possess the retroflex consonants of Standard Mandarin, but otherwise share most Mandarin phonological features.  Most have lost the distinction between the [[nasal consonant]] /n/ and the [[lateral consonant]] /l/ and the nasal finals /-n/ and /-ŋ/. For example, the sounds "la" and "na" are generally indistinguishable, as well as the sounds "fen" and "feng".  Some varieties also lack a distinction between the [[labiodental consonant|labiodental]] /f/ and the glottal /h/.

The people are closely related to the [[Tolai people]] and Sursurunga people of New Ireland and they speak the [[Tangga language]] which has since been split into three separate languages which are now being spoken by the Tangans and they are [[Niwer Mil language]], [[Warwar Feni language]] and  [[Fanamaket language]]. Their population according to the 2011 Papua New Guinea Census Report is 9,033 people. Tubuan, Sokapana and Ingiet are the secret societies practised by the Tanga people. F.L.S.

'''''The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by [[Political science|political scientist]] [[Naomi Murakawa]], who is a professor of [[African-American studies|African American studies]] at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/africanamericanstudies/people/faculty/naomi-murakawa/|title=Naomi Murakawa|website=Center for African American Studies, Princeton University|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book addresses causes of the rapid increase in [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. incarceration rates]] since the 1970s and of [[Race in the United States criminal justice system|racial inequality in the U.S. prison system]]. Specifically, Murakawa traces the role of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] politicians, particularly national-level [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], in shaping racially unequal incarceration policies. For the book, Murakawa was awarded the [[Michael Harrington|Michael Harrington Book Award]] by the [[Caucus for a New Political Science|New Political Science section]] of the [[American Political Science Association|APSA]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthpolicyscholars.org/news/2015-09-09/naomi-murakawa-receives-michael-harrington-book-award|title=Naomi Murakawa receives Michael Harrington Book Award|website=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murakawa's approach specifically "discounts intentions, recognizing that racial power is not necessarily exerted by will."&lt;ref name=osterweil&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osterweil|first1=Willie|title=How White Liberals Used Civil Rights to Create More Prisons|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/193977/how-white-liberals-used-civil-rights-create-more-prisons|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Nation|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the book investigates differing forms of [[racism]] and how they have functionally influenced the U.S. [[prison]] system.&lt;ref name=osterweil/&gt;

According to Murakawa, Democratic efforts to professionalize the U.S. justice system in response to racial bias in policing effectively contributed to that racially discriminatory policing and imprisonment practices. Examples discussed include the [[Boggs Act of 1952]] and the [[Narcotic Control Act of 1956]] which both created [[mandatory sentencing]], a policy that would entail racial inequality during the [[War on Drugs]].&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Thadeus|title=Did Liberals Put Black America Behind Bars? (Opinion)|url=http://www.newsweek.com/did-liberals-put-black-america-behind-bars-297096|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=Newsweek|issue=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill, which was heavily supported by [[Joe Biden]], expanded the [[Capital punishment in the United States|federal death penalty]] and minimum sentencing, which has been disproportionately applied to racial minorities. Minimum sentencing and drug laws have also significantly increased incarceration rates for nonviolent offenders.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Konczal|first1=Mike|last2=Covert|first2=Bryce|title=The Score: Why Prisons Thrive Even When Budgets Shrink|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/181747/score-why-prisons-thrive-even-when-budgets-shrink|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Nation|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murakawa notes that the term "the first civil right" was first used in the [[Harry Truman|Truman]] administration to refer to the right to be protected from violence, specifically Black protection from White supremacist violence, but the term was later popularized by [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] to implicitly mean protection of White people from Black people.&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Dana|title=Blame Liberals|url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/01/15/blame-liberals|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=The Marshall Project|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dumbarton House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dumbarton House]] is the Society's Headquarters]]
'''The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America''' is an [[United States|American]] organization composed of women who are descended from an ancestor "who came to reside in an American Colony before 1776, and whose services were rendered during the Colonial Period." The organization has 45 corporate societies and over 15,000 members. The national headquarters are at [[Dumbarton House]] in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], [[Washington, D.C.]]

== History ==
[[file:Union_Street,_Brunswick,_GA,_US_(07).jpg|right|thumb|Sign by the organization]]
The organization was founded in 1891, shortly after the founding of a similar society, the [[Colonial Dames of America]] (CDA).  The main difference between the two is that the CDA was created to have a centrally organized structure under the control of the parent Society in [[New York City]].

The NSCDA was intended as a federation of State Societies in which each unit had a degree of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partyspace.com/facilitypages/colonialdame/dameshome.htm The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America, Pennsylvania Headquarters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723203839/http://www.partyspace.com/facilitypages/colonialdame/dameshome.htm |date=2008-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another society formed around the same time was the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. Organized following the [[United States Centennial]] of 1876 and a Centennial in New York in 1889 (celebrating the Constitution), they built on renewed interest in America's past to work for preservation of historic collections and buildings, and education related to United States history. The NSCDA has been a leader in the field of historic preservation, restoration and the interpretation of historic sites since its New York Society first undertook the preservation of the Van Cortlandt House in 1897.

In November 2000, the NSCDA received the prestigious Trustee Emeritus Award for Excellence in the Stewardship of historic sites from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Today 41 diverse properties are owned outright by the Corporate Societies of the NSCDA, 13 additional museum collections are owned by the Dames and 30 more properties receive substantial volunteer and financial support from Dames.

The NSCDA has a regular periodical, the ''Dames Dispatch''.

The organization includes 45 Corporate Societies with over 15,000 members. The Society headquarters is located at Dumbarton House (pictured below),  in Washington, D.C. In addition to its broad based activities in the museum field, the Society sponsors a number of scholarship programs and other historic preservation, patriotic service and educational projects to further the aims and objects of the Society. Historic house museums owned or operated by the NSCDA, include:

The '''Tofu Curtain''' is a cultural or [[socioeconomic]] divide between two geographic regions and the people who reside in them, using [[tofu]] as a symbol of lifestyle and political leanings. The term was coined to identify trends on either side of a county line in the [[Pioneer Valley]] along the [[Connecticut River]] in [[Massachusetts]], and has also been widely used similarly with regards to [[gentrification|gentrifying]] neighborhoods in [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref name="Toensmeier and Bates, 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toensmeier|first1=Eric|last2=Bates|first2=Jonathan|title=Paradise Lot: Two Plant Geeks, One-Tenth of an Acre, and the Making of an Edible Garden Oasis in the City|date=2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, Vt.|page=24|isbn=9781603583992|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Tofu Curtain most often refers to these regions of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Massachusetts]], other tofu curtains have been named along similar socioeconomic, educational, and/or ethno-racial divides in various locations around the globe&lt;ref name="Dávila and Rivero, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dávila|first1=Arlene|last2=Rivero|first2=Yeidy M.|title=Contemporary Latina/o Media: Production, Circulation, Politics|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9781479848119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term derives from the political and ideological [[Iron Curtain]] that separated [[communism|communist]] [[Eastern Bloc]] countries from Western Europe during the [[Cold War]]. "Tofu" implies a high proportion of [[vegetarian]]s reside on one side of the divide, and associates [[left wing politics]] with vegetarianism.&lt;ref name="Campeau, 2010" /&gt;

While the Tofu Curtain's distinction is based on [[U.S. Census]] data and the repute of the two counties on either side of the Holyoke Range, their demographics are not absolute. Hampshire County being framed as "more collegiate" than Hampden either ignores the presence of the nine additional colleges and universities in the Springfield metropolitan area's Knowledge Corridor&lt;ref name="Seifer, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siefer|first1=Ted|title=A Springfield revival? – CommonWealth Magazine|url=http://commonwealthmagazine.org/economy/a-springfield-revival/|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=CommonWealth Magazine|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or regards these educational institutions as inferior to those of the Five College Consortium.&lt;ref name="Five Colleges"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/community/impacts|website=Five College Consortium|accessdate=2 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being populated by affluent residents and college students, economic disparities exist within [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], resulting in neighborhood rifts on that side of the Tofu Curtain. Despite the presence of a wealthy college and huge university, 2016 data showed that 50% of [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]] children received free or reduced lunches at public school on the criterion of living in low-income households.&lt;ref name="O'Brien, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=O"Brien|first1=George|title=Big Brothers Big Sisters|url=http://businesswest.com/blog/big-brothers-big-sisters/|accessdate=1 March 2017|work=BusinessWest|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Hampden county's large working class and Puerto Rican populations have been active in community organizing and progressive politics, activities often associated with the culture of the [[college town]]s to the north.&lt;ref name="Szafranski, 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Szafranski|first1=Matt|title=Progressive Moves To the Left and a Bit to the West... – Western Mass Politics &amp; Insight|url=http://www.wmasspi.com/2017/02/progressive-moves-left-bit-west.html|accessdate=1 March 2017|work=Western Mass Politics &amp; Insight|date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion that there is a Tofu Curtain has also been a rallying point for people living and working on both sides of the county line to create equitable systems of [[food sovereignty]], [[workplace democracy]], and [[environmentalism|environmental justice]] as means to destratify the region economically while uniting it politically.&lt;ref name="Cassano, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drane, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drane|first1=Amanda|title=What Are You Going to Do About It?

===Elsewhere in the United States===
People use the term "tofu curtain" to describe a similar sociopolitical phenomenon outside of Western Massachusetts. Those residing in other politically or ecologically progressive regions of [[New England]], such as [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], or the entire state of [[Vermont]], are sometimes posited as living "behind the Tofu Curtain." Likewise, the term is used pejoratively by those wanting to deplore what they see as a liberal agenda, and posts referring to [[California]] as being "behind the tofu curtain" proliferate online forums that support expanding freedoms for civilian gun use.&lt;ref name="Northwest Firearms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greetings From behing The Tofu Curtain|url=https://www.northwestfirearms.com/threads/greetings-from-behing-the-tofu-curtain.27889/|website=Northwest Firearms – Oregon, Washington, and Idaho Gun Owners|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clock Forum"&gt;{{cite web|title='Sons of Guns' star arrested for....|url=http://www.glocktalk.com/threads/sons-of-guns-star-arrested-for.1539255/|website=The Leading Glock Forum and Community - GlockTalk.com|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firing Line"&gt;{{cite web|title=What kind of guns can I get in Nevada?

Tofu curtain can also be used to describe an ideological situation, not specific to the geographies of neighborhood or county lines. In a 2003 essay, [[Paul Gilroy]] described a political speak-out on a university campus and used the term "tofu curtain" as a metaphor for petty factionalizations among different strains of student activism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As peace rallies proliferate, the campus left will have to tear down the tofu curtain and dig itself out from underneath the wreckage of identity politics so narcissistic and short-sighted that it reproduces the political solipsism and imperialistic indifference that are usually associated with power and privilege.&lt;ref name="Gilroy et al, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Donald S.|last2=Kosek|first2=Jake|last3=Pandian|first3=Anand|last4=Gilroy|first4=Paul|title=Race, Nature, and the Politics of Difference|date=2003|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=0822330911|language=en|chapter=1. After the Great White Error}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly the [[Inter-Cooperative Council at the University of Michigan]] has named a dietary split between vegetarians and meat-eaters within its membership "The Tofu Curtain."   At one point an agreement among the co-ops made the split geographical, marked by a particular corner in [[Ann Arbor]] with all co-op houses on one side having "veggie" and on the other side "[[carnivore|carnie]]" kitchens. The Ann Arbor co-ops were using the term as early as 1984.&lt;ref name="Campeau, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campeau|first1=Lisa|title=Remembering the Tofu Curtain|url=http://www.icc.coop/story/alumni/cooperator/AlumCooperator2010Final.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=The Alumni Cooperator|publisher=Inter-Cooperative Council|date=2010–2011|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In [[Australian federal election, 2016|Australia's 2016 federal election]], voters south of Bell Street in [[Melbourne]]'s northern suburb of [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]] voted overwhelmingly for the [[Australian Greens|Green Party]] and those to the north went for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. While the neighborhoods that voted Labor still lean left politically, they tend to be more working class, and the [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighborhoods of Brunswick and [[North Melbourne, Victoria|North Melbourne]] went Green. The split helped nickname Bell Street the Tofu Curtain, and other nicknames proliferated, including "The [[Corduroy]] Line," "The [[Latte]] Line," "The Great Wall of [[Quinoa]]," and "The [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipster]]-Proof Fence", evoking Australia's famed "[[rabbit-proof fence]]" of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Johnston, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Chris|title=Bell tolls for Greens beyond hipster proof fence|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/federal-election-results-2016-bell-tolls-for-greens-beyond-hipster-proof-fence-20160706-gpzzi6.html|accessdate=1 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Josh|title=Greens struggling to cross Melbourne's hipster-proof fence|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/greens-struggling-to-cross-melbournes-hipsterproof-fence-20160803-gqjxup.html|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donelly, 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donelly|first1=Beau|title=The Greens march across Melbourne|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-greens-march-across-melbourne-20160708-gq1e6j.html|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=The Age|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potter, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Potter |first1=Ben |title=South of Tofu Curtain, Shorten has to take a stand on the Adani mine |url=https://www.afr.com/news/politics/election/south-of-tofu-curtain-shorten-has-to-take-a-stand-on-the-adani-mine-20180201-h0sd4f |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=Financial Review |date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutchinson |first1=Samantha |title=Greens confident of Batman win, rubbishing talk of ‘Tofu Curtain’ |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/greens-confident-of-batman-win-rubbishing-talk-of-tofu-curtain/news-story/58c9ebb99b85aff438cd5c48a26db397 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=www.theaustralian.com.au |date=March 17, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the term was used pejoratively by Australia's [[fossil fuel]] industry to divide Green Party and Labor activists from organizing together against expansion of [[coal mining]] and [[gas drilling]].&lt;ref name="SMith, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Chris |title=Greenies behind ‘tofu curtain’ blamed for suffocating mining industry |url=https://www.2gb.com/greenies-behind-tofu-curtain-blamed-for-suffocating-mining-industry/ |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=2GB 873AM |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Courier Mail, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |title='Lying' greenies accused of killing Queensland mining industry |url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/business/lying-greenies-accused-of-killing-queensland-mining-industry/news-story/c8bada0682d13acf636c07afc28b8bb9 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |work=Courier Mail |date=June 14, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Because tofu originated in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and other regions of [[East Asia]], the term "tofu curtain" has also described differences between eastern and western culture.&lt;ref name="Krummert, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krummert|first1=Bob|title=Lifting The Tofu Curtain|journal=Restaurant Hospitality|date=May 2004|volume=88|issue=5|page=22|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/15950704/lifting-tofu-curtain|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study conducted by the [[United Nations]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] showed that in one year China consumed nearly 100 times the amount of soybeans per person over the United States, while the Japan-to-U.S. per capita rate of consumption was more than 200-to-1.&lt;ref name="Otsuka"&gt;{{cite web |title=Soybean consumption {{!}} Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. |url=https://www.otsuka.co.jp/en/nutraceutical/about/soylution/encyclopedia/consumption.html |website=Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that same year the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database]] revealed that Korea's soy consumption rate fell about midway between Japan's and China's.&lt;ref name="Otsuka" /&gt; 2013 data showed these proportions to be about the same, with [[Taiwan]] consuming the highest amount of soyfoods per capita at a rate 15% higher than that of Japan's.&lt;ref name="FAOSTAT, 2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=FAOSTAT |url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CC |website=www.fao.org |publisher=The United NAtions |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ethnicity and diet are considerations in this particular usage, political leanings are a lessor factor on the Asian side of the curtain, as tofu is a dietary staple in Asia and therefore not associated with particular political parties, movements, or factions.&lt;ref name="Shurtleff and Aoyagi, 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shurtleff|first1=William|last2=Aoyagi|first2=Akiko|title=History of Tofu and Tofu Products (965 CE to 2013)|date=2013|publisher=Soyinfo Center|location=Lafayette, CA|isbn=9781928914556|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
In September 2016 Western Massachusetts residents launched ''TofuCurtain.com'', a site for "Satire and Commentary in the Pioneer Valley." Among the site's earliest stories were "Recent Graduate Will Shave, Cut Hair After Finding Job," "[[WikiLeaks]] Release Reveals Town of [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] Extremely Boring," "[[Hampshire College]] Replaces [[American Flag]] with 'For Sale' Sign," and "New Privilege Checkpoint at Coolidge Bridge raises Traffic Concerns.

The '''Tsakhur''' or '''Caxur''' ({{lang-az|saxurlar}}, {{lang-ru|цахурский}}) people are an ethnic group of northern [[Azerbaijan]] and southern [[Dagestan]] ([[Russia]]). They number about 30,000 and call themselves ''yiqy'' (pl. ''yiqby''), but are generally known by the name ''Tsakhur'', which derives from the name of a Dagestani village, where they make up the majority.

==History==
Tsakhurs are first mentioned in the 7th-century [[Armenia]]n and [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] sources where they are named ''Tsakhaik''. After the conquest of [[Caucasian Albania]] by the [[Arabs]], Tsakhurs formed a semi-independent state (later a [[sultanate]]) of [[Tsuketi]] and southwestern Dagestan. By the 11th century, Tsakhurs who had mostly been [[Christian]], converted to [[Islam]]. From the 15th century some began moving south across the mountains to what is now the [[Zaqatala District]] of Azerbaijan. In the 18th century the capital of the state moved south from [[Tsakhur (village)|Tsakhur]] in Dagestan to [[İlisu]] and came to be called the [[Elisu Sultanate]]. West of the Sultanate Tsakhurs formed the [[Djaro-Belokani]] free communities. The sultanate was in the sphere of influence of the [[Shaki Khanate]]. It became part of the [[Russian Empire]] by the beginning of the 19th century.

==Geography==
Tsakhurs live in Azerbaijan's [[Zaqatala District|Zaqatala region]], where they make up 14% of the population, and in [[Gakh]], where they constitute less than 2%. In Dagestan, they live in the mountainous parts of the [[Rutulsky district]]. According to [[Wolfgang Schulze]], there are 9 villages in Azerbaijan, where Tsakhurs make up the majority of the population, all of them in Zaqatala. 13 more villages in Zaqatala and Gakh have a significant Tsakhur minority.&lt;ref name="slsta"&gt;[http://www.sil.org/silesr/2005/silesr2005-016.pdf The Sociolinguistic Situation of the Tsakhur in Azerbaijan] by John M. Clifton et al. ''SIL International'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Most Tsakhurs speak the [[Tsakhur language]] as their native language. The rate of [[bilingualism]] in Tsakhur and [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] is high. Other languages popular among Tsakhurs include [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

'''World energy resources''' are the estimated maximum capacity for energy production given all available resources on [[Earth]]. They can be divided by type into [[fossil fuel]], [[nuclear fuel]] and [[renewable resource]]s.

== Fossil fuel ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

Remaining reserves of fossil fuel are estimated as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2010_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2010.pdf  Proven energy reserves, BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
!width="100"|'''   Fuel   '''
!width="150"|'''Proven energy reserves in [[Zetta-|Z]][[Joule|J]] (end of 2009)'''
|-
|   Coal  || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19.8
|-
|   Gas   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36.4
|-
|   Oil   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8.9
|}

These are the proven energy reserves; real reserves may be up to a factor 4 larger. Significant uncertainty exists for these numbers. Estimating the remaining fossil fuels on the planet depends on a detailed understanding of Earth's crust. While modern drilling technology makes it possible to drill wells in up to 3&amp;nbsp;km of water to verify the exact composition of the geology, one half of the [[ocean]] is deeper than 3&amp;nbsp;km, leaving about a third of the planet beyond the reach of detailed analysis.

In addition to uncertainty in real reserves, there is significant uncertainty in technological and economical factors that impact what percentage of reserves can be recovered gainfully. In general the easiest to reach deposits are the first extracted. Factors affecting the cost of exploiting the remaining reserves include the accessibility of fossil deposits, the level of sulfur and other pollutants in the oil and the coal, transportation costs, and societal instability in producing regions.

===Coal===
{{Main article|Coal#World_coal_reserves|l1=World coal reserves}}
Coal is the most abundant and burned fossil fuel. This was the fuel that launched the industrial revolution and has continued to grow in use; China, which already has many of the world's most polluted cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,501031124-543833,00.html The Middle Landfill]&lt;/ref&gt; was in 2007 building about two coal-fired power plants every week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6769743.stm  China building more power plants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/041707/opi_opinion1.shtml COAL: Scrubbing its future]&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is the fastest growing fossil fuel and its large reserves would make it a popular candidate to meet the energy demand of the global community, short of global warming concerns and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11chinacoal.html Pollution From Chinese Coal Casts a Global Shadow] accessed 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Energy Agency]] the proven reserves of coal are around 909 billion tonnes, which could sustain the current production rate for 155 years,&lt;ref&gt;IEA (2006), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; although at a 5% growth per annum this would be reduced to 45 years, or until 2051. With the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] it is possible to make liquid fuels such as diesel and jet fuel from coal. In the United States, 49% of electricity generation comes from burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat1p1.html EIA sources of electricity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
{{Main article|Natural gas}}
Natural gas is a widely available fossil fuel with estimated 850 000&amp;nbsp;km³ in recoverable reserves and at least that much more using enhanced methods to release shale gas.  Improvements in technology and wide exploration led to a major increase in recoverable natural gas reserves as shale fracking methods were developed.  At present usage rates, natural gas could supply most of the world's energy needs for between 100 and 250 years, depending on increase in consumption over time.

===Oil===
{{See also|Oil reserves|Peak oil}}
It is estimated that there may be 57&amp;nbsp;ZJ of oil reserves on Earth (although estimates vary from a low of 8&amp;nbsp;ZJ,&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Statistical Review of World Energy 2009]], [[BP]] | url = http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | title = Consumption by fuel, 1965 - 2008 | format = XLS | date = July 31, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708203819/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | archivedate = July 8, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of currently proven and recoverable reserves, to a maximum of 110&amp;nbsp;ZJ&lt;ref name="Oil Gas Industry Stats"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oiljobsource.com/oil-gas-industry-statistics.html|title=Oil Gas Industry Stats| publisher= oiljobsource.com| accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) consisting of available, but not necessarily recoverable reserves, and including optimistic estimates for unconventional sources such as [[tar sands|oil sands]] and [[oil shale]]. Current consensus among the 18 recognized estimates of supply profiles is that the peak of extraction will occur in 2020 at the rate of 93-million barrels per day (mbd). Current oil consumption is at the rate of 0.18&amp;nbsp;ZJ per year (31.1 billion barrels) or 85 mbd.

There is growing concern that [[peak oil|peak oil production]] may be reached in the near future, resulting in severe [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price increases]].&lt;ref name="wsj111907golddavis"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also theories that peak of the global oil production may occur in as little as 2–3 years. The ASPO predicts peak year to be in 2010. Some other theories present the view that it has already taken place in 2005. World crude oil production (including lease condensates) according to [[US EIA]] data decreased from a peak of 73.720 mbd in 2005 to 73.437 in 2006, 72.981 in 2007, and 73.697 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t41d.xls International Petroleum Monthly] Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to peak oil theory, increasing production will lead to a more rapid collapse of production in the future, while decreasing production will lead to a slower decrease, as the [[Normal distribution|bell-shaped curve]] will be spread out over more years.

In a stated goal of increasing oil prices to $75/barrel, which had fallen from a high of $147 to a low of $40, [[OPEC]] announced decreasing production by 2.2 mbd beginning 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7786456.stm Opec agrees record oil output cut] retrieved 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
Political considerations over the security of supplies, environmental concerns related to [[global warming]] and [[sustainability]] are expected to move the world's energy consumption away from fossil fuels. The concept of [[peak oil]] shows that about half of the available petroleum resources have been produced, and predicts a decrease of production.

A government moves away from fossil fuels would most likely create economic pressure through [[emissions trading|carbon emissions]] and [[green tax]]ation. Some countries are taking action as a result of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and further steps in this direction are proposed. For example, the [[European Commission]] has proposed that the [[energy policy of the European Union]] should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% in 2007 to 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="roadmap21"&gt;{{cite web | title = Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Renewable Energy Roadmap: Renewable Energies in the 21st century; building a sustainable future - COM(2006) 848 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Commission of the European Communities | date = 10 January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128104118/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | archivedate = 28 January 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of sustainability is a disregard for limits, commonly referred to as the Easter Island Effect, which is the concept of being unable to develop sustainability, resulting in the depletion of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/nemetz/jibe.pdf Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimate that, assuming current consumption rates, current oil reserves could be completely depleted by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Proved1 Reserves of Oil and Natural Gas, Most Recent Estimates|url=http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=14 November 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217151346/http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|archivedate=17 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fuel==
{{See also|Nuclear power|Nuclear energy policy}}

===Nuclear energy===
{{See also|Nuclear fuel}}
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] estimates the remaining uranium resources to be equal to 2500&amp;nbsp;ZJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Global Ur Resources to Meet Projected Demand: Latest Edition of "Red Book" Predicts Consistent Supply Up to 2025| url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/uranium_resources.html | date = 2 June 2006 | publisher = International Atomic Energy Agency | accessdate= 2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumes the use of [[breeder reactor]]s, which are able to create more [[fissile]] material than they consume. [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimated currently proved economically recoverable uranium deposits for once-through fuel cycles reactors to be only 2 ZJ. The ultimately recoverable uranium is estimated to be 17 ZJ for once-through reactors and 1000 ZJ with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Nakicenovic, Nebojsa| title= IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios |url= http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/071.htm| publisher = Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | accessdate=2007-02-20|display-authors=etal}} [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources and technology do not constrain the capacity of nuclear power to contribute to meeting the energy demand for the 21st century. However, political and environmental concerns about [[nuclear safety]] and [[radioactive waste]] started to limit the growth of this energy supply at the end of last century, particularly due to a number of [[List of civilian nuclear accidents|nuclear accidents]]. Concerns about [[nuclear proliferation]] (especially with [[plutonium]] produced by breeder reactors) mean that the development of nuclear power by countries such as [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]] and [[Syria]] is being actively discouraged by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7364269.stm |title=Syria 'had covert nuclear scheme' |newspaper=BBC News |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at the beginning of the 21st century uranium is the primary nuclear fuel worldwide, others such as thorium and hydrogen had been under investigation since the middle of the 20th century.

Thorium reserves significantly exceed those of uranium, and of course hydrogen is abundant. It is also considered by many to be easier to obtain than [[uranium]]. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, [[thorium]] is taken from open pits, and is estimated to be roughly three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, numerous facilities throughout the world have burned [[Thorium]].

===Nuclear fusion===
Alternatives for energy production through fusion of hydrogen has been under investigation since the 1950s.  No materials can withstand the temperatures required to ignite the fuel, so it must be confined by methods which use no materials.  Magnetic and inertial confinement are the main alternatives ([[Cadarache]], [[Inertial confinement fusion]]) both of which are hot research topics in the early years of the 21st century.

[[Fusion power]] is the process driving the sun and other stars. It generates large quantities of heat by fusing the nuclei of hydrogen or helium isotopes, which may be derived from seawater. The heat can theoretically be harnessed to generate electricity. The temperatures and pressures needed to sustain fusion make it a very difficult process to control. Fusion is theoretically able to supply vast quantities of energy, with relatively little pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm Fusion Energy: Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021002/http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA).  2006.  Retrieved on 2007-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although both the United States and the European Union, along with other countries, are supporting fusion research (such as investing in the [[ITER]] facility), according to one report, inadequate research has stalled progress in fusion research for the past 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/us_fusion50yr_dean.pdf Fifty years of U.S. fusion research - An overview of programs st]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable resources==
{{Main article|Renewable resource}}
Renewable resources are available each year, unlike non-renewable resources, which are eventually depleted. A simple comparison is a coal mine and a forest. While the forest could be depleted, if it is managed it represents a continuous supply of energy, vs. the coal mine, which once has been exhausted is gone. Most of earth's available energy resources are renewable resources. Renewable resources account for more than 93 percent of total U.S. energy reserves. Annual renewable resources were multiplied times thirty years for comparison with non-renewable resources. In other words, if all non-renewable resources were uniformly exhausted in 30 years, they would only account for 7 percent of available resources each year, if all available renewable resources were developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/pub_summaries/renew_es.html Renewable Resources in the U.S. Electricity Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar energy===
{{Main article|Solar energy}}
Renewable energy sources are even larger than the traditional fossil fuels and in theory can easily supply the world's energy needs. 89&amp;nbsp;PW&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tester | first = Jefferson W. | authorlink = | title = Sustainable Energy: Choosing Among Options | publisher = The MIT Press | date = 2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-262-20153-4 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers are needed on all book sources, pls fill in for Tester --&gt; of solar power falls on the planet's surface. While it is not possible to capture all, or even most, of this energy, capturing less than 0.02% would be enough to meet the current energy needs. Barriers to further solar generation include the high price of making [[solar cells]] and reliance on weather patterns to generate electricity. Also, current solar generation does not produce electricity at night, which is a particular problem in high northern and southern latitude countries; energy demand is highest in winter, while availability of solar energy is lowest. This could be overcome by buying power from countries closer to the equator during winter months, and may also be addressed with technological developments such as the development of inexpensive energy storage. Globally, solar generation is the fastest growing source of energy, seeing an annual average growth of 35% over the past few years. [[Japan]], [[Europe]], [[China]], [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Solar power in India|India]] are the major growing investors in solar energy. Solar power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power===
{{Main article|Wind power}}
The available wind energy estimates range from 300&amp;nbsp;TW to 870&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcep.stanford.edu/research/exergycharts.html Exergy Flow Charts]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the lower estimate, just 5% of the available wind energy would supply the current worldwide energy needs. Most of this wind energy is available over the open ocean. The [[ocean]]s cover 71% of the planet and wind tends to blow more strongly over open water because there are fewer obstructions.

===Wave and tidal power===
{{Main article|Wave power|Tidal power}}
At the end of 2005, 0.3&amp;nbsp;GW of electricity was produced by [[tidal power]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century | title = Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[tidal forces]] created by the Moon (68%) and the Sun (32%), and the Earth's relative rotation with respect to Moon and Sun, there are fluctuating tides. These tidal fluctuations result in [[dissipation]] at an average rate of about 3.7 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0967-0637(98)00070-3 | volume=45 | title=Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing | year=1998 | journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers | pages=1977–2010 | last1 = Munk | first1 = Walter| bibcode=1998DSRI...45.1977M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical limitation is the energy available in the tidal fluctuations of the oceans, which is about 0.6 EJ ([[exa]][[joule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Marchuk, G.I. and Kagan, B.A. (1989) "Dynamics of Ocean Tides", Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-277-2552-3}}. See page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Note this is only a tiny fraction of the total [[rotational energy|rotational energy of the Earth]]. Without forcing, this energy would be dissipated (at a dissipation rate of 3.7 TW) in about four [[Half|semi]]-[[Day|diurnal]] tide periods. So, dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans. Therefore, this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 TW (20% of the dissipation rate) in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Waves are derived from wind, which is in turn derived from solar energy, and at each conversion there is a drop of about two orders of magnitude in available energy. The total power of waves that wash against the earth's shores adds up to 3 TW.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, et al., p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal power}}
Estimates of exploitable worldwide [[geothermal power|geothermal energy]] resources vary considerably, depending on assumed investments in technology and exploration and guesses about geological formations. According to a 1999 study, it was thought that this might amount to between 65 and 138&amp;nbsp;GW of electrical generation capacity 'using enhanced technology'.&lt;ref&gt;

A 2006 report by [[MIT]] that took into account the use of [[Enhanced Geothermal System]]s (EGS) concluded that it would be affordable to generate 100&amp;nbsp;GWe (gigawatts of electricity) or more by 2050, just in the [[United States]], for a maximum investment of 1 billion US dollars in research and development over 15 years.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[MIT]] | title = The Future of Geothermal Energy | url = http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT report calculated the world's total EGS resources to be over 13&amp;nbsp;YJ, of which over 200&amp;nbsp;ZJ would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2&amp;nbsp;YJ with technology improvements - sufficient to provide all the world's energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; The total heat content of the Earth is 13,000,000 YJ.&lt;ref name="GEO" /&gt;

===Biomass===
{{Main article|biomass|biofuel}}
Production of biomass and biofuels are growing industries as interest in sustainable fuel sources is growing. Utilizing waste products avoids a [[food vs fuel]] trade-off, and burning [[Methane|methane gas]] reduces greenhouse gas emissions, because even though it releases carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is 23 times less of a greenhouse gas than is methane. Biofuels represent a sustainable partial replacement for fossil fuels, but their net impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions depends on the agricultural practices used to grow the plants used as feedstock to create the fuels. While it is widely believed that biofuels can be carbon-neutral, there is evidence that biofuels produced by current farming methods are substantial net carbon emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Rosenthal | first=Elisabeth | title=Biofuels Deemed a Greenhouse Threat | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=2008-02-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/science/earth/08wbiofuels.html}} Registration required. "Almost all biofuels used today cause more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels if the full emissions costs of producing these “green” fuels are taken into account, two studies being published Thursday have concluded."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Farigone | first1=Joseph | last2=Hill | first2=Jason | last3=Tillman | first3=David | last4=Polasky | first4=Stephen | last5=Hawthorne | first5=Peter | title=Land Clearing and the Biofuel Carbon Debt | journal=Science | volume=319 | pages=1235–1238 | date=2008-02-29 | doi=10.1126/science.1152747 | pmid=18258862 | issue=5867 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;| bibcode=2008Sci...319.1235F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Searchinger | first1=Timothy | last2=Heimlich | first2=Ralph | last3=Houghton | first3=R.
