An '''art squat''' is a name used to describe the action of artists to occupy (or [[Squatting|squat]] in) an abandoned building, thereby creating studio space to create art. Art squats often have a semi-legal or illegal status.

[[Kunsthaus Tacheles|Tacheles]], in [[Berlin]], Germany, was one of many buildings occupied by artists in the years after [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/writings-on-the-wall-for-art-squat/2009/01/26/1232818332460.html?page=fullpage "Writing's on the wall for art squat"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', January 27, 2009. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to operate as a studio space and gallery until 2012, when the authorities closed it for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jones, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/05/closure-tacheles-berlin-sad-alternative-art "The closure of Berlin's Tacheles squat is a sad day for alternative art"], Jonathan Jones on Art (blog), ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 5, 2012. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris, France, has experienced several decades of art squats, a result of high rents and a large [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artist population.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/travel/31headsup.html?_r=1&amp; "In Paris, Art Fills the Void"], ''The New York Times (travel)'', January 26, 2010. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples include the [[Bateau-Lavoir]] (destroyed during the 1970s) and Hôpital Éphémère, occupied during the 1980s and 90s.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void" /&gt; In the 2000s the Paris city hall began an initiative to redevelop and legalise the city's art squats, beginning with a 6-storey squat on [[rue de Rivoli, Paris|rue de Rivoli]] which was renovated and reopened in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void" /&gt;

Art Squat was also the name of an Artists Collective co-founded by [[Johnny Otto]] in [[Los Angeles]] in the early 90's, which took over abandoned properties in the Fairfax District and converted them into Galleries. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.artrevealmagazine.com/johnny-otto-ottophobia-conspiracy-propaganda-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Augustan History''''' ([[Latin]]: ''Historia Augusta'') is a late Roman collection of [[biographies]], written in Latin, of the [[Roman Emperor]]s, their junior colleagues, [[Caesar (title)|designated heirs]] and [[Roman usurper|usurpers]] of the period 117 to 284. Supposedly modeled on the similar work of [[Suetonius]], ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', it presents itself as a compilation of works by six different authors (collectively known as the ''Scriptores Historiae Augustae''), written during the reigns of [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I]] and addressed to those emperors or other important personages in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The collection, as extant, comprises thirty biographies, most of which contain the life of a single emperor, while some include a group of two or more, grouped together merely because these emperors were either similar or contemporaneous.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xii}}

However, the true authorship of the work, its actual date, and its purpose, have long been matters for controversy amongst historians and scholars, ever since [[Hermann Dessau]] in 1889 rejected both the date and the authorship as stated within the manuscript. Major problems include the nature of the sources it used, and how much of the content is pure fiction. For instance, the collection contains in all about 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations. Virtually all of these are now considered to be fraudulent.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xx–xxi}}

By the second decade of the 21st century, the overall consensus supported the position that there was only a single author who was writing either at the end of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. There is further consensus that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to [[Cicero]] and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.{{sfn|Breisach|2007|p=75}}

==Title and scope==
The name ''Historia Augusta'' originated with [[Isaac Casaubon]], who produced a critical edition in 1603, working from a complex [[manuscript]] tradition with a number of variant versions.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xi}} The title as recorded on the ''Codex Palatinus'' manuscript (written in the 9th century) is ''Vitae Diversorum Principum et Tyrannorum a Divo Hadriano usque ad Numerianum Diversis compositae'' ("The Lives of various Emperors and Tyrants from the Divine Hadrian to Numerian by Various Authors"), and it is assumed that the work may have been originally called ''de Vita Caesarum'' or ''Vitae Caesarum''.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xi}}

How widely the work was circulated in late antiquity is unknown, but its earliest use was in a ''Roman History'' composed by [[Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus]] in 485.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=20}} Lengthy citations from it are found in authors of the 6th and 9th centuries, including [[Sedulius Scottus]] who quoted parts of the ''Marcus Aurelius'', the ''Maximini'' and the ''Aurelian'' within his ''Liber de Rectoribus Christianis'', and the chief manuscripts also date from the 9th or 10th centuries.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxiv–xxv}} The six ''Scriptores'' – "Aelius Spartianus", "Julius Capitolinus", "Vulcacius Gallicanus", "[[Aelius Lampridius]]", "Trebellius Pollio", and "Flavius Vopiscus (of Syracuse)" – dedicate their biographies to [[Diocletian]], [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] and various private persons, and so ostensibly were all writing around the late 3rd and early 4th century. The first four ''scriptores'' are attached to the lives from [[Hadrian]] to [[Gordian III]], while the final two are attached to the lives from [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] to [[Numerian]].

The biographies cover the emperors from Hadrian to [[Carinus]] and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of [[Philip the Arab]], [[Decius]], [[Trebonianus Gallus]], [[Aemilian]] and all but the end of the reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts,{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=9}} and it has been argued that biographies of [[Nerva]] and [[Trajan]] have also been lost{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=9}} at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]''. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century lacuna might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.{{sfn|Birley|1967|pp=125–130}}

Despite devoting whole books to ephemeral or in some cases non-existent usurpers,{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=118–119}}{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=277}} there are no independent biographies of the Emperors [[Quintillus]] and [[Marcus Annius Florianus|Florian]], whose reigns are merely briefly noted towards the end of the biographies of their respective predecessors, [[Claudius Gothicus]] and [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus|Tacitus]]. For nearly 300 years after Casaubon's edition, though much of the ''Augustan History'' was treated with some scepticism, it was used by historians as an authentic source – [[Edward Gibbon]] used it extensively in the first volume of the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=12}} However, "in modern times most scholars read the work as a piece of deliberate mystification written much later than its purported date, however the fundamentalist view still has distinguished support. (...)  The ''Historia Augusta'' is also, unfortunately, the principal Latin source for a century of Roman history.  The historian must make use of it, but only with extreme circumspection and caution."{{sfn|Browning|1983|pp=43,45}}

== Textual transmission ==
Existing manuscripts and witnesses of the ''Augustan History'' fall into three groups:

# A manuscript of the first quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (''Codex Palatinus''), known as '''P''', and its direct and indirect copies. P was written at [[Lorsch]] in [[Caroline minuscule]]. The text in this manuscript has several ''[[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]]'' marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between ''Verus'' and ''Alexander'', and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in ''Carus''.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxxiii}} P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as [[Petrarch]] and [[Poggio Bracciolini]]; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=354f}}
# A group of 15th century manuscripts, designated as '''Σ'''. Not only are the lives rearranged in chronological order, but the corruptions present in P have been subjected to drastic emendations or omitted altogether. Beginning with Dr. Ernst Hohl, some have asserted that the improvements in the text come from a source independent of P. Although admitting that "this question still remains to be answered definitively", author Peter Marshall noted that research undertaken through to the 1980s had improved scholarly knowledge concerning the methods and abilities of early Italian humanists, and concludes by saying that "the Σ manuscripts nowhere provide readings which are beyond the powers of the humanists active at the time.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=355}}
# Three different sets of excerpts, one of which [[Theodor Mommsen]] suggested was possibly the work of Sedulius Scottus. How any are related to P is unclear.{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=356}}

In Marshall's opinion, the best scholarly editions are those by H. Peter (Teubner, 2nd ed. 1884), &amp; E. Hohl (Teubner, 1971, reissue of 1965 revised by Ch. Samberger &amp; W. Seyfarth).{{sfn|Marshall|1983|p=354f}}

A later version of the Codex Palatinus (possibly a version that was made for Petrarch in 1356) was the basis of the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''History'', published in [[Milan]] in 1475. A subsequent printed version (the Aldine edition) was published at [[Venice]] in 1516, and this was followed closely by an edition edited by [[Desiderius Erasmus]], and published by [[Johann Froben]] in [[Basel]] in 1518.{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxviii}}

==The dating problem==
[[File:Hermann Dessau.jpg|thumb|Hermann Dessau, whose groundbreaking work on the ''Historia Augusta'' led to its critical re-evaluation in the 20th century]]
In 1776, Gibbon had observed that there was something wrong with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Gerardus Vossius]], who published ''de Historicis Latinis'' in 1627, discussed the problem of the distribution of the various vitae among the ''scriptores'', but also the problems about the authors cited by them. [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont]], who published ''Histoire des Empereurs et des autres Princes qui ont régné durant les six premiers Siècles de l'Eglise'' in 1690, provided a wholesale denunciation of the biographies as being worthless, full of contradictions and chronological errors.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=7}}{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxx–xxxi}} A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who was meant to be writing his biographies in 305-6.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=11}} Then in 1889, [[Hermann Dessau]], who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, [[Vulgar Latin]] vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious [[persona]]e, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of [[Theodosius I]].{{sfn|Magie|1921|p=xxxii}}{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=1}} Among his supporting evidence was that the life of [[Septimius Severus]] appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian [[Aurelius Victor]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sev. 17.5–19.4 was copied from Victor, Caes. 20.1 and 10–30; in both passages there is a major error, which mixes up the emperor [[Didius Julianus]] with the legal scholar Salvius Julianus&lt;/ref&gt; and that the life of [[Marcus Aurelius]] likewise uses material from [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;MA 16.3–18.2 was lifted from Eutropius 8.11&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}} In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve at least some of the six ''Scriptores'' as distinct persons and in favour of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, [[Theodor Mommsen]] postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the ''Scriptores''' work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=2}} Hermann Peter (editor of the ''Augustan History'' and of the ''[[Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae]]'') proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language.{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=113}} Others, such as [[Norman H. Baynes]], abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of [[Julian the Apostate]] (useful for arguing the work was intended as [[Paganism|pagan]] propaganda).{{sfn|Baynes|1926|pp=169-169}}

In the 1960s and 1970s however Dessau's original arguments received powerful restatement and expansion from Sir [[Ronald Syme]], who devoted three books to the subject and was prepared to date the writing of the work closely in the region of AD 395. Other recent studies also show much consistency of style,{{sfn|Hornblower|Spawforth|Eidinow|2012|p=691}} and most scholars now accept the theory of a single author of unknown identity, writing after 395.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=19}} Although it was believed that the ''History Augusta'' did not reference any material from [[Ammianus Marcellinus]]' history, which was finished before 391 and which covered the same period,{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=13–14}} this has now been shown not to be the case, and that the ''Historia Augusta'' does in fact make reference to Ammianus' history.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=20}}

Not all scholars have accepted the theory of a forger working around the last decades of the 4th century or the beginning of the 5th. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]]{{sfn|Momigliano|1954|pp=22–46}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1969|pp=566–569}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1973|pp=114–115}} and [[A. H. M. Jones]]{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=1071, Note 1}} were the most prominent 20th century critics of the Dessau-Syme theory amongst English-speaking scholars. Momigliano, summarizing the literature from Dessau down to 1954, defined the question as "res iudicanda" (i.e. "a matter to be decided") and not as "res iudicata" ("a matter that has been decided"). Momigliano reviewed every book published on the topic by Sir Ronald Syme, and provided counter arguments to most if not all of Syme's arguments.{{sfn|Momigliano|1969|pp=566–569}}{{sfn|Momigliano|1973|pp=114–115}} For instance, the reference in the ''Life of Probus'' about the emperor's descendants which has been taken to refer to [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] (consul in 371) and his family may, in the opinion of Momigliano, equally refer to the earlier members of the family, which was prominent throughout the 4th century, such as [[Petronius Probinus (consul 341)|Petronius Probinus]] (consul in 341) and [[Petronius Probianus]] (consul in 322).{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=121}} Momigliano's opinion was that there was insufficient evidence to dismiss a composition date of the early 4th century, and that any post-Constantinian anachronisms could be explained by an editor working on the material at a later date, perhaps during the reigns of [[Constantius II]] or [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]].{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|pp=125, 133}}

Other opinions included Dr H Stern's, who postulated that the ''History'' was composed by a team of writers during the reign of Constantius II after the defeat of [[Magnentius]] on behalf of the [[Senate of the Roman Empire|Senatorial aristocracy]] who had supported the usurper.{{sfn|Momigliano|1984|p=140}} In the 21st century, [[Alan Cameron (classical scholar)|Alan Cameron]] rebutted a number of Syme's and Barnes' arguments for a composition date c.395–400, suggesting a composition date between 361 and the 380s.{{sfn|Cameron|2010|pp=743–746}}

==Six ''scriptores'' or a single author?==
Linked to the problem of dating the composition of the ''History'' is the question about the authorship of the work. Taking the ''History'' at face value, there is clearly a division between the authors named prior and after the presence of the interrupting lacuna. For the first half of the ''History'', four ''scriptores'' are present, and the biographies are divided in a remarkably erratic fashion:{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=12}}
* '''Aelius Spartianus''' (7 lives): ''Hadrian'', ''Aelius'', ''Didius Julianus'', ''Severus'', ''Niger'', ''Caracalla'' and ''Geta''.
* '''Julius Capitolinus''' (9 lives): ''Antoninus'', ''Marcus'', ''Lucius Verus'', ''Pertinax'', ''Albinus'', ''Macrinus'', ''The Maximini'', ''The Gordiani'', and ''Maximus and Balbinus''.
* '''Vulcacius Gallicanus''' (1 life): ''Avidius Cassius''.
* '''Aelius Lampridius''' (4 lives): ''Commodus'', ''Diadumenus'', ''Heliogabalus'' and ''Severus Alexander''.

Of these four, Spartianus and Gallicanus claim to be undertaking  a complete set of imperial biographies from [[Julius Caesar]] onwards, while Lampridius' stated intention was to write a collection of biographies that would deal with the Gordians, Claudius II, Aurelian, Diocletian, Maximian and the four rivals of Constantine. Capitolinus also implied that he was writing more biographies than are present in the ''History''.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=11–12}}

The second half of the ''History'' is divided between two ''scriptores''. Unlike the first half, the emperors tackled in this section are grouped logically, and are divided roughly in half between the two ''scriptores'' in chronological sequence:
* '''Trebellius Pollio''' (4 lives): ''Valerian'', ''Gallienus'', ''Tyranni Triginta'' and ''Claudius''.
* '''Flavius Vopiscus Syracusanus''' (5 lives): ''Aurelian'', ''Tacitus'', ''Probus'', ''Quadrigae Tyrannorum'' and ''Carus, Carinus and Numerian''.

In terms of any acknowledgement of the mutual existence between the ''scriptores'', only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the ''Aurelian'', Vopiscus refers to Constantinus Chlorus as emperor and Diocletian as a private citizen, dating this composition between Diocletian's abdication on 1 May 305 and Constantius' death on 25 July 306&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=10}} refers to any of the other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=10}} However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the ''Albinus'', ''Maximini'' and ''Gordiani'' he addresses Constantine in a fashion that suggests he is writing after 306.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=11}}

The theory that there was a single author, as initially postulated by [[Hermann Dessau]], is based on the difficulties inherent in having a single work comprising a number of individuals but without any textual evidence of an editor who brought the material together. This is especially evident in that the text has examples of stated intentions by an author to write a life of one of the emperors, only for that life to be completed by another of the ''scriptores''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For example, Spartianus declares that he is going to write a life of Verus, but that life is attributed to Capitolinus.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} If those statements are true, and those additional lives were completed, then an editor must have been involved in the project in order to select one ''scriptor'''s life over another's.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}}

However, the presence of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by [[Theodore Mommsen]], still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of the second half of the ''History'', operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=182}} He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the ''History'' means they cannot have been written by the same author.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=182}}

Nevertheless, if the validity of six independent authors is accepted, there are still issues, as the way they approached their work does show similar themes and details.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} All six not only provide biographies for the emperors, but also for the ''Caesars'' and usurpers. They describe their work and approach in very similar language, and quote otherwise unknown historians and biographers, such as Junius Cordus. They collectively share many errors, such as calling [[Diadumenian]]us "Diadumenus".{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} They also share much idiosyncratic content and similar language, with particular focus on women, wine and military discipline, and were fixated on poor plays on words ascribing personality traits to certain emperors, for instance Verus was truthful, while Severus was a severe individual.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} Additionally, the authors shared certain stylistic characteristics that has been suggested would not naturally occur between individuals writing separately. For instance, the authors all happen to use the word ''occido'' with respect to killing (a total of 42 occurrences), but only once do any of them use the alternative word of ''interficio''. This ratio is not found with any other writers in this time period and for this genre.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=5}} Finally, each of the six ''scriptores'' authored fictional lives for some of their biographies, all of them using fake sources, documents and acclamations.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=6}}

It has been postulated that the names of the ''scriptores'' themselves are also a form of literary playfulness, not only mocking both legitimate authors and historians, but also the narrative itself.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=20–21}} The names Trebellius Pollio and Flavius Vopiscus are sourced in various ways from [[Cicero]]'s writings,{{sfn|Birley|2006|pp=25–27}} as is the name Capitolinus.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=23}} Further, the word ''vopiscus'' is a rare Latin term, referring to a twin who survives, while its sibling died ''in utero''; this has been interpreted to refer to "Flavius Vopiscus" as being the final one to survive from the six authors of the ''History''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=23}} Vulcacius is believed to be a mockery of [[Volcatius Sedigitus]], who was a historical literary critic with some association with humor. The meanings behind the other two ''scriptores'' (Spartianus and Lampridius) have eluded interpretation.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=23–24}}

Finally, it should also be noted that the results of recent computer-assisted stylistic analysis concerning the single vs multiple authorship have proven to be inconclusive:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Computer]]-aided stylistic analysis of the work has, however, returned ambiguous results; some elements of style are quite uniform throughout the work, while others vary in a way that suggests multiple authorship. To what extent this is due to the fact that portions of the work are obviously compiled from multiple sources is unclear. Several computer analyses of the text have been done to determine whether there were multiple authors. Many of them conclude that there was but a single author, but disagree on methodology. However, several studies done by the same team concluded there were several authors, though they were not sure how many."{{sfn|Prickman|2013|loc=University of Iowa's website}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Primary and secondary Vitae==
A unique feature of the ''Augustan History'' is that it purports to supply the biographies not only of reigning Emperors (called "primary lives" by modern scholars), but also "secondary lives" of their designated heirs, junior colleagues, and usurpers who unsuccessfully claimed the supreme power.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=54–57}} Thus among the biographies of 2nd-century and early 3rd-century figures are included [[Hadrian]]'s heir [[Lucius Aelius|Aelius Caesar]], and the usurpers [[Avidius Cassius]], [[Pescennius Niger]] and [[Clodius Albinus]], [[Caracalla]]'s brother [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Macrinus]]' son [[Diadumenianus]]. None of these pieces contain much in the way of solid information: all are marked by rhetorical padding and obvious fiction. The biography of Marcus Aurelius' colleague [[Lucius Verus]], which Mommsen thought 'secondary', is however rich in apparently reliable information and has been vindicated by Syme as belonging to the 'primary' series.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=56–57}}

The 'secondary' lives allowed the author to exercise freedom in the invention of events, places and people without the need to conform to authentic historical facts.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=13–14}} As the work proceeds the author's inventiveness undergoes an increasing degree of elaboration as legitimate historical sources begin to run out, eventually composing largely fictional accounts such as the "biographies" of the [[Thirty Tyrants (Roman)|"Thirty Tyrants"]], whom the author claimed had risen as usurpers under [[Gallienus]]. Moreover, after the biography of [[Caracalla]] the 'primary' biographies, of the emperors themselves, begin to assume the rhetorical and fictive qualities previously confined to the 'secondary' ones, probably because the secondary lives were written after the ''Life of Caracalla''.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=44, 211, 214}}

The biography of [[Macrinus]] is notoriously unreliable,{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=57–59}} and after a partial reversion to reliability in the ''[[Elagabalus|Life of Elagabalus]]'', the ''[[Alexander Severus]]'', one of the longest biographies in the entire work, develops into a kind of exemplary and rhetorical fable on the theme of the wise [[philosopher king]].{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=146–150}} Clearly the author's previous sources had given out, but also his inventive talents were developing. He still makes use of some recognized sources – [[Herodian]] up to 238, and probably [[Dexippus]] in the later books, for the entire imperial period the ''[[Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte]]'' as well as [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and [[Jerome]] – but the biographies are increasingly tracts of invention in which occasional nuggets of fact are embedded.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=14}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=20}}

However, even where recognisable facts are present, their use in the ''History'' cannot be taken at face value. In the ''Life of Alexander Severus'', the ''History'' makes the claim at 24.4 that [[Severus Alexander|Alexander]] had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor [[Philip the Arab|Philip]] did later ban the practice.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=151}} Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true – the source of this is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the ''Kaisergeschichte''), and the ''History'' even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the ''Kaisergeschichte''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|pp=150–151}} Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the ''Kaisergeschichte''.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=151}}

==Genre and purpose==
Interpretations of the purpose of the ''History'' also vary considerably, some considering it a work of fiction or [[satire]] intended to entertain (perhaps in the vein of ''[[1066 and All That]]''), others viewing it as a pagan attack on [[Christianity]], the writer having concealed his identity for personal safety. Under this anti-Christianity theory, the lacuna covering the period from Philip the Arab through to the end of Valerian's reign is seen as deliberate, as it freed the author from addressing Philip's reign, as by the late 4th century, Philip was being claimed as a Christian emperor, as well as not discussing Decius and Valerian's reigns, as they were well known persecutors of the Church. It also avoided dealing with their fates, as Christians saw their ends as divine retribution for their persecutions. In fact, where mentioned, both Decius and Valerian are viewed very positively by the author of the ''History''.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=22}} Further, it is noted that the ''History'' also parodies Christian scripture. For instance, in the ''Life of Alexander Severus'' there is: "It is said that on the day after his birth a star of the first magnitude was visible for the entire day at Arca Caesarea",{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Alexander Severus'', 13.5}} while "where, save at Rome, is there an imperial power that rules an empire?"{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Alexander Severus'', 14.4}} is considered to be a response to 2 Thessalonians 2:6–7.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}}

Syme{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=12–13}} argued that it was a mistake to regard it as a historical work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the ''History'' is primarily a literary product – an exercise in [[satire]] produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and [[Marius Maximus]] were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of [[Tacitus]]. (The ''History'' implausibly{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=214}} makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the ''Quadriga tyrannorum''{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 1.2}} — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] — the ''History'' itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': ''homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit'' ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term ''mythistoricis'' occurs nowhere else in Latin.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=76}} Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of [[Aurelian]], in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the [[Praefectus urbi|City Prefect]] of Rome during the festival of [[Hilaria]] in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=192}}

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|Cicero, one of the authors whose works the ''Historia Augusta'' references obliquely.]]
Other examples of the work as a parody can be taken from the names of the ''Scriptores'' themselves. It has been suggested that "Trebellius Pollio" and "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius" were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} With respect to "Trebellius Pollio", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of [[Mark Antony]] who was mentioned in the [[Philippicae|Philippics]] (''Phil'', 11.14), and another reference to him in ''[[Epistulae ad Familiares]]'' along with the term "Pollentiam" reminded the ''History's'' author of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], who was a fellow [[Tribune of the Plebs|Plebeian Tribune]] alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of "Trebellius Pollio" by "Flavius Vopiscus" at the start of the ''Life of Aurelian'', with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|published ''Commentaries'']].{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=25}} Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the [[Cognomen]] ''Fides'' for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it is no coincidence that, in selecting the name "Trebellius Pollio", the author is playing with the concepts of ''fides'' and ''fidelitas historica'' at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to "Trebellius Pollio" and "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius".{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=26}}

In the case of "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius", it was argued that it too was inspired by the Philippics' reference to "Caesar Vopiscus" (''Phil'', 11.11), with Cicero's reference to Vopiscus immediately preceding his reference to Lucius Trebellius.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} The cognomen "Syracusius" was selected because Cicero's ''[[In Verrem]]'' is filled with references to "Syracusae" and "Syracusani".{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} Further, in Cicero's ''[[De Oratore]]'', Cicero refers to Strabo Vopiscus as an authority on humour, during which he refers to the reputation of Sicilians when it came to humour, and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was one of the principal cities of [[Sicily]].{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} Such references were intended as a "knowing wink" to the readers of the ''History'', who would recognise the mockery of the historical material by the author.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=27}} This corresponds with David Rohrbacher's view of the ''History'', who maintains that the author has no political or theological agenda; rather that the ''History'' is the equivalent of a literary puzzle or game, with the reader's understanding and enjoyment of the numerous elaborate and complicated allusions contained within it being the only purpose behind its existence.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=148}}

In support of this theory, Rohrbacher provides an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus' work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II's attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: "''si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret''" ("For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint").{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=143}} There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the ''Life of Caracalla'' (5.7), which makes no sense in Caracalla's time, and is worded in almost exactly the same way: "''qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent''" ("wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever").{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=143}}

Other theories include [[André Chastagnol]]'s minimalist opinion that the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races,{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=147}} while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the ''History'' are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven into the fabric of a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with [[Carus]] substituting for [[Valentinian I]] and Carinus for [[Gratian]].{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=147}}

==Historical value==
From the sixth century to the end of the 19th century, historians had recognized that the ''Historia Augusta'' was a flawed and not a particularly reliable source, and since the 20th century modern scholars have tended to treat it with extreme caution.{{sfn|Browning|1983|pp=43,45}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=4}} Older historians, such as Edward Gibbon, not fully aware of its problems with respect to the fictitious elements contained within it, generally treated the information preserved within it as authentic. For instance, in Gibbon's account of the reign of Gallienus, he uncritically reproduces the ''Historia Augusta's'' biased and largely fictional account of that reign.{{sfn|Bray|1997|pp=3–4}} So when Gibbon states "The repeated intelligence of invasions, defeats, and rebellions, he received with a careless smile; and singling out, with affected contempt, some particular production of the lost province, he carelessly asked, whether Rome must be ruined, unless it was supplied with linen from Egypt, and arras cloth from Gaul",{{sfn|Gibbon|1776|loc=Ch. 10}} he is reworking the passage in ''The Two Gallieni'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am ashamed to relate what Gallienus used often to say at this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. For when he was told of the revolt of Egypt, he is said to have exclaimed "What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!" and when informed that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Two Gallieni'', 6.1–6.8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gibbon then noted after this passage: "This singular character has, I believe, been fairly transmitted to us. The reign of his immediate successor was short and busy; and the historians who wrote before the elevation of the family of Constantine could not have the most remote interest to misrepresent the character of Gallienus."{{sfn|Gibbon|1776|loc=Ch. 10, Note 156}} Modern scholars now believe that Gallienus' reputation was posthumously maligned, that he was one of the main architects of the later Roman imperial structure, and that his reforms were built upon by succeeding emperors.{{sfn|Bray|1997|p=4}}

Nevertheless, it is unwise to dismiss it altogether as it is also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of [[Didius Julianus]] was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as [[Praetorian Prefect]] in 193.{{sfn|Mellor|2002|p=163}} Likewise, the information that [[Hadrian's Wall]] was constructed during Hadrian's reign{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Hadrian'', 11.2}} and that the [[Antonine Wall]] was built during the reign of [[Antoninus Pius]]{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Antoninus Pius'', 5.4}} are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the ''Historia Augusta'',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Where other ancient writers (such as Eutropius) speak of a defensive wall in Britain, they have associated it with the activities of Septimius Severus – see David Shorter's ''Roman Britain: A Sourcebook'' (2008), pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt; the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=13}}

===False documents and authorities===
A peculiarity of the work is its inclusion of a large number of purportedly authentic documents such as extracts from Senate proceedings and letters written by imperial personages.{{sfn|Potter|2005|p=150}}{{sfn|Campbell|1994|p=248}} In all it contains around 150 alleged documents, including 68 letters, 60 speeches and proposals to the people or the senate, and 20 senatorial decrees and acclamations.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xx–xxi}} Records like these are quite distinct from the rhetorical speeches often inserted by ancient historians – it was accepted practice for the writer to invent these himself{{sfn|Mehl|2011|p=21}} – and on the few occasions when historians (such as [[Sallust]] in his work on [[Catiline]] or Suetonius in his ''Twelve Caesars'') include such documents, they have generally been regarded as genuine;{{sfn|Potter|2005|p=149}}  but almost all those found in the Historia Augusta have been rejected as fabrications, partly on stylistic grounds, partly because they refer to military titles or points of administrative organisation which are otherwise unrecorded until long after the purported date, or for other suspicious content.{{sfn|Hadas|2013|pp=356–357}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=6–8}}{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=113–114}}

The ''History'' moreover cites dozens of otherwise unrecorded historians, biographers, letter-writers, knowledgeable friends of the writers, and so on, most of whom must be regarded as expressions of the author's creative imagination.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=98–99}} For example, the biographer "Cordus" is cited twenty-seven times in the ''History''. Long considered to be a real, but lost, biographer until midway into the 20th century,{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xviii–xix}}{{sfn|Syme|1968|pp=96–98}} with a couple of minor exceptions where material claimed to be sourced from Cordus is in reality from Suetonius or Cicero, every other citation is fake, providing details which have been invented and ascribed to Cordus. Cordus is mentioned almost exclusively in those Vitae where the ''History'' used Herodian as the primary source, and his appearances vanish once Herodian's history comes to an end.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=161}}

The author would also misattribute material taken from a legitimate historian and ascribe it to a fictitious author. For instance, Herodian is used more often than he is explicitly referenced in the ''History''; in addition to the ten times he is correctly cited, three times his material is cited as "Arrianus", probably to multiply the author's sources.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}} Further, not only does the author copy from Herodian without citation (either direct lifts, abbreviations or supplementations), he often distorts Herodian, to suit his literary objective.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=13}}

Then there is the deliberate citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the ''History's'' sixteen citations of Dexippus are considered to be fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, but rather as a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the ''Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte''. In addition [[Quintus Gargilius Martialis]], who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=160}}

===Examples of false historical events and personages===
The untrustworthiness of the ''History'' stems from the multifarious kinds of fraudulent (as opposed to simply inaccurate) information that run through the work, becoming ever more dominant as it proceeds.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=13–14}} The various biographies are ascribed to different invented 'authors', and continue with the dedicatory epistles to Diocletian and Constantine, the quotation of fabricated documents, the citation of non-existent authorities, the invention of persons (extending even to the subjects of some of the minor biographies), presentation of contradictory information to confuse an issue while making a show of objectivity, deliberately false statements, and the inclusion of material which can be shown to relate to events or personages of the late 4th century rather than the period supposedly being written about.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=12–16}} For example:
* The biography of Geta states he was born at Mediolanum on 27 May; the year is not specified but it was 'in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius'.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Geta'', 3.1}} He was actually born at Rome on 7 March 189; there was no such pair of suffect [[Roman consul|consuls]] in this or any other year;{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=123}} however, it has been suggested that the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and that these men were suffect consuls sometime before 192.{{sfn|Birley|1966|pp=249–253}}
* A letter of Hadrian written from Egypt to his brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus|Servianus]] is quoted at length (and was accepted as genuine by many authorities well into the 20th century).{{sfn|Raschke|1976|pp=761–762}} Servianus is saluted as consul, and Hadrian mentions his (adopted) son [[Lucius Aelius Caesar]]: but Hadrian was in Egypt in 130, Servianus' consulship fell in 134, and Hadrian adopted Aelius in 136.{{sfn|Habelt|1968|p=121}}{{sfn|Birley|2013|p=3}} The letter is said to have been published by Hadrian's freedman Phlegon, with the letter's existence not mentioned anywhere except in the ''History'', in another suspect passage.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=60}} A passage in the letter dealing with the frivolousness of Egyptian religious beliefs refers to the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Patriarch]], head of the Jewish community in the Empire. This office only came into being after Hadrian put down the Jewish revolt of 132, and the passage is probably meant in mockery of the powerful late 4th-century Patriarch, [[Raban Gamliel VI|Gamaliel]].{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=21–24}}
* Decius revives the office of [[Roman censor|Censor]]; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy to hold it in a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on campaign against the [[Goths]]) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Two Valerians'', 5.4–6.1}} The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=215}}
* Valerian holds an imperial council in [[Byzantium]], attended by several named dignitaries, none of them otherwise attested and some holding offices not known to exist until the following century, at which the general 'Ulpius Crinitus' (a name apparently chosen to evoke the military glories of the Emperor Trajan) takes the young Aurelian (destined to be another military Emperor) as his adopted son. There are no grounds to believe this is anything other than invention.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=97}}
[[File:Trebellianus.jpg|200px|thumb|Trebellianus, one of the fictitious tyrants included in the ''Historia Augusta'', drawn by [[Guillaume Rouillé]] in  ''[[Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum]]''- 1553]]
* In the ''Tyranni Triginta'', the author 'Trebellius Pollio' sets out to chronicle 'the 30 usurpers who arose in the years when the Empire was ruled by Gallienus and Valerian'.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 1.1}} The number 30 is evidently modelled on the notorious '[[Thirty Tyrants]]' who ruled Athens after the end of the Peloponnesian War.{{sfn|Bunson|1991|p=414}} The chapter contains 32 mini-biographies. They include two women, six youths, and seven men who never claimed the imperial power; one usurper of the reign of [[Maximinus Thrax]], one of the time of Decius, and two of the time of Aurelian; and a number who are entirely fictitious: [[Postumus the Younger]], [[Saturninus (253–268)|Saturninus]], [[Trebellianus]], [[Celsus (usurper)|Celsus]], [[Titus (usurper)|Titus]], [[Censorinus (usurper)|Censorinus]], and [[Victorinus Junior]].{{sfn|Cancik|Schneider|Salazar|2009|p=91}}
* In the ''Life of Tacitus'', the emperor is acclaimed by the Senate, meeting in the ''Curia Pompiliana'', which never existed.{{sfn|Den Hengst|2010|p=159}} The ''History'' then lists a number of individuals, all of whom are invented by the author: the consul 'Velius Cornificius Gordianus',{{sfn|Kreucher|2003|p=105}} 'Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus',{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=4, 12}} the [[City Prefect|Prefect of the City]] 'Aelius Cesettianus',{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=117}} and the Praetorian Prefect 'Moesius Gallicanus'.{{sfn|Baldwin|1984|p=4}} Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be fictitious.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=238–239}} Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the ''History'' are believed to be inventions of the author.{{sfn|Syme|1971|pp=4, 12}}{{sfn|Baldwin|1984|p=4}}
* In the ''Quadrigae Tyrannorum'' (''Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus''&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Firmus_et_al*.html The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus] at LacusCurtius&lt;/ref&gt;), the author includes [[Firmus]], said to have been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 3.1}}{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Aurelian'', 32.2}} There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a ''[[Corrector]]'' named Claudius Firmus stationed in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] in 274, about the time [[Zosimus]] states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=71}} Nevertheless, the ''History's'' wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented.{{sfn|Den Boeft|Drijvers|Den Hengst|Teitler|2013|pp=150}} For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''The Lives of the Thirty Pretenders'', 3.2–6.5}}
* In the ''Life of Probus'',{{sfn|Historia Augusta|loc=''Probus'', 24.1–24.3}} the author 'Flavius Vopiscus of Syracuse' states that the Emperor's descendants (''posteri'') fled from Rome and settled near [[Verona]]. There a statue of Probus was struck by lightning, a portent according to soothsayers 'that future generations of the family would rise to such distinction in the senate they all would hold the highest posts', though Vopiscus (supposedly writing under Constantine) says this prophecy has not yet come to pass. This is one of the strongest indications of the ''History's'' late 4th-century date, as it seems to be a fairly transparent allusion to the rich and powerful senator [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus]] (consul in 371) whose two sons held the consulship together in 395.{{sfn|Syme|1968|p=164}}{{sfn|Platnauer|Claudian|1922|loc=''Panegyric on the Consuls Probinus and Olybrius'', Note 1}} Petronius Probus was born in Verona.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1971|pp=739}}

==Marius Maximus or 'Ignotus'?==
Certain scholars have always defended the value of specific parts of the work. [[Anthony Birley]], for instance, has argued that the lives up to Septimius Severus are based on the now-lost biographies of Marius Maximus, which were written as a sequel to Suetonius' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]''.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=14–15}} As a result, his translation of the ''History'' for [[Penguin Books]] covers only the first half, and was published as ''Lives of the Later Caesars'', Birley himself supplying biographies of Nerva and Trajan (these are not part of the original texts, which begin with Hadrian).

His view (part of a tradition that goes back to J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=33}}{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=15}} His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the ''Lives of the Twelve Caesars'', his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that ''Princeps'' in the History is mainly of good quality.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=31–33}} Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=32}} Finally, that the composer of the ''Historia Augusta'' wrote the lives of the emperors through to the ''Life of Caracalla'' (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion.{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=32–33}} It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus),{{sfn|Syme|1983|pp=31–32}} as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the ''Life of Geta''.{{sfn|Syme|1983|p=44}}

A similar theory to Syme's has been put forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was probably a satirical poet, in the same vein as [[Juvenal]] and not an imperial biographer at all.{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=21}} His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the ''History'', the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the ''History's'' description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=160}} This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley{{sfn|Birley|2006|p=21}} and David Rohrbacher.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|pp=161–162}}

==Literary value==
The ''Historia Augusta'' has been described by Ronald Syme as "the most enigmatic work that Antiquity has transmitted".{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=4}} Although much of the focus of study throughout the centuries has been on the historical content, since the 20th century there has also been an assessment of the literary value of the work. For much of that time the assessment has been critical, as demonstrated by the analysis put forward by David Magie:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The literary, as well as the historical, value of the Historia Augusta has suffered greatly as a result of the method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and incoherence of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.{{sfn|Magie|1921|pp=xxiii–xxiv}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

M. L. W. Laistner was of the opinion that "even if the ''Historia Augusta'' was propaganda disguised as biography, it is still a wretched piece of literature",{{sfn|Laistner|1966|p=180}} while Ronald Syme noted that with respect to the author's Latin prose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was not an elegant exponent. His normal language is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions&amp;nbsp;... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.{{sfn|Syme|1971|p=251}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further, the work shows evidence of its having been put together in a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative.{{sfn|Birley|1988|pp=18–19}} Birley sees an example of the carelessness with which the author approached the work in the construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the ''Life of Marcus Aurelius'' the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}} The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}} However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=19}}

Although these criticisms still form the prevailing view on the ''History's'' literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work,{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|p=171}}{{sfn|Birley|1988|p=18}} its use of allusion as a vehicle for parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, making it one of the most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2016|pp=170–172}}{{sfn|Rohrbacher|2013|p=148}}

The '''Aventine Triad''' (also referred to as the '''plebeian Triad''' or the '''agricultural Triad''') is a modern term for the joint [[Religion in ancient Rome|cult of the Roman deities]] [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]]. The cult was established ca. 493 BC within a sacred district ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#templum|templum]])'' on or near the [[Aventine Hill]], traditionally associated with the Roman ''[[plebs]]''. Later accounts describe the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|temple building]] and rites as "Greek" in style. Some modern historians describe the Aventine Triad as a plebeian parallel and self-conscious antithesis to the archaic [[Capitoline Triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]] and the later Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, [[Minerva]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]. The Aventine Triad, temple and associated ''[[ludi]]'' (games and theatrical performances) served as a focus of plebeian identity, sometimes in opposition to Rome's original ruling elite, the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]].

==Origins==
The Aventine relationship between Ceres, Liber and Libera was probably based first on their functions as agricultural and fertility deities of the ''plebs'' as a distinct social group. Liber had been companion to both Ceres and to Libera in separate and disparate fertility cults that were widespread throughout the Hellenised Italian peninsula, long before their official adoption by Rome &amp;ndash; or rather, their partial assimilation, as Ceres' own cult appears to have been considered more tractable and obedient than Liber's. Their Aventine cults, reported in later Roman sources as distinctively Greek in character, may have been further reinforced and influenced by their [[Interpretatio Romana|perceived similarities]] to particular Greek deities: Ceres to [[Demeter]], Liber to [[Dionysus]] (Roman [[Bacchus]]) and Libera to [[Persephone]] (Roman [[Proserpina]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, T., ''The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.1000–264 BC)'', Routledge, 1995, p. 264: "We cannot be sure that these Greek features of the cult go back to the 490's BC, but the rest of the evidence makes it probable that they do; and the arguments that have been used to support a later date are extremely weak", contra Henri Le Bonniec, ''Le Culte du Ceres a Rome,'' Paris, 1958, p381 for the much later date of c.205 BC0, based on the Christian polemicist Arnobius, ''Adversus Nationes'', 2.73: according to Cornell, Arnobius is a "highly unreliable" source for argument on the nature of the early Aventine cult.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with Roman theology, the internal and external equivalence of the Aventine Triad remained speculative, broad and flexible. Long after its establishment, Cicero rejects the equivalence of Liber and Dionysus and asserts that Ceres is mother to Liber and Libera.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6 - 8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=Liber%20Cicero&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 44.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also T.P. Wiseman, ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133 and notes 20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The Aventine Triad was established soon after the overthrow of the [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]] and establishment of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionysus of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 6.17, records a tradition that the Triad was established at the recommendation of the [[Sibylline Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rome's majority of citizen commoners ([[plebs]]) were ruled by the patricians, a small number of powerful, landed aristocrats who asserted a traditional, exclusive right to Rome's highest religious, political and military offices. The ''plebs'' not only served in [[Roman army|Rome's legions]]: they were the backbone of its economy &amp;ndash; smallholders, labourers, skilled specialists, managers of landed estates, vintners, importers and exporters of grain and wine. Against a background of famine in Rome, an imminent war against the [[Latini|Latins]] and a threatened [[Conflict of the Orders|plebeian secession]], the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis|A. Postumius]] vowed a temple to the patron deities of the ''plebs'', Ceres, [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]] on or near the [[Aventine Hill]]. The famine ended and Rome's plebeian citizen-soldiery co-operated in the conquest of the Latins. In 493 BC, a new built temple on or near the Aventine hill was dedicated to the [[Triple deity#List of triple deities|Triad]] and Rome's first recorded ''[[Ludi|ludi scaenici]]'' ([[Theatre of ancient Rome|religious dramas]]) were held in honour of Liber, for the benefit of the [[SPQR|Roman people]]. Liber's festival, the [[Liberalia]], may date from this time.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrician dominance was manifest in the [[Capitoline Triad]] of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Quirinus]] on the Capitoline Hill, at the heart of the city. The Capitoline temple lay within Rome's sacred boundary ([[pomerium]]). The Aventine lay outside it. In most versions of the [[Founding of Rome|Roman founding myth]], this was the hill on which the unfortunate [[Remus]] lost to his brother [[Romulus]] in a contest of [[augury]] to decide Rome's foundation, name and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, 4-17, ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Postumius' vow has been interpreted as a pragmatic, timely recognition of the plebeian citizenry as a distinct social and political grouping with its own values, interests and traditions; the vow may have intended confirmation of the plebs and their deities as fully Roman, but its fulfillment focused plebeian culture and identity on a Triad of deities only part-assimilated into official Roman religion. Some aspects of their cults were still considered [[Mos maiorum|morally "un-Roman"]] by Rome's authorities. Thus the Aventine Triad gave the ''plebs'' what has been variously described by modern historians as a parallel to the official Capitoline Triad, and its "copy and antithesis".&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbette Spaeth|Barbette Stanley Spaeth]], ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6-8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 92], citing Henri Le Bonniec, ''Le culte de Cérès à Rome. Des origines à la fin de la République,'' Paris, Librairie C. Klincksieck, 1958, for the Aventine cult with its central female deity as "copy and antithesis" of the early, entirely male Capitoline Triad, focused on Jupiter as Rome's supreme deity. When Mars and Quirinus were later replaced by two goddesses, Jupiter remained the primary focus of Capitoline cult. While the Aventine temple and ''ludi'' may represent a patrician attempt to reconcile or at least molify the ''plebs'', Le Bonniec asserts their role in the religious, political and moral plebeian opposition to patrician domination throughout contemporary and later Republican history.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other religious innovations based on his [[Roman antiquarianism|antiquarian]] interests, the emperor [[Claudius]] redrew the ''pomerium'' to encompass the Aventine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Ando]], ''The Matter of the Gods: Religion and the Roman Empire'' (University of California Press, 2008), p. 118, citing [[Aulus Gellius]] 13.14.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The ''plebs'' continued to establish and administer their own laws (''plebiscita'') and held formal [[Concilium plebis|assemblies]] from which patricians were excluded,. They elected their own [[Roman magistrates|magistrates]] and sought religious confirmation of their decisions through their own augury, which in plebeian religious tradition had been introduced by [[Marsyas]], a [[satyr]] or [[Silenus|silen]] in the entourage of Liber. Meanwhile, the [[Tribune#Plebeian tribune|plebeian tribunes]], an emergent [[Nobiles|plebeian nobility]] and a small but growing number of [[populares|popularist]] politicians of patrician ancestry gained increasing influence over Rome's religious life and government. Any person who offended against the sacred rights and person of a plebeian tribune was liable to declaration as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|homo sacer]]'', who could be killed with impunity and whose property was, almost certainly, forfeit to Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres and the Death of Tiberius Gracchus", ''Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte'', Vol. 39, No. 2 (1990), pp. 185-186. The sacred status and functions of the plebeian tribunes are respected by Rome's entire divine community, but as protectress of plebeian rights, Ceres is entitled to the property of the ''homo sacer''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, official ''[[Ludi Cereales]]'' were not established until as late as 202 BC. Liber's festival and the Bacchic or Dionysian aspects of his cult were suppressed under the ferocious ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' of 186 BC. The Liberalia rites were transferred to Cerealia; after a few years they were restored to Liber.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp66 - 67, 93 - 96. For date of earliest recorded ''ludi Cereales'', see [[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 30.39.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of the period, see Cornell, T., ''The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.1000–264 BC)'', Routledge, 1995, 258 - 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Varro]]'s complex, investigative Late Republican theology groups Ceres with [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]] and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], therefore (in Varronian reasoning) with [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]; and Ceres with Libera, when the latter is understood as the female aspect of Liber.&lt;ref&gt;C.M.C. Green, "Varro's Three Theologies and their influence on the Fasti", in Geraldine Herbert-Brown, (ed)., ''Ovid's Fasti: historical readings at its bimillennium'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 78-80.[https://books.google.com/books?id=CeFErNPdXOMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=jKfOltwDm_&amp;dq=Ovid's%20Fasti%3A%20historical%20readings%20at%20its%20bimillennium%20%20By%20Geraldine%20Herbert-Brown&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]: citing Varro, Res Divina, Cardauns 208 as general commentary on the rationale for these groupings: ''sed potest... fieri ut eadem res et una sit, et in ea quaedam res sint plures'' - "but it can happen that a thing is unitary, while at the same time certain things in it are multiple."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cults and priesthoods==
Evidence is lacking for the earliest priesthoods of the Aventine Triad, whether in joint or individual cult to its deities. The plebeian [[aedile]]s, named after their service of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]] (shrine or temple) may have acted as cult priests for their community&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 64 -5.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have served Liber and Libera in this capacity. Ceres was served by a [[Flamen#Flamines minores|flamen Cerealis]], usually a plebeian. His duties included the invocation of her assistant deities and cult service to the earth-goddess Tellus. From ca. 205 BC, a joint mystery cult to Ceres and Proserpina was held at the Aventine Triad's temple, in addition to its older rites.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Graeco Ritu: A Typically Roman Way of Honoring the Gods", ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 97, Greece in Rome: Influence, Integration, 1995, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This ''[[ritus graecus|ritus graecus cereris]]'' recognised Libera as equivalent to Proserpina.  Liber's involvement, if any, is unknown. Initiation was reserved to women, and the cult was served by priestesses of high social caste. According to Cicero, men were forbidden to look on Ceres' cult image;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''In Verres,'' 2.4.108 et passim, cited by Olivier de Cazanove, in [[Jörg Rüpke|Rüpke, Jörg]] (Editor), A Companion to Roman Religion, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p 56.&lt;/ref&gt; this could imply the use of separate cult images, or the use of the same images in different, gender-segregated rites.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Temple==
The Aventine Triad's temple was known by the name of its leading deity &amp;ndash; thus, Roman sources describe it as the Temple of Ceres, though within it, each deity had a separate internal sanctuary (''[[cella]]''). The temple served as a cult centre for the patron deities of the plebs, a sacred depository for plebeian records and the headquarters for the plebeian aediles; the minutes or conclusions of senatorial decrees were also placed there, under the protection of Ceres as the guardian of laws on behalf of the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 64 -5. See also Cornell, T., ''The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.1000–264 BC)'', Routledge, 1995, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; While the original temple fabric and furnishings may have been funded in whole or part by its patrician sponsors, its cult images and perhaps its maintenance were supported partly through voluntary offerings and partly through the fines collected by the plebeian aediles from those who infringed plebeian civil and religious laws.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, p. 90.[https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; By the late Republic, it may have fallen into disrepair: [[Augustus]] undertook its restoration, which was completed by his successor [[Tiberius]]. [[Pliny the Elder]]'s later description of its style and designers as "Greek" are taken as further evidence of continued plebeian cultural connections with [[Magna Graecia]], officially funded well into the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]].  No trace remains of the temple building, and the historical and [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|epigraphical record]] offers only sparse details to suggest its exact location.&lt;ref&gt;Barbette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman goddess Ceres'', University of Texas Press, 1996, pp. 6-8, 86ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s mark the golden age of the independent '''[[B movie]]''', made outside of Hollywood's [[major film studio]]s. As censorship pressures lifted in the early 1960s, the low-budget end of the American motion picture industry increasingly incorporated the sort of sexual and violent elements long associated with so-called [[exploitation film]]s. The death of the [[Production Code]] in 1968 and the major success of the exploitation-style ''[[Easy Rider]]'' the following year fueled the trend through the subsequent decade. The success of the B-studio exploitation movement had a significant effect on the strategies of the major studios during the 1970s.

==Cheesecake and choppers: 1960s==
Despite the many transformations in the industry, the average production cost of an American feature film was effectively stable over the course of the 1950s. In 1950, the figure had been $1 million; in 1961, it reached $2 million—after adjusting for inflation, the increase in real terms was less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (2003), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional twin bill of B film preceding and balancing a subsequent-run A film had largely disappeared from American theaters. The dual genre-movie package, popularized by [[American International Pictures]] (AIP) the previous decade, was the new face of the double feature. In July 1960, the latest [[Joseph E. Levine]] [[Sword and sandal|sword-and-sandals]] import, ''[[Hercules and the Queen of Lydia|Hercules Unchained]]'', opened at neighborhood theaters in New York. An 82-minute-long suspense film, ''Terror Is a Man'', produced by a Manila-based, American-Philippine company, ran as a "co-feature." It had a now familiar sort of exploitation gimmick: "The dénouement helpfully includes a 'warning bell' so the sensitive can 'close their eyes.'"&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; That year, [[Roger Corman]] took American International down a new road: "When they asked me to make two ten-day black-and-white horror films to play as a double feature, I convinced them instead to finance one horror film in color."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Di Franco (1979), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; A period piece in the vein of Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]], ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' was a success, launching a series of Poe-based movies Corman would direct for AIP.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Hogan (1997), pp. 212 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It also typifies the continuing ambiguities of B-picture classification. ''House of Usher'' was clearly an A film by the standards of both director and studio, with the longest shooting schedule and biggest budget Corman had ever enjoyed. But from a latter-day perspective, it is regarded as a B movie—that schedule was a mere fifteen days, the budget just $200,000, one-tenth the industry average.&lt;ref&gt;Per Corman, quoted in Di Franco (1979), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Low-budget-movie aficionado John Reid reports once asking a neighborhood theater manager to define "B picture." The response: "Any movie that runs less than 80 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reid (2005), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; ''House of Usher'''s running time is close, 85 minutes. And despite its high status in studio terms, it was not sent out into the world on its own, but screened in tandem with a crime melodrama asking the eternal question ''Why Must I Die?''&lt;ref&gt;Archer (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MotorpsychoPoster.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Motorpsycho (film)|Motorpsycho]]'' (1965) had it all: Director [[Russ Meyer]]'s unsurpassed eye for the finer points of female anatomy. The biker theme ("MURDERcycles") that would prove its popularity in historic fashion just a few years down the road. And that money-in-the-bank word in the title: ''psycho''.]]

With the loosening of industry [[Production Code|censorship constraints]], the 1960s and 1970s saw a major expansion in the production and commercial viability of a variety of B-movie subgenres that have come to be known collectively as ''exploitation films''. The term gained broader application as well: Exploitation-style promotional practices had become standard practice at the lower-budget end of the industry; with the majors having exited traditional B production, ''exploitation'' became a way to refer to the entire field of low-budget genre films. The combination of intensive and gimmick-laden publicity with movies featuring vulgar subject matter (as judged by mainstream standards) along with often outrageous imagery dated back decades—before such milestones as ''[[The Tingler]]'' (1959), before ''Women in Bondage'' (1943), before even ''[[The Terror of Tiny Town]]'' (1938). ''Exploitation'' had originally defined truly fringe productions with a dose of shocking content, made at the lowest depths of Poverty Row or entirely outside the Hollywood system. Many graphically depicted the wages of sin in the context of promoting prudent lifestyle choices, particularly "[[Exploitation film#Classic exploitation|sexual hygiene]]." Audiences might see explicit footage of anything from a live birth to a ritual circumcision in such films.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999), pp. 187, 376.&lt;/ref&gt; They were not generally booked as part of movie theaters' regular schedules but rather presented as special events by traveling roadshow promoters (they might also appear as fodder for "grindhouses," which typically had no regular schedule at all). The most famous of those promoters, [[Kroger Babb]], was in the vanguard of marketing low-budget, sensationalistic films with a "100% saturation campaign," inundating the target audience with ads in almost any imaginable medium.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In the era of the traditional double feature, no one would have characterized these exploitation films as "B movies." As production and exhibition practices changed, so did the terms of definition.

In the early 1960s, exploitation movies in the original sense continued to appear: 1961's ''Damaged Goods'', a [[cautionary tale]] about a young lady whose boyfriend’s promiscuity leads to [[venereal disease]], comes complete with enormous, grotesque closeups of VD's physical manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/roadshow.php ''Something Weird Traveling Roadshow Films''] review of DVD release with historical analysis by Bill Gibron, July 24, 2003; part of the ''DVD Verdict'' website. Retrieved 11/17/06.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the concept of fringe exploitation was merging with a closely related and similarly venerable tradition: “[[Nudity in film|nudie]]" films featuring nudist-camp footage or striptease artists like [[Bettie Page]] had simply been the [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] pornography of previous decades. As far back as 1933, ''This Nude World'', which promised an "Authentic Trip Through an American Nudist Colony!", was "Guaranteed the Most Educational Film Ever Produced!"&lt;ref name="Halperin 2006, p. 201"&gt;Halperin (2006), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s, as more of the old grindhouse theaters specifically devoted themselves to "adult" product, a few filmmakers began making nudies with some greater semblance of plots. Best known was [[Russ Meyer]], who released his first successful narrative nudie, ''[[The Immoral Mr. Teas]]'', in 1959. Five years later, on a sub-$100,000 budget, Meyer came out with ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]]'', "a harder-edged film that combined sex with gritty realism and violence."&lt;ref name="Halperin 2006, p. 201"/&gt; Meyer would build an underground reputation as a talented director with movies such as ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]'' (1965) and ''[[Vixen!]]'' (1968), the sort of films, virtually ignored by the mainstream press, that had become known as [[sexploitation]] pictures.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest usage of "sexploitation" in a cinematic context so far located is in two ''Los Angeles Times'' articles from 1958: Howard Whitman, "Crisis in Morals" (May 26), and movie industry reporter Philip K. Scheuer, "Actor Clears Up Rip Torn Mystery" (June 3). In 1959, Scheuer may have been the first to use the phrase "sexploitation movie" (more precisely, "'sexploitation' movie") in his review "'Blue Denim' Tells of Youths' Plight" (August 20). That same year, the phrase "sexploitation film" appears in the government document ''Juvenile Delinquency: Hearings Before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate'', pp. 7030, 7099. The term appears to have been in general circulation by 1964, judging from its repeated use that year in the periodical ''Film World''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another leading director in the genre was Joseph Sarno, who had his first commercial success in 1963 with ''Sin in the Suburbs''. Many of his subsequent films, including the artistically crafted ''Red Roses of Passion'' (1966) and ''Odd Triangle'' (1968), examined the hesitant transformation of sexual mores among the American middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Grimes (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as Meyer's and Sarno's—though not sexually explicit during this period—were largely relegated to the fringe circuit of "adult" theaters, while AIP teen movies with wink-wink titles like ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' (1965) and ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' (1966), starring [[Annette Funicello]] and [[Frankie Avalon]], played drive-ins and other relatively reputable venues.&lt;ref&gt;Such movies were usually covered by the major media with great disdain. The anonymous ''New York Times'' reviewer begins: "'HOW TO STUFF A WILD BIKINI'—yep, that's the title that appeared yesterday on a circuit double bill. And anyone who ambles inside expecting the worst won't be disappointed. For here, finally and in color, is the answer to a moron's prayer." These films were often close to the last stop for faded stars; as the nameless reviewer put it, "This time let's pity [[Brian Donlevy]], [[Mickey Rooney]] and good, old, now-departed [[Buster Keaton]]." "'Wild Bikini' Appearing in Neighborhoods," ''The New York Times'', January 12, 1967 (available [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9E04E3DF103BE63ABC4A52DFB766838C679EDE online]).&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Corman's ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' (1967) for American International, written by veteran AIP/Corman actor [[Jack Nicholson]], never shows a fully bared, unpainted breast, but flirts with nudity throughout. The Meyer and Corman lines were drawing closer.

One of the most influential films of the era, on B's and beyond, was [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Its $8.5 million in earnings against a production cost of $800,000 made it the most profitable movie of 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mainstream distribution without the [[Production Code]] seal of approval helped weaken U.S. film censorship. And, as William Paul notes, this move into the horror genre by respected director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was made, "significantly, with the lowest-budgeted film of his American career and the least glamorous stars. [Its] greatest initial impact... was on schlock horror movies (notably those from second-tier director [[William Castle]]), each of which tried to bill itself as scarier than ''Psycho''."&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Castle's first film in the ''Psycho'' vein was ''[[Homicidal]]'' (1961), an early step in the development of the [[slasher film|slasher]] subgenre that would flourish in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It seemed the less money available for a horror film, the better the chances of being grossed out by it: ''[[Blood Feast]]'' (1963), a movie about human dismemberment and culinary preparation made for approximately $24,000 by experienced nudie-maker [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], established a new, more immediately successful subgenre, the gore or [[splatter film]]. Lewis's business partner [[David F. Friedman]] drummed up publicity by distributing vomit bags to theatergoers ("You May Need This When You See ''Blood Feast''")—the sort of [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)#New trends in exhibition|gimmick]] Castle had become renowned for in the 1950s—and arranging for an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida—the sort of problem exploitation films had long run up against, except Friedman had planned it.&lt;ref&gt;Rockoff (2002), pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Friedman's efforts typify the emerging sense of "exploitation": the progressive adoption of traditional exploitation and nudie elements into horror, into other classic B genres, and into the low-budget film industry as a whole.

Despite ''Psycho'''s impact and the growing popularity of horror, major Hollywood studios largely continued to disdain the genre, at least for their own production lines. Along with the output of "off-Hollywood" U.S. concerns like Lewis and Friedman's, distributors brought in more foreign movies to fill the demands of rural drive-ins, lower-end urban theaters, and outright grindhouses.&lt;ref&gt;Worland (2007), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer Films' success with ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957) and its remake of ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958) had established the studio as an important supplier of horror movies to the American B market, a positioned it maintained throughout the 1960s. In 1961, American International released a movie clearly influenced by Hammer's characteristically bold visual style and moody pace—''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'' was a dubbed horror import from Italy, where it had premiered the previous year as ''La maschera del demonio''. It became the highest grossing film in AIP history.&lt;ref&gt;Per commentary by Tim Lucas on Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD, cited in Kehr (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The movie's director was [[Mario Bava]], who would launch the horror subgenre known as [[giallo]] with ''[[La ragazza che sapeva troppo]]'' (''The Girl Who Knew Too Much''; 1963) and ''[[Blood and Black Lace|Sei Donne per l’assassino]]'' (''Blood and Black Lace''; 1964). Many gialli, highly stylized films mixing sexploitation and ultraviolence, were picked up for U.S. B-market distribution and would prove influential on American horror films in turn, especially of the slasher type. While in the past, the term ''B movie'' had been applied, both in the United States and abroad, almost exclusively to low- and modest-budget American films, the growing Italian exploitation film industry now also became associated with the label (usually styled in Italy as ''B-movie'').

===The demise of the Code===
The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968, to be replaced by the first version of the present-day [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]]. That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American filmmaking would take in the next decade, with major long-range consequences for the B film. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated [[Roman Polanski]] and based on a bestselling novel by [[Ira Levin]]. Produced by B-horror veteran William Castle, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' "took the genre up-market for the first time since the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), pp. 222–223.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a critical success and the seventh-biggest box office hit of the year. The other was [[George A. Romero]]'s now classic ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Essentially a war movie pitting a small group of humans against a [[zombie]] [[corps]], it built on the achievement of B-genre predecessors like ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues. The movie doubled as both a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for America's treatment of the descendants of its former slaves at home and its conduct of a distant [[Vietnam War|war against Vietnamese nationalists]]. Its greatest influence, though, derived not from its ideological implications but rather its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, its low-cost, truly independent means of production, and its high rate of return: $3 million in earnings in 1968, with much more to come as it was revived in various fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Cook (2000), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Production Code gone and the [[X-rated|X rating]] established, major studio A films like ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' could now show "adult" imagery, while the market for increasingly [[hardcore pornography]] exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, for the first time a Meyer film, ''[[Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!]]'', was reviewed in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Canby (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Corman would be putting out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as ''The Student Nurses'' (1970) and ''[[Women in Cages]]'' (1971). With ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970), Hammer similarly launched "a cycle of lesbian vampire movies that bordered on soft porn."&lt;ref&gt;Worland (2007), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1969, the most important of all exploitation movies premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Much of ''[[Easy Rider]]'''s significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable, if still modest, budget and released by a major studio. The project was first taken by one of its cocreators, [[Peter Fonda]], to American International. Fonda had become AIP's top star in the Corman–directed ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966), a biker movie, and ''The Trip'', as in [[LSD]]. The idea Fonda pitched would combine those two proven themes. AIP was intrigued but balked at giving his collaborator, [[Dennis Hopper]]—who had appeared in ''The Trip'' and several other AIP opuses—free directorial rein. The duo then took their concept, for which they had projected a $60,000 budget, to producer [[Bert Schneider]]. Suggesting that they would have an easier time raising $600,000, Schneider helped arrange a financing and distribution deal with [[Columbia Pictures]], where his brother was president. Two more graduates of the Corman/AIP exploitation mill joined the project: Jack Nicholson and cinematographer [[László Kovács (cinematographer)|László Kovács]]. The film (which managed to incorporate another favorite exploitation theme, the [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] menace, as well as a fair amount of nudity) was brought in at a cost of $501,000. ''Easy Rider'' would earn $19.1 million in rentals, becoming, as one history puts it, "the seminal film that provided the bridge between all the repressed tendencies represented by schlock/kitsch/hack since the dawn of Hollywood and the mainstream cinema of the seventies."&lt;ref&gt;Quote: Cagin and Dray (1984), p. 53. General history: Cagin and Dray (1984), pp. 61–66. Financial figures: per associate producer William L. Hayward, cited in Biskind (1998), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sleazeballs and slashers: 1970s==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new generation of low-budget film companies emerged that drew from all the different lines of exploitation as well as the sci-fi and teen themes that had been a mainstay since the 1950s. Operations such as Roger Corman's [[New World Pictures]], [[Cannon Films]], [[New Line Cinema]], [[Film Ventures International]], Fanfare Films, and Independent-International Pictures brought exploitation films to mainstream theaters around the country. The major studios' top product was continuing to inflate in running time—in 1970, the ten biggest earners averaged 140.1 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;See Finler (2003), p. 359, for top films. Finler lists ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' as 1970, when it made most of its money, but it premiered in December 1969. ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', 51 minutes shorter, replaces it in this analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; The B's were keeping pace: In 1955, Corman had a producorial hand in five movies averaging 74.8 minutes, with a range between 69 and 79. He played a similar part in five films originally released in 1970, two for AIP and three for his own New World, including an Italian horror film that he purchased for around $25,000: the average length was 89.8 minutes, with a range between 86 and 94.&lt;ref&gt;From 1955: ''Apache Woman'', ''The Beast with a Million Eyes'', ''Day the World Ended'', ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1954 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'', and ''Five Guns West''. From 1970: ''Angels Die Hard'', ''Bloody Mama'', ''[[The Dunwich Horror#Adaptations|The Dunwich Horror]]'', ''Ivanna'' (aka ''Scream of the Demon Lover''; U.S. premiere: 1971), and ''The Student Nurses''. For purchase of ''Ivanna'': Di Franco (1979), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; These films could turn a tidy profit. The first New World release, the biker movie ''Angels Die Hard'', cost $117,000 to produce. It was no ''Easy Rider'', but its box-office take of $2 million–plus meant a 46 percent return for New World's investors.&lt;ref&gt;Di Franco (1979), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director [[Brian De Palma]], whose previous movie, a [[Warner Bros.]] comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing ''[[Sisters (1973 film)|Sisters]]'', De Palma's first horror film, ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' critic [[Pauline Kael]] observed that its "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but why is there so much gratuitous dumbness too?... [H]e can't get two people talking in order to make a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] picture of 1938."&lt;ref&gt;Kael (1976), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples of the so-called [[blaxploitation]] genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was [[Pam Grier]], who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' (1970) and who had appeared in several New World pictures, including ''The Big Doll House'' (1971) and ''The Big Bird Cage'' (1972), both directed by [[Jack Hill]]. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: ''[[Coffy]]'' (1973) and [[Foxy Brown (film)|''Foxy Brown'']] (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.

Blaxploitation was the first exploitation genre to picked up by the major studios in a substantial way. Indeed, the [[United Artists]] release ''Cotton Comes to Harlem'' (1970), directed by [[Ossie Davis]], is seen as the first significant film of the type. Crossing over before the genre had even gotten established, Laurence Merrick's micro-budget independent ''The Black Angels'' (aka ''Black Bikers from Hell''; 1970) followed by a few months.&lt;ref&gt;Puchalski (2002), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; But the movie regarded as truly igniting the blaxploitation phenomenon, again completely independent, came the following year: ''[[Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song]]'' is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form—wildly experimental in style, borderline pornographic ("Rated X by an All White Jury," declared the ads), and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. [[Melvin Van Peebles]] wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with the last-minute help of a $50,000 loan from [[Bill Cosby]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Peebles (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in April 1971, distributed by [[Cinemation Industries]], a small company then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian ''[[Mondo Cane]]'' "shockumentaries" and the Swedish skin flick ''[[Fanny Hill#Film adaptations|Fanny Hill]]'', as well as for its one in-house production, ''[[The Man from O.R.G.Y.]]'' (1970). These were the sort of films that played in the "grindhouses" of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather specializing in all manner of exploitation cinema. As director [[Quentin Tarantino]] describes in a 2007 interview, "Grindhouses were usually in the ghetto. Or they were the big old downtown movie theaters that sometimes stayed open all night long, for all the bums. At the grindhouse that I went to, every week there was the new kung fu movie, or new car-chase movie, or new sexploitation movie, or blaxploitation movie."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Joiner (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.

In 1970, a low-budget crime drama shot in [[16 mm film|16 mm]] by a first-time American director won the [[FIPRESCI|international critics' prize]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. ''[[Wanda (film)|Wanda]]'', written and directed by [[Barbara Loden]], is both a seminal event in the independent film movement and a classic B picture. The plot—involving a disaffected divorcée who drifts away from her coal-town life and aimlessly falls in with a small-time, would-be [[hardboiled]] crook—and the often seedy settings would have been suitable to a straightforward exploitation film or (with a little shifting of sex roles) an old-school B [[film noir|noir]]. Loden, who spent six years raising money for the sub-$200,000 production, created a film that [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised for "the absolute accuracy of its effects, the decency of its point of view and the kind of purity of technique that can only be the result of conscious discipline."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reynaud (2006). See Reynaud also for Loden's fundraising efforts. For production cost: Schickel (2005), p. 432.

Retrieved 12/29/06.&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Wanda'' would be the only movie Loden ever made, she "left us with a film that anticipated the independent spirit that would reinvigorate the industry."&lt;ref&gt;Konrad, Todd (2006). "[http://www.independentfilmquarterly.com/ifq/reviews/wanda.htm ''Wanda'' (review)]" part of [http://www.independentfilmquarterly.com/ ''Independent Film Quarterly'']. Retrieved 4/11/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Romero and Van Peebles, other filmmakers of the era made pictures that combined the gut-level entertainment of exploitation with biting social commentary. The first three features directed by [[Larry Cohen]], ''Bone'' (aka ''Beverly Hills Nightmare''; 1972), ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]'' (1973), and ''[[Hell Up in Harlem]]'' (1973), were all nominally blaxploitation movies, but Cohen—also the screenwriter on each film—used them as vehicles for a satirical examination of race relations and the wages of dog-eat-dog capitalism. Cohen's ''The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover'' (1977), for AIP, might have "the look of tabloid sleaze," but one leading critic found it "perhaps the most intelligent film about American politics ever to come out of Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1999), p. 835; Robin Wood, quoted in Cook (2000), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The gory horror film ''Deathdream'' (aka ''Dead of Night''; 1974), directed by [[Bob Clark]] and written by Alan Orsmby, is also an agonized protest of the war in Vietnam. Canadian filmmaker [[David Cronenberg]] made serious-minded low-budget horror films whose implications are not so much ideological as psychological and existential: ''[[Shivers (film)|Shivers]]'' (1975), ''[[Rabid (film)|Rabid]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979) all involve a degree of [[self-reference|self-reflexiveness]] that, as William Paul points out, "makes Cronenberg's status as a genre director somewhat odd.... His works foreground their meaningfulness in a way that is unusual for the horror film."&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), pp. 368–69.&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Easy Rider'' with conceptual rigor, the movie that most clearly presaged the way in which exploitation content and artistic treatment would be combined in modestly budgeted films of later years was the biker-themed ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' (1973), a United Artists release directed by [[James William Guercio]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tom Milne, "''Electra Glide in Blue''," in ''Time Out Film Guide'', 8th ed., ed. John Pym (London et al.: Penguin, 1999), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical admiration was hardly universal at the time: Roger Greenspun of ''The New York Times'' wrote, "Under different intentions, it might have made a decent grade-C Roger Corman bike movie—though Corman has generally used more interesting directors than Guercio."&lt;ref&gt;Greenspun (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The horror field continued to attract young, independent American directors whose work would prove especially influential. As critic [[Roger Ebert]] explained in one 1974 movie review, "Horror and exploitation films almost always turn a profit if they're brought in at the right price. So they provide a good starting place for ambitious would-be filmmakers who can't get more conventional projects off the ground."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; The particular movie under consideration was ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''. Written and directed by [[Tobe Hooper]], it was made on a budget of somewhere between $93,000 and $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Rockoff (2002), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It would earn $14.4 million in domestic rentals and become one of the most influential horror films of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;For the film's U.S. rentals: Cook (2000), p. 229. For its influence: Sapolsky and Molitor (1996), p. 36; Rubin (1999), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Carpenter]], whose debut feature, the $60,000 sci-fi comedy ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), had become a cult classic, made his lasting mark four years later. ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), produced for $320,000, grossed over $80 million at the box-office worldwide, making it "the most successful 'indie' movie ever released."&lt;ref&gt;Harper (2004), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The film effectively established the slasher mode as the primary expression of the horror genre for the next decade. Just as Hooper had learned from Romero's landmark ''Night of the Living Dead'', ''Halloween'', in turn, largely followed the model of ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', directed by ''Deathdream'''s Bob Clark.&lt;ref&gt;Rockoff (2002); Paul (1994), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of these films still echoes through such movies as the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' series, including 2006's ''[[Saw III]]'', a mainstream, $10 million production—far below the current Hollywood average, but more than a hundred times Hooper's budget and well out of any true independent's league.
In various ways, the B movies of the era have inspired later filmmakers blessed with much better financial backing. Almost all the works of Quentin Tarantino—in particular, ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' (1997), the ''[[Kill Bill]]'' movies (2003–4), and his ''Death Proof'' segment of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007)—pay explicit tribute to classic exploitation cinema. Blaxploitation is directly homaged by the former, while the ''Kill Bill'' pictures reference a wide variety of Asian [[martial arts films]], which appeared as imports in U.S. theaters regularly during the 1970s. These "[[kung fu]]" films as they were often called, whatever specific martial art was featured, were popularized in the United States by the Hong Kong–produced movies of [[Bruce Lee]]. His films and later ones with such stars as Hong Kong's [[Jackie Chan]] and Japan's [[Sonny Chiba]] were marketed to the same genre/exploitation audience targeted by AIP and New World. ''Death Proof'' is inspired by a range of exploitation styles, particularly giallo/slasher pictures and car-chase movies like [[20th Century-Fox]]'s ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]'' (1971) and ''[[Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry]]'' (1974) and New World's ''[[Cannonball (film)|Cannonball]]'' (1976) and ''[[Grand Theft Auto (film)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1977).

===New markets for the B===
In the early 1970s, the growing practice of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, with the goal of building a [[cult film]] audience, made the [[midnight movie]] a significant new mode of cinematic exhibition, with transgressive connotations. Socializing in a [[counterculture|countercultural]] milieu was part of the original attraction of the midnight filmgoing experience, something like a drive-in movie for the [[hip (slang)|hip]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jack Stevenson, ''Land of a Thousand Balconies: Discoveries and Confessions of a B-Movie Archaeologist'' (Manchester: Headpress/Critical Vision, 2003), pp. 49–50; Joanne Hollows, "The Masculinity of Cult," in ''Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste'', ed. Mark Jancovich (Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2003), pp. 35–53; Janet Staiger, ''Blockbuster TV: Must-see Sitcoms in the Network Era'' (New York and London: New York University Press, 2000), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first films adopted by the new midnight movie circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old ''Night of the Living Dead''. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside of the studio system, like [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century-Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B-picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as ''Rocky Horror'' generated its own [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.

On television, the parallels between the weekly series that became the mainstay of [[prime-time]] programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long been clear. In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. While there had been dramatic feature presentations made especially for TV since the beginning of the medium's mass commercialization in the late 1940s, they had by and large not crossed over with the realm of the B movie. In the 1950s, the live television drama—a unique amalgam of cinematic and theatrical elements exemplified by ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' (1956–1961)—had predominated. Over the course of the 1960s, there was a transition to prerecorded features; most of those produced by the major networks either aspired to the prestige of major motion pictures (e.g., [[CBS]]'s 1965 ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]'') or were intended as pilots for projected series. During this period, AIP produced a number of low-grade genre pictures such as ''[[Zontar, the Thing from Venus]]'' (1966) intended for the first-run [[television syndication|TV syndication]] market.

As production of [[TV movies]] expanded with the introduction of the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original feature presentations, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B-picture territory. In a 1974 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article, "The New B Movies," [[Richard Schickel]] begins by discussing a few recent high-priced TV features, only to argue that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
as with the old films, so with TV movies: the quick, deft westerns, mysteries and action melodramas that depend on well-established conventions may in the end exert a larger claim on our attention than their more pretentiously publicized rivals.... Convenient to turn on, easy to flick off, movies made for TV approximate the conditions under which all movies used to be chanced by audiences years ago...when at least half the pleasure of moviegoing derived precisely from the fact that no sense of cultural occasion was attached to that simple, inexpensive act.&lt;ref&gt;Schickel (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While many TV films of the 1970s were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production, the small screen also saw a revival of the B melodrama. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''The Ordeal of [[Patty Hearst]]'', which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened all the way back to the 1920s and such movies as ''Human Wreckage'' and ''When Love Grows Cold'', pictures from low-budget studio [[Film Booking Offices|FBO]] made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Some TV movies, such as ''[[Nightmare in Badham County]]'' (ABC; 1976), headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.

The reverberations of ''Easy Rider'' could be felt in ''Nightmare in Badham County'', as well as in a host of big-screen exploitation films of the era. But perhaps its greatest influence on the fate of the B movie was less direct. By 1973, the major studios were clearly catching on to the commercial potential of genres that had once been consigned to the bargain basement. ''Rosemary's Baby'' had shown that a well-packaged horror "special" could be a box-office hit, but it had little in common with the exploitation style. Warner Bros.' ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', directed by [[William Friedkin]], was a different story. It showed that a heavily promoted and distributed film in the genre could be an absolute blockbuster. And more: In William Paul's description, "it is the film that really established gross-out as a mode of expression for mainstream cinema.... [P]ast exploitation films managed to exploit their cruelties by virtue of their marginality. ''The Exorcist'' made cruelty respectable. By the end of the decade, the exploitation booking strategy of opening films simultaneously in hundreds to thousands of theaters became standard industry practice."&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), pp. 288, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the biggest movie of the year and by far the highest-earning horror movie yet made. On behalf of its genre, [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[American Graffiti]]'' did something similar. Released when writer-director [[George Lucas]] was twenty-nine years old, it is described by Paul as "essentially an American-International teenybopper pic with a lot more spit and polish"—a combination that made it the third biggest movie of 1973 and, likewise, by far the highest-earning teen-themed movie yet made.&lt;ref&gt;Paul (1994), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A-budgeted B-themed movies of even greater historical import would follow in their wake.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3285">The '''Beverage Testing Institute''' ('''BTI''') is a marketing service company that provides reviews for [[distilled beverage|spirits]], [[wines]], and [[beer]]s. It uses numerical scores and publishes books of its test results.

The company's beer marketing program, the '''World Beer Championships''', was founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tastings.com/Tastings_World_Beer_Championships.html Tastings World Beer Championships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
The company rates spirits, wines and beers. It does not accept advertising from any company that submits their products for review. The judging ratings range from 96 to 100 for superlative to 80 and below for not recommended. Jerald O’Kennard, Director of the Beverage Testing Institute, said that 94 is an extremely good score, and unusually high. They use a tasting lab in [[Chicago]]. Testing methods minimize external factors and maximize the concentration of the panelist. Taste tests are practically the same time every weekday morning. All of the panelists are professional guest tasters who are retailers, restaurateurs, or prominent writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nightclub.com/ultra-premium/fuzzys-vodka-awarded-international-gold-medal-908 | title = Fuzzy's Vodka Awarded International Gold Medal | accessdate = 2010-06-12 | date = 2009-11-17 | work = Nightclub &amp; Bar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
The company published the book ''Beverage Testing Institute's Buying Guide to Beer''. The book is a guide to beers throughout the world. The breweries and brands are arranged in alphabetical order according to geographic location. There are also notes on the appearance, aroma, and taste for every beer that is rated and there is information on [[beer styles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.beerbooks.com/cgi/ps4.cgi?action=enter&amp;thispage=1288&amp;order_id=!ORDERID! | title = Beverage Testing Institute's Buying Guide to Beer | accessdate = 2010-06-12 | work = BeerBooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also published the book ''Buying Guide to Imported Wines''. The book has evaluations of styles, vintages, and producers cover 2,500 wines from 22 countries in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Russia. The best-scoring wines are categorized by name, region, description, and price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JyGgAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=beverage+testing+institute&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hxAUTO-RLZKFnQfKx_2LDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ | title = Buying Guide to Imported Wines | accessdate = 2010-06-12 | work = Google Books Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scores and their meaning==
The scores are translated onto a modified 100-point scale. The five "bands" below more accurately reflect the quality of products in today's market. It roughly corresponds to a five-star system:

*96–100—Superlative
*90–95—Exceptional
*85–89—Highly Recommended
*80–84—Recommended
*less than 80—Not Recommended
*Best Buy. Wines or spirits that provide uncommon value.
*Cellar Selection. This is a wine that they believe will improve significantly with at least three to five years of age.

The '''buddy system''' is a [[procedure (term)|procedure]] in which two people, the "buddies", operate together as a single unit so that they are able to monitor and help each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the buddy system? |url=http://www.becomeascout.org/faq.aspx |work=FAQs |publisher=Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905063021/http://www.becomeascout.org/faq.aspx |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As per Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the phrase “buddy system” goes as far back as 1942. Webster goes on to define the buddy system as “an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/buddy%20system&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieci.org/newsroom-and-insights/working-in-pairs-the-buddy-system&lt;/ref&gt;
The buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could be to ensure that the work is finished safely or the skill/learning is transferred effectively from one individual to the other.

==Advantages==
In adventurous or dangerous activities, where buddies are often required, the main benefit of the system is improved [[safety]]; each may be able to prevent the other becoming a casualty or rescue the other in a crisis.

When this system is used as part of training or the induction of newcomers to an organization, the less experienced buddy learns more quickly from close and frequent contact with the experienced buddy than when operating alone.

==Organizations==
The buddy system is used in the [[United States Armed Forces]], and referred to by various names in each branch ("[[Wingman|Wingmen]]" in the Air Force, "Battle Buddies" in the Army, "Shipmates" in the Navy), as well as the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]&lt;ref name="scouts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Buddy_System |title=Buddy System in Swimming, Boating, Rappelling and other activities.|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used by religious organisations like the LDS Church. Members on mission form a [[Missionary (LDS Church)#Companionships|companionship]] constituted by two or sometimes more missionaries, which are not allowed to be alone for a two-year time period: "Stay Together. Never be alone. It is extremely important that you stay with your companion at all times."&lt;ref name="ldshandbook"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lds.org/manual/missionary-handbook/missionary-conduct?lang=eng | title=LDS Missionary Handbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buddy system is used in new employee induction for assisting with the formalities in an organization. The period could be from a month to two months. The buddy helps in acclimatizing the new employee to the culture and day to day aspects of working, in a shorter period of time. The buddy helps the new employee to become knowledgeable about department practices and organizational culture in a shorter period. The purpose of assigning new employees with a buddy is to help welcome employees and reaffirms their decision to join the organization. It provides new employees with a reliable, motivated, single point-of-contact for their basic questions regarding their work experience. The buddy system is an effective method to provide support, monitor stress, and reinforce safety procedures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/buddy-system.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The buddy system is also informally used by [[elementary school|school-aged]] children, especially on [[field trip]]s. Assigning each student a buddy provides an extra measure of safety and removes some of the burden of keeping an eye on a large number of children in an unfamiliar environment from the supervising adults.

The buddy system encourages open and effective dialogue among peers and tends to break down social barriers with their classmates. It helps create a collaborative learning environment in which peers feel less hesitant to raise questions. This enables students to develop social networks, cross-cultural experiences. It provides effective support for the students who are ‘at risk’ and to lower the attrition rate at the higher education level.

== Education ==

=== Benefits of a buddy system ===

A buddy system in a school is where a child gets paired with another child, usually one that is older and of higher abilities. A buddy system helps to promote friendship, better support of coursework, behavioral and social needs, and can foster a greater sense of belonging and a more inclusive school community.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008&gt;Hughes, C., &amp; Carter E.W. (2008). ''Peer Buddy Programs for Successful Secondary School Inclusion.'' Paul H. Brookes Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Students create friendships that enable both older and younger "buddies" to bond more closely with their school, increasing the likelihood of more positive school behavior and positive response towards learning for all students.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; The buddy system helps students starting at a new school have a welcoming experience from the very beginning. The older children learn to take on responsibility, while the younger children know that they have a fellow student they can confidently turn to for support.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015&gt;Anderson, M. K., Tenenbaum, L. S., Ramadorai, S. B., &amp; Yourick, D. L. (2015). "Near-peer mentor model: synergy within mentoring". ''Mentoring &amp; Tutoring: Partnership in Learning'', 23(2), 116–132.&lt;/ref&gt;
Buddy systems in schools can have numerous benefits such as promoting an inclusive environment for all,&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; better acceptance of differences, promoting better self-control, expansion of communicative interaction with peers,&lt;ref name=Quill1990&gt;Quill, K. A. (1990). "A model for integrating children with autism". ''Focus on Autistic Behavior'', 5(4), 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; decrease in behavioral problems,&lt;ref name=Fo1974&gt;Fo, W. S., &amp; O'Donnell, C. R. (1974). "The Buddy System: Relationship and contingency conditions in a community intervention program for youth with nonprofessionals as behavior change agents." ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', 42(2), 163–169.&lt;/ref&gt; and even personal maturation or growth in career aspirations.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;
The buddy system positively affects the culture of the school and it greatly affects the troubled student as well as the older buddy.
The students learn and share from their peers and learn collaboratively. The students actively participate with each other and enjoy the informal setting and feel comfortable discussing with peers rather than a teacher. The opportunity for active participation, clearing doubts and discussions help students to continue with studies or activities with joy and creates a depth in the subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The buddy system helps to increase self-confidence for all involved in the system and in the process helps build trust and co-operation within individuals. It benefits the buddies, buddy learner, school/university and the parents as well. The buddies involved also learn leadership skills and in turn can take up the role of buddy leader.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; 
The buddy system helps in reducing the stress level of the learner. It reduces the levels of anxiety experienced by the students who struggle to engage with course material or with the school/university in general.{{citation needed|reason= citation provided hereafter does not apply to students but to rats|date=August 2016}} "When there's a companion available, the physiological measure of stress—cortisol levels in the blood—can be alleviated somewhat", explains Jim Winslow, PhD, a specialist in behavioral neuroscience and pharmacology and head of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Research Program, Non-Human Primate Core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andelson|first1=Rachel|title=Buddy system eases stress|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/sep04/buddy.aspx|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teachers at progressive schools collaborate to improve their students' learning—and their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Tony|title=The Buddy System|url=http://www.edweek.org/tm/articles/2005/01/01/04view.h16.html|website=www.edweek.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives independence to all students, and increases self-esteem and peer acceptance. Children become protectors of each other.
Christine Hogan states that the buddy system approach is highly appropriate for organizational behavior studies adding to the students' range of learning strategies. The technique not only works with peers of the same nation but has also proved to be of particular importance to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hogan, (1992) "'You are not studying alone': Introducing experiential learning into the teaching of organizational behaviour", ''Education + Training'', 34(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pairing types ===

There are numerous pairings styles: newly admitted students paired with older students, low achieving elementary school students paired with high achieving elementary school students;&lt;ref&gt;Freyberg, J. T., (1967). "The effects of participating in an elementary school buddy system on the self concept, school attitudes and behaviors, and achievement of fifth grade Negro children."

=== Metropolitan Nashville Peer Buddy Program ===

An example of a successful peer buddy system was in Nashville, Tennessee's McGavock High School. Teachers were concerned with having a more inclusive environment for special education students. Not only were the specialized students excluded academically but there was social exclusion as well. This adversely affects specialized students when there is a need for them to later assimilate when out of high school.&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; Students with disabilities were eating with their buddies and their friends, which resulted in the expansion of their circle of friendship and thus allowed for the special needs students to feel more normal and included. The program was so successful it was later adopted in the other 11 high schools of that district.&lt;ref name=Anderson2015/&gt;

=== Buddy systems for mainstream students ===

There are more examples of buddy systems for developmentally challenged students than there are of students with normal development but with behavioral or academic needs.&lt;ref name=Fo1974/&gt; If a system can be implemented that can help autistic or behaviorally challenged children or children with intellectual disabilities, than similar buddy systems can be incorporated into mainstream classrooms to help aid students that have a hard time learning but who may not qualify for the special needs programs. Students with disabilities report feeling more included, able to start friendships and conversations,&lt;ref name=Carter2001/&gt; and these same benefits can be transferred over to students that have social problems but are not able to be in special needs programs. Similarly, a student who is struggling academically can be paired with someone more adept with certain subjects.

Peer buddy groups can benefit many people. More research is needed to understand the possible impact of buddy systems for the general student population. Students that qualify for special services receive a lot of attention but students struggling behaviorally and socially would highly benefit from such an inclusive service.

=== Implementation of buddy systems ===

Students that qualify for special needs services receive a lot of attention. For the students that do not qualify but might be struggling behaviorally and socially, then programs like these could potentially have similar benefits for them as well. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; promote a more ubiquitous peer buddy system in their book by laying out different strategies and benefits if schools were to include these systems in their curriculum. Examples they provide are: administrators assisting  in the publication of the program, school counselors signing up students for a credit based buddy system course, general education teachers providing support for special needs students who might be in there classroom and having parents providing impetus and support for a program to begin. Carolyn Hughes and Erik Carter&lt;ref name=Hughes2008/&gt; suggest starting on a smaller scale, perhaps a classroom or two and then growing a base of support.

=== Peer-to-peer buddy systems for autistic students ===

A key element of education is to build empathy and understand other people in the society. This approach sees a small group of students in a class being made "buddies" for an autistic student. The students are made aware of particular challenge a student has and are asked to take special care to include them, to be on the lookout for any bullying or exclusion and to be supportive to the student if they get stressed out or upset at break time or in class.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The students who are selected would be chosen for their maturity and kindness. Parental consent would be sought from the parents of the students involved. While not every autistic student will instantly begin to socialise or make friends, this approach will at the very least ensure inclusion and also that there will be a friendly pair of eyes when teachers are not present or are out of ear-shot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Everyone needs a buddy sometimes – maybe a student is having a bad day, is upset about something or just is not very good at starting conversations or making friends alone. Under this system, a class would explore difference as a whole and recognize that everyone in a class is different and so have different needs, strengths, abilities and oddities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} They would then either be paired up or each student would draw a name and become "buddy" to that person, perhaps without them even being made aware of it. Before the draw or pairing it could be discussed with the teacher, to ensure an autistic student gets an especially strong buddy.
The advantage of this system is that it does not single out the autistic student, especially if they are not comfortable with that, and instead includes everyone. Additionally, it gives the autistic person a role in being a buddy too, which can be used to teach social skills, expectations and etiquette.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Adam|title="Back to School": Buddy System|url=https://www.asiam.ie/back-school-buddy-system|website=asiam.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cayuse language''' (''Cailloux, Willetpoos'') is an extinct [[unclassified language]] formerly spoken by the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] tribe in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].  The Cayuse name for themselves was ''Liksiyu'' (see Aoki 1998).

Similarities to [[Molala language|Molala]], the language of people to the south of them in central Oregon, are thought to have been due to [[language contact|contact]].

'''"Chasing the dragon"''' ({{zh|t=追龍|s=追龙|j=zeoi1 lung4|p=zhuī lóng|first=t}}) is a [[slang]] phrase of [[Cantonese]] origin from [[Hong Kong]] referring to inhaling the vapor from heated  [[morphine]], [[heroin]], [[oxycodone]] or [[opium]] that has been placed on a piece of foil.  The "chasing" occurs as the user gingerly keeps the liquid moving in order to keep it from coalescing into a single, unmanageable mass.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dikotter, Lars Laamann &amp; Zhou Xun, ''Narcotic Culture: A History of Drugs in China'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), 162.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another more metaphorical use of the term "chasing the dragon" refers to the elusive pursuit of the ultimate high in the usage of some particular drug. Both usages have been frequently featured in popular culture.

'''Cretan School''' describes an important school of [[icon]] painting, under the umbrella of '''post-Byzantine art''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spratt|first=Emily L.|date=2012|title=Toward a Definition of "Post-Byzantine" Art: The Angleton Collection at the Princeton University Art Museum|jstor=24416383|journal=Record of the Art Museum, Princeton University|volume=71/72|pages=2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.

== 15th century ==
[[File:Desprestaur.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''[[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]]'', probably an early Cretan work of 13th or 14th century.]]
[[File:Zafouris Triptych of Deposition.jpg|thumb|left|260px|''Deposition, Lamentation and Resurrection'' triptych by [[Nikolaos Zafouris]], c. 1490s ([[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]).]]

There was a substantial demand for Byzantine icons in Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and, as a Venetian possession since 1204, [[Crete]] had a natural advantage and soon came to dominate the supply. A probable early example is the famous icon of the Virgin in [[Rome]] known as [[Our Mother of Perpetual Help]], which was certainly well known in Rome by 1499. At this date there is little to distinguish Cretan work from other Byzantine icons stylistically, and the quality of work is lower than that associated with [[Constantinople]].

This period also saw considerable numbers of wall-paintings in local churches and monasteries - altogether some 850 from the 14th and 15th centuries survive in Crete, far more than from earlier or later periods.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis, in ''From Byzantium to El Greco'',p.42, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 15th century, Cretan artists had established a distinct icon-painting style, distinguished by "the precise outlines, the modelling of the flesh with dark brown underpaint and dense tiny highlights on the cheeks of the faces, the bright colours in the garments, the geometrical treatment of the drapery, and, finally the balanced articulation of the composition",&lt;ref&gt;Nano Chatzidakis, in ''From Byzantium to El Greco'',p.49, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt; or "sharp contours, slim silhouettes, linear draperies and restrained movements".&lt;ref&gt;Anne Met-Graavgard in ''Post-Byzantine art'', Grove Art Online, accessed January 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous artist of the period was [[Andreas Ritzos]]
(c. 1421–1492), whose son Nicholas was also well known.  Angelos Akotantos, until recently thought to be a conservative painter of the 17th century, is now, after the discovery of a will dated 1436, seen to have been an innovative artist in fusing Byzantine and Western styles, who survived until about 1457, when the will was actually registered.  The will was made in anticipation of a voyage to Constantinople; several icons were bequeathed to church institutions, some Catholic but mainly Orthodox, and the disposition of his stock of pattern drawings was carefully specified.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack; Painting the Soul; pp. 182-191; 1997; Reaktion Books, London; {{ISBN|1-86189-001-X}}. For the older view, see D. Talbot-Rice, Byzantine Art&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andreas Pavias]] (d. after 1504) and his pupil [[Angelo Bizamanos|Angelos Bizamanos]], and Nicholas Tzafuris (d. before 1501) were other leading artists.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 311-12, {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the fall of [[Constantinople]] there is evidence that leading [[Byzantine art]]ists were leaving the capital in order to settle in Crete. The migration of Byzantine artists to Crete continued increasingly the next years and reached its peak after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when Crete became "the most important centre of art in the Greek world", influencing artistic developments in the rest of the Greek world.  Cretan icons were commissioned for monasteries on [[Mount Athos]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Nano Chatzidakis, op cit, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cretan school had a smaller rival; until it fell to the Turks in 1522, [[Rhodes]] also had a community of artists, but not so large or significant.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack in Byzantium to El Greco'',p.27, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Venetian archives preserve considerable documentation on the trade of artistic icons between Venice and Crete, which by the end of the 15th century had become one of mass production. There is documentation of a specific order in 1499, of 700 icons of the [[Virgin]], 500 in a Western style, and 200 in [[Byzantine]] style. The order was placed with three artists by two dealers, one Venetian and one from mainland [[Greece]], and the time between contract date and delivery was set at only forty-five days.  Probably the quality of many such commissioned icons was fairly low, and the dismissive term '''Madonneri''' was devised to describe such bulk painters, who later practised in Italy also, often using a quasi-Byzantine style, and apparently often Greek or Dalmatian individuals.  Production of icons at these levels seems to have led to a glut in the market, and in the following two decades there is much evidence that the Cretan trade declined significantly, as the European demand had been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Constantoudaki-Kitromilides in ''From Byzantium to El Greco'',p.51-2, Athens 1987, Byzantine Museum of Arts&lt;/ref&gt;  But at the top end of the market Cretan icons were now the finest in the [[Byzantine]] world.

About 120 artists can be documented working in Candia (the Venetian name of [[Chandax]], present day [[Herakleion]]), in the period 1453–1526, and they had organized a ''Schuola di San Luca'' [[painter's guild]], based on the Italian model.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis in The Icon, 1982, Evans Brothers Ltd, London, p. 310, {{ISBN|0-237-45645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blending of the Eastern and the Western traditions, and a relaxed interchange between [[Greek Orthodoxy|Greek Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] rites led to the "'''Cretan Renaissance'''", a golden period for the arts on the island, where both literature and painting flourished. Some of these painters chose to continue the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition of Constantinople, while others were influenced by the masters of the Venetian Renaissance, such as [[Giovanni Bellini]] and [[Titian]].&lt;ref name="Tazartes23-24"&gt;M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] was to be a particular influence.  Works by these masters or copies were in monasteries and churches of the island, while examples of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] decorated the Catholic churches of [[Heraklion|Candia]] or were to be found in the private collections of rich Venetians and Greeks.&lt;ref name="Plaka41" /&gt; In particular, Candia contained a large Franciscan church and a large Orthodox monastery, a daughter-house of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], both of which had strong collections from their respective traditions.

Contemporary documents refer to two styles in painting: the ''maniera greca'' (''alla greca'', in line with the Byzantine idiom) and the ''maniera Latina'' (''alla Latina'', in accordance with Western techniques), which artists knew and utilized according to the circumstances; as a result some kind of "[[eclecticism]]" appeared.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, ''El Greco-The Greek'', 40-41&lt;br /&gt;* M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, sometimes both styles could be found in the same icon, the one right next to the other.&lt;ref name="Plaka41"&gt;M. Lambraki-Plaka, El Greco—The Greek&lt;/ref&gt; The fame of the most prominent Cretan painters spread throughout [[Greece]], the [[Mediterranean]] and Europe. After the beginning of the 16th century, the Cretan artists once again had more commissions and their works were avidly sought, since they had started to use new motives and to adjust their iconography to the new trends of their era.  To an extent quantity was probably replaced by quality compared with the previous century.

=== 16th-century artists ===

Apart from El Greco, the most famous Cretan artists during the century were Theophanis Strelitzas (Θεοφάνης Στρελίτζας), known as [[Theophanes of Crete|Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Michael Damaskenos]] (Μιχαήλ Δαμασκηνός), and [[Georgios Klontzas]] (Γεώργιος Κλόντζας).&lt;ref name="Tazartes23-24" /&gt;  Various members of the Lambardos family were also significant artists.  Fortunately for art historians, many Cretan painters adopted the practice, perhaps as early as Western painters, of signing their work, which was not a traditional Byzantine practice.&lt;ref&gt;David Talbot-Rice, Byzantine Art, 3rd edn 1968, Penguin Books Ltd, p. 384. See also Cormack, 1997, op cit., pp.172-4 &amp; passim&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophanes the Cretan]] was a relatively conservative Cretan artist, whose first dated work is from 1527, and all of whose known works were done on the mainland or smaller islands. He was the most important Greek wall painter of his day, incorporating some Western iconographic and stylistic elements, but remaining essentially Byzantine in spirit.

The intellectual and artistic personality of the young [[El Greco]] was formed in this artistic environment. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a "master" ("maestro Domenigo"), meaning he was already an enrolled master of the local guild, presumably in charge of his own workshop.&lt;ref name="Panayotakis29"&gt;N.M. Panayotakis, ''The Cretan Period of Doménicos'', 29&lt;/ref&gt;  He left for Venice a few years later, and never returned to Crete. His ''[[Dormition of the Virgin (El Greco)|Dormition of the Virgin]]'', of before 1567 in [[tempera]] and gold on panel (61,4 x 45&amp;nbsp;cm, Holy Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin, [[Hermoupolis]], [[Syros]]) was probably created near the end of [[El Greco]]'s Cretan period. The painting combines post-Byzantine and Italian [[Mannerist]] stylistic and iconographic elements, and incorporates stylistic elements of the Cretan School.

During the second half of the 16th century, many Cretan artists went to [[Venice]], in the hope of gaining commissions and recognition. Unlike El Greco, the other Cretan painters who moved there did not substantially alter their styles or working methods. They simply incorporated more Italian motifs into a consistent Byzantine framework. [[Jonathan Brown (author)|Jonathan Brown]] provides a perceptive analysis of the ways that El Greco distinguished himself from other Cretan artists active in Venice, while [[Richard G. Mann|Richard Mann]] argues that "none of these painters accepted Renaissance ideas about the relevance of change to the creation of art works".&lt;ref name="MannB"&gt;J. Brown, ''El Greco and Toledo'', 76-78&lt;br /&gt;* R.G. Mann, ''Tradition and Originality in El Greco's Work'', 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Damaskenos returned to Crete after three years, and remained there for the rest of his life.

[[File:TzanesIcon.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Icon by [[Emmanuel Tzanes]] (Paul and Alexandra Kanellopoulos Museum, [[Athens]]).]]

Prominent representatives of the Cretan School during the 17th century were Father [[Emmanuel Tzanes]] (Εμμανουήλ Τζάνες, 1610–1690), [[Emmanuel Lambardos]] and [[Theodoros Poulakis]] (Θεόδωρος Πουλάκης, 1622–1692). The Cretan icon painters continued to flourish, until the mid-century, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] occupied all the island except for Candia, which finally fell after twenty years of siege in 1669.&lt;ref&gt;X. Papaefthimiou, [http://www.i-m-patron.gr/keimena/xionadites.html Popular Aspects of the Greek Iconography] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524124904/http://www.i-m-patron.gr/keimena/xionadites.html |date=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Ottoman occupation of Crete, the centre of Greek painting moved to the [[Ionian Islands]], which remained under Venetian rule until the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. A new artistic movement was created called the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]] which was mostly influenced by [[Western European]] artistic trends. Many Cretan artists migrated to the Heptanese or [[Western Europe]] to enjoy the artistic freedom. A successive occupation of the Ionian islands by the [[France|French]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] allowed the [[Heptanese]] to remain the centre of [[Greek Art]] until the independence of Greece in 1830.

The '''Dagan languages''' are a small family of [[Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea]] (TNG) languages spoken in the "[[Bird's Tail]]" (southeastern peninsula) of New Guinea, the easternmost Papuan languages on the mainland. They are sometimes included in a speculative [[Southeast Papuan languages|Southeast Papuan]] branch of Trans&amp;ndash;New Guinea (TNG), but the Southeast Papuan families have not been shown to be any more closely related to each other than they are to other TNG families.

The languages are: 
:[[Daga language|Daga]], [[Mapena language|Mapena]], [[Maiwa language|Maiwa]], [[Dima language|Dima]] (Jimajima), [[Ginuman language|Ginuman]], [[Kanasi language|Kanasi]] (Sona), [[Onjob language|Onjob]], [[Umanakaina language|Umanakaina]] (Gwedena), and the nearly extinct [[Turaka language|Turaka]].

Although clearly related, they are not particularly close. The closest language to Umanakaina, for example, is Ginuman, which is only 23% lexically similar.  Pronouns are:

In the same interview, former Misfits vocalist [[Glenn Danzig]] explains that his version of the hairstyle developed from an imitation of [[Eddie Munster]]'s hairstyle. A style similar to the Devilock was sported earlier - for instance the Surfari's cover picture of 'Gum-dipped Slicks' (1964) shows a member of the band with a devilock-like quiff &lt;ref&gt;https://sundazed.com/c/365-Original-Surfaris-The.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Nihongo|'''''Dragon Ball'''''|ドラゴンボール|Doragon Bōru|lead=yes}}, sometimes styled as ''Dragonball'', is a Japanese [[media franchise]] created by [[Akira Toriyama]] in 1984. The initial [[manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting [[Japanese dragon|dragon]] when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

Toriyama's [[Dragon Ball (manga)|manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (anime)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|19 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996–1997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015–2018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and a [[List of Dragon Ball video games|large number of video games]]. {{As of|December 2014}},  the franchise has generated over {{US$|5&amp;nbsp;billion|link=yes}} in merchandise sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecnl.com/FunimationDec2014Catalog.pdf|title=Funimation December 2014 catalogue|date=December 2014|website=www.thecnl.com|access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dragon Ball'' is one of the top ten [[List of the highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]], as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pokemon Beats Out Star Wars, Marvel as Highest Grossing Media Franchise |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/08/28/pokemon-highest-grossing-media-franchise/ |work=ComicBook.com |date=August 28, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its release, ''Dragon Ball'' has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time. The manga's 42 volumes have sold over 159{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan and over 350{{nbsp}}million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history&lt;!-- this is referenced in the reception section below. --&gt;. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture.

[[Akira Toriyama]] loosely modeled ''Dragon Ball'' on the classic Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'';&lt;ref name="Manga Design"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manga Design |chapter=Akira Toriyama |first=Julius |last=Wiedemann |editor=Amano Masanao (ed.) |publisher=[[Taschen]] |date=September 25, 2004 |page=372 |isbn=3-8228-2591-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]]  |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |date=September 1, 2001 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-64-7 |oclc=47255331 |pages=101–102 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] manga ''Dragon Boy''.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"/&gt; He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor [[Jackie Chan]],&lt;ref name="Illustrations"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 1: COMPLETE ILLUSTRATIONS|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=206–207|language =Japanese|isbn=4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: STORY GUIDE|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=261–265|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-782752-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of ''Journey to the West'', but with "a little [[kung fu]]."&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80–91|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama was a fan of [[Hong Kong martial arts films]] such as ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'' in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dragon Ball Z Legend: The Quest Continues |date=2004 |publisher=DH Publishing Inc |isbn=9780972312493 |page=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEeDFD3KItgC&amp;pg=PA7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was serialized in a shōnen magazine, he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game-like activity of gathering something, without thinking of what the characters would wish for.&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"/&gt; With Goku being [[Sun Wukong]], [[Bulma]] as [[Tang Sanzang]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Oolong|Oolong]] as [[Zhu Bajie]] and [[Yamcha]] being [[Sha Wujing]], he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shenlong2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Shenlong Times 2 |work=DRAGON BALL 大全集 2: Story Guide |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |year=1995| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand, he specifically aimed ''Dragon Ball'' at readers older than those of his previous serial ''[[Dr. Slump]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furinkan.com/takahashi/takahashi4.html |title=Toriyama/Takahashi interview |publisher=Furinkan.com |date=1986 |accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in ''Dr. Slump'', deliberately going for Chinese scenery, referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of [[China]] his wife had bought.&lt;ref name="World"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 大全集 4: WORLD GUIDE|year=1995|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=164–169 |isbn=4-08-782754-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island where the {{nihongo|Tenkaichi Budōkai|天下一武道会||lit. "Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament"}} is held is modeled after [[Bali]], which he, his wife and assistant visited in mid-1985, and for the area around [[Babidi|Bobbidi]]'s spaceship he consulted photos of [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="World"/&gt;
[[File:Wiki DragonBall Earth.png|thumb|right|The Earth of ''Dragon Ball'', as published in ''Daizenshuu 4: World Guide'']]

During the early chapters of the manga Toriyama's editor, [[Kazuhiko Torishima]], commented that Goku looked rather plain, so to combat this he added several characters like [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kame-Sennin|Kame-Sen'nin]] and [[Krillin|Kuririn]], and created the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first Tenkaichi Budōkai began that ''Dragon Ball'' truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in ''Dr. Slump''.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Spartan X]]'', in which enemies tended to appear very fast. He then created [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo Daimao]] as a truly evil villain, and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth, they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the {{nihongo|Saiyans|サイヤ人|Saiya-jin}}; and Goku himself was [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] from an Earthling to a Saiyan who was sent to Earth as a baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title=DRAGON BALL 天下一伝説|year=2004|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=80–91|language=Japanese|isbn=4-08-873705-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frieza|Freeza]], who forcibly took over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]] and was inspired by [[real estate]] [[Speculation|speculators]], whom Toriyama called the "worst kind of people."&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; Finding the escalating enemies difficult, he created the [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Ginyu Force|Ginyu Force]] to add more balance to the series. When Toriyama created the {{nihongo4|Super Saiyan|{{ruby|超|スーパー}}サイヤ人|Sūpā Saiya-jin}} transformation during the Freeza arc, he was initially concerned that Goku's facial expressions as a Super Saiyan made him look like a villain, but decided it was acceptable since the transformation was brought about by anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toriyama|first=Akira|authorlink1= Akira Toriyama|title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　5: TV ANIMATION PART 2 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–210 |isbn=4-08-782755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added [[time travel]] next during the [[Cell (Dragon Ball)|Cell]] arc, but said he had a hard time with it, only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt; After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for [[Gohan]] to replace Goku as the series' [[protagonist]], but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind.&lt;ref name="Story"/&gt;

Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, he designed many of ''Dragon Ball''{{'s}} most powerful characters with small statures, including the protagonist, Goku.&lt;ref name="SJ interview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interview with the Majin! Revisited |journal=[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]] |volume=5 |issue=11 |page=388 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |date=November 2007 |issn=1545-7818}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toriyama later explained that he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier, even though his first editor [[Kazuhiko Torishima]] was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically.&lt;ref name="Chogashu"&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON BALL 超画集|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|pages=224–225|year=2013|isbn=978-4-08-782520-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings.&lt;ref name="World"/&gt; Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story, resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series, including changing the colors of the characters mid-story and few characters having [[screentone]] because he found it difficult to use.&lt;ref name="Illustrations"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TenkaDen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shenlong2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=DRAGON　BALL　大全集　5: TV ANIMATION PART 2 |year=1995 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |pages=206–210 |isbn=4-08-782755-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the completion of ''Dragon Ball'', Toriyama has continued to add to its story, mostly background information on its universe, through guidebooks published by Shueisha.

During the second half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines.&lt;ref name="Illustrations"/&gt; In 2013, he stated that because ''Dragon Ball'' is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art.&lt;ref name="Chogashu"/&gt; He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an "unconventional and contradictory" story.&lt;ref name="SJ interview"/&gt; In 2013, commenting on ''Dragon Ball''{{'}}s global success, Toriyama said, "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy.", "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers."&lt;ref name="AsahiInterview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iwamoto |first=Tetsuo|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201303270032|title=Dragon Ball artist: 'I just wanted to make boys happy'|publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]]|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spin-offs====
Another manga penned by Ōishi, the three-chapter ''[[Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock]]'' that revolves around [[Burdock (Dragon Ball)|Bardock]], Goku's father, was published in the monthly magazine ''[[V Jump]]'' from August and October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-21/dragon-ball-episode-of-bardock-spinoff-manga-gets-anime |title=Dragon Ball Episode of Bardock Spinoff Manga Gets Anime |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, a spin-off manga titled ''Dragon Ball Side Story: The Case of Being Reincarnated as Yamcha'' began in Shueisha's ''Shōnen Jump+'' digital magazine. Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the ''Dragon Ball'' manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/12/11-1/dragon-ball-spin-off-imagines-a-world-where-yamcha-totally-rules|title="Dragon Ball" Spin-Off Imagines a World Where Yamcha Totally Rules|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|first=Paul|last=Chapman|date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crossovers ====
Toriyama also created a short series, ''[[Neko Majin]]'' (1999–2005), that became a self-parody of ''Dragon Ball''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-851090-9&amp;mode=1|script-title=ja:ネコマジン 完全版 |publisher=Shueisha|accessdate=June 22, 2008|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] between ''[[Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo]]'' (or ''Kochikame'') and ''Dragon Ball'' by Toriyama and ''Kochikame'' author [[Osamu Akimoto]] appeared in the {{nihongo4|''Super Kochikame''|超こち亀|Chō Kochikame}} manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/超こち亀-ジャンプコミックス-秋本-治/dp/4088740963|title=超こち亀|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Toriyama teamed up with [[Eiichiro Oda]] to create a crossover chapter of ''Dragon Ball'' and ''[[One Piece]]'' titled ''Cross Epoch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/03/comics-spotlight-on-shonen-jump-100/|title=Comics Spotlight on Shonen Jump #100|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anime ===
''Dragon Ball'', ''Dragon Ball Z'', and ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'' are all adaptations of the manga, with various new material added in to make extra episodes so that Toriyama would have more time to write original chapters for them to adapt. ''Dragon Ball GT'' and ''Dragon Ball Heroes'' are not originated from any direct source material from Toriyama, being fully created by their respective animation studios. ''Dragon Ball Super'' was released parallel to (and many times ahead of) the manga of the same name, due to the fact that they were both based on the same outline by Toriyama for the story of ''Super''.

==== ''Dragon Ball'' ====
{{main|Dragon Ball (anime)|List of Dragon Ball episodes}}
[[Toei Animation]] produced an [[anime]] television series based on the first 194 manga chapters, also titled ''Dragon Ball''. The series premiered in Japan on [[Fuji Television]] on February 26, 1986 and ran until April 19, 1989, lasting 153 episodes.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"/&gt;

==== ''Dragon Ball Z'' ====
{{main|Dragon Ball Z|List of Dragon Ball Z episodes}}
Instead of continuing the anime as ''Dragon Ball'', Toei Animation decided to carry on with their adaptation under a new name and asked Akira Toriyama to come up with the title. {{Nihongo|''Dragon Ball Z''|ドラゴンボールZ(ゼット)|Doragon Bōru Zetto|commonly abbreviated as ''DBZ''}} picks up five years after the first series left off and adapts the final 325 chapters of the manga. It premiered in Japan on Fuji Television on April 26, 1989, taking over its predecessor's time slot, and ran for 291 episodes until its conclusion on January 31, 1996.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"/&gt; Two television specials based on the ''Z'' series were aired on Fuji TV in Japan. The first, ''The One True Final Battle ~The Z Warrior Who Challenged Freeza -- Son Goku's Father~'', renamed ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku|Bardock – The Father of Goku]]'' by Funimation, was shown on October 17, 1990. The second special, ''Defiance in the Face of Despair!! The Remaining Super-Warriors: Gohan and Trunks'', renamed ''[[Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks|The History of Trunks]]'' by Funimation, is based on a special chapter of the original manga and aired on February 24, 1993.

*'''''Dragon Ball Z Kai''''' (Remastered Director's Cut)
{{Main|List of Dragon Ball Z Kai episodes}}
In February 2009, ''Dragon Ball Z'' celebrated its 20th anniversary, with Toei Animation announcing that it would broadcast a re-edited and remastered version under the name {{Nihongo|''Dragon Ball Kai''|ドラゴンボール改|Doragon Bōru Kai|lit. "Dragon Ball Revised"}}. The footage would be re-edited to follow the manga more closely, eliminating scenes and episodes which were not featured in the original manga, resulting in a more faithful adaptation, as well as in a faster-moving, and more focused story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= ｢ドラゴンボールZ｣放送開始20周年記念!

{{See also|List of Dragon Ball films}}
Nineteen animated theatrical films based on the ''Dragon Ball'' series have been released in Japan. The two most recent films, ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods]]'' (2013) and ''[[Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F']]'' (2015), were produced as full-length feature films and were given stand-alone theatrical releases in Japan (as well as limited theatrical releases in the U.S.); these two have a greater sense of continuity with the series than the older films, especially since their storylines were directly adapted into the first-two story arcs of the ''Dragon Ball Super'' anime. They're also the first movies to have original creator Akira Toriyama deeply involved in their production.&lt;ref name="BattleGods"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-07-10/toei-toriyama-work-on-march-2013-dragon-ball-z-film |title = Akira Toriyama, Toei Make Dragon Ball Z Film Next March |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |accessdate = March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Key Visual For 2015 Dragon Ball Z Film Reveals Frieza|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-11-17/1st-key-visual-for-2015-dragon-ball-z-film-reveals-frieza/.81112|website=ANN|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 feature film, ''[[Dragon Ball: The Path to Power]]'', with a running time of 80 minutes was produced to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the anime and is a re-imagining of the first arc of the series.

All films preceding these three were usually below [[feature length]] (around 45–60 minutes each), making them only slightly longer than an episode of the TV series, this is due to them being originally shown as back-to-back presentations alongside other Toei film productions. These films are also mostly alternate re-tellings of certain story arcs (like ''The Path to Power'') or extra side-stories that do not correlate with the continuity of the series. The first three films, along with ''The Path to Power'', are based on the original ''Dragon Ball'' anime series. The remaining fifteen films are based on ''Dragon Ball Z''. The first five films were shown at the {{nihongo4|Toei Manga Festival|[[:ja:東映まんがまつり|東映まんがまつり]]|Tōei Manga Matsuri}}, while the sixth through seventeenth films were shown at the {{nihongo4|Toei Anime Fair|[[:ja:東映アニメフェア|東映アニメフェア]]|Toei Anime Fea}}.

They were out of print for many years, but were re-released in April 2006 (accompanying the Japanese DVD release of ''Dragon Ball GT'') and this edition is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-874089-0 | title=復刻版ドラゴンボールGTパーフェクトファイル　vol．1 (Dragon Ball GT: Perfect File vol.1)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-874090-4&amp;mode=1 | title=復刻版ドラゴンボールGTパーフェクトファイル　vol．2 (Dragon Ball GT: Perfect File vol.2)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the 34-volume ''kanzenban'' re-release of the manga, and the release of the entire series on DVD for the first time in Japan, four new guidebooks were released in 2003 and 2004. ''Dragon Ball Landmark'' and ''Dragon Ball Forever'' cover the manga, using volume numbers for story points that reference the ''kanzenban'' release,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873702-4&amp;mode=1 | title=Dragonball　FOREVER| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873478-5&amp;mode=1 | title=Dragonball　LANDMARK| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu''|ドラゴンボール 天下一伝説}} and {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu''|ドラゴンボールZ 孫悟空伝説}} cover the ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Dragon Ball Z'' anime, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873705-9 | title=テレビアニメ完全カイド「DRAGONBALL」～天下一伝説～ (Dragon Ball: Tenkaichi Densetsu)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-873546-3 | title=テレビアニメ完全ガイド Dragonball　Z 孫悟空伝説 (Dragon Ball Z: Son Goku Densetsu)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the material in these books is reused from the earlier ''Daizenshuu'' volumes, but they include new textual material including substantial interviews with the creator, cast and production staff of the series. ''Son Goku Densetsu'' in particular showcases previously-unpublished design sketches of Goku's father Bardock, drawn by character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru prior to creator Akira Toriyama's revisions that resulted in the final version.

Following the release of ''Dragon Ball Kai'' in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide''|ドラゴンボール 超エキサイティングガイド}} in 2009, covering the manga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874803-0 | title=DRAGON　BALL　超エキサイティングガイド ストーリー編 (Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide Story)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874804-7 | title=DRAGON　BALL　超エキサイティングガイド キャラクター編 (Dragon Ball: Super Exciting Guide Character)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two-volume {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection''|ドラゴンボール　極限バトルコレクション}} in 2010, covering the anime series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874840-5&amp;mode=1 | title=DRAGON　BALL　極限バトルコレクション　ラウンド01 (Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection: Round 1)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-874841-2&amp;mode=1 | title=DRAGON　BALL　極限バトルコレクション　ラウンド02 (Dragon Ball: Extreme Battle Collection: Round 2)| publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the TV series airing during this time being ''Kai'', the ''Extreme Battle Collection'' books reference the earlier ''Z'' series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw the release of a new artbook, {{nihongo|''Dragon Ball: Anime Illustrations Guide - The Golden Warrior''|ドラゴンボール アニメイラスト集 「黄金の戦士」}}; a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented ''Complete Illustrations'', it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese "Dragon Box" DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of ''Dragon Ball Kai'', released 2009 to 2011, come with a ''Dragon Book'' guide that contains details about the content therein. Each also contains a new interview with a member of the cast or staff of the series. These books have been reproduced textually for Funimation's release of the ''Dragon Ball Z'' Dragon Box sets from 2009 to 2011.

''Dragon Ball'' is one of the most popular manga series of all time, and it continues to enjoy high readership today.

Manga critic [[Jason Thompson (writer)|Jason Thompson]] stated in 2011 that "''Dragon Ball'' is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every ''Shonen Jump'' artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways."&lt;ref name="ANNJT"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Jason|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2011-03-10|title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Dragon Ball|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says the series "turns from a gag/adventure manga to an nearly-pure fighting manga",&lt;ref name="ANNJT"/&gt; and its basic formula of "lots of martial arts, lots of training sequences, a few jokes" became the model for other [[Shōnen manga|shōnen]] series, such as ''Naruto''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Dragon Ball?|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5201656/what-is-dragon-ball|author=Thompson, Jason|authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer)|publisher=Io9|accessdate=December 9, 2009|date=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson also called Toriyama's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series' popularity.&lt;ref name="ANNJT"/&gt; James S. Yadao, author of ''The Rough Guide to Manga'', claims that the first several chapters of ''Dragon Ball ''"play out much like ''[[Journey to the West|Saiyuki]]'' with ''[[Dr. Slump]]''-like humour built in" and that ''Dr. Slump'', Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series.&lt;ref name=Yadao116&gt;Yadao, James S.

"Also in evidence is the influence of ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', especially in the early chapters, which play out much like ''[[Journey to the West|Saiyuki]]'' with ''Dr. Slump''-like humour built in."&lt;/ref&gt; He feels the series "established its unique identity" after the first occasion when Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin, when the story develops "a far more action-packed, sinister tone" with "wilder" battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count, while humor still makes an occasional appearance.&lt;ref name=Yadao116/&gt; Yadao claims that an art shift occurs when the characters "lose the rounded, innocent look that he established in ''Dr. Slump'' and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity."&lt;ref name=Yadao116117&gt;Yadao, James S.

''[[Animerica]]'' felt the series had "worldwide appeal", using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to "maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans".&lt;ref name="Animerica"&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2001 |title=Anime Radar: News |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=9 |issue=2 |page=36 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |location=San Francisco, California |issn=1067-0831 |oclc=27130932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Little Boy: The Art of Japan's Exploding Subculture'', Takashi Murakami commented that ''Dragon Ball''{{'s}} "never-ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly, seamlessly, and with great finesse."&lt;ref name="LittleBoy"/&gt; Ridwan Khan from Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a "chubby" art style, but as the series continued the characters got more refined, leaner, and more muscular. Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2003/07/reviews/08/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081211064603/http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2003/07/reviews/08/|archivedate= December 11, 2008|title= Dragon Ball Vol.1 review|publisher= Animefringe.com |date=July 2003 |author=Khan, Ridwan|accessdate= September 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen Divers of [[Anime News Network]] praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters' personalities.

Aviva Rothschild of Rationalmagic.com remarked the first manga volume as "a superior humor title".

The content of the manga has been controversial in the United States. In November 1999, [[Toys "R" Us]] removed Viz's ''Dragon Ball'' from their stores nationwide when a [[Dallas]] parent complained the series had "borderline soft porn" after he bought them for his four-year-old son.&lt;ref name="Maryland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maryland School Library to Remove Dragon Ball Manga|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-10-07/maryland-school-library-to-remove-dragon-ball-manga |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on the issue, [[Susan J. Napier]] explained it as a difference in culture.&lt;ref name="Maryland"/&gt; After the ban, Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution.&lt;ref name="censorship2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2000-08-21/viz-explains-censorship-in-dragonball-manga|title=Viz explains censorship in Dragonball Manga|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=August 22, 2000|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2001, after releasing three volumes censored, Viz announced ''Dragon Ball'' would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions.&lt;ref name="censorship2"/&gt; In October 2009, [[Wicomico County Public Schools]] in [[Maryland]] banned the ''Dragon Ball'' manga from their school district because it "depicts nudity, sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children."&lt;ref name="Maryland"/&gt;

=== Anime ===
The anime adaptations have also been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, "Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way ''Dragon Ball Z'' has.

Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up ''Dragon Ball'' as "an action-packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer—a genuine sense of adventure."&lt;ref name="DBseason2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball/dvd-season-2|last=Kimlinger|first=Carl|title= Dragon Ball DVD Season 2 Uncut Set|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation's reputation for drastic alterations of the script, but praised the dub.&lt;ref name="DBseason2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DBseason3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball/dvd-season-3|last=Martin|first=Theron|title= Dragon Ball DVD Season 3|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation's English dub and script of ''Dragon Ball Z'' over the years. Jeffrey Harris [[IGN]] criticized the voices including how Freeza's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza's gender.&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/12/dragon-ball-gt-the-lost-episodes-dvd-box-set-review|title= Dragon Ball GT&amp;nbsp;— The Lost Episodes DVD Box Set Review|publisher= IGN|date=November 12, 2007|author= Harris, Jeffrey |accessdate= October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=565|title= Dragon Ball anime review|publisher=themanime.org |author= Jones, Tim|accessdate= October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite praising ''Dragon Ball Z'' for its cast of characters, they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=245|title= Dragon Ball Z anime review|publisher=themanime.org |author= Ross, Carlos|accessdate= October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragon Ball Z'' is well-known, and often criticized, for its long, repetitive, dragged-out fights that span several episodes, with Martin commenting "DBZ practically turned drawing out fights into an art form."&lt;ref name="DBZSeason6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-z/dvd-season-6|last=Martin|first=Theron|title= Dragon Ball Z DVD Season 6|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isn't Dragon Ball just a bunch of speedlines and ripped dudes with bad hair screaming "It's over 9,000!"|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5201669/isnt-dragon-ball-just-a-bunch-of-speedlines-and-ripped-dudes-with-bad-hair-screaming-its-over-9000|author=Thompson, Jason|authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer)|publisher=Io9|date=April 8, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dragon Ball Z'' was listed as the 78th best animated show in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Animated Series,&lt;ref name="ign100"&gt;{{cite web |title=78.

Harris commented that ''Dragon Ball GT'' "is downright repellent", mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun. He also criticized the ''GT'' character designs of [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] and [[Vegeta]] as being goofy.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about ''GT'', mentioning that the fights from the series were "a very simple childish exercise" and that many other anime were superior. The plot of ''Dragon Ball GT'' has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/dragon-ball-gt/dvd-8|title=Dragon Ball GT DVD 8: Salvation|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|date=June 6, 2004|author= Bertschy, Zac |accessdate= October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode of ''Dragon Ball Z Kai'' earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11.3, ahead of ''[[One Piece]]'' and behind ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-13/japanese-anime-tv-ranking-march-30-april-5|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 13, 2009|title=Japanese Anime TV Ranking, March 30-April 5|accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although following episodes had lower ratings, ''Kai'' was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-16/japanese-anime-tv-ranking-april-6-12|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 16, 2009|title=Japanese Anime TV Ranking, April 6–12|accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-22/japanese-anime-tv-ranking-april-13-19|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 22, 2009|title=Japanese Anime TV Ranking, April 13–19|accessdate=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fabric tube turning''' is a [[sewing]] technique where an object is sewn with the right sides facing one another, leaving an opening, and is then "turned" out, concealing the stitching and unfinished edge, and leaving an opening through which filler or stuffing may be put into the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sewing.org/files/guidelines/1_150_tube_turners1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tube Turners : Part 1 |website=Sewing.org |accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabric may be turned with a common item such as a [[chopstick]], or with tools such as the Fasturn, Loop Turners, or [[Hemostat|Hemostats]].&lt;ref&gt;''Singer: The New Sewing Essentials'' by the Editors of Creative Publishing International, {{ISBN|0-86573-308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stiffer [[Textile|fabrics]] and narrower tubes are more difficult to turn than softer fabrics and broader tubes.

[[File:Alex Cafe, Islington - geograph.org.uk - 453902.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cafe (British)|British cafe]] (such as this one in Islington, London, with a “breakfast served all day” sign) typically serves the full breakfast throughout the day]]
A '''full breakfast''' is a [[breakfast]] meal that typically includes [[bacon]], [[Sausage#Britain and Ireland|sausages]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and a beverage such as coffee or tea. It comes in different regional variants and is referred to by different names depending on the area. While it is colloquially known as a “fry up” in most areas of Britain and Ireland, it is usually referred to as a ''full English breakfast'' in [[England]] (often shortened to "full English"),&lt;ref name="full English"&gt;{{cite web|title=The full English|url=http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/the-full-english|publisher=Jamieoliver.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore, as a "full Irish", "full Scottish", "full Welsh", “full Cornish”, and the "Ulster fry" in the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and [[Northern Ireland]], respectively.&lt;ref name="full Scottish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Scottish Food|url=http://www.visitscotland.com/about/food-drink/traditional|publisher=Visit Scotland|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="full Welsh"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowland |first=Paul |title=So what is a 'full Welsh breakfast'? |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |accessdate=26 February 2014 |newspaper=Wales Online |date=25 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004835/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |archivedate= 2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=James|title=How to...

It is also popular in other [[English-speaking countries]], particularly countries that were a part of the [[British Empire]].  On its origin, ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine states, "The idea of the English breakfast as a national dish goes right back to the 13th century and the country houses of the gentry. In the old Anglo-Saxon tradition of hospitality, households would provide hearty breakfasts for visiting friends, relatives and neighbours."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrylife.co.uk/food-drink/frying-pan-return-full-english-breakfast-167853 "10 reasons why the Full English Breakfast is one of the world’s great meals"]. ''Country Life'' magazine. Retrieved 21 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]] along with such staples as [[bangers and mash]], [[shepherd's pie]], [[cottage pie]], [[fish and chips]], [[roast beef]], [[Sunday roast]] and the [[Christmas dinner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History |first=Colin|last= Spencer|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fried breakfast became popular in Britain and Ireland during the Victorian era, and appears as one among many suggested breakfasts in home economist [[Isabella Beeton]]'s ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|Book of Household Management]]'' (1861). A full breakfast is often contrasted (e.g. on hotel menus) with the lighter alternative of a [[continental breakfast]], consisting of tea or coffee, milk and [[fruit juice]]s with bread, [[croissant]]s, [[bagel]]s, or [[pastry|pastries]].

[[File:Englishbreakfast.jpg|thumb|The full English breakfast often consists of bacon, fried egg, [[sausage]], mushrooms, baked beans, toast, grilled tomatoes, and accompanied with tea or coffee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/the-15-most-british-foods-ever/full-english-breakfast/ “The 15 most British foods ever.

The traditional full English breakfast includes bacon (traditionally [[back bacon]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishbreakfastsociety.com/full-english-breakfast.html |title=The Traditional Full English Breakfast |publisher=The English Breakfast Society |date= |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; fried, [[poached egg|poached]] or [[scrambled eggs]], fried or grilled tomatoes, fried mushrooms, [[fried bread]] or buttered [[toast]], and [[sausage]]s (also called "bangers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to make the perfect full English breakfast|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/11029015/How-to-make-the-perfect-full-English-breakfast.html|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black pudding]], [[baked bean]]s and [[bubble and squeak]] are also often included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Full English|url=https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/pork-recipes/the-full-english/|agency=Jamie Oliver.com|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stress-free full English breakfast|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/stressfreefullenglis_67721|agency=BBC|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[North Midlands]], fried or grilled [[Staffordshire oatcake|oatcake]]s sometimes replace fried bread. The food is traditionally served with a mug of tea; more recently coffee is an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to get all-you-can-eat breakfast with unlimited tea and coffee for just £5 in Coventry|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/whats-on/food-drink-news/how-you-can-eat-breakfast-13151617|work=Coventry Telegraph|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As nearly everything is fried in this meal, it is commonly called a "fry-up". As some of the items are optional, the phrase "full English breakfast", or "full English" (or  "[[The Full Monty (phrase)|Full Monty]]") often specifically denotes a breakfast including everything on offer. The latter name became popular after World War II after British Army general [[Bernard Montgomery]] (nicknamed Monty) was said to have started every day with a full English breakfast when in the campaign in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Parkinson (2011).

====Ireland====
{{Redirect|Irish breakfast|the tea|Irish breakfast tea}}
[[File:Full irish breakfast.jpg|thumb|left|A full Irish breakfast served in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]]]
In Ireland, as elsewhere, the exact constituents of a full breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation. Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are [[bacon]] rashers, [[pork sausage]]s, fried eggs (or scrambled), [[white pudding]], [[black pudding]], [[toast]] and fried tomato.&lt;ref name="foodireland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodireland.com/recipes/Breakfast/irishbreakfast.htm |title=Traditional Irish Breakfast recipe from |publisher=Food Ireland |date= |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sauteed [[Agaricus campestris|field mushrooms]] are also sometimes included,&lt;ref name="barrystea"&gt;[http://store.barrys-tea.com/articles/full_irish_breakfast.html Traditional Irish Breakfast recipe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213056/http://store.barrys-tea.com/articles/full_irish_breakfast.html |date=7 July 2011 }} from [[Barry's Tea]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as baked beans, [[hash browns]], [[Liver (food)|liver]], and brown [[soda bread]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riversidepark.ie/cmsFiles/breakfast_at_riva.pdf "Breakfast at Riva: full Irish breakfast"].

The "[[breakfast roll]]",&lt;ref name='indo'&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=McDonald|title=Top breakfast baguette rolls into Irish history|date=12 May 2008|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/top-breakfast-baguette-rolls-into-irish-history-1372872.html|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of elements of the full breakfast served in a [[French roll]], has become popular due to the fact it can be easily eaten on the way to school or work, similar to the [[breakfast burrito]] in the United States.&lt;ref name='indo' /&gt; The breakfast roll is available from many [[petrol station]]s and corner shops throughout Ireland.&lt;ref name='indo' /&gt;

===={{visible anchor|Ulster}}====
[[File:Full Ulster fry.jpg|thumb|right|A full Ulster fry served in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland. The [[Potato_bread#Ireland|potato bread]] is under the eggs, with the [[soda farl]] at the bottom.]]
An [[Ulster]] fry is a dish similar to the [[Irish breakfast]], and is popular throughout Ulster, where it is eaten not only at breakfast time but throughout the day. Typically it will include [[soda farl]] and [[Potato_bread#Ireland|potato bread]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zgk7mp3 “Is the Ulster fry the best cooked breakfast in the UK?“]. BBC. Retrieved 29 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly to the breakfast roll seen in the south of [[Ireland]], in [[Northern Ireland]] they serve "filled sodas", which usually consist of a [[soda farl]] shallow-fried on one side and filled with fried sausages, bacon or eggs. Fried onions or mushrooms are usually added upon request. Filled sodas are a popular choice for breakfast from roadside [[fast-food]] vendors.

====Scotland====
[[File:Scottish breakfast.jpg|thumb|left|A similar Scottish alternative]]
In Scotland, the full breakfast, as with others, contains eggs, back bacon, link [[sausage]], buttered toast, [[baked beans]], and tea or coffee. Distinctively Scottish elements include Scottish style or [[Stornoway_black_pudding|Stornoway]] [[black pudding]], [[Lorne sausage]], Ayrshire middle bacon and [[tattie scone]]s. It commonly also includes fried or grilled tomato or [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]] and occasionally [[haggis]], [[white pudding]], [[fruit pudding]]&lt;ref name='memphisflyer2'&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Gerald|title=The Full English|date=12 July 2012|publisher=Contemporary Media, Inc.|url=http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/the-full-english/Content?oid=3222629|work=[[Memphis Flyer]]|accessdate=30 July 2012|quote=The Scots like to have tattie (potato) scones, fruit pudding (actually a sausage made with very little fruit), and, of course, their curse on the earth, haggis.}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[oatcake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800|author=Elizabeth Foyster, Christopher A. Whatley|page=139|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to food|author=Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine|page=185|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other breakfasts it has become more common, especially within the home, to grill the meats, puddings and tomatoes and to only fry the eggs and tattie scones. Another more historical Scottish breakfast is [[porridge]].

Early editions of ''[[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable]]'' referred to a ''Scotch breakfast'' as "a substantial breakfast of sundry sorts of good things to eat and drink".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brewer|first=E. Cobham|authorlink=E.

====Wales====
As in the rest of Britain and Ireland, the composition of a Full Welsh Breakfast ({{lang-cy|Brecwast llawn Cymreig}}) can vary. However, with the new-found appreciation of Welsh food and recipes in the early 21st century, there have been attempts to establish a broad definition.&lt;ref name="walesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |work=Wales Online |title=So what is a 'full Welsh breakfast'? |date=25 October 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004835/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/what-full-welsh-breakfast-2374227 |archivedate= 2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Welsh breakfast reflects the coastal aspect of [[Welsh cuisine]]. As such it will typically include Welsh [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockles]] and [[laverbread]] (a [[Laver (seaweed)|seaweed]] purée often mixed with oatmeal and fried). Both delicacies are traditionally served with thick bacon, but a Welsh breakfast may also include Welsh sausages, mushrooms and eggs.&lt;ref name="walesonline.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name='wales.com'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/english/about_wales/food/food.aspx|title=Wales.com – Food|accessdate=30 July 2012|author=Welsh Government|publisher=[[Government of Wales]]|quote=Laverbread, not actually bread at all but seaweed, is rolled in oatmeal, fried into crisp patties and served with eggs, bacon and fresh cockles for a traditional Welsh breakfast.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Welsh breakfasts are accompanied by traditional breakfast drinks, with Welsh tea a ubiquitous choice. Today, as they are often served throughout the day in public houses or inns, a [[Beer in Wales|traditional beer or ale]] is not uncommon.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
 
Modern alternatives to the traditional full breakfast will often develop the traditional seafood theme. Smoked fish such as sea trout or [[sewin]] may be served accompanied with poached eggs.&lt;ref name="walesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

===North America===
[[File:American breakfast (187066827).jpg|thumb|Bacon and eggs with pancakes]]
This style of breakfast was brought over to the United States and Canada, where it has endured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-full-english-breakfast-hops-the-pond-1444080283 "The Full English Breakfast Hops the Pond"]. Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 21 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; A full breakfast in these countries often consists of eggs, various meats, and commonly one type of fried potatoes – [[hash browns]], [[home fries]], [[Potatoes O'Brien]], or [[potato pancakes]] –  and some form of bread or toast. Most of the time the big breakfast is served for special occasions and on weekends owing to the time needed to prepare them and calories involved.
In the Southern US, [[grits]] are typically included. 

Typical breakfast meats in all of America are [[bacon]], [[Back bacon|Canadian bacon]], [[breakfast sausage]], and [[ham]]. In Canada, [[peameal bacon]] or [[cretons]] are often served.  Canada and the USA don't follow the trend of the rest of the [[Anglosphere]] where tea is the usual hot beverage for breakfast, but rather both strongly prefer [[coffee]], drunk with milk, cream, or sugar.  [[Maple syrup]] is common to both, with both nations having [[Sugar shack|sugar shacks]] in their Eastern forests, Quebec producing the most.  Both nations have [[Diner|diners]], and there the most common components are [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[bacon]] and/or [[breakfast sausage]] served with one or two of either [[toast]], [[English muffins]], hash browns, [[home fries]], [[pancakes]], [[French toast]]  or [[waffles]].  [[Omelette|Omelettes]] are a delicacy where anything goes, and several kinds of cheese are added to the mix depending on the desire of the cook, like [[cheddar cheese|cheddar]], [[Colby cheese|Colby]], [[Monterey Jack]], and [[feta]]. [[Eggs Benedict]] originated in New York and bagels wherever [[Eastern European Jews]] settled, but both are now a staple in both countries.

There is also great regional variety as well. [[Oatmeal]]  made with [[rolled oats]] is common to much of Canada and New England at breakfast, but is replaced by [[grits]] in the Southeast, where eating oatmeal for breakfast is a newer convention of the past 50 years as it is traditionally too warm to grow oats there. [[Biscuit (bread)|Biscuits]] leavened with baking powder or baking soda are a staple of the South and a component of [[biscuits and gravy]].  [[Country ham]] is very popular in every Southeastern state but Florida and replaces [[Back bacon|Canadian bacon]] in recipes. [[Scrapple]] and  [[Taylor Ham|taylor ham]] are breakfast meats common to [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]] and sausages in Texas and Florida are usually a type of [[chorizo]]. [[Country fried steak]] is a dish that originated in Texas  and [[steak and eggs]] are popular in much of the Midwest.

The West is usually the home of dishes like [[migas]], [[huevos rancheros]], and the [[breakfast burrito]], with all three spicy because they contain sizable amounts of chili peppers.  Both coasts of Canada and the USA serve [[smoked salmon]] for breakfast and it is a staple in particular of [[First Nations]] of British Columbia.  [[Eggs Sardou]] and [[Eggs Neptune]] are local variations on Eggs Benedict from Louisiana and Maryland, with each changing out the [[back bacon|Canadian bacon]] with artichoke and crabmeat, respectively.  Midwesterners will eat calf brains with their eggs and New Englanders will eat the [[johnnycake]], and [[Spam (food)|Spam]] is a staple of every Hawaiian plate. Californians invented the fruit [[smoothie]].  Juices vary with orange juice being the most popular, but also can be apple, cranberry, or pineapple.

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
The full breakfast common in Australia and New Zealand is similar to British/Irish and North American variants, with some differences, having spread to Australasia when it was a part of the British Empire.

Bacon, eggs, hash browns,  and sausages are the most common aspects of the Australasian full breakfast. Tomato, barbecue and Worcestershire sauces are used frequently, as is cheese. Bread is used as the base for most breakfast dishes, however it is common to use bread (or toast) to make a bacon and egg sandwich. Breakfast muffins are an increasingly popular alternative to bread in the Australasian full breakfast. 

Regional variants are prevalent, with German influences particularly commonplace in [[South Australia]].

===Hong Kong=== 

A few establishments in [[Hong Kong]] offer all day breakfast or brunch options (hybrid of English and North American items) from formal restaurants to low frills establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48hrs/article/1794272/brunch-time-10-bargain-all-day-breakfasts-hong-kong|title=Hong Kong brunch: 10 best bargain all-day breakfasts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/travel-leisure/article/1933764/hong-kongs-best-kept-secrets-all-day-breakfasts-hk48-sleepy|title=Hong Kong’s best-kept secrets: all-day breakfasts for HK$48 in a sleepy border village|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1356">'''Traditional Day''' or '''Fête du Vodoun''' (literally Vodoun Festival, also known as Traditional Religions Day) is a [[public holiday]] in [[Benin]] that celebrates the nation's history surrounding the West African religion of [[Vodoun]]. The celebration is held annually on January 10 throughout the country but most notably in the city of [[Ouidah]]. Beginning with the [[Ritual slaughter|slaughter of a goat]] in honor of the spirits, the festival is filled with singing, dancing and the imbibing of liquor, especially [[gin]]. Vodoun was officially declared a religion in Benin in 1996 and the festival has attracted thousands of devotees and tourists to Ouidah to participate in the festivities ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1756057.stm |title=Benin marks Voodoo Day |date=2002-11-11 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.worldnomads.com/worldfestivals/story/32700/Benin/January-Voodoo-Festival-Benin |title=January - Voodoo Festival, Benin |date=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transafrica.biz/festivals/festivals-events-in-benin/ |title=Voodoo, a traditional religion on the Gulf of Guinea Coast }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

The '''Georgian mafia''' ({{lang-ka|ქართული მაფია}}) is regarded as one of the biggest, powerful and influential criminal networks in Europe, which has produced the biggest number of "[[Thief in law|thieves in law]]" in all former [[USSR]] countries and controls and regulates most of the [[Russian language|Russian-speaking]] mafia groups.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Knowledge For Tomorrow: A Summarized Commentary Of World History, Nature, Health, Religion, Organized Crime, And Inspiration For The Youth: Quinton Douglass Crawford p145&lt;/ref&gt; They are very active in Russia, Georgia, and in NV Copenhagen

Georgian mafia is known as best organized and most ruthless criminal group, {{Citation needed|reason=Source cited is a work of fiction.|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Germ Warfare: John Lonergan&lt;/ref&gt; being very "structured" and "hierarchical". At the head of such a group is a leader who rarely appears in public and, in turn, reports to a "Godfather", who operates on an international level. The power of the leader is largely dependent on his ability to subordinate independent groups of thieves under his authority. His underlings oversee the activities of smaller Georgian criminal gangs. The pyramid is cemented by the payment of tributes to the leader of each group acting in the region. This is the so-called "common fund".&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal-neo.org/2013/09/12/rus-o-razmahe-deyatel-nosti-gruzinskih-opg/ The Scope of Activities of Georgian Organized Crime Groups] Vladimir Odintsov&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia always had a disproportionately high number of crime bosses and still has a majority of the 700 or so still operating in the post-Soviet space and western Georgia (Kutaisi clan) is particularly well represented.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of War &amp; Peace Reporting (29 June 2007) Georgia: New Crime Crackdown&lt;/ref&gt;

In some of its rules or "laws", the Georgian mafia parallels the [[Sicilian Mafia]]. There are differences but many things are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Caucasian Review of International Affairs (2006) ''Thieves of the Law and the Rule of Law in Georgia'' p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Soviet period===
The Russian criminal subculture of the thieves-in-law ({{lang-ka|კანონიერი ქურდი}}, ''kanonieri kurdi'') disproportionately included ethnic [[Georgians]]. During the 1970s [[Brezhnev stagnation]], corrupt officials increasingly turned to the criminal underworld to source black market supplies. However, the Thieves Code explicitly forbade cooperation of any kind with the authorities, and at a 1982 summit of thieves in Tbilisi, the secret society was split in two, with Georgian thieves favouring closer collaboration with officials while this motion was opposed by Slavic 'purists'.&lt;ref&gt;Gurov, Alexander; ''Professionalnaya Prestupnost''; (Moscow: Yuridicheskaya Literatura, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia quickly gained a reputation as one of the most corrupt but also relatively prosperous. Georgian farmers ignored the planned economy and grew much-prized citrus fruits and were protected by Georgian officials, who also ran networks of underground factories and distribution chains.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Shelley &amp; Erik Scott; Organized crime and corruption in Georgia; (New York: Routledge, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Georgia===
During the period leading up to Georgian independence in 1991, as tension grew between Georgians and ethnic [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] several nationalist militias were formed, the two most prominent being the [[National Guard of Georgia]] led by ex-convict [[Tengiz Kitovani]] and the [[Mkhedrioni]] led by former thief-in-law [[Jaba Ioseliani]]. Due to an absence of any other means of funding, the militias engaged in protection rackets and smuggling and the weak Georgian government had no choice but to embrace them.&lt;ref&gt;Zurcher, Christoph; ''The Post-Soviet Wars: Rebellion, Ethnic Conflict, and Nationhood in the Caucasus''; NYU Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The paramilitaries were first deployed against the separatist regions of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], but attempts by President [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] to rein them in resulted in a [[Georgian Civil War|violent coup]] where he was replaced by [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], who had the backing of the militias, which continued to operate with impunity. The Mkhedrioni took advantage of their position of power to take over the gasoline business.&lt;ref&gt;RAYMOND BONNER [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEED71431F935A25752C1A965958260 Georgian Fighter Wields Guns, Money and Charm] ''The New York Times''. November 16, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Shevardnadze finally got the excuse he needed to disband the militias in 1995 after an assassination attempt. Ioseliani was imprisoned, although released in 2000 as part of a general amnesty, dying three years later. But other, less idealistic thieves-in-law still continued to dominate day-to-day life in Georgia.

===Rose Revolution===
In November 2003 a popular uprising known as the [[Rose Revolution]] toppled the Shevardnadze regime and put [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4036145.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Georgia remembers Rose Revolution|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saakashvili soon implemented a series of reforms aimed at tackling crime and corruption, firing and imprisoning a number of officials as well as making membership of the thieves-in-law a crime in 2005. In response to this as well as harsher prison regimes, several prison riots broke out before being heavy-handedly put down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/node/11162/section/2|title=Undue Punishment - Human Rights Watch|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid prosecution, Georgian gangsters fled the country, typically to Russia, Israel and Western Europe.

===In Russia===
Georgian organized crime has been present in Russia since the Soviet era. During the 1990s, as rival criminal gangs, corrupt law enforcement and [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchs]] fought one another for supremacy over the lucrative protection rackets of the emerging private business sector in the chaotic transition to capitalism, the Georgian mafia made its presence known in Moscow. One of the most famous bosses of this period was [[Otari Kvantrishvili]], a former sportsman turned racketeer after a conviction for rape. He would often act as a go-between for various underworld factions and something of a public face for the mafia. Prior to his assassination in 1993, Kvantrishvili spoke of his ambitions to start his own political party. His funeral was attended by many celebrities and politicians, including the singer [[Joseph Kobzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/14/world/a-slaying-puts-russian-underworld-on-parade.html|title=A Slaying Puts Russian Underworld on Parade|date=14 April 1994|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, the Georgian underworld in Russia, Georgia and elsewhere has been characterised by a violent feud between the Kutaisi and Tbilisi clans, led by [[Tariel Oniani]] and [[Aslan Usoyan]], respectively. The conflict claimed the life of notorious Russian thief-in-law [[Vyacheslav Ivankov]], who was assassinated while attempting to mediate in 2009, while Usoyan was himself killed by a sniper in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/european-police-georgian-gang-arrest-blitz-2013-6|title=European Police Georgian Gang Arrest Blitz - Business Insider|date=27 June 2013|work=Business Insider|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian word]] for "magic". According to Egyptian literature (Coffin text, spell 261), Heka existed "before duality had yet come into being''.''" The term ''ḥk3'' was also used to refer to the practice of magical rituals.

== Name ==

The name Heka is identical with the Egyptian word ''ḥk3w'' "magic". This hieroglyphic spelling includes the symbol for the word [[Ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Ka (vital spark)|''ka'']] (''kꜣ''), the ancient Egyptian concept of the vital force.

== Beliefs ==
The Old Kingdom [[Pyramid Texts]] depict ''ḥk3w'' as a supernatural energy that the gods possess. The "cannibal pharaoh" must devour other gods to gain this magical power. Eventually, Heka was elevated to a deity in his own right and a cult devoted to him developed. By the [[Coffin Texts]], Heka is said to be created at the beginning of time by the creator [[Atum]]. Later Heka is depicted as part of the tableau of the divine [[solar barge]] as a protector of Osiris capable of blinding crocodiles. Then, during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], Heka's role was to proclaim the pharaoh's enthronement as a son of Isis, holding him in his arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=George|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses|date=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0415344951|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0L83uBijeZwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0415344956|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrW2xNQTVN0C&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=heka%20khnum&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q=heka&amp;f=false|title=Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE|last=Dunand|first=Françoise|last2=Zivie-Coche|first2=Christiane|authorlink=Françoise Dunand|date=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801441653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heka also appears as part of a divine triad in [[Esna]], capital of the [[Nome (Egypt)|Third Nome]], where he is the son of ram-headed [[Khnum]] and a succession of goddesses. His mother was alternately said to be Nebetu'u (a form of [[Hathor]]), lion-headed [[Menhit]], and the cow goddess [[Mehetweret]], before settling on [[Neith]], a war and mother goddess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y72qrAmKcfEC&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=heka%20khnum%20triad&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Egypt, Trunk of the Tree, Vol. I: A Modern Survey of and Ancient Land|last=Najovits|first=Simson R.|date=May 2003|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=9780875862347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other deities connected with the force of ''ḥk3w'' include [[Hu (mythology)|Hu]], [[Sia (god)|Sia]], and [[Werethekau]], whose name means "she who has great magic".

The '''indie design''' movement is made up of independent [[designer]]s, [[artist]]s, and [[craftspeople]] who [[design]] and make a wide array of products − without being part of large, industrialised businesses. The indie design movement can be seen as being an aspect of the general indie movement and [[DIY culture]].

The designs created generally include works and art pieces that are individual to that creative individual.  Such products may include [[jewellery]] and other [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]], [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], [[clothing]], [[glass art]], [[metalwork]], [[furniture]], [[cosmetics]], [[handicrafts]], and diverse [[artwork]]s.

==Marketing==
Self-employed indie designers are supported by shoppers who are seeking niche and often handmade products as opposed to those mass-produced by manufacturing and retail corporations. 

Indie designers often sell their items directly to buyers by way of their own online shops, [[craft fairs]], [[street market]]s and a variety of online marketplaces, such as [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |title= Crafts, Clothes and Clout: Small Designers Reach Larger Audience With Growth of Web and TV Showcases |author= Christina Binkley |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704009804575309034273947988?mod=googlewsj |newspaper= Wall Street Journal |date= June 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they may also engage in consignment and/or wholesale relationships with retail outlets, both online and offline.

;Corporate knockoffs
In recent years some large manufacturing and/or retail [[fashion company|fashion]] and other [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[corporation]]s have sold products which appear to closely resemble or directly copy innovative original works of indie designers and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Michal Addady, [http://fortune.com/2016/07/20/zara-stealing-designs/ "12 Artists Are Accusing Zara of Stealing Their Designs"], ''Fortune'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused some controversy.

'''Jussi Parikka''' is a Finnish [[new media]] theorist and Professor in Technological Culture &amp; Aesthetics at [[Winchester School of Art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsa.soton.ac.uk/ |title=wsa.soton.ac.uk |publisher=wsa.soton.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[University of Southampton]]). He is also Docent of digital culture theory at the [[University of Turku]] in [[Finland]]. Until May 2011 Parikka was the Director of the Cultures of the Digital Economy (CoDE) research institute at Anglia Ruskin University and the founding Co-Director of the Anglia Research Centre for Digital Culture.

== Biography ==

Parikka was awarded a Ph.D. in Cultural History from the [[University of Turku]] in 2007. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Fibreculture-journal and a member of the [[Leonardo Journal]] Digital Reviews Panel.

In 1995, Parikka deferred his [[Conscription in Finland|national service]] and spent 18 months as an assistant fisheries inspector in [[Oulu Province|Oulu]].

Parikka has published extensively on [[digital art]], [[digital culture]] and [[cultural theory]] in Finnish and English in journals such as ''[[Ctheory]]'', ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society'', ''Fibreculture'', ''Media History'', ''Postmodern Culture'' and ''Game Studies''. His texts have been translated into Hungarian, French, Turkish, Polish, Portuguese and Indonesian. He has published five single authored books; in Finnish on [[media theory]] in the age of [[cybernetics]] (Koneoppi. Ihmisen, teknologian ja median kytkennät, (2004)) and in English, ''Digital Contagions: A Media Archaeology of Computer Viruses'' (2007), the award-winning ''Insect Media'' (2010), ''What is Media Archaeology?'' (2012) and ''A Geology of Media'' (2015).

''Digital Contagions'' is the first book to offer a comprehensive and critical analysis of the culture and history of the [[computer virus]] phenomenon. The book maps the anomalies of [[wikt:network|network]] culture from the angles of security concerns, the biopolitics of [[Digital data|digital]] systems, and the aspirations for [[artificial life]] in [[software]].

The genealogy of network culture is approached from the standpoint of accidents that are endemic to the digital [[media ecology]]. Viruses, worms, and other [[software]] objects are not, then, seen merely from the perspective of [[anti-virus]] research or practical security concerns, but as cultural and historical expressions that traverse a [[non-linear]] field from fiction to technical media, from [[net art]] to politics of software.

His work on Insect Media combines themes from media archaeology, posthumanism and animal studies to put forth a new history of how insects and technology frame critical, scientific and technological thought. It won the Society for Cinema and Media Studies 2012 Anne Friedberg Award for Innovative Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/press/press-releases/insect-media-wins-the-scms-anne-friedberg-innovative-scholarship-award |title=Anne Friedberg award |publisher=Upress.umn.edu |date=2012-03-01 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also discussed this work in dialogue with historian [[Etienne Benson]] and media theorist [[Bernard Dionsius Geoghegan]] on the [[Cultural Technologies]] podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bernardg.com/node/54 |title=Animal Media with Parikka and Benson (Episode 3) &amp;#124; Cultural Technologies Podcast &amp;#124; Bernard Dionysius Geoghegan |publisher=Bernardg.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, Parikka has written on media archaeology as a theory and methodology in various publications, including ''Media Archaeology'' (co-edited with Erkki Huhtamo) and ''What is Media Archaeology?''

With [[Garnet Hertz]], Parikka co-authored a paper entitled "Zombie Media: Circuit Bending Media Archaeology into an Art Method," which was nominated for the 2011 Transmediale Vilem Flusser media theory award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transmediale.de/content/zombie-media-talk-garnet-hertz-ca-and-jussi-parikka-fi-present-their-zombie-media-project |title=Zombie Media Talk: Garnet Hertz (ca) and Jussi Parikka (fi) present their "Zombie Media" project &amp;#124; transmediale |publisher=Transmediale.de |date=2011-02-03 |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research activity==

Dr. Parikka's research activities include [[continental philosophy]], [[media theory]], the politics and history of [[new media]], media [[archaeology]], new materialist cultural analysis and various other topics relating to anomalies, [[New media|media]] and the body.

'''''Larousse Gastronomique''''' ({{IPA-fr|la.ʁus ɡas.tʁɔ.nɔ.mik|pron}}) is an [[encyclopedia]] of [[gastronomy]]. The majority of the book is about [[French cuisine]], and contains recipes for French dishes and cooking techniques. The first edition included few non-French dishes and ingredients; later editions include many more. The book was originally published by [[Éditions Larousse]], founded by [[Pierre Larousse]].

==Background==
The first edition (1938) was edited by [[Prosper Montagné]], with prefaces by [[Georges Auguste Escoffier]] and [[Philéas Gilbert]]. Gilbert was a collaborator in the creation of this book as well as ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'' with Escoffier, leading to some cross-over with the two books. It caused Escoffier to note when he was asked to write the preface that he could "see with my own eyes," and "Montagné cannot hide from me the fact that he has used ''Le Guide'' as a basis for his new book, and certainly used numerous recipes."&lt;ref&gt;James, 266–68&lt;/ref&gt;

The third English edition (2001), which runs to approximately 1350 pages has been modernized and includes additional material on other [[cuisine]]s. It is also available in a concise edition (2003). A new, updated and revised edition was released on 13 October 2009 published by [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Larousse_Gastronomique.html?id=RkaNPgAACAAJ|title=Larousse Gastronomique: The World's Greatest Culinary Encyclopedia|last=Robuchon|first=Joël|date=2009|publisher=Hamlyn|isbn=9780600620426|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learning by doing''' refers to a theory of [[education]] expounded by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. He theorized that learning should be relevant and practical, not just passive and theoretical. He implemented this idea by setting up the [[University of Chicago Laboratory School]].&lt;ref name=positive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepositiveencourager.global/john-deweys-approach-to-doing-positive-work/|title=D is for John Dewey: His Approach To Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views have been important in establishing practices of [[progressive education]].

{{Quote|text="I believe that the school must represent present life – life as real and vital to the child as that which he carries on in the home, in the neighborhood, or on the playground."|author=John Dewey (''My Pedagogic Creed'')|&lt;ref name=positive /&gt;}}

{{Quote|text="… The teachers were to present real life problems to the children and then guide the students to solve the problem by providing them with a hands-on activity to learn the solution ...

"Cooking and sewing was to be taught at school and be a routine. Reading, writing, and math was to be taught in the daily course of these routines. Building, cooking, and sewing had these schooling components in it and these activities also represented everyday life for the students.|author=Peggy Hickman|&lt;ref name=positive /&gt;}}

He expanded upon these principles in ''[[Democracy and Education]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">'''Lille Grønnegade Theatre''' was a Danish [[theatre]] which was active from 1722 to 1728. It was the first public theatre in [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]].

== History ==
[[File:Lille Grønnegade - 1722 poster.jpg|thumb|160px|Poster for [[Molière]]'s ''[[The Miser]],'' 1722]] 
In 1721, the French troupe [[La troupe du Roi de Danemark]], which had performed for the royal court in Copenhagen since 1682, was fired by the king, who wished to hire an Italian opera troupe instead. As the French actors, who in many cases had lived in Denmark for generations, did not all wish to leave, René Magnon and another French immigrant, Etienne Capion, asked for permission to open a public theatre. They were granted royal permission and in 1722, and the first public theatre was opened in Copenhagen on Lille Grønnegade, the first Danish-language theatre open to the public.

Capion was the director, Magnon was responsible for the actors, and [[Marie Madeleine de Montaigu]] became the first actress to have performed for the Danish public at an official theatre. The female actors were few: among them were also Helene le Coffre, Maren Magdalene Lerche and Marie Madeleine's own daughter Frederikke Sophie. Plays were performed in Danish but there was also dance: in 1726, [[Jean-Baptiste Landé]] was a guest ballet master.

The economic difficulites, however, proved to be too difficult. In 1728, the theatre was closed, and in 1730, theatre was banned in Denmark until 1746.

This is a '''list of fictional space stations''' that have been identified by name in notable published works of fiction and [[science fiction]].

A [[space station]] (or ''orbital station'') is a [[spacecraft]] capable of supporting a crew, which is designed to remain in [[Outer space|space]] (most commonly in [[low Earth orbit]]) for an extended period of time and for other spacecraft to dock. A space station is distinguished from other spacecraft used for [[human spaceflight]] by lack of major [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] or [[landing]] systems. Instead, other vehicles transport people and cargo to and from the station.

'''Lombardic''' or '''Langobardic''' is an extinct [[West Germanic language]] that was spoken by the [[Lombards]] (''Langobardi''), the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people who settled in [[Italy]] in the 6th century. It was already rapidly declining by the seventh century because the invaders quickly adopted the [[Vulgar Latin|Latin vernacular]] spoken by the local Gallo-Roman population. Lombardic may have been in scattered use until as late as c. AD 1000. A number of Italian place names and items of [[Italian language|Italian]] vocabulary derive from Lombardic. Some linguists have argued that the modern [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] and [[Mòcheno language|Mocheno]] varieties in [[Northeast Italy]], usually classified as Austro-Bavarian, are in fact surviving Lombard remnants.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Schweizer: ''Die Herkunft der Zimbern''. In: ''Die Nachbarn. Jahrbuch für vergleichende Volkskunde 1'', 1948, ISSN 0547-096X, S. 111–129.;  Alfonso Bellotto: ''Il cimbro e la tradizione longobarda nel vicentino I.'' In: ''Vita di Giazza e di Roana 17-18'', (1974) S. 7–19; ''Il cimbro e la tradizione longobarda nel vicentino II.'' In: ''Vita di Giazza e di Roana 19-20'', (1974) S. 49–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ermenegildo Bidese ''Die Zimbern und ihre Sprache: Geographische, historische und sprachwissenschaftlich relevante Aspekte''. In: Thomas Stolz  (ed.): ''Kolloquium über Alte Sprachen und Sprachstufen. Beiträge zum Bremer Kolloquium über „Alte Sprachen und Sprachstufen“. (= Diversitas Linguarum, Volume 8)''. Verlag Brockmeyer, Bochum 2004, {{ISBN|3-8196-0664-5}}, S. 3–42.[http://portale.unitn.it/ateneo/persone/ermenegildo.bidese Webseite von Ermenegildo Bidese]&lt;/ref&gt; This could, in turn, indicate that Lombardic was itself an Austro-Bavarian dialect.

==Overview==
Lombardic is preserved only fragmentarily, the main evidence being individual words used in [[Latin]] texts. For example, the [[Edict of Rothari]] of 643, the earliest Lombard legal code, is written in Latin, with only individual legal terms given in Lombardic. The many Lombard personal names preserved in Latin deeds from the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] also provide evidence of the language.

In the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about its morphology and syntax. The genetic classification is necessarily based entirely on phonology. Because there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the [[High German consonant shift]], it is classified as an [[Elbe Germanic]] or [[Upper German]] dialect. The [[Historia Langobardorum]] of [[Paulus Diaconus]] mentions a duke [[Zaban]] of 574, showing {{IPA|/t/}} shifted to {{IPA|/ts/}}. The term ''stolesazo'' (ablative)&lt;ref&gt;''Edictus rothari'', cap. 150: "[...] districtus ab stolesazo."&lt;/ref&gt; (the second element is cognate with English ''seat'') in the [[Edictum Rothari]] shows the same shift. Many names in the Lombard royal families show shifted consonants, particularly {{IPA|/p/}} &lt; {{IPA|/b/}} in the following name components:
* ''pert'' &lt; ''bert'': Aripert, Godepert
* ''perg'' &lt; ''berg'': Gundperga (daughter of [[Agilulf|King Agilulf]])
* ''prand'' &lt; ''brand'': Ansprand, Liutprand

This [[sound change]] left two different sets of names in the [[Italian language]]: palco (longobard palk, "beam")/balcone (longobard balk, "wood platform"); panca (longobard panka)/banca (longobard banka, "bench").&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Devoto, ''Dizionario etimologico''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, Lombardic was classified as [[Ingaevonian]] (North Sea Germanic) or as [[Eastern Germanic]], but these classifications are considered obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{LexMA|5|1698|1699|Langobardisch|Federico Albano Leoni}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of Lombardic within the Germanic languages may be complicated by issues of orthography. According to Hutterer (1999) it is close to [[Old Saxon]]. [[Tacitus]] counts them among the [[Suebi]]. [[Paulus Diaconus]] (8th century) and the  ''Codex Gothanus'' (9th century) wrote that the Lombards were ultimately of Scandinavian origin, having settled at the [[Elbe]] before entering Italy.

Lombardic fragments are preserved in [[rune|runic]] inscriptions, in Latinized forms, and in transcriptions influenced by [[Old High German]] orthography. This ''Lombardic alphabet'', as commonly transcribed, consists of the following graphemes:{{sfn|Hutterer|1999|page=339}}

{{block indent|''a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q(u), r, s, {{IPA|ʒ}}, t, [[þ]], u, w, z''}}

The ''qu'' represents a {{IPA|[kw]}} sound. The ''ʒ'' is {{IPA|[s]}}, e.g. ''skauʒ'' {{IPA|[skaus]}} "womb"&lt;!-- glossed in German, "Schoß" --&gt;.
The ''z'' is {{IPA|[ts]}}. ''h'' is {{IPA|[h]}} word-initially, and {{IPA|[x]}} elsewhere.

Among the primary source texts are short inscriptions in the [[Elder Futhark]], among them the "bronze capsule of [[Schretzheim]]" (c. 600):
*On the lid: '''arogisd'''
*On the bottom: '''alaguþleuba : dedun'''
*("Arogisl/-gast. Alaguth (and) Leuba made (it)",&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Looijenga, ''Runes Around The North Sea And On The Continent Ad 150-700'', PhD diss. Groningen 1997, p. 158. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050502101056/http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/1997/j.h.looijenga/thesis.pdf Download PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; less likely "Arogis and Alaguth made love")

And also the two fibulae of [[Bezenye]], [[Hungary]] (mid 6th century):
*Fibula A: '''godahid unj[a]'''
*Fibula B: '''(k?)arsiboda segun'''
*("To Godahi(l)d, (with) sympathy (?), Arsiboda's bless"&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Looijenga, ''Runes Around The North Sea And On The Continent Ad 150-700'', PhD diss. Groningen 1997, p. 134. [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/1997/j.h.looijenga/thesis.pdf Download PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114809/http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/1997/j.h.looijenga/thesis.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

There are a number of Latin texts that include Lombardic names, and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular, including:
*[[Origo gentis Langobardorum]]
*[[Paulus Diaconus]], [[Historia Langobardorum]]
*[[Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani]]
*[[Edictum Rothari]]

In 2006, Emilia Denčeva argued that the inscription of the [[Pernik sword]] may be Lombardic.{{sfn|Dentschewa|2006}}

'''''My Bloody Valentine''''' is a 1981 Canadian [[slasher film]] directed by [[George Mihalka]] and written by John Beaird, starring Paul Kelman, [[Lori Hallier]], and [[Neil Affleck]]. The film tells the story of a group of young adults who decide to throw a [[Valentine's Day]] party only to incur the vengeful wrath of an assailant in mining gear who begins a killing spree.

Conceived and produced entirely over the course of around a year,&lt;ref name=bl/&gt; the film was shot on location in [[Sydney Mines]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, in the fall of 1980. It was released theatrically in North America beginning in February 1981, coinciding with the Valentine's holiday.

''My Bloody Valentine'' faced notable [[censorship]], having a total of nine minutes cut by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] due to the amount of violence and gore. Though co-producer Dunning confirmed that the excised footage still existed, attempts to release it proved difficult as [[Paramount Pictures]] refused to offer an uncut version. In 2009, [[Lionsgate]] subsequently acquired DVD rights to the film and released a DVD with three minutes of additional footage restored. The same year, Lionsgate released a [[My Bloody Valentine 3D|remake]] of the film.

==Plot==
Inside a mine shaft, a female miner takes off her gear in front of another miner. When the woman performs a striptease, the miner pushes her onto a mining pickaxe, killing her.

Mayor Hanniger of mining town Valentine Bluffs reinstates the traditional Valentine's Day dance, which has been suspended for twenty years. The dances stopped after an accident in which two supervisors left several miners in the mines to attend the dance. Because they forgot to check [[methane]] gas levels, there was an explosion that trapped the miners. Harry Warden, the only survivor, resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive and became insane. He murdered the two supervisors who left them there, and vowed further attacks if the Valentine's Day Dance ever occurred again. Warden was placed into an asylum and the accident was forgotten, so the dance resumed. A group of young residents are excited about the dance: Gretchen, Dave, Hollis, Patty, Sylvia, Howard, Mike, John, Tommy, and Harriet. Sarah, Axel, and the mayor's son T.J. are involved in a tense love triangle.

Mayor Hanniger and the town's police chief Jake Newby receive an anonymous box of Valentine chocolates containing a human heart, and a note warning that murders will begin if the dance proceeds. That evening, resident Mabel is murdered by a mining-geared killer, and her heart removed. Newby publicly reports that she died of a heart attack to prevent a panic. He contacts the mental institution where Harry Warden was incarcerated, but they have no record of him. Hanniger and Newby cancel the dance but the town's youngsters decide to hold their own party at the mine. A bartender warns them against it but is killed by the miner.

At the party, the miner brutally kills Dave and Sylvia. Newby rushes into the mines with police to rescue the remaining teenagers. The miner impales a large drill into Mike and Harriet, and shoots a nail gun into Hollis's head. Horrified, Howard flees. The remaining four try to climb to the top with a ladder, but discover a dead beheaded Howard. 

While finding their way out, Axel and Patty are killed by the miner. The miner chases T.J. and Sarah and a fight ensues. The miner is revealed to be Axel, who faked his demise. A flashback shows that Axel's father was one of the supervisors. As a child, Axel witnessed Harry Warden murdering his father, which traumatized him. The tunnel begins to collapse from the fight, and traps Axel while Newby and the police arrive to rescue T.J. and Sarah. It is revealed that Harry Warden had died five years earlier. T.J. and Sarah hear a rescuer shout that Axel is alive and rush back to the scene. Sarah sees an insane Axel freeing himself from the debris by amputating his trapped arm. He runs deeper into the mine shouting threats to murder everyone in town, and mumbling about Sarah being his “bloody valentine.” The film ends with a maniacal laugh being heard.

==Production==
===Development===
Director George Mihalka, on the strength of his earlier movie ''Pick-Up Summer'', was approached by Cinepix Productions, headed by André Link and John Dunning with a two-movie contract. Mihalka was asked to direct a horror-slasher story, presented to Dunning by Stephen Miller in mid-1980, and, after Mihalka agreed to direct, John Beaird was bought in to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name=mihalka2005&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terrortrap.com/interviews/georgemihalka/|title=My Bloody Memories: An Interview with George Mihalka |date=June 2005|work=The Terror Trap |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was originally entitled ''The Secret''; however, the producers decided to change it to ''My Bloody Valentine'', so to overtly reference the holiday serial killer trend{{Sfn|Blake|2013|p=116}} with which the slasher genre was becoming increasingly popular, through films such as ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974), ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trulydisturbing.com/2013/02/13/day-history-bloody-valentine-1981/|title=This day in History: MY BLOODY VALENTINE|first=Laura |last=Mooney |date=February 13, 2013 |work=Truly Disturbing |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the slasher sub-genre had seen further commercial success with the releases of ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' and ''[[Terror Train]]'' (both 1980).{{sfn|Leeder|2018|p=65}}

===Filming===
Shooting on ''My Bloody Valentine'' began in September 1980, taking place around the Princess Colliery Mine in Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia,{{Sfn|Pike|2012|p=186}} which had closed in 1975.{{Sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=106}} Filming completed in November 1980.{{Sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=106}} The budget was approximately $2.3 million.&lt;ref name=cbp/&gt; Two mines were considered for the setting, the other in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]]. The production company decided on the Sydney Mines location due to "the exterior [being] a dreary, cold and dusty area [with] no other buildings around it so it looked like it was totally in the middle of nowhere."&lt;ref name=mihalka2005 /&gt;

Upon arrival at the town for principal photography, the crew found that the townspeople, unbeknownst to them, had redecorated the mine so to make it more presentable, thus destroying the dark atmosphere that had convinced the production company to base the film there. The cast therefore spent a few days staying in Sydney Mines, encouraged by the director to get a feel for the small-town location.

Mihalka has said since making the movie that the most difficult element of ''My Bloody Valentine'' was filming in the mines. Located {{convert|2700|ft|m}} underground, filming in the mine was a lengthy process, as, due to limited space in the elevators, it would take an hour to assemble the cast and crew underground. Also, due to the methane levels, lighting had to be carefully planned as the number of bulbs that could be safely utilised was limited.&lt;ref name=mihalka2005 /&gt; Prior to the production's arrival to the mine, the owners cleaned up the location significantly, leaving it described as a "clean and colourful [[Disneyland]]-like set."&lt;ref name=cbp/&gt; This resulted in the production team spending an estimated $30,000 to paint portions of the mine to achieve a darker atmosphere, akin to how it had appeared in its original state.{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=106}} Producer Dunning referred to the shoot as "horrendous."{{Sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=106}} 

==Release==
===Box office===
''My Bloody Valentine'' grossed [[US dollar|US]]$5,672,031 at the United States box office upon its February 11, 1981 release.&lt;ref name=bom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mybloodyvalentine.htm|work=Box Office Mojo|title=My Bloody Valentine (1981)|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the U.S. gross exceeded the film's $2.3 million budget, it was considered a box-office disappointment by Paramount Pictures, returning a "derisory sum of $2.6 million."{{sfn|Nowell|2011|p=231}} This profit amounted to less than one-third of Paramount's ''Friday the 13th'', released the year before.{{sfn|Nowell|2011|p=231}}

===Critical response===
====Contemporaneous====
Upon its release, ''My Bloody Valentine'' received numerous reviews criticizing it for its depiction of violence and gore. Bruce Bailey of the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' noted the film as having an "awkward script," adding: "All that's really notable about ''My Bloody Valentine'' is that it gives you more than the usual m.p.g.p.{{em dash}}murders per gallon of popcorn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bailey, Bruce|date=February 14, 1981|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|location=Montreal, Quebec|p=105|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23907127/the_gazette/|via=Newspapers.com|title='Valentine' lacks essential heart}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Buckley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' echoed a similar sentiment, writing: "''My Bloody Valentine'' probably won't make you shiver with fright, but it's almost certain to make you squirm, first with irritation and then with revulsion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03EED6143BF931A25751C0A967948260|work=The New York Times|first=Tom|last=Buckley|date=February 12, 1981|accessdate=December 29, 2016|title='My Bloody Valentine'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Detroit Free Press]]''{{'}}s Jack Mathews conversely complimented the film on delivering "on its title promise by bucketfuls," adding: "There's nothing subtle about ''My Bloody Valentine''. A pickax to the belly, a 10-penny nail through the forehead, a granite drill through the back. There are some passing attempts at comic relief, but most of the yuks are inadvertent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|location=Detroit, Michigan|title=One bad shock deserves another|author=Mathews, Jack|p=8D|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23906922/detroit_free_press/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest Leogrande of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' noted the film as bearing similarity to other slasher films of the time, but conceded: "Movies like this are designed to make you jump, scream, hide your eyes, hug your date and talk with glee about what bad taste the movie makers are capable of. ''My Bloody Valentine'' does all that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leogrande, Ernest|date=February 11, 1981|work=[[New York Daily News]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23909973/daily_news/|title=So what became of chocolate hearts?|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reviewers were highly critical of the film's partial financing by the [[Telefilm Canada|Canadian Film Development Corporation]], which used taxed income from Canadian provinces to help fund its production: Among them were John Dodd of the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', who lambasted the film as a "rip off" of ''Halloween'' (1978), adding: "All this perverted gore is brought to you thanks to the financial help of the Canadian Film Development Corp. which uses your own tax money to help greedy, talentless producers make a killing, you should pardon the expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=February 16, 1981|work=[[Edmonton Journal]]|location=Edmonton, Alberta|title='I couldn't take it anymore'|author=Dodd, John|p=D8|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23907586/edmonton_journal/|via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' also noted the corporation's financing in his review, in which he awarded the film one out of four stars, deeming it a "dismal and depressing horror film," and "another entry in that most depressing of film genres, the mad-slasher-with-a-knife."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author-link=Gene Siskel|author=Siskel, Gene|p=4|date=February 17, 1981|title='Dogs of War' loses its bite in the second half|location=Chicago, Illinois|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23906615/chicago_tribune/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Blank of the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' faulted the film's cinematography and mine setting, writing that its "novelty, for the worse as it happens, is that the principal setting is a coal mine where most of the male characters work. Shooting scenes in the mine, brightened only by the miners' hats, permits Mihalka to play without a full deck. You can't tell what's going on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|p=A-5|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23907357/the_pittsburgh_press/|via=Newspapers.com|author=Blank, Ed|title='Bloody Valentine' A Drag}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Scapperotti of ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', alternately praised the film's cinematography, writing: "[it] is beautifully photographed, and the utilization of the mine creates powerful imagery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Cinefantastique|first=Dan|last=Scapperotti|title=My Bloody Valentine|page=48|volume=11|number=1|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Constitution]]'', Richard Zoglin noted that the film "floats along effortlessly in the current flood of schlock-horror films unleashed by John Carpenter's ''Halloween''. But it is more restrained — even tasteful — than most. The camera averts its eyes from much of the blood and gore, and women are treated somewhat better than usual (that is, they are generally allowed to keep their clothes on before being dispatched)." While praising the film for constraining the amount of violence shown, Zoglin criticized the characters and the plot for being "uninteresting" and "predictable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22935030/the_atlanta_constitution/|title='Valentine' Slickly Produced But Just A Routine Shocker|last=Zoglin|first=Richard|date=February 17, 1981|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Gross of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' panned the film for being "too convoluted, too derivative and, oddly, too ambitious to properly coagulate into the kind of [[exploitation film|exploitation movie]] that it tries to be."&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles, California|title='Bloody Valentine' Is Heartless Fare|date=February 16, 1981|p=2|via=Newspapers.com|author=Gross, Linda|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23906457/the_los_angeles_times/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she conceded that the film's cinematography is "sharp" and the musical score "portentous."&lt;ref name=gross/&gt;

====Modern assessment====
Contemporary [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] shows the film has a 47% approval rating, with an average rating of 4.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_bloody_valentine/ |title=My Bloody Valentine (1981) |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate= July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 30, 2007 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', the film was ranked 17 in a list of guilty pleasures, listed among such films as ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Escape from New York]]'', and called "the most criminally underappreciated of the [[slasher film|slasher]] genre." Popular filmmaker [[Quentin Tarantino]] called it his all-time favorite slasher film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1206985,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | author=Nashawaty, Chris  | title='House' Mates: Tarantino and Rodriguez talk Grindhouse| date=June 23, 2006|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrospective assessment, film historian Adam Rockoff wrote that the film was "easily one of the best and most polished slasher films."{{Sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=107}}

In another retrospective assessment by scholar Jim Harper in his book ''Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies'', he notes that the film distinguishes itself from other slashers by moving outside the "typical teen based scenario," instead focusing on a group of twenty-something adults in a [[working class]] community, and relying on a notable "atmosphere dread."{{Sfn|Harper|2004|p=128}}

===Censorship===
''My Bloody Valentine'' was significantly censored in North America upon its theatrical release.&lt;ref name=bl&gt;{{cite av media|title=Bloodlust: My Bloody Valentine and the Rise of the Slasher Film|year=2009|people=Rockoff, Adam; Mihalka, George; Link, André|publisher=Lionsgate|medium=documentary|format=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) to award the movie with an R-rating, cuts were requested to every death sequence in the film; producer Dunning said the film was essentially "cut to ribbons" in order to achieve an R-rating.{{Sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=106}} Even after cutting the film to match the requirements made by the MPAA, it was again returned with an X-rating and further cuts were demanded. Stills of the trimmed footage were published in ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine whilst the film was still in production, though the sequences were excised from the theatrical version;&lt;ref name=barton&gt;{{cite web|date=December 5, 2009|accessdate=March 13, 2018|author=Barton, Steve|title=My Bloody Valentine (1981) (Blu-ray)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/14686/my-bloody-valentine-1981-blu-ray/|work=[[Dread Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; even today the complete uncut version has not been released (though a 2009 DVD and Blu-ray release by Lionsgate reinstated three minutes of excised footage).&lt;ref name=bl/&gt; The standard North American theatrical cut of the film ran approximately 90 minutes.{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=199}} In the United Kingdom, the film was passed for theatrical release by the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) on March 30, 1981; according to the BBFC catalogue, this version ran at 90 minutes and 55 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=British Board of Film Classification|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/my-bloody-valentine-1970-1|title=My Bloody Valentine (1981)|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two reasons that are frequently attributed to the extreme cutting of the film. It has been suggested that Paramount Pictures was keen to remove the offending footage due to the backlash they had received from releasing ''Friday the 13th'' the previous year. The second reason, that Mihalka attributes, is that the movie was cut due to the [[murder of John Lennon]] in December 1980, stating that there was a major backlash against movie violence in the wake of his death.&lt;ref name=mihalka2005 /&gt;

====Restoration efforts====
{{See also|#Home media}}
An uncensored cut of ''My Bloody Valentine'' remained unavailable to the public for nearly thirty years after its original theatrical release.&lt;ref name=uncut/&gt; When Paramount released the film on DVD in North America for the first time in 2002, the studio claimed that the purported "missing" footage did not exist.&lt;ref name=barton/&gt; 

In 2008, [[Lionsgate]] acquired the rights to the film after producing a [[My Bloody Valentine 3D|feature film remake]], and in the process, acquired excised footage never-before seen in the standard theatrical cut of the film.&lt;ref name=barton/&gt; In January 2009, Lionsgate and Paramount co-released an unrated [[Region 1 DVD|Region 1]] "Special Edition" DVD featuring this footage.&lt;ref name=uncut/&gt; This DVD allows viewers the option to watch the standard R-rated version of the film, as well as an uncensored version in which excised violent footage is reinstated. Despite this, three scenes play in their unrated form regardless of which version is being viewed: the flashbacks of Axel's father's death, and Harry Warden with the arm.&lt;ref name=uncut/&gt; Commenting on the release, director Mihalka said: "[with this DVD] we have it back to 80% of the image back and 95% of the impact back."&lt;ref name=gmtalks&gt;{{cite web|work=ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/712261-excl-george-mihalka-talks-my-bloody-valentine-uncut#eyAPvvJUtPTYceTm.99|title=EXCL: George Mihalka Talks My Bloody Valentine Uncut|author=Turek, Ryan|date=January 17, 2009|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 "Special Edition" DVD reinstates approximately two-and-a-half minutes of previously-unreleased footage back into the film, which contradicts an earlier claim by director Mihalka that it had been trimmed by 8–9 minutes.&lt;ref name=dvdtalk09&gt;{{cite web|work=DVD Talk|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35922/my-bloody-valentine-special-edition-1981/|title=My Bloody Valentine: Special Edition (1981)|date=January 9, 2009|author=McGaughy, Cameron|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the so-called uncut DVD still has some sequences missing, particularly the double-impalement of Mike and Harriet which the director recalls filming. It is thought that the remaining footage appears to be composed of expository scenes, such as dialogue and other non-violence related material. This is given credence by the fact that Mihalka gave his seal of approval to this release, and a written introduction by him precedes the beginning of the special edition DVD, stating that this version was the way that the film was meant to be seen.&lt;ref name=bl/&gt;

===Home media===
''My Bloody Valentine'' was released to both [[VHS|videotape]] and [[LaserDisc]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/23182/LV1447/My-Bloody-Valentine-(1981) | title='LaserDisc Database'|publisher=LaserDisc Database |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film made its [[DVD]] debut on September 3, 2002 from Paramount Home Video;&lt;ref name=2002dvd&gt;{{cite av media|publisher=Paramount Home Video|year=2002|title=My Bloody Valentine|orig-year=1981|format=DVD|asin= B000069I04}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was a standard widescreen release of the theatrical cut, and it contained no bonus materials.&lt;ref name=2002dvd/&gt; The same disc was re-issued as a DVD double feature with ''[[April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' (1986; also a Paramount title) in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|publisher=Paramount Home Video|year=2002|title=My Bloody Valentine / April Fool's Day|format=DVD|asin= B0017CW5TE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2009, a "Special Edition" DVD version of the film was released in North America, coinciding with the theatrical release of the remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]|url=http://www.papermag.com/my-bloody-valentine-special-edition-dvd-1425508601.html|title=My Bloody Valentine Special Edition DVD|date=January 11, 2009|author=''Paper'' Magazine Staff|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version integrates the cut footage back into the film and features two featurettes and optional introductory sequences to the previously missing murder sequences.&lt;ref name=uncut&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Crave Online|ComingSoon.net]]|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/712045-my-bloody-valentine-uncut-deleted-scenes|title=My Bloody Valentine Uncut: Deleted Scenes!|author=Turek, Ryan|date=December 30, 2008|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two featurettes are also included. Director Mihalka, cast members Lori Hallier, Neil Affleck, Helene Udy, and Carl Marotte, composer Paul Zaza and make-up artists Thomas Burman and [[Ken Diaz]] are all involved.&lt;ref name=2009dvd&gt;{{cite av media|title=My Bloody Valentine|format=DVD|publisher=Lionsgate &amp; Paramount Home Video|year=2009|orig-year=1981|asin=B001KZN2IQ|series=Special Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Blu-ray]] was released on November 24, 2009 from Lionsgate, on loan from Paramount. The disc contained the same bonus materials as the "Special Edition" DVD released in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/My-Bloody-Valentine-Blu-ray/6868/|work=Blu-ray.com|title=My Bloody Valentine|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray is now out of print.

==Legacy and remake==
On January 16, 2009, shortly after the uncut version of the film was released in [[Canada]], a remake titled ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]'' was released in theaters.{{sfn|Roche|2014|p=10}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15297">The '''National Curriculum for England''' was first introduced by the [[Education Reform Act 1988|Education Reform Act of 1988]]. At the time of its introduction the legislation applied to both England and Wales. However, education later became a devolved matter for the Welsh government. The current statutory National Curriculum dates from 2014 at which point it was introduced to most year groups across primary and secondary education. Some elements were introduced in September 2015. The National Curriculum sets out the content matter which must be taught in a number of subjects in "local authority–maintained schools".{{efn|That does not include independent schools and state-funded academies – although in practice many such schools do follow the National Curriculum.}}

==Aims==
There are two main aims presented in the statutory documentation for the National Curriculum, stating:
# The national curriculum provides pupils with an introduction to the essential knowledge they need to be educated citizens. It introduces pupils to the best that has been thought and said, and helps engender an appreciation of human creativity and achievement.
# The national curriculum is just one element in the education of every child. There is time and space in the school day and in each week, term and year to range beyond the national curriculum specifications. The national curriculum provides an outline of core knowledge around which teachers can develop exciting and stimulating lessons to promote the development of pupils’ knowledge, understanding and skills as part of the wider school curriculum.&lt;ref name=nc&gt;{{cite web|title=National curriculum in England: framework for key stages 1 to 4|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4/the-national-curriculum-in-england-framework-for-key-stages-1-to-4|website=GOV.UK|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aims set out to support the statutory duties of schools to  offer a curriculum which is balanced and broadly based and which promotes the spiritual, moral, cultural, mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society, while preparing pupils at the school for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life, as set out in the [[Education Act 2002]].&lt;ref name=nc /&gt;

==Structure==
The National Curriculum, as released most recently in 2014, is set out for all year groups for pupils aged between 5 and 16. Within these ages, the curriculum is structured into four [[Key Stage]]s, for each of which a prescribed list of subjects must be taught. The table below sets out the statutory list of subjects to be taught at each Key Stage:&lt;ref name=nc /&gt;

For each of the statutory curriculum subjects, the Secretary of State for Education is required to set out a Programme of Study which outlines the content and matters which must be taught in those subjects at the relevant Key Stages.&lt;ref name=EAct2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Act 2002|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/32/part/6|website=GOV.UK|publisher=H M Government|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recently-published National Curriculum was introduced into schools in September 2014.

===Other entitlements===
In addition, children in all Key Stages must be provided with a curriculum of [[Religious Education]], and for pupils in Key Stages 3 and 4 a curriculum of Sex and Relationships Education must also be provided.
At Key Stage 4, although some subjects are not compulsory for all students, provision must be made to allow all students to access the arts (comprising art and design, music, dance, drama and media arts), design and technology, the humanities (comprising geography and history) and a modern foreign language.&lt;ref name=nc /&gt;

==History==
===Callaghan's Great Debate===
In a 1976 speech at [[Ruskin College]], Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] launched what became known as the "Great Debate". The speech has been called "revolutionary" in the context of its time,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/oct/16/schools.uk Callaghan's Ruskin College speech about education 25 years ago seemed revolutionary. Today, many of the issues are familiar. That's because we still haven't solved them], Will Woodward, October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and that it "lit a flare that has illuminated education reform ever since".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/17/education.schools 30 years on, Callaghan's words resonate, [[Andrew Adonis]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The speech intended to stimulate wide debate on the purpose of education in the UK:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These are proper subjects for discussion and debate. And it should be a rational debate based on the facts... It is not my intention to become enmeshed in such problems as whether there should be a basic curriculum with universal standards - although I am inclined to think there should be... The goals of our education, from nursery school through to adult education, are clear enough. They are to equip children to the best of their ability for a lively, constructive, place in society, and also to fit them to do a job of work. Not one or the other but both... Both of the basic purposes of education require the same essential tools. These are basic literacy, basic numaracy, the understanding of how to live and work together, respect for others, respect for the individual. This means requiring certain basic knowledge, and skills and reasoning ability. It means developing lively inquiring minds and an appetite for further knowledge that will last a lifetime. It means mitigating as far as possible the disadvantages that may be suffered through poor home conditions or physical or mental handicap. Are we aiming in the right direction in these matters?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/speeches/1976ruskin.html 'A rational debate based on the facts']; James Callaghan, Ruskin College Oxford, 18 October 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1988 Education Reform Act===
{{main|Education Reform Act 1988}}
The first statutory National Curriculum was introduced by the [[Education Reform Act 1988]] by [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]].&lt;ref name=DGillard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gillard|first1=Derek|title=History of Education in England (Chapter 8)|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter08.html|website=Education in England|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Programmes of Study were drafted and published in 1988 and 1989, with the first teaching of some elements of the new curriculum beginning in September 1989.

===1994-95 Shephard reforms===
Under [[Gillian Shephard]]'s tenure as Education Secretary, a review of the National Curriculum was launched in 1994, led by [[Ronald Dearing, Baron Dearing|Ron Dearing]]. Its objective was to find ways to 'slim down' the over-detailed curriculum. The final report set out the need to reduce the volume of statutory content, particularly at lower key stages, as well as recommending changes to methods of [[National Curriculum assessment|assessment]].&lt;ref name=Dearing&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dearing|first1=Ron|title=Dearing Review, 1994|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/dearing1994/dearing1994.html|website=Education in England|publisher=Derek Gillard|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, an updated National Curriculum was published in 1995 which saw a considerable reduction in the content of the curriculum and a simplification in line with Dearing's recommendations.

===1997-99 Blunkett reforms===
When a new Labour government took office in 1997, its focus on English and Maths led to a decision to disapply the statutory Programmes of Study for the foundation subjects from September 1998, to allow schools to spend more time teaching literacy and numeracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=English schools told to go back to basics|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/46975.stm|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=BBC News website|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=13 Jan 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of State, [[David Blunkett]] later announced another overhaul of the National Curriculum, particularly at primary level, to reduce the content in foundation subjects allowing more time to be spent on the core subjects of English, Maths and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=National Curriculum faces overhaul|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/93921.stm|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=BBC News website|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=15 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new National Curriculum was published in 1999, for first teaching in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Curriculum to go online|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/517750.stm|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=BBC News website|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=15 Nov 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007-08 Balls reforms===
Further changes were announced by [[Ed Balls]] in 2007 for the statutory curriculum for Key Stages 3 and 4, which again focussed on removing some content from the documentation, while also adding some additional element, with the intended aim of additional flexibility for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Curriculum to  be 'more flexible'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6293164.stm|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=BBC News website|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes were introduced in September 2008, and were swiftly followed by proposed changes to the primary curriculum, based on a review to be led by Jim Rose. The review proposed replacing the 10 statutory subjects in Key Stages 1 and 2 with 6 broader 'areas of learning', such as "understanding English, communication and languages" and "human, social and environmental understanding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Primary School subjects overhaul|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7770469.stm|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=BBC News website|agency=BBC|publisher=BBC|date=8 Dec 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the change of government in 2010, the plans for this change - proposed to begin in September 2011 - were abandoned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose Review officially abandoned|url=https://education.scholastic.co.uk/content/11405|website=Scholastic.co.uk|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with schools advised to continue to follow the 2000 curriculum pending review. 

===2012-14 Gove reforms===
Following his appointment as Education Secretary in 2010, [[Michael Gove]] commissioned an expert review panel to report on a framework for a new National Curriculum. The review was led by Tim Oates of [[University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate|Cambridge Assessment]], and reported in December 2011. It suggested significant changes to the structure of the National Curriculum, including dividing Key Stage 2 into two shorter (two-year) phases.&lt;ref name=EP&gt;{{cite book|title=The Framework for the National Curriculum. A report by the Expert Panel for the National Curriculum review|date=Dec 2011|publisher=Department for Education|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/framework-for-the-national-curriculum-a-report-by-the-expert-panel-for-the-national-curriculum-review|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013, the government produced a draft National Curriculum, followed by a final version in September 2013, for first teaching in September 2014. Due to the short timescales for introduction, the curriculum was introduced only for certain subjects and year groups in 2014, with the core subjects in Years 2 and 6 (the final years of Key Stages 1 and 2) only becoming statutory in September 2015, to allow time for the introduction of new testing arrangements at the end of the Key Stages. Similarly, core subjects at Key Stage 4 are to be introduced on a year-by-year basis starting in September 2015 for English and Maths, and September 2016 for Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The national curriculum for England to be taught in all local authority-maintained schools.|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum|website=GOV.UK|publisher=H M Government|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open House Tel Aviv''' (''Batim MiBifnim'', lit. "Houses From Within") happens over the course of a weekend annually in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], in which different buildings, landmarks and private residences open their doors to the general public to offer a free glimpse of architecture in the past and present, with a preview of design for the future. It is one of many [[Doors Open Days|Open House]] events that take place in cities such as [[London]] and [[New York City]], originally started in [[France]] in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="918">The term '''''oracy''''' was coined by Andrew Wilkinson, a British researcher and educator, in the 1960s. This word is formed by analogy from [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]]. The purpose is to draw attention to the neglect of [[Speech communication|oral skills]] in [[education]].

'''Positivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that certain ("positive") knowledge is based on [[natural phenomena]] and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from [[sensory experience]], interpreted through [[reason]] and [[logic]], forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or [[truth]]) is found only in this [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]].

Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as [[empirical evidence]]; thus positivism is based on [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, ''Sociology'', Seventh Canadian Edition, [[Pearson Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism also holds that [[society]], like the physical world, operates according to general [[Scientific law|laws]]. [[Introspection|Introspective]] and [[intuitive knowledge]] is rejected, as are [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed positivism into a ''[[Religion of Humanity]]''.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''positivism'' was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word ''positivisme'', derived from ''positif'' in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. ''positīvus'') has been used in a similar sense to discuss law ([[positive law]] compared to [[natural law]]) since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Robert'' s. v. ''positivisme''; ''OED'' s. v. ''positive''&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Overview==

===Antecedents===
Positivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and [[poetry]], notably laid out by [[Plato]] and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the [[humanities]],&lt;ref name="Egan1997p114"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Egan |first1=Kieran |author-link1=Kieran Egan (educationist) |year=1997 |title=The Educated Mind |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0-226-19036-5|quote=Positivism is marked by the final recognition that science provides the only valid form of knowledge and that facts are the only possible objects of knowledge; philosophy is thus recognized as essentially no different from science [...] Ethics, politics, social interactions, and all other forms of human life about which knowledge was possible would eventually be drawn into the orbit of science [...] The positivists' program for mapping the inexorable and immutable laws of matter and society seemed to allow no greater role for the contribution of poets than had Plato. [...] What Plato represented as the quarrel between philosophy and poetry is resuscitated in the "two cultures" quarrel of more recent times between the humanities and the sciences.|title-link=The Educated Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato elaborates a critique of poetry from the point of view of philosophy in his dialogues ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 245a, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 209a, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' 398a, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' 817 b-d and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, T. J. ''Introduction to Ion.'' London: [[Penguin Books]], 1987, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between [[Geisteswissenschaft]] (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften ([[natural science|natural sciences]]).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences,&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; was stated, in different terms, by [[G. B. Vico]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico, ''Principi di scienza nuova'', ''Opere'', ed. Fausto Nicolini (Milan: R. Ricciardi, 1953), p. 365–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.&lt;ref name="MoreraEsteve1990p13"&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13 ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivists===
Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larrain |first1=Jorge |year=1979 |title=The Concept of Ideology |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson |page=197 |quote=one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) and [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) believed the [[scientific method]], the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace [[metaphysics]] in the [[history]] of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of [[social research]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical Sociological Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA103 |year=2002|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|isbn=978-0-631-21348-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; and it is humanistic [[knowledge]] that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; Dilthey was in part influenced by the [[Historism|historicism]] of [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt;

===Antipositivism===
{{main article|Antipositivism}}
At the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and [[critical theorist]]s have associated positivism with "[[scientism]]"; science ''as [[ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]], ''Technik und Wissenschaft als Ideologie'', Frankfurt am Main: [[Suhrkamp]], 1968, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career (1969),&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg (1969) ''[[The Part and The Whole]]''&lt;/ref&gt; German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], Nobel laureate for pioneering work in [[quantum mechanics]], distanced himself from positivism by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|editor=Ruth Nanda Nanshen|others=Translator: [[Arnold J. Pomerans]]|title=Werner Heisenberg - Physics and Beyond - Encounters and Conversations|series=World Perspectives|volume=42|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|page=213|chapter=Positivism, Metaphysics and Religion|lccn=78095963|oclc=15379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Logical positivism and postpositivism===
{{main article|Logical positivism|Postpositivism}}
In the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in [[Vienna Circle|Vienna]] and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure [[logic]]. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have been highly influential, and led to the development of [[postpositivism]].

===In historiography===
In [[historiography]] the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and [[historicism]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; (Historicism is also sometimes termed ''[[historism]]'' in the German tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], [[Routledge]], 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that [[history]] differs from sciences like [[physics]] and [[ethology]] in [[Theory|subject matter]] and [[Methodology|method]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"/&gt; That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other fields===
Positivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by [[quantitative approach]]es and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by [[cultural anthropology]], which tends naturally toward [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace, Edwin R.  and Gach, John (2008) ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] the positivist movement was influential in the development of [[operationalism]]. The 1927 philosophy of science book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term [[operational definition]], which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a ''de facto'' fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology.&lt;ref name="Boland2012"&gt;[http://positivists.org/blog/economic-positivism Lawrence A. Boland, ''Economic Positivism'' positivists.org 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see  "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In [[jurisprudence]], "[[legal positivism]]" essentially refers to the rejection of [[natural law]]; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a "scientific" view of law.

In the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were "incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity" on the real problems of contemporary cities.&lt;ref name="Portugali2012p51"&gt;Portugali, Juval and Han Meyer, Egbert Stolk (2012) ''Complexity Theories of Cities Have Come of Age'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZCQhvfBpIC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 20th century sociology===
In contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, [[replicability]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"&gt;Gartell, David, and Gartell, John. 1996. "Positivism in sociological practice: 1967-1990". ''Canadian Review of Sociology'', Vol. 33 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This positivism is generally equated with "[[quantitative research]]" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"&gt;Boudon, Raymond.  1991.  "Review: What Middle-Range Theories are".  Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 20 Num. 4 pp 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 21st century sociology===
Other new movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis|first=John|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-13-800270-1|pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straker|first=David|title=Positivism|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm|publisher=changingminds.org|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"&gt;Halfpenny, Peter. ''Positivism and Sociology: Explaining Social Life.'' London:Allen and Unwin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological positivism==

===Comte's positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Auguste Comte] in [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.

{{quotation|"The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand—not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one. ... This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity," which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology."|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)|&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;}}

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general "[[law of three stages]]". The idea bears some similarity to [[Marx]]'s belief that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak (see [[dialectical materialism]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'', (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to [[God]]. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any "fact" adduced for society to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a time steeped in logical [[rationalism]], to the time right after the [[French Revolution]]. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard von Mises]], ''Positivism: A Study In Human Understanding'', 5 (Paperback, [[Dover Books]], 1968 {{ISBN|0-486-21867-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would "lead to the historical consideration of every science" because "the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 622&lt;/ref&gt; As Comte would say: "from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 566&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil]]
Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Emile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. As an approach to the [[philosophy of history]], positivism was appropriated by historians such as [[Hippolyte Taine]]. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, [[Harriet Martineau]], regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993) ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. [[Brazil]]'s national [[motto]], ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") was taken from the positivism motto, "Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal", which was also influential in [[Positivism in Poland|Poland]].

In later life, Comte developed a '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

===Proletarian positivism===
[[Fabien Magnin]] was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin was in touch with the English positivists [[Richard Congreve]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]]. He established the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] in 1863 which was affiliated to the [[First International]]. [[Eugène Sémérie]] was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. "Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal." he wrote.&lt;ref name="FPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sémérie|first1=Eugène|title=Founding of a Positivist Club|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/comte/1870/semerie.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim's positivism===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "[[social facts]]" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". Durkheim described sociology as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by [[Pearson Education]], that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical [[social research]] as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other [[social sciences]], such as [[political science]], as well of [[market research]] and other fields.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antipositivism and critical theory===
{{Main article|Antipositivism|Critical theory}}
At the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of [[social action]], using critical analysis and [[verstehen]] techniques. The sociologists [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Charles Cooley]] were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy, [[hermeneutics]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] facilitated the movement in general.

[[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] theory of [[historical materialism]] and critical analysis drew upon positivism,&lt;ref&gt;"Main Currents of Marxism" by Leszek Kolakowski page 331, 327,&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition which would continue in the development of [[critical theory]]. However, following in the tradition of both [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Marx]], the critical theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] (in its relation to the cultural [[rationalisation (sociology)|"rationalisation"]] of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. Positivism may be espoused by "[[Technocracy|technocrats]]" who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt; New movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.

===Contemporary positivism===
In the original Comtean usage, the term "positivism" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while "sociology" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. "Positivism is a way of understanding based on science"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. "Antipositivism" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt;  Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science.  However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] rather than [[qualitative research|qualitative]]).&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;Brett, Paul. 1994. "A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles". ''English For Specific Purposes''. Vol 13, Num 1:47–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Grant |first2=Kathryn B. |last2=Ward |author3=Xue Lan Rong |title=Is There An Association between Gender and Methods in Sociological Research? |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=52 |issue=6 |year=1987 |pages=856–862 |jstor=2095839|doi=10.2307/2095839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}} Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}}

===The role of science in social change===
The contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the [[Positivism dispute]]) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. [[Public sociology]]—especially as described by [[Michael Burawoy]]—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: [http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/ASA%20Presidential%20Address.pdf "For Public Sociology"] ([[American Sociological Review]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3): 183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

==Logical positivism==
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
[[File:Schlick sitting.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Moritz Schlick]], the founding father of logical positivism and the [[Vienna Circle]].]]
[[Logical positivism]] (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines [[empiricism]], the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of [[rationalism]], the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.

Logical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the "First Vienna Circle" which gathered at the [[Café Central]] before [[World War I]]. After the war [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], a member of that early group, helped bring [[Moritz Schlick]] to Vienna. Schlick's [[Vienna Circle]], along with [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]], propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.

It was [[Otto Neurath]]'s advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all [[metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]] and [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']] propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work (which he himself later set out to refute){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of "rational reconstruction," in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, Mill, and Mach. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—neo-Thomisism, neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C. [Verifiability Criterion]—but for no defensible reason—or admitting that the V.C. requires a background language, etc., which opens the door to relativism, etc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230818/http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |archivedate=7 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his ''Logical Syntax of Language''. This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be "logical empiricism."{{cn|date=February 2018}} While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical positivism==
Historical positivism is the [[historiography|historiographical]] view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://colegiomoz.blogspot.com/2017/11/historiografia-positivista.html?m=1 | title=Historiografia positivista - Colégio-moz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its tenets were later contradicted by [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the Holocaust, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further thinkers&lt;!--'Popper legend' redirects here--&gt;==
Within years of the publication of  [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s book ''A General View of Positivism'' (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included [[Émile Zola]], [[Emile Hennequin]], [[Wilhelm Scherer]], and [[Dimitri Pisarev]]. Émile Zola was an influential French [[novelist]], the most important example of the literary school of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], and a major figure in the political liberalization of [[France]].

Emile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He "exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature." He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that [[subjectivity]] does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.

Wilhelm Scherer was a German [[Philology|philologist]], a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on "hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

Dimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were "an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position." He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Stephen Hawking]] was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31) he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by [[Karl Popper]] and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the "'''Popper legend'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Stadler]], ''The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism'', Springer, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', 1934, 1959 (1st English ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a [[unified science]]. However, this was also part of the "Popper legend"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p256 [[Routledge]], London, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science today==
{{See also|Constructive empiricism}}
The key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the "received view",&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (ed.) 1981. Scientific revolutions. - Oxford Univ. Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# A focus on science as a product, a linguistic or numerical set of statements;
# A concern with [[axiomatization]], that is, with demonstrating the logical structure and coherence of these statements;
# An insistence on at least some of these statements being testable; that is, amenable to being verified, confirmed, or shown to be false by the empirical observation of reality.  Statements that would, by their nature, be regarded as untestable included the [[teleology|teleological]]; thus positivism rejects much of classical metaphysics.
# The belief that science is markedly cumulative;
# The belief that science is predominantly [[Trans-cultural diffusion|transcultural]];
# The belief that science rests on specific results that are dissociated from the personality and social position of the investigator;
# The belief that science contains theories or research traditions that are largely commensurable;
# The belief that science sometimes incorporates new ideas that are discontinuous from old ones;
# The belief that science involves the idea of the unity of science, that there is, underlying the various scientific disciplines, basically one science about one real world.
# The belief that science is nature and nature is science; and out of this duality, all theories and postulates are created, interpreted, evolve, and are applied.

Positivism is elsewhere{{Non sequitur|date=February 2018}}{{where|date=February 2018}} defined{{by who|date=February 2018}} as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific,&lt;ref name="bullock"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]] and [[Stephen Trombley]], [Eds] ''The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', London: [[Harper-Collins]], 1999, pp. 669–737&lt;/ref&gt; and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to [[reductionism]], in that both involve the belief that "entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

While most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, Richard.  1997. "Genre analysis, and the social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion sections in three disciplines". ''English For Specific Purposes'', vol. 16, num. 4:321–337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"/&gt;  It can be thus argued that "natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre".&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Positivism dispute}}
Historically, positivism has been criticized for its [[reductionism]], i.e., for contending that all "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," and that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

[[Max Horkheimer]] criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adorno/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism falsely represented the object of study by [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Some scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of [[postpositivism]]. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. "The Arrogance of Public Sociology". ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of "man" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a [[Platonism|Platonic]] or [[Christian]] ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.

[[Experientialism]], which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E. T., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (1999). ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. Basic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of the "positivist" and "antipositivist" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;Hanson, Barbara. 2008. "Wither Qualitative/Quantitative?: Grounds for Methodological Convergence." ''Quality and Quantity'' 42:97–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as "positivists" are actually postpositivists.&lt;ref name="Bryman"&gt;Bryman, Alan. 1984. "The Debate about Quantitative and Qualitative Research: A Question of Method or Epistemology?." ''The British Journal of Sociology'' 35:75–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the "other", with each side defining the other by what it is ''not'' rather than what it ''is'', and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the "antipositivist" articulation of a social [[meta-theory]] which includes a philosophical critique of [[scientism]], and "positivist" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of work that they see as violating such standards.

'''Purse accessories''' are [[Fashion accessory|fashion accessories]] that are made specifically for [[handbag]]s, to enhance their functionality or appearance.

==Purse rain cover==
Purse rain covers, also widely known as Purse Raincoats, assist in waterproofing purses. They take the form of a [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] cover that is worn on a purse to protect it from rain. The purse rain cover is commonly made out of waterproof fabrics such as [[Ethylene-vinyl_acetate |PEVA]] or [[polyester]].  Some retailers offer them for free along with purchases of certain purses, such as [[Birkin bag |Hermes Birkin handbags]].

==Purse organizer==
These assist in organizing, and ease finding objects inside purses, especially when they are overloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Top 5 Most Popular Purse Organizer Insert {{!}} Luxury Handbags Shopping Tips, Prices, News and Guide|url = http://www.bagreporter.com/top-5-most-popular-purse-organizer-insert/|website = www.bagreporter.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purse organizer is inserted into the purse, and typically, has several pockets that can be used to group different items into separate groups, for example, electronics, make-up, and food and drinks pockets, thus, making it easier to find them. Purse organizers can be made out of [[plastic]], although the more expensive ones are made out of [[leather]].

==Fur and charms==
Fur or [[amulet|charms]] can be added to purses, either as attachments, or as cosmetic covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fendi Bag Bugs - PurseBop|url = http://www.pursebop.com/whats-deal-bag-charms/|website = PurseBop|accessdate = 2015-11-20|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}

'''''Redneck''''' is a derogatory term chiefly but not exclusively applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with [[Country (identity)|rural]] whites of the [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name="Harold Wentworth 1975 p. 424"&gt;Harold Wentworth, and Stuart Berg Flexner, ''Dictionary of American Slang'' (1975) p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redneck|publisher=Merriam Webster|title=Redneck - Definition and More|accessdate=January 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage is similar in meaning to ''[[Cracker (pejorative)|cracker]]'' (especially regarding [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Texas (U.S. state)|Texas]],&lt;ref name="Harold Wentworth 1975 p. 424"/&gt; and [[Florida]]), ''[[hillbilly]]'' (especially regarding [[Appalachia]] and the [[Ozarks]]),&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Harkins, ''Hillbilly, A Cultural History of an American Icon'', Oxford University Press (2004), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[white trash]]'' (but without the last term's suggestions of immorality).&lt;ref&gt;Wray (2006) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Cashmore and James Jennings, eds. ''Racism: essential readings'' (2001) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Goad, ''The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies, Hicks, and White Trash Became America's Scapegoats'' (1998) pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the term had become offensive slang, its meaning expanded to include racism, loutishness, and opposition to modern ways.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Chapman, ''Dictionary of American Slang'' (1995) p. 459; William Safire, ''Safire's New Political Dictionary'' (1993) pp. 653-54; Tom Dalzell, ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J-Z'' (2005) 2:1603.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Huber, in his monograph ''A Short History of Redneck: The Fashioning of a Southern White Masculine Identity'', emphasized the theme of masculinity in the 20th-century expansion of the term, noting, "The redneck has been stereotyped in the media and popular culture as a poor, dirty, uneducated, and racist Southern white man."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Huber,  "A short history of Redneck: The fashioning of a southern white masculine identity." ''Southern Cultures'' 1#2 (1995): 145-166. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/scu/summary/v001/1.2.huber.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th and early 20th centuries==

===Political term for poor farmers===
The term characterized farmers having a red neck caused by sunburn from hours working in the fields. A citation from &lt;time&gt;1893&lt;/time&gt; provides a definition as "poorer inhabitants of the rural districts...men who work in the field, as a matter of course, generally have their skin stained red and burnt by the sun, and especially is this true of the back of their necks".&lt;ref name=regional&gt;Frederic Gomes Cassidy &amp; Joan Houston Hall, ''Dictionary of American Regional English VOL.IV'' (2002) p. 531. {{ISBN|978-0674008847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1900, "rednecks" was in common use to designate the political factions inside the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] comprising poor white farmers in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirwan|first1=Albert D.|title=Revolt of the Rednecks: Mississippi Politics, 1876-1925|date=1951|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|location=Lexington|isbn=9780813134284}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same group was also often called the "wool hat boys" (for they opposed the rich men, who wore expensive silk hats). A newspaper notice in Mississippi in August 1891 called on rednecks to rally at the polls at the upcoming primary election:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Patrick Huber|author2=Kathleen Drowne|title=Redneck: A New Discovery|journal=American Speech|date=2001|volume=76|issue=4|pages=434–437|doi=10.1215/00031283-76-4-434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Primary on the 25th.
And the "rednecks" will be there.
And the "Yaller-heels" will be there, also.
And the "hayseeds" and "gray dillers," they'll be there, too.
And the "subordinates" and "subalterns" will be there to rebuke their slanderers and traducers.
And the men who pay ten, twenty, thirty, etc. etc. per cent on borrowed money will be on hand, and they'll remember it, too.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Frank Tengle, Bud Fields, and Floyd Burroughs, cotton sharecroppers, Hale County, Alabama.jpg|thumb|Poor white sharecroppers in [[Alabama]] in &lt;time&gt;1936&lt;/time&gt;]]
By &lt;time&gt;1910&lt;/time&gt;, the political supporters of the [[History of Mississippi|Mississippi]] Democratic Party politician [[James K. Vardaman]]—chiefly poor white farmers—began to describe themselves proudly as "rednecks," even to the point of wearing red neckerchiefs to political rallies and picnics.&lt;ref&gt;Kirwan (1951), p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist Sterling Eisiminger, based on the testimony of informants from the Southern United States, speculated that the prevalence of [[pellagra]] in the region during the [[Great Depression in the United States|great depression]] may have contributed to the rise in popularity of the term; red, inflamed skin is one of the first symptoms of that disorder to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Redneck|author=Sterling Eisiminger|page=284|journal=American Speech|volume=59|number=3|date=Autumn 1984|jstor=454514|doi=10.2307/454514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal miners===
The term "redneck" in the early 20th century was occasionally used in reference to American coal miner union members who wore red [[bandanas]] for solidarity.  The sense of "a union man" dates at least to the 1910s and was especially popular during the 1920s and 1930s in the coal-producing regions of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Huber, "Red Necks and Red Bandanas: Appalachian Coal Miners and the Coloring of Union Identity, 1912-1936," ''Western Folklore'', Winter 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by union strikers to describe poor white [[strikebreakers]].&lt;ref name=GreenHills&gt;{{cite book|author=James Green|title=The Devil Is Here in These Hills: West Virginia's Coal Miners and Their Battle for Freedom|publisher=Grove Press|date=2015|location=New York|page=380|isbn=9780802124654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20th and early 21st centuries==

Writers [[Edward Abbey]] and [[Dave Foreman]] also use "redneck" as a political call to mobilize poor rural white Southerners. "In Defense of the Redneck" was a popular essay by Ed Abbey. One popular early [[Earth First!]] bumper sticker was "Rednecks for Wilderness". [[Murray Bookchin]], an urban leftist and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]], objected strongly to Earth First!'s use of the term as "at the very least, insensitive".&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray; Foreman, Dave. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0896083829 ''Defending the Earth: A Dialogue Between Murray Bookchin and Dave Foreman'']. South End Press. 1991. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Southerners have proudly [[Reappropriation|embraced the term as a self-identifier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kyff |first = Rob |title = Embrace Slurs, Reclaim Pride |work = [[Hartford Courant]] |date = August 3, 2007 |page = D.10 |accessdate = 2010-06-30 |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/1314629651.html?dids=1314629651:1314629651&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+03%2C+2007&amp;author=ROB+KYFF&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=EMBRACE+SLURS%2C+RECLAIM+PRIDE&amp;pqatl=google |quote = Many southerners have adopted the disparaging term redneck as a banner of pride.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Page |first=Clarence |authorlink=Clarence Page |title='Redneck' is not a word that a politician should take lightly |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jJYWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pxIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969,4414198&amp;dq=redneck+pride&amp;hl=en |work=The Milwaukee Sentinel |date=July 18, 1989 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927171911/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jJYWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pxIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969,4414198&amp;dq=redneck+pride&amp;hl=en |archivedate=September 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Earth First!'s use, the self-described "anti-racist, pro-gun, pro-labor" group [[Redneck Revolt]] have used the term to signal its roots in the rural white working-class and celebration of what member Max Neely described as "redneck culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/11/redneck-revolt-guns-anti-racism-fascism-far-left |title=Redneck Revolt: the armed leftwing group that wants to stamp out fascism |last=Watt |first=Cecilia Saixue |date=11 July 2017 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As political epithet==
According to Chapman and Kipfer in their "Dictionary of American Slang", By 1975 the term had expanded in meaning beyond the poor Southerner to refer to "a bigoted and conventional person, a loutish ultra-conservative."&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Chapman and Barbara Ann Kipfer, ''Dictionary of American Slang'' (3rd ed. 1995) p. 459&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1960 John Barlow Martin expressed Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] should not enter the Indiana Democratic presidential primary because the state was "redneck conservative country."  Indiana, he told Kennedy, was a state "suspicious of foreign entanglements, conservative in fiscal policy, and with a strong overlay of Southern segregationist sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ray E. Boomhower|title=John Bartlow Martin: A Voice for the Underdog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDF3BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA273|year=2015|publisher=Indiana UP|page=273|isbn=9780253016188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer [[William Safire]] observes it is often used to attack white Southern [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], and more broadly to degrade working class and rural whites that are perceived by urban progressives to be insufficiently liberal.&lt;ref&gt;William Safire, ''Safire's political dictionary'' (2008) p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some [[white Southerners]] have reclaimed the word, using it with pride and defiance as a self-identifier.&lt;ref&gt;Goad, ''The Redneck Manifesto: How Hillbillies, Hicks, and White Trash Became America's Scapegoats'' (1998) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[Johnny Russell (singer)|Johnny Russell]] was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in &lt;time&gt;1973&lt;/time&gt; for his recording of "[[Rednecks, White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer]]", parlaying the "common touch" into financial and critical success.
*Further songs referencing rednecks include "[[Longhaired Redneck (song)|Longhaired Redneck]]" by [[David Allan Coe]], "[[Rednecks (song)|Rednecks]]" by [[Randy Newman]], "[[Redneck Friend]]" by [[Jackson Browne]],  "[[Redneck Woman]]" by [[Gretchen Wilson]], "[[Redneck Yacht Club]]" by  [[Craig Morgan]], "[[Redneck (song)|Redneck]]" by [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], "[[Redneck Crazy]]" by [[Tyler Farr]], and "[[Your Redneck Past]]" by [[Ben Folds Five]]. 
*'[[Picture to Burn]]' by [[Taylor Swift]] is another successful country song using the word 'redneck', this time in a negative way, where the narrator calls her ex-boyfriend a 'redneck heartbreak'.
*Comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s &lt;time&gt;1993&lt;/time&gt; comedy album ''[[You Might Be a Redneck If...]]'' cajoled listeners to evaluate their own behavior in the context of [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] redneck behavior. 
*Redneck is mentioned several times on Texas-based animated sitcom [[King of the Hill]] by [[Hank Hill]]'s antagonistic neighbor Kahn.&lt;ref name="productionhistory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501636|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008120722/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501636|archivedate=October 8, 2007|title=Milestone: 'King of the Hill'|work=hollywoodreporter.com|date=May 11, 2006|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the United States==

===Historical Scottish Covenanter usage===
In Scotland in the 1640s, the [[Covenanters]] rejected rule by bishops, often signing manifestos using their own blood. Some wore red cloth around their neck to signify their position, and were called rednecks by the Scottish ruling class to denote that they were the rebels in what came to be known as [[Bishops' Wars|The Bishop's War]] that preceded the rise of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]].&lt;ref name=Albion&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer|Fischer, David Hackett]]. (1989) ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]''. New York: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;redneck (1989); ''Oxford English Dictionary'' second edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the term began to mean simply "[[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]", especially in communities along the Scottish border. Because of the large number of Scottish immigrants in the pre-revolutionary American South, some historians have suggested that this may be the origin of the term in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur L. Herman|Herman, Arthur]], ''[[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]]''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2001, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dictionaries document the earliest American citation of the term's use for Presbyterians in &lt;time&gt;1830&lt;/time&gt;, as "a name bestowed upon the Presbyterians of Fayetteville [North Carolina]".&lt;ref name="regional"/&gt;&lt;ref name=oed /&gt;

===Roman Catholics===
In [[Northern England]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] were known as rednecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=10UyAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=roman+catholics++rednecks&amp;dq=roman+catholics++rednecks|title=The All England Law Reports Reprint: Being a Selection from the Law Times Reports, 1843-1935|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2013|quote="At the meeting the appellant called Roman Catholics "rednecks," a name most insulting to them, and challenged them to get up."|author1=Bridgman|first1=George Frederick Leslie|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The exact Afrikaans equivalent, ''{{lang|af|[[wikt:rooinek|rooinek]]}}'', is used as a disparaging term for English people and South Africans of English descent, in reference to their supposed naïveté as later arrivals in the region in failing to protect themselves from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A Dictionary of South African English|author=Jean Bedford|publisher=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Research-informed Teaching''' refers to the practice of linking research with teaching in [[Higher education|Higher Education]]. Most universities in the world are organised into teaching and research divisions. Professors and lecturers will normally be contracted to do both and, in theory at least, course syllabi are structured around the teacher's research interests. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to further integrate the two activities. This has led to a new interest in undergraduate research, where students enrolled on bachelor's degrees are given the opportunity to participate in research projects or undertake their own research.

This concept is also coined as '''Teaching-as-Research''' or '''Research-based Practices in Teaching''' in higher education. There are growing number of activities supported and sponsored by inter-university organizations such as the National Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network.[https://www.cirtl.net/] 

==Worldwide==
This practice was pioneered in America, where there is now a nationwide Council for Undergraduate Research, and in Australia. Recently, the UK Government funded several 'centres of excellence' which focus in different ways on undergraduate research. One of the most important is the  Reinvention Centre for Undergraduate Research, which was set up in the Sociology department at [[University of Warwick|Warwick University]] in  partnership with the School of the [[Built environment|Built Environment]] at  [[Oxford Brookes University]] under the directorship of Mike Neary. The Centre's journal, Reinvention, launched in September 2007. In 2006, the UK Government also invested c.£25m into universities across the country to strengthen research-informed teaching. Key publications by Alan Jenkins, Roger Zetter, Mick Healey and Angela Brew have further developed the research base for research-informed teaching. In April 2007 the University of [[Central Lancashire]] appointed the first ever Chair in Research-informed Teaching, Stuart Hampton-Reeves, and in September 2007 launched a Centre for Research-informed Teaching.

==Efficacy==
While university instruction is optimal when grounded in empirical findings, some concerns have arisen regarding the efficacy of university instruction at research focused institutions. A growing number of these higher education research institutions focus on the researching prowess of the potential professor (and, in many cases, the grant-writing ability of prospective employee) while often paying substantially less attention to one's ability to disseminate the information.  Of course, those talented instructors who are both strong in research and instruction have the potential to really impact their students.

'''Rudolf Carnap''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|n|æ|p}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/carnap "Carnap"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈkaɐ̯naːp|lang}}; May 18, 1891 – September 14, 1970) was a German-born [[philosopher]] who was active in Europe before 1935 and in the United States thereafter. He was a major member of the [[Vienna Circle]] and an [[advocate]] of [[logical positivism]].  He is considered "one of the giants among twentieth-century philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00004&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id= California Digital Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:Wuppertal Ronsdorf - Villa Carnap 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Carnap's birthplace in Wuppertal]]
Carnap's father had risen from the status of a poor ribbon-weaver to become the owner of a ribbon-making factory. His mother came from academic stock; her father was an educational reformer and her oldest brother was the archaeologist [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]]. As a ten-year-old, Carnap accompanied his uncle on an expedition to Greece.&lt;ref name=DCDVlife&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine, W.V. and Rudolf Carnap|title=Dear Carnap, Dear Van: The Quine-Carnap Correspondence and Related Work|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnap was raised in a religious family, but later became an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"Carnap had a modest but deeply religious family background, which might explain why, although he later became an atheist, he maintained a respectful and tolerant attitude in matters of faith throughout his life." Buldt, Bernd: "Carnap, Paul Rudolf", Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography Vol. 20 p.43. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his formal education at the [[Barmen]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. From 1910 to 1914, he attended the [[University of Jena]], intending to write a thesis in [[physics]]. But he also studied carefully [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' during a course taught by [[Bruno Bauch]], and was one of very few students to attend [[Gottlob Frege]]'s courses in [[mathematical logic]]. While Carnap held moral and political opposition to [[World War I]], he felt obligated to serve in the German army. After three years of service, he was given permission to study physics at the [[University of Berlin]], 1917–18, where [[Albert Einstein]] was a newly appointed professor. Carnap then attended the [[University of Jena]], where he wrote a thesis defining an [[axiom|axiomatic theory]] of [[space]] and [[time]]. The physics department said it was too philosophical, and Bruno Bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics. Carnap then wrote another thesis in 1921, with Bauch's supervision, on the theory of space in a more orthodox [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian style, and published as ''Der Raum'' (''Space'') in a supplemental issue of ''[[Kant-Studien]]'' (1922). 

Frege's course exposed him to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s work on logic and philosophy, which put a sense of the aims to his studies. He accepted the effort to surpass traditional philosophy with logical innovations that inform the sciences. He wrote a letter to Russell, who responded by copying by hand long passages from his ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' for Carnap's benefit, as neither Carnap nor his university could afford a copy of this epochal work. In 1924 and 1925, he attended seminars led by [[Edmund Husserl]],&lt;ref&gt;Smith, D. W., and Thomasson, Amie L. (eds.), 2005, ''Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 8 n. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and continued to write on physics from a [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] perspective.

Carnap discovered a kindred spirit when he met [[Hans Reichenbach]] at a 1923 conference. Reichenbach introduced Carnap to [[Moritz Schlick]], a professor at the [[University of Vienna]] who offered Carnap a position in his department, which Carnap accepted in 1926. Carnap thereupon joined an informal group of Viennese intellectuals that came to be known as the [[Vienna Circle]], directed largely by [[Moritz Schlick]] and including [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[Herbert Feigl]], with occasional visits by Hahn's student [[Kurt Gödel]]. When [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] visited Vienna, Carnap would meet with him. He (with Hahn and Neurath) wrote the 1929 manifesto of the Circle, and (with [[Hans Reichenbach]]) initiated the philosophy journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]''.

In February 1930 [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] lectured in Vienna, and during November 1930 Carnap visited Warsaw. On these occasions he learned much about Tarski's [[model theory|model theoretic]] method of [[semantics]]. [[Rose Rand]], another philosopher in the Vienna Circle, noted, "Carnap's conception of semantics starts from the basis given in Tarski's work but a distinction is made between logical and non-logical constants and between logical and factual truth... At the same time he worked with the concepts of intension and extension and took these two concepts as a basis of a new method of semantics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rand|first=Rose|title=Reading Notes and Summaries on Works by Rudolph Carnap, 1932 and Undated|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061817825.pdf|work=Rose Rand Papers|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Carnap was appointed Professor at the German [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. In 1933, [[W. V. Quine]] met Carnap in Prague and discussed the latter's work at some length. Thus began the lifelong mutual respect these two men shared, one that survived Quine's eventual forceful disagreements with a number of Carnap's philosophical conclusions.

Carnap, whose [[socialism|socialist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] beliefs put him at risk in Nazi Germany, emigrated to the United States in 1935 and became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1941. Meanwhile, back in Vienna, [[Moritz Schlick]] was murdered in 1936. From 1936 to 1952, Carnap was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]]. During the late 1930s, Carnap offered an assistant position in philosophy to [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], who accepted and became one of his most significant intellectual collaborator. Thanks partly to Quine's help, Carnap spent the years 1939–41 at Harvard, where he was reunited with Tarski. Carnap (1963) later expressed some irritation about his time at Chicago, where he and [[Charles W. Morris]] were the only members of the department committed to the primacy of science and logic. (Their Chicago colleagues included [[Richard McKeon]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], and Manley Thompson.) Carnap's years at Chicago were nonetheless very productive ones. He wrote books on [[semantics]] (Carnap 1942, 1943, 1956), [[modal logic]], and on the philosophical foundations of [[probability]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] (Carnap 1950, 1952).

After a stint at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], he joined the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|philosophy department at UCLA]] in 1954, [[Hans Reichenbach]] having died the previous year. He had earlier refused an offer of a similar job at the [[University of California]], because accepting that position required that he sign a [[loyalty oath]], a practice to which he was opposed on principle. While at [[UCLA]], he wrote on scientific knowledge, the [[analytic statement|analytic]] – [[synthetic statement|synthetic]] dichotomy, and the [[verification principle]]. His writings on [[thermodynamics]] and on the foundations of probability and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], were published posthumously as Carnap (1971, 1977, 1980).

Carnap taught himself [[Esperanto]] when he was 14 years of age, and remained sympathetic to it (Carnap 1963). He later attended the [[World Congress of Esperanto]] in 1908 and 1922, and employed the language while traveling.

Carnap had four children by his first marriage to Elizabeth Schöndube, which ended in divorce in 1929. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Ina Stöger, in 1933.&lt;ref name=DCDVlife /&gt; Ina committed suicide in 1964.

== Topics in the development of Carnap's philosophy ==
Below is an examination of the main topics in the evolution of the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap. It is not exhaustive, but it outlines Carnap’s main works and contributions to modern epistemology and philosophy of logic. 

=== PhD dissertation ===
From 1919 to 1921, Carnap worked on a doctoral thesis called “Der Raum. Ein Beitrag zur Wissenschaftslehre” (1922). In this dissertation on the philosophical foundations of geometry, Carnap tried to provide a logical basis for a theory of space and time in physics. Considering that Carnap was interested in pure mathematics, natural sciences and philosophy, his dissertation can be seen as an attempt to build a bridge between the different disciplines that are geometry, physics and philosophy. For Carnap thought that in many instances those disciplines use the same concepts, but with totally different meanings. The main objective of Carnap’s dissertation was to show that the inconsistencies between theories concerning space only existed because philosophers, as well as mathematicians and scientists, were talking about different things while using the same “space” word. Hence, Carnap characteristically argued that there had to be three separate notions of space. “Formal” space is space in the sense of mathematics: it is an abstract system of relations. “Intuitive” space is made of certain contents of intuition independent of single experiences. “Physical” space is made of actual spatial facts given in experience. The upshot is that those three kinds of “space” imply three different kinds of knowledge and thus three different kinds of investigations. It is interesting to note that it is in this dissertation that the main themes of Carnap’s philosophy appear, most importantly the idea that many philosophical contradictions appear because of a misuse of language, and a stress on the importance of distinguishing formal and material modes of speech.  

=== ''Der Logische Aufbau der Welt'' ===
From 1922 to 1925, Carnap worked on a book which became one of his major works, namely ''Der logische Aufbau der Welt'' (1928) (translated as “The logical structure of the world”, 1967). That achievement has become a landmark in modern epistemology and can be read as a forceful statement of the philosophical thesis of logical positivism. Indeed, the Aufbau suggests that epistemology, based on modern symbolic logic, is concerned with the logical analysis of scientific propositions, while science itself, based on experience, is the only source of knowledge of the external world, i.e. the world outside the realm of human perception. According to Carnap, philosophical propositions are statements about the language of science; they aren’t true or false, but merely consist of definitions and conventions about the use of certain concepts. In contrast, scientific propositions are factual statements about the external reality. They are meaningful because they are based on the perceptions of the senses. In other words, the truth or falsity of those propositions can be verified by testing their content with further observations.  

In the Aufbau, Carnap wants to display the logical and conceptual structure with which all scientific (factual) statements can be organized. Carnap gives the label “constitutional” to this epistemic-logical project. It is a constructive undertaking that systematizes scientific knowledge according to the notions of symbolic logic. Accordingly, the purpose of this constitutional system is to identify and discern different classes of scientific concepts and to specify the logical relations that link them. In the Aufbau, concepts are taken to denote objects, relations, properties, classes and states. Carnap argues that all concepts must be ranked over a hierarchy. In that hierarchy, all concepts are organized according to a fundamental arrangement where concepts can be reduced and converted to other basic ones. Carnap explains that a concept can be reduced to another when all sentences containing the first concept can be transformed into sentences containing the other. In other words, every scientific sentence should be translatable into another sentence such that the original terms have the same reference as the translated terms. Most significantly, Carnap argues that the basis of this system is psychological. Its content is the “immediately given”, which is made of basic elements, namely perceptual experiences. These basic elements consist of conscious psychological states of a single human subject. In the end, Carnap argues that his constitutional project demonstrates the possibility of defining and uniting all scientific concepts in a single conceptual system on the basis of a few fundamental concepts.    

=== Overcoming metaphysics ===
From 1928 to 1934, Carnap published papers (''Scheinprobleme in der Philosophie,'' 1928 – translated as “Pseudoproblems in Philosophy”, 1967) in which he appears overtly skeptical of the aims and methods of metaphysics, i.e. the traditional philosophy that finds its roots in mythical and religious thought. Indeed, he discusses how, in many cases, metaphysics is made of meaningless discussions of pseudo-problems. For Carnap, a pseudo-problem is a philosophical question which, on the surface, handles concepts that refer to our world while, in fact, these concepts do not actually denote real and attested objects. In other words, these pseudo-problems concern statements that do not, in any way, have empirical implications. They do not refer to states of affairs and the things they denote cannot be perceived. Consequently, one of Carnap’s main aim has been to redefine the purpose and method of philosophy. According to him, philosophy should not aim at producing any knowledge transcending the knowledge of science. In contrast, by analyzing the language and propositions of science, philosophers should define the logical foundations of scientific knowledge. Using symbolic logic, they should explicate the concepts, methods and justificatory processes that exist in science. 

Carnap believed that the difficulty with traditional philosophy lied in the use of concepts that are not useful for science. For Carnap, the scientific legitimacy of these concepts was doubtful, because the sentences containing them do not express facts. Indeed, a logical analysis of those sentences proves that they do not convey the meaning of states of affairs. In other words, theses sentences are meaningless. Carnap explains that to be meaningful, a sentence should be factual. It can be so, for one thing, by being based on experience, i.e. by being formulated with words relating to direct observations. For another, a sentence is factual if one can clearly state what are the observations that could confirm or disconfirm that sentence. After all, Carnap presupposes a specific criterion of meaning, namely the wittgensteinian principle of verifiability. Indeed, he requires, as a precondition of meaningfulness, that all sentences be verifiable, what implies that a sentence is meaningful only if there is a way to verify if it is true or false. To verify a sentence, one needs to expound the empirical conditions and circumstances that would establish the truth of the sentence. As a result, it is clear for Carnap that metaphysical sentences are meaningless. They include concepts like “god”, “soul” and “the absolute” that transcend experience and cannot be traced back or connected to direct observations. Because those sentences cannot be verified in any way, Carnap suggests that science, as well as philosophy, should neither consider nor contain them. 

=== The logical analysis of language ===
At that point in his career, Carnap attempted to develop a full theory of the logical structure of scientific language. This theory, exposed in ''Logische Syntax der Sprache'' (1934) (translated as “The logical syntax of language”, 1937) gives the foundations to his idea that scientific language has a specific formal structure and that its signs are governed by the rules of deductive logic. Moreover, the theory of logical syntax expounds a method with which one can talk about a language: it is a formal meta-theory about the pure forms of language. In the end, because Carnap argues that philosophy aims at the logical analysis of the language of science and thus is the logic of science, the theory of the logical syntax can be considered as a definite language and a conceptual framework for philosophy. 

The logical syntax of language is a formal theory. It is not concerned with the contextualized meaning or the truth-value of sentences. In contrast, it considers the general structure of a given language and explores the different structural relations that connect the elements of that language. Hence, by explaining the different operations that allow specific transformations within the language, the theory is a systematic exposition of the rules that operate within that language. In fact, the basic function of these rules is to provide the principles to safeguard coherence, to avoid contradictions and to deduce justified conclusions. It is to be noted that Carnap sees language as a calculus. This calculus is a systematic arrangement of symbols and relations. The symbols of the language are organized according to the class they belong to and it is through their combination that we can form sentences. The relations are different conditions under which a sentence can be said to follow, or to be the consequence, of another sentence. The definitions included in the calculus state the conditions under which a sentence can be considered of a certain type and how those sentences can be transformed. We can see the logical syntax as a method of formal transformation, i.e. a method for calculating and reasoning with symbols. 

It is in the ''logical syntax'' that Carnap introduces his notable principle of tolerance. This principle suggests that there is no moral in logic. When it comes to using a language, there is no good or bad, fundamentally true or false. In this perspective, the philosopher’s task is not to bring authoritative interdicts prohibiting the use of certain concepts. In contrast, philosophers should seek general agreements over the relevance of certain logical devices. According to Carnap, those agreements are possible only through the detailed presentation of the meaning and use of the expressions of a language. In other words, Carnap believes that every logical language is correct only if this language is supported by exact definitions and not by philosophical presumptions. It is to be noted that Carnap embraces a formal conventionalism. That implies that formal languages are constructed and that everyone is free to choose the language it finds more suited to his purpose. There should not be any controversy over which language is the correct language; what matters is agreeing over which language best suits a particular purpose. Carnap explains that the choice of a language should be guided according to the security it provides against logical inconsistency. Furthermore, practical elements like simplicity and fruitfulness in certain tasks influence the choice of a language. Clearly enough, the principle of tolerance was a sophisticated device introduced by Carnap to dismiss any form of dogmatism in philosophy.    

=== Inductive logic ===
After having considered problems in semantics, i.e. the theory of the concepts of meaning and truth (''Foundations of Logic and Mathematics,'' 1939; ''Introduction to Semantics,'' 1942; ''Formalization of Logic'', 1943), Carnap turned his attention to the subject of probability and inductive logic. His views on that subject are for the most part exposed in ''Logical foundations of probability'' (1950) where Carnap aims to give a sound logical interpretation of probability. Carnap thought that according to certain conditions, the concept of probability had to be interpreted as a purely logical concept. In this view, probability is a basic concept anchored in all inductive inferences, whereby the conclusion of every inference that holds without deductive necessity is said be more or less likely to be the case. In fact, Carnap claims that the problem of induction is a matter of finding a precise explanation of the logical relation that holds between a hypothesis and the evidence that supports it. An inductive logic is thus based on the idea that probability is a logical relation between two types of statements: the hypothesis (conclusion) and the premises (evidence). Accordingly, a theory of induction should explain how, by pure logical analysis, we can ascertain that certain evidence establishes a degree of confirmation strong enough to confirm a given hypothesis. 

Carnap was convinced that there was a logical as well as an empirical dimension in science. He believed that one had to isolate the experiential elements from the logical elements of a given body of knowledge. Hence, the empirical concept of frequency used in statistics to describe the general features of certain phenomena can be distinguished from the analytical concepts of probability logic that merely describe logical relations between sentences. For Carnap, the statistical and the logical concepts must be investigated separately. Having insisted on this distinction, Carnap defines two concepts of probability. The first one is logical and deals with the degree to which a given hypothesis is confirmed by a piece of evidence. It is the ''degree of confirmation''. The second is empirical, and relates to the long run rate of one observable feature of nature relative to another. It is the ''relative frequency.'' Statements belonging to the second concepts are about reality and describe states of affairs. They are empirical and, therefore, must be based on experimental procedures and the observation of relevant facts. On the contrary, statements belonging to the first concept do not say anything about facts. Their meaning can be grasped solely with an analysis of the signs they contain. They are analytical sentences, i.e. true by virtue of their logical meaning. Even though these sentences could refer to states of affairs, their meaning is given by the symbols and relations they contain. In other words, the probability of a conclusion is given by the logical relation it has to the evidence. The evaluation of the degree of confirmation of a hypothesis is thus a problem of meaning analysis. 

Clearly, the probability of a statement about relative frequency can be unknown; because it depends on the observation of certain phenomena, one may not possess the information needed to establish the value of that probability. Consequently, the value of that statement can be confirmed only if it is corroborated with facts. In contrast, the probability of a statement about the degree of confirmation could be unknown, in the sense that one may miss the correct logical method to evaluate its exact value. But, such a statement can always receive a certain logical value, given the fact that this value only depends on the meaning of its symbols.              

==Primary source materials==
The Carnap Papers consist of approximately 10,000 personal letters of correspondence. The papers were donated by his daughter, Hanna Carnap-Thost in 1974. Documents that contain financial, medical, and personal information are restricted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Guides to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System | accessdate = 2015-12-02  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were written over his entire life and career. Carnap used the mail regularly to discuss philosophical problems with hundreds of others. The most notable were: Herbert Feigl, Carl Gustav Hempel, Felix Kaufmann, Otto Neurath, and Moritz Schlick. Photographs are also part of the collection and were taken throughout his life. Family pictures and photographs of his peers and colleagues are also stored in the collection. Some of the correspondence is considered notable and consist of his student notes, his seminars with Frege, (describing the ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' and the logic in mathematics). Carnap's notes from Russell's seminar in Chicago, and notes he took from discussions with Tarski, Heisenberg, Quine, Hempel, Gödel, Jeffrey are part of the University of Pittsburgh's Archives and Collections.

'''''Scanners III: The Takeover''''' (also known as '''''Scanner Force''''' in [[United Kingdom|UK]]) is a 1992 science fiction horror film and second sequel to the film ''[[Scanners]]'', and the last film in the trilogy. It was directed by Christian Duguay. The film received mixed reception from fans and viewers, and is the least successful ''Scanners'' film to be released. Once again, this sequel has a different set of characters.

This film also features a few actors from ''[[Scanners II: The New Order]]''. For instance, Jason Cavalier from The New Order (with the exploding tumor) here plays a punk leader.

==Plot==

Helena Monet ([[Liliana Komorowska]]), a [[Scanners|Scanner]] is troubled by the painful side-effects of her telepathic powers. This drives her to try her adoptive father's untested, experimental drug called Eph-3 (pronounced "F3"), a variant of the drug Ephemerol prescribed to Scanners to help attenuate the myriad voices (representing the thoughts of people around them) which their natural, inborn telepathy otherwise forces them to hear. Her use of Eph-3 causes her to lose her sense of moral conscience, making her into a [[megalomaniac]]. She kills her father ([[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]]) and takes over his pharmaceutical company. Her long-lost adopted brother Alex, also a Scanner, is alerted to her dangerous behavior and attempts to stop her.

As her rise to power and desire for global dominance gains momentum, her brother must fend off the attackers whom she has sent after him and ultimately defeat his sister to save the world.

==Release==
The film was released on VHS in the United States by [[Republic Pictures]], in Canada by Malofilm Home Video and in the UK by First Independent Films. A DVD version of the film is included in the Scanners Trilogy box set released only in the EU by [[Starz Home Entertainment]]. This box also includes the first and second Scanner film. Shout! Factory's new horror label Scream Factory released a Region 1 DVD/Blu-ray edition on September 10, 2013.

The '''tall poppy syndrome''' describes aspects of a culture where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, strung up or criticised because they have been classified as superior to their peers. The term has been used in cultures of the [[English-speaking world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20170607-why-are-australians-so-laid-back|title=Why are Australians so laid back?|publisher=BBC|first=Miranda|last=Luby|date=12 June 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/opinion/the-end-of-the-australian-dream.html|title=The End of the Australian Dream?|publisher=New York Times|first=Lisa|last=Pryor|date=1 May 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/carol-vallone-mitchell/a-cautionary-tale-for-tal_b_11266084.html|title=A Cautionary Tale for Tall Poppies and Women Leaders|publisher=HuffPost|first=Carol Vallone|last=Mitchell|date=1 August 2016|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwianarama.co.nz/tall-poppy-syndrome/|title=Tall Poppy Syndrome|publisher=Kiwianarama|date=7 April 2009|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/how-america-turned-against-smart-kids/|title=How America Turned Against Smart Kids|publisher=The American Conservative|first=Pratik|last=Chougule|date=22 April 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Lawrence Alma-Tadema 11.jpeg|thumb|''Tarquinius Superbus'' by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], depicting the king receiving a [[laurel wreath]]; the poppies in the foreground refer to the "tall poppy" allegory]]

The concept originates from accounts in [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']] (Book 5, 92f), [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (1284a), and [[Livy]]'s [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|''Ab Urbe Condita Libri'']], Book I.

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Periander]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; had sent a herald to [[Thrasybulus of Miletus|Thrasybulus]] and inquired in what way he would best and most safely govern his city. Thrasybulus led the man who had come from Periander outside the town, and entered into a sown field. As he walked through the wheat, continually asking why the messenger had come to him from [[Cypselus]], he kept cutting off all the tallest ears of wheat which he could see, and throwing them away, until he had destroyed the best and richest part of the crop. Then, after passing through the place and speaking no word of counsel, he sent the herald away. When the herald returned to Cypselus, Periander desired to hear what counsel he brought, but the man said that Thrasybulus had given him none. The herald added that it was a strange man to whom he had been sent, a madman and a destroyer of his own possessions, telling Periander what he had seen Thrasybulus do. Periander, however, understood what had been done, and perceived that Thrasybulus had counselled him to slay those of his townsmen who were outstanding in influence or ability; with that he began to deal with his citizens in an evil manner.|Herodotus, ''The Histories'', Book 5, 92-f}}

The specific reference to poppies occurs in Livy's account of the tyrannical [[Roman Kingdom|Roman king]], [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. He is said to have received a messenger from his son [[Sextus Tarquinius]] asking what he should do next in [[Gabii]], since he had become all-powerful there. Rather than answering the messenger verbally, Tarquin went into his garden, took a stick, and symbolically swept it across his garden, thus cutting off the heads of the tallest [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]] that were growing there. The messenger, tired of waiting for an answer, returned to Gabii and told Sextus what he had seen. Sextus realised that his father wished him to put to death all of the most eminent people of Gabii, which he then did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livius|first=Titus|title=The History of Rome, Vol. I |url=http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Liv1His.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=54&amp;division=div2|publisher=Electronic Text Center|location=University of Virginia Library|chapter=The Earliest Legends: 1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest English-language example of Tall Poppies being used as a metaphor for notables may be found in [[Roger L'Estrange]]'s newspaper, ''[[The Observator]]'', in 1710. One party to a dialogue relates the tale of Tarquin, and later observes approvingly of his Royalist allies, "If you'll have but a little Patience, you may see them make very noble Efforts towards striking off the Heads of the tall Poppies."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observator'' (London), 6 December 1710, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1835, the metaphor had crossed the Atlantic to the United States,{{Clarify|post-text=(see [[Talk:Tall poppy syndrome#Usage in the US|talk]])|date=March 2014}} where the ''Torch Light'' of [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], observed of then-Congressman [[Francis Thomas]], "Politically, Mr. Thomas and his friends are imitating the example of Tarquin and Sextius &amp;ndash; indeed it is said some of the tall poppies of our county are in danger of decapitation."&lt;ref&gt;''Torch Light'' (Hagerstown, Maryland), 1 October 1835, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a similar legend about the king [[Ramiro II of Aragon]], who asked for some advice to his old master to deal with some nobles who questioned his power. His master did not say anything but just cut the heads of the tallest roses in the garden. This legend is known as the "[[Bell of Huesca]]".

== Usage in Australia ==
{{see also|Culture of Australia}}
The phrase can be found as early as 1864 in a controversy over the awarding of a knighthood:

{{quote|It is more difficult to find a similar recommendation for such a dignity as the Order of the Garter. But then it derives a collateral value from the fact that it is always given either to people of singular distinction, or else to men whose social position is sufficient to make them formidable to the Minister of the day. It is a kind of public proclamation that you are a tall poppy and that, as in these days your head cannot be struck off, it is worth while to buy you.&lt;ref&gt;''Empire'' (Sydney, NSW : 1850–1875, newspaper), 8 December 1864, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Again in 1904 in a report of a debate in the Federal Parliament:

{{quote|Senator. O'Keefe&amp;ndash; He regarded the appointment of a High Commissioner as necessary.

Sir William Zeal&amp;ndash;    Another tall poppy.

Senator. O'Keefe&amp;ndash;  Some tall poppies were necessary."&lt;ref&gt;''The Examiner'' (Launceston, Tasmania), 10 March 1904, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1930 one may read:

{{quote|Unquestionably one of the evils of Government in Australia and Britain is the appalling cost of administration, from the tall poppy at £3,000 per annum to the toiler at £260.&lt;ref&gt;''The Townsville Daily Bulletin'', 8 October 1930, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase has been in more common use since [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], Premier of [[New South Wales]], described his egalitarian policies as "cutting the heads off tall poppies" in 1931. "Mr. Lang made some of the tall poppies suffer who could be made to suffer."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Canberra Times]]'', 26 July 1934, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; "The tall poppies of the party had dragged Mr. Lang's name into the debate to cloud the issue."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 12 August 1935, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase experienced a revival with the publication of Susan Mitchell's best-selling book ''Tall Poppies'' in 1984 in which Mitchell interviewed nine successful Australian women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11947509|title=Tall poppies nine successful Australian women talk to Susan Mitchell|last=Mitchell|first=Susan|date=1984|publisher=Ringwood, Victoria, Australia Penguin Books|isbn=0140072101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Australian definition, [[Peter Hartcher]] of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' writes, "(Australian) citizens know that some among them will have more power and money than others... But according to the unspoken national ethos, no Australian is permitted to assume that he or she is better than any other Australian. How is this enforced? By the prompt corrective of levelling derision. It has a name—The "Tall Poppy Syndrome". The tallest flowers in the field will be cut down to the same size as all the others. This is sometimes misunderstood... It isn't success that offends Australians. It's the affront committed by anyone who starts to put on superior airs."{{cn|date=March 2017}}

== Usage in Britain ==
Prior to becoming British Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]] explained her philosophy to an American audience as "let your poppies grow tall." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Comfort|first=Nicholas|title=Brewer's Politics|year=1993|publisher=Cassell|isbn=0-304-34085-5|page=599}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ clarify | date = August 2015 | reason = The quote from Margaret Thatcher given was used in the US not in Britain.

Additionally, there are comments in the Talk section of this article that dispute whether TPS is actually a significant cultural characteristic present in the UK meaning use of this quote by a famous UK politician may mislead some readers.}}

The quote was made in the United States for political purposes and any assertion that the United Kingdom itself has a culture of tall poppy syndrome in the [[crab mentality]] sense like Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref name=SpaceyWaikato&gt;{{cite journal| url= https://www.srl.to/u5e2dNha |last=Spacey| first=S. |year= 2015| title= Crab Mentality, Cyberbullying and 'Name and Shame' Rankings| journal= In Press| publisher= Waikato University| location= New Zealand| accessdate= 19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed.&lt;ref name=SpaceyLinkedIn&gt;{{citation| url= https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-begging-cyberbullied-your-linkedin-profile-simon-spacey | last=Spacey | first=S. | title= Are you "Begging to be Cyberbullied" on LinkedIn? | accessdate= 15 November 2015  | date = 15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
Belief in the strength of this cultural phenomenon, and the degree to which it represents a negative trait, is to some extent influenced by politics. Tall poppy syndrome is related to what some call "the politics of envy".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Some commentators{{Who|date=May 2016}} have argued that tall poppy syndrome is a universal phenomenon, that is more common in some cultures. The concepts of ''janteloven'' or "[[Law of Jante]]", in [[Scandinavia]], and ''A kent yer faither'' (English: ''I knew your father'') in Scotland, are very similar. Similar phenomena are said to exist in the Netherlands (where it is called ''maaiveldcultuur''). In the United States, [[Benjamin Franklin Fairless]], president of United States Steel Corporation (1950), criticised such behaviour when he stated: "You cannot strengthen one by weakening another; and you cannot add to the stature of a dwarf by cutting off the leg of a giant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bartleby.com/73/142.html|chapter=142. Benjamin Franklin Fairless (1890–1962). |title=Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations|year=1989|editor-first=Suzy |editor-last=Platt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zero-sum prestige ===
Some sociologists, notably [[Max Weber]], believe that in certain social groups, the acquisition of prestige and power is a [[zero-sum game]], and this situation may provide a rationalisation for the dislike of "tall poppies".&lt;ref name="ethics"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801000000*/http://www.ethicsofinterpersonalrelationships.com/Ethics_Chapter_13.pdf | title=Ethics of Interpersonal Relationships | publisher=Karnac Books Ltd | last1=Firestone| first1=Robert W. |last2= Catlett| first2= Joyce | year=2009 | pages=346 | isbn=978-1-85575-605-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such groups, there is only a limited amount of prestige for its members to share in and only a fixed quantity of attention, authority and material resources that its members can give to each other. Status is a relative value, so for someone to rise in status, another person must fall. A person who is more prestigious is an obstacle to another person's rise simply by being more prestigious, and a person who suddenly rises is an outright threat to the other's current status. Humiliating or [[sabotaging]] a popular member of the group will lower that person's status and thus make it possible for the aggressor to supplant him in the group hierarchy.

This zero-sum pattern can be found in small groups characterised by fixed hierarchies and where there is little movement in or out of the group. Examples include poor American communities and some street gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/papers/baumeistersmartboden1996%5B1%5D.pdf |format=PDF |title=Relation of Threatened Egotism to Violence and Aggression: The Dark Side of High Self-Esteem | first1= Roy F. |last1= Baumeister | first2= Joseph M. |last2= Boden| first3= Laura |last3= Smart|publisher=American Psychological Association; republished at Emotionalcompetency.com |journal= Psychological Review | volume= 103 | year= 1996 | number= 1| pages= 5–33 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.103.1.5 | pmid=8650299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Roy |last= Baumeister |title= Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty| page= 167 | year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related concept is that of a [[crab mentality]] in which successful members of a disadvantaged community are seen as undermining the standing of other community members. The image is drawn from the observation that a crab clawing its way out of a bucket (or barrel in other versions) is pulled back down by its fellows.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Impact ==
Recent research performed at [[University of Waikato]] in New Zealand shows that a culture of tall poppy syndrome may result in a reduction in average performance of up to 20% for an organisation and explains how electronic [[cyberbullying]] can be considered a modern extension to the physical assassinations of King Tarquin's day.&lt;ref name=SpaceyWaikato/&gt;

Test anxiety can also be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, situational anxiety or evaluation anxiety.

==Signs and symptoms==

Researchers believe that feelings of anxiety arise to prepare a person for threats.&lt;ref name="DePhil"&gt;DePhil, M.B., Brilot, B., Nettle, D. (2011). Anxiety: An Evolutionary Approach. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 56(12):707-715&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, anxiety symptoms are distributed along a continuum and different symptom levels of anxiety predict outcomes. Responses consist of increased heart rate, stress hormone secretion, restlessness, vigilance, and fear of a potentially dangerous environment.&lt;ref name="DePhil"/&gt; Anxiety prepares the body physically, cognitively, and behaviourally to detect and deal with threats to survival. As a result, a person’s body begins to hyperventilate to allow more oxygen to enter the bloodstream, divert blood to muscles, and sweat to cool the skin.&lt;ref name="DePhil"/&gt; In  individuals, the degree to which an anxiety response is developed is based on the probability of bad things happening in the environment and the individual’s ability to cope with them. In the case of test taking, this might be a failing exam grade that prevents the student from being accepted to a post-secondary institution. A person's beliefs about their own competencies are a form of self-knowledge, which plays an important role in analyzing situations that might be threatening. When a person has feelings of low competence about their abilities they are likely to anticipate negative outcomes such as failure, under uncertain conditions. Thus, evaluative situations including tests and exams, are perceived as more threatening by students who have low competencies.&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt;

There is a difference between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and test anxiety. GAD is characterized by "trait anxiety" which results in a person experiencing high levels of stress across a wide range of situations. In contrast, people with test anxiety have a "state anxiety" which results in high levels of nervousness specific to testing.&lt;ref&gt;sady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties (pp. 7-26). New York, NY: Peter Lang&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms of test anxiety can range from moderate to severe. "Students who exhibit moderate symptoms are still able to perform relatively well on exams. Other students with severe anxiety will often experience [[panic attacks]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Test Anxiety Symptoms|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/test-anxiety-symptoms.htm|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common physical symptoms include: headache, upset stomach, feeling of fear, feeling of dread, shortness of breath, sweating, pacing or fidgeting, crying, racing thoughts and blanking out.

During states of excitement or stress, the body releases [[adrenaline]]. Adrenaline is known to cause physical symptoms that accompany test anxiety, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and rapid breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyness|first=D'Arcy|title=Test Anxiety|url= http://kidshealth.org/teen/school_jobs/school/test_anxiety.html|work=The Nemours Foundation.|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases having adrenaline is a good thing. It is helpful when dealing with stressful situations, ensuring alertness and preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen S., Kozlovsky N., Matar M.A., Kaplan Z., Zohar J. and Cohen H. (2012). Post-exposure sleep deprivation facilitates correctly-timed interactions between glucocorticoid and adrenergic systems which attenuate traumatic stress responses. ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' 37; 2388–2404&lt;/ref&gt; But for some people the symptoms are difficult or impossible to handle, making it impossible to focus on tests.

Test anxiety consists of:

*'''Physiological overarousal''' – often termed ''[[emotionality]]''.  [[Somatic symptom disorder|Somatic]] signs include headaches, stomach aches, nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating, shortness of breath, light-headedness or fainting, rapid heartbeat and dry mouth. Test anxiety can also lead to panic attacks, in which the student may have a sudden intense fear, difficulty breathing, and extreme discomfort.
*'''Worry and dread''' – maladaptive cognitions. This includes catastrophic expectations of gloom and doom, fear of failure, random thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, self-condemnation, negative self-talk, frustration and comparing oneself unfavorably to others.
*'''Cognitive/Behavioral''' – poor concentration, "going blank" or "freezing," confusion, and poor organization.  The inability to concentrate leads to impaired performance on tests. Fidgeting during or outright avoidance of the test. Students often report "blanking out" even though they have studied sufficiently for the test.&lt;ref name="New York Times Company"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Test Anxiety Symptoms|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/test-anxiety-symptoms.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Emotional''' – low self-esteem, depression, anger, and a feeling of hopelessness.&lt;ref name="New York Times Company"/&gt;

==Causes==
Research shows that parental pressure is associated with greater worry, test irrelevant thoughts, and stronger bodily symptoms relating to anxiety during a test.&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt;

Other causes of test anxiety may include fear of failure, [[procrastination]], and previous poor test performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ADAA|title=Test Anxiety|url=http://www.adaa.org/living-with-anxiety/children/test-anxiety|work=Anxiety Disorder Association of America|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, characteristics of the test environment such as: nature of the task, difficulty, atmosphere, time constraints, examiner characteristics, mode of administration and physical setting can affect the level of anxiousness felt by the student.&lt;ref name= "Salend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt; Researchers Putwain &amp; Best (2011),&lt;ref name="Best"&gt;Putwain D.W., Best, N. (2011). Fear appeals in the primary classroom: effects on test anxiety and test grade. Learning and Individual Differences, 21 580-584&lt;/ref&gt; examined test performance among elementary children when the teacher put pressure on the students in an attempt to create a more high stress environment. Their findings showed that students performed worse in high threat situations and experienced more test anxiety and worrisome thoughts than when in a low threat environment.

Test anxiety is known to develop into a vicious cycle. After experiencing test anxiety on one test, the student may become so fearful of it happening again they become more anxious and upset than they would normally, or even than they experienced on the previous test. If the cycle continues without acknowledgement, or the student seeking help, the student may begin to feel helpless in the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Causes of Test Anxiety|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/mentalhealth/a/test-anxiety-causes.htm|work=The New York Times Company|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who experience test anxiety often have parents or siblings who have test anxiety or other types of anxiety. Anxiety does seem to have some genetic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Diana|title=Overcoming College Anxiety|url=http://www.everydayhealth.com/college-health/overcoming-college-test-anxiety.aspx|work=Everyday Health|accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological causes:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; During times of stress the body releases a hormone called adrenaline that helps prepare for what is about to happen. Generally this adrenaline discharge is a good thing, but in some people the symptoms of nerves can be so strong that it does not allow them to concentrate on the tests.

Mental causes

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In addition to the biological causes are the mental causes, one of the most influential is the students' expectations, if the student goes to the exam with the mentality that it will go wrong, is much more likely to feel anxiety before and during the exam which will lead to poor performance in the tests.

===Diagnosis===

Test anxiety can be diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, under the classification of ''social phobia.''&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;
Social phobias are characterized by ''a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur''. In order to be diagnosed as suffering from a social phobia, the DSM-IV states that the individual must present four different factors.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

*Must show an immediate anxiety response when exposed to the feared social or performance situation.
*Must show various attempts to avoid social or performance situation, or sometimes endure it but with extreme fear. 
*Must experience a  disruption to normal activities due to the avoidance or fear associated with the situation
*Must have experienced the symptoms for at least six months.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

Other variables related to test anxiety are:

*[[Obsessive compulsive disorder]]s
*Perfectionist tendencies and unrealistic expectations
*Negative [[self-esteem]], self-statements, and criticism
*Poor motivation or lack of confidence
*[[Stereotype threat]]
*Inadequate study and test-taking skills
*Poor eating, sleeping and exercising habits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health, Exercise, Diet, Rest, Self-Image, Motivation, and Attitudes|url=http://www.muskingum.edu/~cal/database/general/physiopsyc.html|publisher=Muskingum College|accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed |date=June 2016}}

==Theories==

Anxiety is defined as the "psychological mechanism whereby the current intensification of a dangerous drive results in the elicitation of defenses."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenwald, G.C (1961). The assessment of anxiety in psychological experimentation: a theoretical reformulation and test. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62(3): 666-673&lt;/ref&gt; George Mandler and Seymour Sarason (1952), developed the theory that anxiety present in testing situations is an important determinate of test performance.  Individuals that become highly anxious during tests typically perform more poorly on tests than low-test anxious persons, especially when tests are given under stressful evaluative conditions such as a post-secondary exam. The feelings of forgetfulness, or drawing a "blank" are developed because of anxiety-produced interference between relevant responses and irrelevant responses generated from the person’s anxious state. The difference in performance of a high-anxious test taker compared to a low-anxious test taker is largely due to the difference in their ability to focus on the tasks required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wine | first1 = J | year = 1971 | title = Test anxiety and direction of attention | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 92–104 | doi=10.1037/h0031332| pmid = 4937878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A low-anxious test taker is able to focus greater attention on the tasks required of them while taking the test, while a high-anxious test taker is focused on their internal self, and the anxiety they are feeling. Anxious test takers do not perform adequately on the test as their attention is divided between themselves and the test. Therefore, students with high test anxiety are unable to focus their full attention on the test. Furthermore, anxiousness is evoked when a student believes that the evaluative situation, such as an assessment, exceeds his or her intellectual, motivational, and social capabilities.&lt;ref name= "Putwain"&gt;Putwain, D.W., Woods, K.A., Symes, W. (2010). Personal and situational predictors of test anxiety of students in post-compulsory education. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 80, 137-160&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Liebert and Morris (1967) analyzed the structure of test anxiety given on two distinct factors: ''Cognitive Test Anxiety'' and ''Emotionality''.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; '''''Emotionality''''' means that the individual shows high levels of several different symptoms related to test anxiety that can be seen through physiological responses experienced during situations where they are being evaluated; such as an exam.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; Some of the physiological manifestations include: increased galvanic skin response and heart rate, dizziness, nausea, or feelings of panic.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; There is evidence that emotionality is a distinct part of test anxiety; however, it can be seen that when an individual displays high emotionality it means that it is mostly associated with declining performance, but only when the individual is also experiencing high levels of worry.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt;

The other factor mentioned is '''''Cognitive Test Anxiety''''', also known as worry. It is mostly composed of the individuals cognitive reactions to situations where they are being evaluated, in the times prior to, during, and after those tasks.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt; Some of the thoughts that individuals with high cognitive test anxiety are constantly dealing with are comparing self performance to peers, considering the consequences of failure, low levels of confidence in performance, excessive worry about grades, feeling that they are unprepared for tests, and loss of self-worth.&lt;ref name="Cassady &amp; Johnson" /&gt;

Researchers Putwain, Woods &amp; Symes (2010), found that a low academic self-concept was associated with higher worry and tension about their abilities to do well on a test. A student's metacognitive beliefs play an important role in the maintenance of negative self-beliefs.&lt;ref name="Putwain"/&gt;

Anxiety reactions can be generalized from previous experiences to testing situations.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. &amp; Sarson, S. B. (1952). A study of anxiety and learning. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 47, 166-173&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, anticipations of punishment or loss of status and esteem manifest anxiety responses. As well, the presence of an audience can debilitate the performance of high anxious test takers and increase the performance of low anxious test takers. Persons who score high on anxiety scales tend to describe themselves in negative, self-devaluing terms. Highly anxious test takers also blame themselves for their failure significantly more than low anxious test takers.

The study of the relationship between  anxiety and performance can be understood by using the '''Yerkes-Dodson Law,''' where one can see the facilitating and debilitating effects of arousal on performance as an inverted "U".&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; 
An example of this correlation can be seen in terms of a child taking a test where the degree of arousal or anxiety that the child portrays can be seen as beneficial to the performance. Though, if the child doesn't have a feeling or fear or failure or some sort of encouragement to perform well on the test, then the child is unlikely to put the necessary effort into preparing or being motivated when taking the test and so he or she will not perform to their fullest potential.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

However, if before or during a test a child's level of anxiety is above the optimum level, they may also fail to demonstrate their true abilities.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Under these circumstances fear of the actual test may disrupt preparation and cause a great amount of distress during the test that it is more than likely to impair their performance.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

===Attentional theories===
There are two main groups of attentional theories that attempt to explain compromised performance in pressured situations.&lt;ref name = DeCaro&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://hpl.uchicago.edu/Publications/Choking%20Under%20Pressure%20Multiple%20Routes%20to%20Skill%20Failure.pdf | title=Choking under pressure: multiple routes to skill failure. |vauthors=DeCaro MS, Thomas RD, Albert NB, Beilock SL | journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |date=August 2011 | volume=140 | issue=3 | pages=390–406 | doi=10.1037/a0023466| pmid=21574739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of theories are the ''explicit monitoring theories''. They state that when a person is expected to perform a specific skill, the pressure may cause an increased self-consciousness and inward focus, which can disrupt their ability to successfully perform that task.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Thinking about step-by-step procedures can inhibit one’s ability to execute a task.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt; For example, a study by R. Gray found that baseball players put into the high-pressure condition had increased errors, and an increased ability to recall details like the direction their bat was moving.  This indicates that the pressured players were monitoring themselves more, which impacted their ability to successfully hit the ball.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt;

A second group of theories are the ''distraction theories''. These theories states that high-pressure environments create a dual-task situation, in which the person’s attention is divided between the task at hand and unhelpful thoughts about the situation and possible negative consequences of poor performance.&lt;ref name = interplay&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/ramirezg/CH05.pdf On the interplay of emotion and cognitive control: Implications for enhancing academic achievement.]  Beilock, Sian L. Ramirez, Gerardo ; In: The psychology of learning and motivation (Vol 55): Cognition in education. Mestre, Jose P. (Ed.); Ross, Brian H. (Ed.); San Diego, CA, US: Elsevier Academic Press, Vol 55, 2011. pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt; 
Attention is an important part of [[working memory]],&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; which is the system that actively holds several pieces of relevant information in the mind while inhibiting irrelevant information.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Working memory has a limited capacity, and the addition of stress and anxiety reduces the resources available to focus on relevant information.&lt;ref name = Revlin&gt;Revlin, Russell. Cognition: Theory and Practice. New York, NY: Worth, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations in which individuals need to concentrate their attention on a specific task, emotional stimuli can divert their attention to a greater degree than non-emotional stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192286/pdf/nihms318701.pdf | title=Attentional capture by emotional stimuli is preserved in patients with amygdala lesions | author=Richard M.

Furthermore, test anxious persons have been found to bias their attention towards threatening and anxiety related stimuli more than nonemotional stimuli.&lt;ref name = Baddeley2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0030029|title=Working memory and emotion: Ruminations on a theory of depression|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=17|pages=20–27|year=2013|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|citeseerx=10.1.1.400.9070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research has accordingly found that tasks that rely heavily on working memory are the ones that suffer the most during pressure.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Shortfalls in performance that are caused by test anxiety seem to be related to the extent to which the student has full access to their [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Test anxiety and Working Memory | author=Ju Hyun Lee | journal=Journal of Experimental Education | year=1999 | volume=67 | issue=3 | pages=218–240 | doi=10.1080/00220979909598354|jstor = 20152597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing these two theories in the context of academic performance, a majority of work supports distraction theories.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; One reason for this is that many of the skills performed in the classroom require heavy demands on working memory.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; However, there are different kinds of pressure situations. There is ''monitoring pressure'', in which an individual’s performance is impacted due to the presence of an audience, and ''outcome pressure'', in which an individual’s performance is influenced by the consequences of the testing results.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt; In a study, DeCaro ''et al.'' found that performance on a rule-based task, that relies heavily on working memory, was impaired by outcome pressure, but not monitoring pressure, whereas performance on an information-integration task, which does not require attentional control, was hurt by monitoring pressure, but not outcome pressure.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt; These findings indicate that  performance is compromised in different ways depending on the type of task, and the types of pressure, and that both theories can be correct.&lt;ref name = DeCaro/&gt;

====Attentional control====
[[File:Baddley's Model of Working Memory.png|thumbnail|Schematic of the four elements of Baddeley's model of working memory.]]
[[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]] ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, M. W., Santos, R., Derekshan, N., &amp; Calvo, M. G. (2007). Anxiety and cognitive performance: Attentional Control Theory. Emotion, 7(2), 336–352.&lt;/ref&gt; elaborate upon the distraction theories and propose the attentional control theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.k-state.edu/psych/research/documents/Rai_et_al_2010-online_Effects_of_Stress_and_WM_Capacity_on_FL_Readers_Inferential_Proc_Durin.pdf | title=Effects of Stress and Working Memory Capacity on Foreign Language Readers' Inferential Processing During Comprehension |author1=Manpreet K.

Cook | journal=Language Learning |date=March 2011 | volume=61 | issue=1 | pages=187–218 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2010.00592.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory uses [[Baddeley's model of working memory]] to explain the effects of anxiety on working memory and on performance.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; In Baddeley's theory, working memory (WM) consists of four components, one of them the [[central executive]] that has a number of tasks such as coordination of the temporary stores of phonological and visual information ([[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 | last1 = Baddeley | first1 = A.D. | year = 2000 | title = The episodic buffer: A new component of working memory? | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 11| pages = 417–423 | pmid=11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attentional control theory assumes that anxiety primarily affects attentional control, which is a key function of the central executive.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; Attentional control is the balance between the two attentional systems, the ''goal-directed system'', influenced by the individual's goals, and the ''stimulus-driven system'', influenced by salient stimuli.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; According to the attentional control theory, anxiety disrupts the balance between these two systems. The stimulus-driven system becomes stronger at the expense of the goal-directed system, thereby impairing the efficiency of the inhibition and shifting functions of the central executive.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt;

In support of this theory, there is strong evidence that anxiety largely impairs processing efficiency rather than performance effectiveness.&lt;ref name = Derakshan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1027/1016-9040.14.2.168|title=Anxiety, Processing Efficiency, and Cognitive Performance|journal=European Psychologist|volume=14|issue=2|pages=168–176|year=2009|last1=Derakshan|first1=Nazanin|last2=Eysenck|first2=Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performance effectiveness refers to the quality of performance whereas processing efficiency refers to the amount of resources used to attain an effective performance.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; There is also evidence that anxiety impairs both the inhibition and the shifting function.&lt;ref name = Derakshan/&gt; Therefore, this theory suggests that students high in test anxiety will have to allocate more resources to the task at hand than non-test anxiety students in order to achieve the same results.&lt;ref name = Mowbray/&gt;

In general, people with higher working memory capacity do better on academic tasks, but this changes when people are under acute pressure.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; [[Sian Beilock]] ''et al.'' found that pressure led individuals with a high working memory capacity to perform worse on a complicated task, whereas individuals with a low WM capacity got the same low results with or without pressure. This was because people with high WM could use more better but more demanding problem solving strategies in the low pressure condition, which they had to abandon in the high pressure condition. The low WM people never used these demanding strategies in the first place.&lt;ref name = interplay/&gt; Evidence for similar working memory effects in children has also been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1111/bjep.12027 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | year = 2013 | title = The effect of pressure on high- and low-working-memory students: An elaboration of the choking under pressure hypothesis | url = | journal = British Journal of Educational Psychology| volume =  84| issue = 2| pages = 1–13 | pmid=24164334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that trait anxiety might have different effects on working memory than state or acute pressure situations comes from Johnson ''et al.'' who found individuals' performances on a task showed a decrease in accuracy due to trait anxiety for individuals with low or average WM capacity, but did not significantly decrease for individuals with high WM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10615800802291277|pmid=18785033|title=Individuals lower in working memory capacity are particularly vulnerable to anxiety's disruptive effect on performance|journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping|volume=22|issue=2|pages=201–213|year=2009|last1=Johnson|first1=Dan R.|last2=Gronlund|first2=Scott D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement scales==

Early scales, by authors such as [[Charles Spielberger]], tended to focus on physiological and somatic features and on worry, commonly referred to as ''emotionality'',&lt;ref&gt;cf Charles Spielberger&lt;/ref&gt; while more recent offerings, such as that by Cassady &amp; Johnson, emphasize cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Cassady2001"&gt;Cassady, J. &amp; Johnson, R. (2001). Cognitive test anxiety and academic performance. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 27, 270–295.&lt;/ref&gt; "Test anxiety" for these authors consists of physiological and mental processes, and impaired test performance is seen as the result.

The ''Children's Test Anxiety Questionnaire'' is specifically designed to measure test anxiety in children 8–12 years of age. It provides scores for three dimensions of test anxiety: "worrisome thoughts concerning failure (i.e. 'when I take tests, I worry about failing'), automatic reactions concerning students' general and specific somatic indications of anxiety (i.e. 'when I take tests, my heart beats fast'), and off-task behaviours concerning nervous habits and distracting behaviours (i.e. 'when I take tests, I play with my pencil')" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10615800412331292606|title=Measuring test anxiety in children: Scale development and internal construct validation|journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping|volume=17|issue=3|pages=227–240|year=2004|last1=Wren|first1=Douglas G.|last2=Benson|first2=Jeri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Test Anxiety Inventory for Children and Adolescent'' (TAICA) is a way to measure and assess test anxiety in children and adolescents in Grades 4 through 12. Those individuals who are being assessed rate their responses on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never true about me) to 5 (always true about me). The TAICA is a 45-item self-report measure which consists of four sub scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lowe|first1=Patricia A.|last2=Lee|first2=Steven W.|last3=Witteborg|first3=Kristin M.|last4=Prichard|first4=Keri W.|last5=Luhr|first5=Megan E.|last6=Cullinan|first6=Christopher M.|last7=Mildren|first7=Bethany A|last8=Raad|first8=Jennifer M.|last9=Cornelius|first9=Rebecca A.|last10=Janik|first10=Melissa|title=Examination of the Psychometric Properties of a New Multidimensional Measure of Test Anxiety Among Elementary and Secondary School Students|journal=Psychoeducational Assessment|date=September 2008|volume=26|issue=3|pages=215–230|doi=10.1177/0734282907303760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Cognitive Obstruction/Inattention subscale assesses memory and attention difficulties and obstructed cognitions associated with test anxiety
*Physiological Hyperarousal subscale measures physical symptoms associated with the test-taking process.
*Social Humiliation subscale measures fear associated with failing a test and being belittled or ridiculed by significant others
*Worry subscale assesses negative thoughts and worries that adversely affect test performance.

==Treatment ==
Medication is not recommended to treat test anxiety; instead, standard suggestions include sleep, proper nutrition, exercise, meditation, studying without stress, and enacting habits to reduce stress during the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sawchuk |first1=Craig |title=Test anxiety: Can it be treated? |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/expert-answers/test-anxiety/faq-20058195 |website=Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Downs |first1=Cecilia |title=Managing Test Anxiety |url=https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/support/counseling-and-psychological-services/index.php?q=managing-test-anxiety |website=Brown University Counseling and Psychological Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Management===
To gain an accurate assessment of student comprehension, instructors should be concerned with minimizing the effects of test anxiety. Instructors might offer "second chances" post test, familiarize students with test format and grading scheme, and lower the impact of any one test.&lt;ref&gt;Wilbert J. Mckeachie and Marilla Svinicki's "Teaching Tips" 12th edition, pg. 110;&lt;/ref&gt; If students have greater confidence in their test-taking skills, they are more likely to be comfortable and relaxed when the testing does occur. Having an intentional thinking strategy should help student performance improve.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

For some individuals, poor academic performance is due to skill deficits, which could include problems in encoding (learning),rehearsal (study skills) or retrieval during a test (test-taking strategies).&lt;ref&gt;Damer, D.E., Melendres, L.T (2011). Tackling Test Anxiety: A groups for college students. The Journal for Specialists in Group Work, 36(3):163-177&lt;/ref&gt; Skill deficits may lead to poor performance directly (failure to adequately learn the material) or indirectly (awareness of being ill-prepared causes anxiety that, in turn, leads to poor performance). Therefore, the most effective interventions are those that combine skill-focused strategies (i.e. study skills training, test-taking skills) with cognitive (i.e. cognitive restructuring) or behavioural approaches (i.e. relaxation training, systematic desensitization).&lt;ref&gt;Ergene, T. (2003). Effective interventions on test anxiety reduction. School Psychology International, 24, 313–328&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students also need to stay healthy in order to be able to deal with stress and anxiety. They need to eat healthy, and get enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-well-to-help-manage-anxiety-your-questions-answered-2018031413460|title=Eating well to help manage anxiety: Your questions answered - Harvard Health Blog|last=MD|first=Uma Naidoo,|date=2018-03-14|work=Harvard Health Blog|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Waking Life''''' is a 2001 American [[Adult animation|adult animated]] [[docufiction]] film, directed by [[Richard Linklater]]. The film explores a wide range of philosophical issues including the nature of reality, [[dream]]s, [[consciousness]], the meaning of life, [[free will]], and [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt; ''Waking Life'' is centered on a young man who wanders through a succession of dream-like realities wherein he encounters a series of individuals who engage in insightful philosophical discussions.

The film was entirely [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]], although it was shot using digital video of [[Live action|live actors]] with a team of artists drawing stylized lines and colors over each frame with computers, rather than being filmed and traced onto cels on a lightbox. The film contains several parallels to Linklater's 1991 film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Julie Delpy]] reprise their characters from ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' in one scene.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obsessed"/&gt; ''Waking Life'' premiered at the 2001 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waking_life/ |title=Waking Life |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
An unnamed young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an [[existential crisis]]. He observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters—ranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends—about such issues as [[metaphysics]], [[free will]], [[social philosophy]], and the [[meaning of life]]. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, group of people, or couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, [[Situationist International|situationist]] politics, [[posthumanity]], the film theory of [[André Bazin]], and [[lucid dreaming]], and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.

Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional [[false awakening]]s. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream.

The protagonist's final talk is with a character whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to accept God's invitation.

The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the car's handle, but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view.

==Production==
In a 2001 interview Linklater estimated that the idea for the film came "before I was even interested in film, probably 20 years ago".&lt;ref name="AVclubinterview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tobias|first1=Scott|title=INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD LINKLATER|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/richard-linklater-13739|website=AV Club|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the long gestation process in his head, Linklater noted that before he came up with the idea of rotoscoping, the film "didn't quite work" calling it "too blunt, too realistic"&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=D.|first1=Spence|title=INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD LINKLATER|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/20/interview-with-richard-linklater|website=IGN|date=October 20, 2001|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "I think to make a realistic film about an unreality the film had to be a realistic unreality".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

Adding to the dream-like effect, the film used an animation technique based on rotoscoping.&lt;ref name="Animating"/&gt; Animators overlaid live action footage (shot by Linklater) with animation that roughly approximates the images actually filmed.&lt;ref name="Animating"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; This technique is similar in some respects to the rotoscope style of 1970s filmmaker [[Ralph Bakshi]]. Rotoscoping itself, however, was not Bakshi's invention, but that of experimental silent film maker [[Max Fleischer]], who patented the process in 1917.&lt;ref name="Patent"/&gt; A variety of artists were employed, so the feel of the movie continually changes, and gets stranger as time goes on. The result is a [[surrealism|surreal]], shifting dreamscape.

The animators used expensive "off-the-shelf" [[Apple Macintosh]] computers. The film was mostly produced using [[Rotoshop]], a custom-made rotoscoping program that creates blends between [[keyframe]] vector shapes, which also makes use of virtual "layers", and created specifically for the production by [[Bob Sabiston]]. Linklater used this animation method again for his 2006 film ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]''.

==Release==
''Waking Life'' [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2001, and was given a limited release in the United States on October 19, 2001.

===Reception===
Critical reaction has been mostly positive. It holds a rating of 80% across 137 reviews on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] — with critical consensus that "the talky, animated ''Waking Life'' is a unique, cerebral experience" — and an average score of 82/100 ("universal acclaim") on [[Metacritic]], based on 31 reviews.&lt;ref name="RT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metacritic"/&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as "a cold shower of bracing, clarifying ideas".&lt;ref name="Sun-Times"/&gt; Ebert later included the film on his list of "Great Movies".&lt;ref name="RogerEbert"/&gt; [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the film an "A" rating, calling it "a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursues the logic-defying (parallel) subjects of dreaming and moviegoing,"&lt;ref name="Schwarzbaum"/&gt; while [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said it was "so verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you can't absorb it unless you have all your wits about you".&lt;ref name="Holden"/&gt; [[Dave Kehr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the film to be "lovely, fluid, funny" and stated that it "never feels heavy or over-ambitious".&lt;ref name="Kehr"/&gt;

Conversely, [[J. Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' felt that ''Waking Life'' "doesn't leave you in a dream&amp;nbsp;... so much as it traps you in an endless bull session".&lt;ref name="Hoberman"/&gt; [[Frank Lovece]] felt the film was "beautifully drawn" but called its content "pedantic navel-gazing".&lt;ref name="Lovece"/&gt;

Nominated for numerous awards, mainly for its technical achievements, ''Waking Life'' won the [[National Society of Film Critics]] award for "Best Experimental Film", the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] award for "Best Animated Film", and the "CinemAvvenire" award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for "Best Film". It was also nominated for the Golden Lion, the festival's main award.

The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:
* 2008: [[AFI's 10 Top 10]]:
** Nominated Animation Film&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/10top10.pdf?docID=381&amp;AddInterest=1781 |title=AFI's 10 Top 10 Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071937/http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/10top10.pdf?docID=381&amp;AddInterest=1781 |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
The film was released on [[DVD]] in North America in May 2002. Special features included several [[Audio commentary|commentaries]], documentaries, interviews, trailers, and [[deleted scene]]s, as well as the short film ''Snack and Drink''. A bare-bones DVD with no special features was released [[DVD region code|in Region 2]] in February 2003.

==Soundtrack==
{{Main article|Waking Life (soundtrack)}}
The ''[[Waking Life OST]]'' was performed and written by Glover Gill and the [[Tosca Tango Orchestra]], except for [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2. The soundtrack was relatively successful. Featuring the [[nuevo tango]] style, it bills itself "the 21st Century Tango".  The tango contributions were influenced by the music of the Argentine "father of new tango" [[Ástor Piazzolla]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3967">{{nihongo|'''Yagō'''|屋号}}, literally meaning "house name", is a term applied in traditional Japanese culture to [[Japanese name|names]] passed down within a guild, studio, or other circumstance other than blood relations. The term is synonymous with {{nihongo|'''iena'''|家名}} and {{nihongo|'''kadona'''|角名}}. The term most often refers to the guild names of [[kabuki]] actors, but is also applicable to the names artists take from their masters or studios, names taken from one's business, and a few other similar circumstances.

The ''ya'' (屋) of ''yagō'', also often seen at the end of a ''yagō'' name, means "house", "roof", or "shop", and helps to illuminate the origins and meanings of the term. A number of ''yagō'' have associated [[Mon (emblem)|mon]] emblems, some of which incorporate [[rebus]]es; see [[Japanese rebus monogram]].

==History==
Originally, ''yagō'' were place names of homes or buildings taken on by the inhabitants. Even when the house changed hands entirely from one family to another, the new family would take on the name of the house. However, the previous owners would frequently keep the house name when they moved. Often, a family (or individual) would come to be better known by their ''yagō'' than by their actual family name.

Though it is not clear when the custom first emerged, it first appears in print in the chronicles of the [[Muromachi period]]. For many centuries, commoners in Japan did not have [[family name]]s, and so ''yagō'' would often come about to describe people by their location, occupation, or by a store or business they owned. There are similarities in the origins and evolution of family names in other cultures around the world.

''Yagō'' also came to be used to help differentiate the status of lineages with the same last name, or simply to differentiate between people with the same family name within a village. Houses might come to be known simply by their location, such as in a {{nihongo|meadow|原|Hara}} or at the {{nihongo|foot of a hill|坂本|Sakamoto}}, and families took on these place-names. ''Yagō'' could also be used to denote the [[honke|main]] and [[bunke|branch]] lines of a family.

''Yagō'' came to be especially well-known and widely used in kabuki theater, where actors take on a name relating to their guild. The famous actor [[Ichikawa Danjūrō V]], though he was from the Ichikawa family, was also known by the ''yagō'' of Naritaya (Narita house), which indicates his guild within the Kabuki world. This therefore connects him to others of the Naritaya, and reflects his apprenticeship and study alongside certain other actors who might be from other families. Actors' ''yagō'' were often chosen to recall earlier great actors, and it remains a common practice (called ''[[kakegoe]]'') for audience members to shout out an actor's ''yagō'' when he performed a line or pose particularly well-executed, especially a pose or line associated with the actor's namesake.

Artists, writers and poets in Japan, like in other parts of the world, would often take on [[pen name]]s or pseudonyms. These were sometimes derived from the names of their mentors (particularly in painting studios), in which case they could be considered ''yagō''. But more often these art-names or pen names are called in Japanese {{nihongo|''kagō''|家号}} or simply ''[[art-name|gō]]'' (号).

During the [[Edo period]], merchant houses took ''yagō'', which functioned as surnames. Patterns include the name of a [[Provinces of Japan|province]] + ''ya'' such as Kagaya and [[Mitsukoshi|Echigoya]], and an indicator of occupation such as Minatoya (''minato'', meaning "harbor", indicating someone in shipping or trade). Some of these survive as surnames today.

'''Zhiren Cave''' ({{zh|c=智人洞}}) is a [[karstic]] cave in the Mulan Mountains that overlooks the Hejiang River in [[Chongzuo]], [[Guangxi]], China.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} Zhiren Cave is an early [[Late Pleistocene]] site that has yielded the fossil remains of possibly [[anatomically modern humans]] with some mixed [[archaic human]] features.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}}{{sfn|Kaufman|2010}}

==Fossils==
The fossil remains were discovered by Chinese paleontologists in 2007.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} The fossils were covered by a continuous layer of [[flowstone]], a layer that was initially dated to around 113,000 to 100,000 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} A more thorough re-dating was later undertaken, and gives an estimated date of around 116,000 to 106,000 BP.{{sfn|Cai|Qiang|Wang|Jin|2017}}

Some of the large mammal remains discovered at Zhiren Cave include those from ''[[Pongo pygmaeus]]'', ''Elephas kiangnanensis'', ''[[Elephas maximus]]'', ''[[Megatapirus augustus]]'', ''Rhinoceros sinensis'', ''Megalovis guangxiensis'', [[Cervus unicolor]], ''[[Ursus thibetanus]]'', ''[[Arctonyx collaris]]'' and ''[[Panthera pardus]]''.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} Around 25% of the large mammal species discovered at the site are now extinct.{{sfn|Dennell|2010}}

Three pieces of hominin remains were identified: two upper molars (''Zhiren 1'' and ''Zhiren 2'') and an anterior [[mandible]] (''Zhiren 3'').{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} The fossils are believed to have belonged to at least two different individuals, as ''Zhiren 1'' and ''Zhiren 3'' are unlikely to have come from the same individual.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}}

When compared to Late Pleistocene fossils from western Eurasia, ''Zhiren 1'' and ''Zhiren 2'' are smaller and would be classified as modern; however, the comparative context is lacking in East Asian Late Pleistocene fossils.{{sfn|Dennell|2010}}{{sfn|Dennell|2014|pp=45-46}} Zhiren 2 shows evidence for dental winging in its lower incisors, a feature that has only been found in ''Homo sapiens''.{{sfn|Martinón-Torres|Wu|Bermúdez de Castro|Xing|2017}}

''Zhiren 3'' contains a mix of archaic and modern human features.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} The most significant aspect of ''Zhiren 3'' is that it has a distinctively modern human chin.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} Coupled with the dating, ''Zhiren 3'' could possibly represent the earliest modern human fossil in East Asian.{{sfn|Liu|Jin|Zhang|Cai|2010}} However, many were skeptical of this conclusion, since this would significantly push back the general consensus on the dating of [[Recent African origin of modern humans|human migration out of Africa]].{{sfn|Dennell|2010}}{{sfn|Dennell|2014|pp=45-46}} [[Peter Bellwood]] also cites the lack of archaeological finds associated with the fossils.{{sfn|Bellwood|2013}}
