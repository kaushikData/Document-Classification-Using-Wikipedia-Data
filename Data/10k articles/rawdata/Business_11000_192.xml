==History==
The building was built in three stages between 1912 and 1937. It was originally designed by Mortimer J. Fox, of the firm [[Buchman &amp; Fox]], and called the '''New York Times Annex''' because it was designed to supplement the [[One Times Square]] Times Tower, built in 1905 at Broadway and 42nd Street (which gives Times Square its name).&lt;ref name="emporis" /&gt; In 1922, the Ludlow &amp; Peabody firm designed a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} extension on the west side as well as a five-story setback attic level in the style of the [[French Renaissance]], including the [[Mansard roof]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} From 1930 to 1932, architect [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]] designed a further expansion to the west including a second lobby and roof-top studio. Further expansions included a 12-story New York Times North building adjoining it to the north on 44th Street.&lt;ref name="emporis" /&gt;

The New York Times Company sold the building in 2004 to [[Tishman Speyer|Tishman Speyer Properties]] for $175 million. Tishman sold it to [[Africa Israel Investments]] in 2007 for $525 million.&lt;ref&gt;Koblin, John (April 30, 2007).

'''Badruddin Ahmad''' (17 August 1912, Patiala, India - 19 March 1981, Karachi, Pakistan) was a pioneer in the field of [[Civil aviation]]. He was instrumental in the development of post-[[Second World War|World War II]] aviation plans and supervised the construction of non-military runways and airports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manimasood.com/civil-aviation-pioneer/&lt;/ref&gt; The assets developed by Ahmad were transferred to the international civil authorities, leading to the advent of Civil Aviation as an industry.

Ahmad was perhaps best known for his association with the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) and in his roles as the Director General of Civil Aviation for the [[Government of Pakistan]] and Chief of Administration at the [[Pakistan Meteorological Department]].

==Education==

Ahmad graduated with a Master of Arts in Mathematics degree, with specialization in Advanced Astronomy from [[Allahabad University]] (then called 'University of Allahbad' and referred to as 'the Oxford of the East')&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1106781.cms Allahabad Varsity to become a central university] [[The Times of India]], May 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; on 30 January 1935.

==Career==

Badruddin Ahmed was instrumental in the events and planning that lead to the advent of the Civil Aviation industry.

He drafted government policy on the [[subsidization]] of flying clubs; licensed many non-military pilots, navigators and ground engineers; and progressed the selection and training of pilots and ground engineers for the [[Royal Indian Air Force]].

After [[Pakistan Movement|partition of Indian subcontinent]], Ahmed drafted the plans for Civil Aviation in Pakistan and conducted pioneer work in establishing the Department of Civil Aviation in Pakistan and was responsible for the coordination of the department's activities and international relations.

He was responsible for much work in the establishment of [[Pakistan International Airlines]] and was director in charge of the construction of various civil aviation works such as jet [[runways]] and [[airports]].

In 1955 he was elected member of the British [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport|Institute of Transport]]. He was elected Chairman in 1959 by unanimous vote of the Joint Middle East and South East Asia Air Navigation Conference to lay down the rules for [[Jet Aircraft]] operations.

In 1959, he was awarded the [[Tamgha-e-Quaid-e-Azam]], a prestigious [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|civil decoration of Pakistan]], for his contribution to the Civil Aviation development in Pakistan.

In 1960 he was promoted to Director General of Civil Aviation Authority.

In 1962 he was given the additional appointment of Chief of Administration with the status of Additional Director in the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

During his career he represented Pakistan in four General Assemblies of the International Civil Aviation Organization and worked on defining international travel and carrier routes.

==Horticulture==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Badruddin Ahmad with Begum Liaqat Ali.jpg|right|thumb|Badruddin Ahmad at a flower show, receiving an award from [[Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan|Begum Liaquat Ali]], First Lady of Pakistan.]] --&gt;

In addition to his distinguished career in government policy and Civil Aviation, Ahmad made contributions to the field of [[horticulture]].

He was a fellow of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] and the Royal Rose Society (now the [[Royal National Rose Society]]). Many [[Introduced species|non-indigenous plants]] in the Indian Subcontinent are attributed to him.

He was co-founder of the Horticultural Society of Pakistan and served as its Vice President from 1959 to 1961. During his tenure he introduced the [[Ficus elastica|rubber plant]] (''Ficus elastica'') to Pakistan and received awards and recognition for [[Crotons]] and [[Carnation]] cultivations.

After death, the [[British High Commission]] suggested that the Government of Pakistan dedicate a [[Botanical and horticultural library|Horticultural Library]] to his name. A one million-pound memorial fund for books was offered. Alas, political turbulence in Pakistan at the time meant that the proposal never came to fruition.

==Personal life==

Ahmad was born in  Patiala, India to Khairuddin Ahmad and Fatima Begum Javed. His father was a Royal Veterinary Surgeon and his mother was a homemaker. He is the oldest of five siblings, three sisters and two younger brothers.

A [[polyglot]], Ahmad was able to speak, read and write in [[English language|English]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]; and had working knowledge of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other languages.

He participated in the popular ''Brain Trust'' programme on [[Radio Pakistan]], was a member of the [[Royal Photographic Society]], and a lifetime member of the council of the [[Iqbal Academy Pakistan|Iqbal Academy]].

He was married twice to Ms. Jeanne Ahmed and Ms. Maher UnNisah and had two sons, Saeed A Masood and Shafat A Mehmood.

The '''Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation''' ('''CSIRO''') is an independent [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] agency responsible for scientific research. Its chief role is to improve the economic and social performance of industry for the benefit of the community. 

CSIRO works with leading organisations around the world. From its headquarters in Canberra, CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States, employing about 5500 people.

Federally funded scientific research began in Australia {{age|1916|6|1}} years ago. The Advisory Council of Science and Industry was established in 1916 but was hampered by insufficient available finance.  In 1926 the research effort was reinvigorated by establishment of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding. CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. In 1949 further legislated changes included re-naming the organisation as CSIRO.

Notable developments by CSIRO have included the invention of [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]], essential components of [[Wi-Fi]] technology, development of the first commercially successful [[polymer banknote]], the invention of the insect repellent in [[Aerogard]] and the introduction of a series of biological controls into Australia, such as the introduction of [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]] for the control of [[European rabbit|rabbit]] populations.

== Structure ==
CSIRO is governed by a board appointed by the Australian Government, currently chaired by [[David Thodey]]{{post-nominals|country=AUS|A0}}. There are nine directors inclusive of the Chief Executive, presently Dr. [[Larry R. Marshall|Larry Marshall]], who is responsible for management of the organisation.

== History ==
===Evolution of the organisation===
A precursor to CSIRO, the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, was established in 1916 on the initiative of prime minister [[Billy Hughes]]. However, the Advisory Council struggled with insufficient funding during the First World War. In 1920 the Council was renamed the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, and was led by [[George Handley Knibbs]] (1921–26), but continued to struggle financially.

In 1926 the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] modified the principal Act for national scientific research (the ''Institute of Science and Industry Act 1920'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 22 |date= 14 September 1920 |url= http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/iosaia1920221920384.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by passing ''The Science and Industry Research Act 1926''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1926 |number= 20 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= http://www5.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/au/legis/cth/num_act/saira1926201926306.pdf |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Act replaced the Institute with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). With encouragement from prime minister [[Stanley Bruce]], strengthened national science leadership and increased research funding, CSIR grew rapidly and achieved significant early successes. The council was structured to represent the federal structure of government in Australia, and had state-level committees and a central council. In addition to an improved structure, CSIR benefited from strong bureaucratic management under [[George Julius]], [[David Rivett]], and Arnold Richardson. Research focused on primary and secondary industries. Early in its existence, CSIR established divisions studying animal health and animal nutrition. After the [[Great Depression]], research was extended into manufacturing and other secondary industries.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/our-history/ |title= Our history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 the Act was changed again&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Science and Industry Research Act 1949 |number= 13 |date= 21 June 1926 |url= https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2012C00352/Download |accessdate= 18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the entity name amended to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The amendment enlarged and reconstituted the organisation and its administrative structure. Under [[Ian Clunies Ross]] as chairman, CSIRO pursued new areas such as radio astronomy and industrial chemistry. CSIRO still operates under the provisions of the 1949 Act in a wide range of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;

Since 1949 CSIRO has expanded its activities to almost every field of primary, secondary and tertiary industry, including the environment, human nutrition, conservation, urban and rural planning, and water.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; It works with leading organisations around the world and maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and in France, Chile and the United States of America, employing about 5500 people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.csiro.au/en/About/International&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/International |title=International collaboration – CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-01-28 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic research===
CSIRO had a pioneering role in the scientific discovery of the universe through radio "eyes". A team led by [[Paul Wild (Australian scientist)|Paul Wild]] built and operated (from 1948) the world’s first solar radiospectrograph, and from 1967 the {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=mid|-diameter}} radioheliograph at Culgoora in New South Wales. For three decades, the Division of Radiophysics had a world-leading role in solar research, attracting prominent solar physicists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |title=Dr John Paul Wild |publisher=CSIRO |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125053338/http://www.csiro.au/news/ps47j |archivedate=25 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO owned the first computer in Australia, [[CSIRAC]], built as part of a project began in the Sydney Radiophysics Laboratory in 1947. The CSIR Mk 1 ran its first program in 1949, the fifth electronic computer in the world. It was over 1,000 times faster than the mechanical calculators available at the time. It was decommissioned in 1955 and recommissioned in Melbourne as CSIRAC in 1956 as a general purpose computing machine used by over 700 projects until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |title=CSIRAC |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |work=Department of Computer Science and Engineering |accessdate=2006-05-08 |author1=Steven Pass |author2=David Hornsby |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227165717/http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/dept/about/csirac/ |archivedate=27 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRAC is the only surviving first-generation computer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.vic.gov.au/csirac/ |title=Museum Victoria's CSIRAC information site|accessdate=2008-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1965 and 1985, [[George Bornemissza]] of CSIRO's Division of Entomology founded and led the [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]]. Bornemissza, upon settling in Australia from Hungary in 1951, noticed that the pastureland was covered in dry cattle dung pads which did not seem to be recycled into the soil and caused areas of rank pasture which were unpalatable to the cattle. He proposed that the reason for this was that native Australian dung beetles, which had co-evolved alongside the marsupials (which produce dung very different in its composition from cattle), were not adapted to utilise cattle dung for their nutrition and breeding since cattle had only relatively recently been introduced to the continent in the 1880s. The Australian Dung Beetle Project sought, therefore, to introduce species of dung beetle from South Africa and Europe (which had co-evolved alongside bovids) in order to improve the fertility and quality of cattle pastures. Twenty-three species were successfully introduced throughout the duration of the project and also had the effect of reducing the pestilent bush fly population by 90%.&lt;ref name="adbp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bornemissza G. F. | year = 1976 | title = The Australian dung beetle project 1965–1975 | url = | journal = Australian Meat Research Committee Review | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---Missylisa153, August 2009---&gt;

===Domain name===
CSIRO was the first Australian organisation to start using the Internet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |title=AARNET – About Us – History |publisher=[[Australian Academic and Research Network]] |accessdate=16 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412054848/https://www.aarnet.edu.au/about-us/history.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was able to register the [[second-level domain]] csiro.au (as opposed to csiro.org.au or csiro.com.au).  Guidelines were introduced in 1996 to regulate the use of the [[.au]] domain.

When CSIR was formed in 1926, it was led initially by an Executive Committee of three people, two of whom were designated as the Chairman and the Chief Executive. Since then the roles and responsibilities of the Chair and Chief Executive have changed many times. From 1927 to 1986 the head of CSIR (and from 1949, CSIRO)&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt; was the Chairman, who was responsible for the management of the organisation, supported by the Chief Executive. From 1 July 1959 to 4 December 1986 CSIRO had no Chief Executive; the Chairman undertook both functions.&lt;ref name="heads"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/heads-of-csiro-2/ |title= Chief Executives and Chairs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, when the [[Hawke Government|Australian Government]] changed the structure of CSIRO to include a board of non-executive members plus the Chief Executive to lead CSIRO, the roles changed. The Chief Executive is now responsible for management of the organisation in accordance with the strategy, plans and policies approved by the CSIRO Board which, led by the Chair of the Board, is responsible to the Australian Government for the overall strategy, governance and performance of CSIRO.&lt;ref name="heads"/&gt;

As with its governance structure, the priorities and structure of CSIRO, and the teams and facilities that implement its research, have changed as Australia's scientific challenges have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csiropedia.csiro.au/organisational-history/ |title= Organisational history |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= April 2018 |website= CSIROpedia |publisher= CSIRO |access-date= 16 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Total Wellbeing Diet===
In 2005 the CSIRO gained worldwide attention, including some criticism, for promoting a high-[[protein]], low-[[carbohydrate]] diet of their own creation called ''[[Total Wellbeing Diet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Health-and-Wellbeing/Prevention/Total-Wellbeing-Diet-online.aspx |title=CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet online - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSIRO published the diet in a book which sold over half a million copies in Australia and over 100,000 overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=2006-04-24 |title=The town taking the CSIRO challenge |work=[[A Current Affair (Australian TV program)|A Current Affair]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051213020826/http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/stories/2006.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 13 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet was criticised in an editorial by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' for giving scientific credence to a "fashionable" diet sponsored by meat and dairy industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/peers-turn-up-heat-on-csiro-diet/2005/12/27/1135445573297.html |title=Peers turn up heat on CSIRO diet |publisher=The Age |date=28 December 2005 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classicbackissues.australasianscience.com.au/bi2006/272CSIROdiet.pdf |title=Nature Gags on CSIRO Diet |publisher=Australasian Science |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===802.11 patent===
In the early 1990s, CSIRO radio astronomy scientists John O'Sullivan, Graham Daniels, Terence Percival, Diethelm Ostry and John Deane undertook research directed to finding a way to make wireless networks work as fast as wired networks within confined spaces such as office buildings. The technique they developed, involving a particular combination of [[forward error correction]], frequency-domain interleaving, and [[multi-carrier modulation]], became the subject of {{US Patent|5487069}}, which was granted on 23 January 1996.

In 1997 Macquarie University professor David Skellern and his colleague Neil Weste established the company Radiata, Inc., which took a nonexclusive licence to the CSIRO patent for the purpose of developing commercially viable integrated circuit devices implementing the patented technology.&lt;ref name=Radiata&gt;{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Mark |title=Creating and Exploiting Intangible Networks: How Radiata was able to improve its odds of success in the risky process of innovating |url=http://www.dest.gov.au/NR/rdonlyres/3C2255E6-B6E5-49EB-BB96-1FBA94EB0EA4/1372/radiata.pdf |publisher=Australian Government, Department of Education, Science and Training |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author2=Bob Frater |pages=8–9 &amp; 16 |format=PDF |date=November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the [[IEEE 802.11]] Working Group was developing the 802.11a wireless LAN standard. CSIRO did not participate directly in the standards process, however David Skellern was an active participant as secretary of the Working Group, and representative of Radiata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skellern |first=David |title=Tentative Minutes of the IEEE P802.11 Full Working Group |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11/Minutes/Cons_Minutes_99July.pdf |publisher=Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=5–9 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 it became apparent that the CSIRO patent would be pertinent to the standard. In response to a request from Victor Hayes of Lucent Technologies, who was Chair of the 802.11 Working Group, CSIRO confirmed its commitment to make non-exclusive licenses available to implementers of the standard on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cooper |first=Dennis |title=Letter to Mr V Hayes, Chair, IEEE P802.11 |url=http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/patcom/loa-802_11a-csiro-04Dec1998.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2012 |format=PDF |date=4 December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Cisco Systems]], Inc. and [[Broadcom]] Corporation each invested A$4&amp;nbsp;million in Radiata, representing an 11% stake for each investor and valuing the company at around A$36&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt; In September 2000, Radiata demonstrated a chip set complying with the recently finalised IEEE 802.11a Wi-Fi standard, and capable of handling transmission rates of up to 54 Mbit/s, at a major international exhibition.&lt;ref name=Radiata/&gt;

In November 2000, Cisco acquired Radiata in exchange for US$295&amp;nbsp;million in Cisco common stock with the intention of incorporating the Radiata Baseband Processor and Radio chips into its Aironet family of wireless LAN products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Press Release: Cisco Systems to Acquire Radiata, Inc. |url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |publisher=Cisco Systems, Inc. |accessdate=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011124055012/http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/fspnisapi08cd.html |archivedate=24 November 2001 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cisco subsequently took a large write-down on the Radiata acquisition, following the 2001 [[telecoms crash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heskett |first=Ben |title=Cisco still confident after networking shock |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/cisco-still-confident-after-networking-shock/119211 |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=9 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 it shut down its internal development of wireless chipsets based on the Radiata technology in order to focus on software development and emerging new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reardon |first=Marguerite |title=Cisco retires wireless chipsets |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033_3-5151131.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CNET News |date=30 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy over the CSIRO patent arose in 2006 after the organisation won an injunction against [[Buffalo Technology]] in an infringement suit filed in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO wins landmark legal battle |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/wireless--broadband/csiro-wins-landmark-legal-battle/2006/11/15/1163266614119.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Age |date=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injunction was subsequently suspended on appeal, with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finding that the judge in Texas should have allowed a trial to proceed on Buffalo’s challenge to the validity of the CSIRO patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Venkatesan |first=Arun |title=Buffalo Allowed to sell wireless products again (for now) |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/03/buffalo-allowed-to-sell-wireless-products-again-for-now/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechCrunch |date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, CSIRO declined to provide an assurance to the IEEE that it would not sue companies which refused to take a license for use in 802.11n-compliant devices, while at the same time continuing to defend legal challenges to the validity of the patent brought by [[Intel]], [[Dell]], [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Netgear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Winterford |first=Brett |title=No backdown from CSIRO over Wi-Fi patents |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/systems-management/2007/10/02/no-backdown-from-csiro-over-wi-fi-patents-39289756/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Hewlett-Packard broke ranks with the rest of the industry becoming the first to reach a settlement of its dispute with CSIRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Moses |first=Asher |title=CSIRO cashes in on patent claim |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/csiro-cashes-in-on-patent-claim/2009/04/01/1238261630683.html |accessdate=13 May 2012 |date=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was followed quickly by settlements with Microsoft, [[Fujitsu]] and [[Asus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duckett |first=Chris |title=Microsoft, Fujitsu, Asus settle with CSIRO |url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/microsoft-fujitsu-asus-settle-with-csiro-339295967.htm |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=ZDNet |date=15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Dell, Intel, [[Nintendo]], [[Toshiba]], Netgear, Buffalo, [[D-Link]], [[Belkin]], [[SMC Networks|SMC]], [[Accton]], and [[3Com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent lawsuits conclude with the final 13 companies set |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/22/csiros-patent-lawsuits-conclude-with-the-final-13-companies-set/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=David |title=CSIRO could scoop billions from Wi-Fi patent |url=http://apcmag.com/csiro-could-scoop-billions-from-wi-fi-patent.htm |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=APC Magazine |date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy grew after CSIRO sued US carriers [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]], [[Verizon]] and [[T-Mobile]] in 2010, with the organisation being accused of being "Australia's biggest patent troll", a wrathful "patent bully", and of imposing a "WiFi tax" on American innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Popper |first=Ben |title=Australia's Biggest Patent Troll Goes After AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505124_162-43340647/australias-biggest-patent-troll-goes-after-at038t-verizon-and-t-mobile/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=CBS News |date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=CSIRO's patent fight targets more victims: AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, and T-Mobile |url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/21/csiros-patent-fight-targets-more-victims-atandt-verizon-wireles/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Engadget |date=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Masnick |first=Mike |title=CSIRO Wants To Expand Its WiFi Tax: Sues Mobile Operators |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100601/1913309652.shtml |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=TechDirt |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further fuel was added to the controversy after a settlement with the carriers, worth around $229&amp;nbsp;million, was announced in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |title=Champagne at CSIRO after WiFi patent settlement |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/01/csiro_settles_with_carriers/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Register |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |title=WiFi patent case results in $229 million payment to Australian government |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/wifi-patent-case-results-in-229m-payment-to-australian-government/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged in part by an announcement by the Australian Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills Science and Research, Senator Chris Evans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Media Release: Aussie scientists bring home millions in wifi windfall |url=http://minister.innovation.gov.au/chrisevans/MediaReleases/Pages/millionsinwifiwindfall.aspx |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=13 May 2012 |date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an article in [[Ars Technica]] portrayed CSIRO as a shadowy organisation responsible for US consumers being compelled to make "a multimillion dollar donation" on the basis of a questionable patent claiming "decades old" technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=Joe |title=How the Aussie government "invented WiFi" and sued its way to $430 million |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/how-the-aussie-government-invented-wifi-and-sued-its-way-to-430-million/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting debate became so heated that the author was compelled to follow up with a defence of the original article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=Joe |title=Responses and clarifications on the CSIRO patent lawsuits |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/04/op-ed/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view was also published on [[The Register]], challenging a number of the assertions made in the Ars Technica piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chirgwin |first=Richard |title=CSIRO patent-trolls ALL OF AMERICA! |date=10 April 2012|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/10/csiro_patent_trolls_wifi/ |accessdate=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Register }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetically modified wheat trials===
On 14 July 2011, [[Greenpeace]] activists vandalised a crop of GM wheat, circumventing the scientific trials being undertaken. Greenpeace was forced to pay reparations to CSIRO of $280,000 for the criminal damage, and were accused by the sentencing judge, Justice Hilary Penfold, of cynically using junior members of the organisation with good standing to avoid custodial sentences, while the offenders were given 9-month suspended sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/greenpeace-activists-in-costly-gm-protest-20120802-23i0t.html| title=Greenpeace activists in costly GM protest| publisher=Sydney Morning Herald| date=2012-08-02| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/gm-crop-destroyers-given-suspended-sentences-20121119-29l66.html| title=GM crop destroyers given suspended sentences| publisher=Canberra Times| date=2012-11-19| accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the attack Greenpeace criticised CSIRO for a close relationship with industry that had led to an increase in [[genetically modified crops]], even though a core aim of CSIRO is Cooperative Research "working hand in hand with industry [to] build partnerships and engage with industry to generate impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Partner/Industry.aspx | title = Working hand in hand with industry | accessdate = 8 Nov 2013 | date = 22 April 2013 | work = CSIRO website | publisher = Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/en/mediacentre/media-releases/food/Greenpeace-calls-on-CSIRO-to-come-clean-on-commercial-relationships/ |title= Greenpeace calls on CSIRO to come clean on commercial relationships |date= 15 July 2011 |publisher= www.greenpeace.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change censorship: Clive Spash ===
On 25 November 2009, a debate was held in the Australian Senate concerning the alleged involvement of the CSIRO and the Labor government in censorship. The debate was called for by opposition parties after evidence came to light that a paper critical of carbon emissions trading was being suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-2-The-Australian-FRONT-PAGE.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 2 November 2009 |title= CSIRO bid to gag emissions trading scheme policy attack |work= The Australian |publisher= News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the Labor government was trying to get such a scheme through the Senate. After the debate, the Science Minister, Kim Carr, was forced to release the paper, but when doing so in the Senate he also delivered a letter from the CEO of the CSIRO, [[Megan Clark]], which attacked the report's author and threatened him with unspecified punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/9_News_26_Nov_2009.pdf |author= Crystal, J. |date= 26 November 2009 |title= CSIRO scientist faces punishment |publisher= 9 News |location= Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of the paper, Clive Spash, was cited in the press as having been bullied and harassed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Climate expert Clive Spash 'heavied' by CSIRO management |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/09-11-3-The_Australian-Climate_expert_Clive_Spash_heavied_by_CSIRO_management.pdf |author= Berkovic, N. |date= 3 November 2009 |work= The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later gave a radio interview about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MW-CSIRO-121212.mp3 |author= Walsh, M. |year= 2012 |title= The toxic workplace and bullying culture at CSIRO |publisher= www.2cc.net.au }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the midst of the affair, CSIRO management had considered releasing the paper with edits that Nature reported would be "tiny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/news/2009/091113/full/news.2009.1083.html |author= Pincock, S. |date=13 November 2009 |title= Australian agency moves to calm climate row.

He later posted on his website a document detailing the text that CSIRO management demanded be deleted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= An Orwellian guide to carbon emissions trading |author= Spash, C. |year= 2010 |url= https://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OrwellianGuidetoCarbonETS.pdf |publisher= www.clivespash.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; by itself, this document forms a coherent set of statements criticising emissions trading without any additional wording needed. In subsequent Senate Estimates hearings during 2010, Senator Carr and Clark went on record claiming the paper was originally stopped from publication solely due to its low quality not meeting CSIRO standards.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Senate 2010. Senate Economics Legislation Committee Estimates. Canberra: Official Hansard (Wednesday, 10 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of its attempted suppression, the paper had been accepted for publication in an academic journal, [[New Political Economy (journal)|New Political Economy]], which in 2010 had been ranked by the Australian Research Council as an 'A class' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/era2010_journal_title_list.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119133137/http://www.arc.gov.au/xls/ERA2010_journal_title_list.xls |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ABC radio interview, Spash called for a Senate enquiry into the affair and the role played by senior management and the Science Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Dumped Professor calls for Senate inquiry |url= http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s2829301.htm |author= Colvin, M. |year= 2010 |publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After these events, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''  reported that "Questions are being raised about the closeness of BHP Billiton and the CSIRO under its chief executive, Megan Clark".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.smh.com.au/business/csiro-in-bed-with-big-coal-20100702-zu2i.html |author= Manning, P. |year= 2010 |title= CSIRO in bed with big coal |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his resignation, an unedited version of the paper was released by Spash as a discussion paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/ |author= Spash, C.

===CSIRO–Novartis–DataTrace scandal===
On 11 April 2013, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' ran a story on how CSIRO had "duped" the Swiss-based pharmaceutical giant [[Novartis]] into purchasing an anti-counterfeit technology for its vials of injectable [[Voltaren]]. The invention was marketed by a small Australian company called DataTrace DNA as a method of identifying fake vials, on the basis that a unique tracer code developed by CSIRO was embedded in the product. However, the code sold to Novartis for more than A$2M was apparently not unique, and was based on a "cheap tracer ... bought in bulk from a Chinese distributor". Novartis was contractually bound not to reverse-engineer the tracer to verify its uniqueness. The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' report alleges that this was done with the knowledge of key CSIRO personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the CSIRO cheated a global drugs giant |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-the-csiro-cheated-a-global-drugs-giant-20130410-2hluf.html |accessdate=12 April 2012 |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald |date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSIRO has since conducted a full review of the allegations and found no evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csiro.au/en/Portals/Media/CSIRO-review-of-issues-raised-about-CSIROs-interactions-with-DataTrace.aspx |title=CSIRO review of issues raised about CSIRO’s interactions with DataTrace |publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation |date=11 August 2013 |accessdate=7 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years{{When|date=February 2017}} the CSIRO has fallen under the spotlight for allegedly exhibiting a culture of workplace bullying and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser and Nicky Phillips (12 April 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/science-second-in-toxic-csiro-work-culture-20130412-2hqv0.html "Science second in toxic CSIRO work culture"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Former CSIRO employees started to surface with experiences of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members.&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (5 February 2013) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/probe-into-csiro-bullying-20130205-2dwva.html "Probe into CSIRO bullying"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton Besser (18 September 2012) [http://www.smh.com.au/national/whistleblowers-at-csiro-forced-out-and-bullying-rife-20120917-262hk.html "Whistleblowers at CSIRO forced out and bullying rife"], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; CSIRO took the allegations seriously and responded to the articles on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (14 April 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/More-than-85-years-growth-change-impact.aspx "More than 85 years of growth, change and impact"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Megan Clark (2 May 2013) [http://www.csiro.au/Portals/Media/Chief-Executive-Megan-Clarks-update-to-staff-re-Fairfax-articles.aspx "Chief Executive Megan Clark's update to staff re Fairfax articles"], CSIRO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shadow minister for innovation, industry, science and research, [[Sophie Mirabella]], wrote to the government requesting it establish an inquiry. Mirabella said she is aware of as many as 100 cases of alleged workplace harassment. On 20 July 2012 [[Comcare]] issued CSIRO with an Improvement Notice with regard to handling and management of workplace misconduct/code of conduct type investigations and allegations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130727093429/http://www.comcare.gov.au/about_us/access_to_information/disclosure_log/foi_requested_documents/improvement_notice_relating_to_eve207221 ]&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2013 Mirabella advised the [[Australian House of Representatives]] that in relation to the worker's compensation claim for psychological injuries of ex-CSIRO employee, Martin Williams, which was vigorously defended by [[Comcare]] on the advice of the CSIRO, that CSIRO officers had provided false testimony on no less than 128 occasions under oath when the matter went before the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;''"I am also reminded of the government's stubborn unwillingness to bring the CSIRO to account for a series of inaccurate and misleading statements that have been made to the Senate estimates committees, including the recent incomprehensible answer to question AL156 which says that no CSIRO employee provided false evidence under oath during cross-examination in the AAT case involving Martin Williams, when an analysis of the transcript of that case suggests that there are at least 100, and more precisely around 128, separate instances of CSIRO officers providing false evidence in the case."''
Sophie Mirabella MP (shadow minister for innovation, industry, science research and tertiary education). Australian House of Representatives – House Debate Monday 24 June 2013 at 6:33pm. [http://www.openaustralia.org/debate/?id=2013-06-24.99.2 "Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Bill 2013; Second Reading"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirabella stated, "even in establishing the framework for this inquiry it is obvious there's an inappropriate 'hands on' approach by CSIRO."

In response to the allegations Clark commissioned Dennis Pearce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwlebsworth.com.au/expertise/intellectual-property-and-trade-marks/features/our-team/item/479-emeritus-professor-dennis-pearce-ao.html |title=Emeritus Prof. Dennis Pearce AO FAAL |website=Hwlebsworth.com.au |date= |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is assisted by an investigation team from HWL Ebsworth Lawyers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWL Ebsworth appointed to CSIRO bullying enquiry|url=http://asia.legalbusinessonline.com/news/hwl-ebsworth-appointed-to-csiro-bullying-enquiry/110241|work=Asian Legal Business|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct an independent investigation into allegations of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hwlebsworth.com.au/csiro-investigation.html Independent Investigator for Allegations of Workplace Bullying and Other Unreasonable Behaviour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409032401/http://hwlebsworth.com.au/csiro-investigation.html |date=9 April 2013 }}, hwlebsworth.com.au&lt;br/&gt;
"Emeritus Professor Dennis Pearce AO has been appointed as the independent investigator for allegations of workplace bullying and other unreasonable behaviour by current and former CSIRO staff members and CSIRO affiliates."&lt;/ref&gt;  Mirabella continued to question the independence of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sophie Mirabella]] MP, (26 February 2013), [http://www.sophiemirabella.com.au/Media/PortfolioMedia/MediaReleases/tabid/78/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/708/CSIRO-BULLYING-TERMS-OF-REFERENCE-LEAVES-QUESTIONS-UNANSWERED.aspx "CSIRO bullying terms of reference leaves questions unanswered"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105083222/http://www.sophiemirabella.com.au/Media/PortfolioMedia/MediaReleases/tabid/78/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/708/CSIRO-BULLYING-TERMS-OF-REFERENCE-LEAVES-QUESTIONS-UNANSWERED.aspx# |date=5 January 2017 }}, Portfolio News&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the investigation is scheduled to publish its findings at the end of July 2013, and the final stage is scheduled to be complete by February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;''"The investigator will provide his Phase 1 reports by 31 July 2013. It is likely that people will be told the outcome of the investigator's consideration of their submission at about this time. It is intended that Phase 2 will be completed by February 2014."''

===CSIRO and the Liberal Government===
In August 2015 the CSIRO discontinued its annual July and August survey, conducted over the previous five years, polling to create a long-term view of how Australians viewed global warming and their support for action.  In the previous 2013 poll, 86 per cent agreed with the statement that climate change was occurring and only 7.6 per cent disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-change-csiro-axes-annual-attitudes-survey-delays-2014-results-20150810-giw6i1.html |title=Climate change: CSIRO axes annual attitudes survey, delays 2014 results |website=Smh.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 11th February 2016, Dr Larry Marshall – a former venture capitalist with Southern Cross Venture Holdings, who had been appointed CEO of the CSIRO on the 1st January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/Leadership-governance/Chief-Executive-and-Executive-Team/Team |title=Executive Team - CSIRO |website=Csiro.au |date=2015-07-16 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused an international outcry after describing Australia’s national climate change discussion as “more like religion than science,” a week after announcing hundreds of job cuts to the organisation that will reduce the effectiveness of its climate research team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2016/climate-politics-more-like-religion-says-csiro-boss-90059 |title=Climate politics 'more like religion', says CSIRO boss |publisher=Renew Economy |date=2016-02-11 |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In “an open letter to the Australian Government and CSIRO”, 2,800 of the leading climate scientists from 60 countries say the announcement of cuts to the CSIRO’s Oceans and Atmosphere research program has alarmed the global climate research community.  They say the decision shows a lack of insight and a misunderstanding of the importance of the depth and significance of Australian contributions to global and regional climate research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-worlds-top-scientists-beg-malcolm-turnbull-to-allow-csiro-to-continue-its-climate-research-2016-2 |title=The world's top scientists beg Malcolm Turnbull to allow CSIRO to continue its climate research |website=Businessinsider.com.au |accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Car Dogs''''' is a film which stars [[George Lopez]], [[Dash Mihok]], [[Patrick J. Adams]], [[Octavia Spencer]], and [[Josh Hopkins]]. The film is set in a car dealership where, in a single day, salesmen have to sell more cars than they ever have done.
==Story==
The story is set at the Chamberlain Auto Group which is run by Malcolm Chamberlain (played by [[Chris Mulkey]]). He has his son Mark working for him as the GM. Malcolm is a ruthless and manipulative car dealer. He offers his son a major part of a new store if he and the team of car salesmen can move 35 cars in a day, and they have to do it by 5pm.&lt;ref&gt;''Geek News Network'', March 24, 2017 - [https://geeknewsnetwork.net/2017/03/24/car-dogs-movie-review/ Car Dogs | Movie Review by Eric Fiallos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Automotive News]]'', April 29, 2017 - [http://www.autonews.com/article/20170429/RETAIL07/305019950/car-dogs-have-their-day-on-screen DOG EAT DOG, 'Car Dogs' have their day on screen - Stephanie Hernandez McGavin]&lt;/ref&gt; The sales manager (played by [[Josh Hopkins]]) has his eyes on the new dealership for himself and is playing dirty tricks behind Mark's back.&lt;ref&gt;''Geek News Network'', March 24, 2017 - [https://geeknewsnetwork.net/2017/03/24/car-dogs-movie-review/ Car Dogs | Movie Review by Eric Fiallos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The film came about as a result of Mark Edward King who was a student of Adam Collis. He wrote a short film script about car salesmen at a dealership who were trying to sell as many cars in a single day, more than they had ever done. King was encouraged by Collis to expand it into a script for a full feature.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', March 16, 2017 - [http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/car-dogs-movie-george-lopez-asu-9159414 The Story Behind Car Dogs, Starring George Lopez and Made (in Part) by Arizona State University Interns - M.V.

'''''Comics &amp; Games Retailer''''' was the longest-running periodical serving retailers who sell [[comic books]], [[collectible card games]], and [[role-playing games]] until it ceased publication in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2007/f-w-shutters-multiple-hobbyist-magazines|title=F+W Shutters Multiple Magazines |accessdate=January 24, 2008|work=Folio:}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comics Retailer (a.k.a. Comics &amp; Games Retailer)|url=http://www.farawaypress.com/magazines/comicsretailer.html|publisher=Faraway Press|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters was in [[Iola, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

==History and profile==
Launched in April 1992&lt;ref name="farp"/&gt; by [[Krause Publications]] (later acquired by [[F+W Publications Inc.]] in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hite|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Hite| title=State of the Industry 2005: Another Such Victory Will Destroy Us|publisher=GamingReport.com|date=March 30, 2006|url=http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;artid=186|accessdate=February 21, 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204034158/http://www.gamingreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=printpage&amp;artid=186| archivedate=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the free-to-retailers monthly magazine was a spinoff from that company’s consumer magazine, ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]''.

The publication was originally known as ''Comics Retailer'', and in 2002 changed to ''Comics &amp; Games Retailer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Paul Gabilliet|author2=Bart Beaty|author3=Nick Nguyen|title=Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1t8g_yX1wcC&amp;pg=PA358|accessdate=February 19, 2016|date=January 2010|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-267-2|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011|isbn= 978-1-907702- 58-7|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early columnists included many retailers and experts on retailing, including Bruce Costa, Brian Hibbs, [[Scott Haring]], Preston Sweet, Bob Gray, and Harry Friedman. Hired in 1993, its editor of longest tenure, [[John Jackson Miller]], added “Market Beat,” a section of retailer sales reports; coverage of the game industry; and statistical analysis of comics and game sales.

Given its availability only to those working behind the scenes, the magazine’s opinion columns have often been the flashpoint of both controversy and new ideas for the hobby. In 1996, business researchers from the [[University of Kentucky]] and [[Rutgers University]] joined with the magazine to conduct a study of retailer attitudes toward distributors and publishers. In 2001, columnist [[Joe Field]] suggested in the magazine that Diamond launch a [[Free Comic Book Day]] – which later became an industry tradition. In 2002, columnist Brian Hibbs filed a class-action suit on behalf of retailers against [[Marvel Comics]] over its trade terms. As a consequence he moved his "Titling at Windmills" column, first to [[Newsarama]] then to [[Comic Book Resources]]. His last column in ''Comics Retailer'' was in the May 1992 issue.

'''Daoud Bokhary''' ({{lang-ur|داوود بخاري}}, {{zh|包大衛}}, also spelled Daud Bokhary; born c. 1919) is a retired [[Hong Kong]] businessman.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Focus/GE26Dh01.html |periodical=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=2005-05-26 |accessdate=2008-01-09 |title=Good life fit for a hero |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526140254/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Focus/GE26Dh01.html |archivedate=26 May 2005 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{citation|title=Credibility: zero minus|first=Ardeshir|last=Cowasjee|date=1998-02-28|accessdate=2010-01-31|periodical=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|url=http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Dawn/1998/21Feb98.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bokhary was born near [[Peshawar]] in the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]] of British India (today part of [[Pakistan]]). He served in the [[Indian Army (1895–1947)|British Indian Army]] for four years as a logistics expert, and came to Hong Kong with the army on the first British ship after the [[surrender of Japan]] ended the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|occupation of Hong Kong]]. He briefly returned home to run a [[Coal mining|coal mine]], but, fearing for his wife's safety during the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, returned to Hong Kong with her and their first son soon after.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;

==Career in Hong Kong==
Bokhary began his career in Hong Kong managing a dockside [[Warehouse|godown]], a position he found thanks to his army logistics experience. He received accolades and promotions for his ability to keep his workers happy, and his skilled handling of the growth in ship traffic resulting from the [[Communist Party of China]]'s takeover of [[Shanghai]]. He eventually came to manage an entire wharf, and with his increased responsibilities, began taking night classes in [[accountancy]] at the [[University of Hong Kong]]. He retired from his wharf position in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;

For his second career, Bokhary went into [[day trading]], and together with his elder son founded his own company, Bokhary Securities; he wanted to be his own boss, and believed that his religion and ethnicity would keep him out of managerial positions at the big financial corporations which then dominated securities trading in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Outside of his work, Bokhary is engaged in various philanthropic activities. He pays for the upkeep of a mosque in his hometown in Pakistan, and also served as a treasurer on the council of the [[Diocesan Girls' School]], an [[Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui|Anglican]] school, and on one occasion helped it out of financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dgs.edu.hk/popup/speechday1.html|title=The Rededication Ceremony, Cake-Cutting Ceremony and Speech Day 98-99|date=January 2000|publisher=Diocesan Girls' School|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he prefers not to have any buildings named after him in return for his donations.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;

==Identity==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = I did very well in my jobs and was very well treated. Hong Kong was a British city and a Chinese city. You cannot concern yourself too much with that sort of thing ... I have always said this to fellow Indians and Pakistanis who complain: 'Nobody invited you here. If you don't like it you can always go straight back home'.
 |source = Daoud Bokhary&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;
 |width  = 25%
 |align  = right
}}

Bokhary holds [[Pakistani nationality law|Pakistani nationality]].&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt; He is critical of the Pakistani government's corruption and poor governance, noting that [[overseas Pakistani]]s such as himself achieve successes which they could never match at home due to the lack of an environment which rewards hard work. When asked by a journalist whether he invested in Pakistan, he reportedly responded, "Having conversed with me for an hour, do you really take me to be such a damned fool?"&lt;ref name="Dawn"/&gt;

Though his career development has been limited by his ethnic background, Bokhary takes a philosophical attitude towards the discrimination faced by him and other [[South Asians in Hong Kong]], and feels gratitude for being allowed to settle in Hong Kong. He also admonishes younger South Asian immigrants for their anti-discrimination activism, and suggests that they would feel less affected by racism if they focused more on learning about religion.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;

==Family==
Bokhary's wife died in the 1970s. He formerly owned land in Peshawar near his hometown, but sold it when he realised that neither he nor his sons wanted to settle in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;

Syed Bagh Ali Shah Bokhary is Daoud Bokhary's eldest son.&lt;ref name="TheStandard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Carney |first=John |title=Amina's friends and family in high places |accessdate=2011-05-11 |url=http://topics.scmp.com/news/whorunshk/article/Aminas-friends-and-family-in-high-places |date=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721181934/http://topics.scmp.com/news/whorunshk/article/Aminas-friends-and-family-in-high-places |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited the brokerage business when Daoud Bokhary retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=家世顯赫頻惹官非 (From a good family but frequently getting into trouble with the law)|periodical=Hong Kong Daily News|url=http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=83716|date=2010-01-29|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=SFC Reprimands Bokhary Securities Limited and Syed Bagh Ali Shah Bokhary|date=2003-12-29|accessdate=2010-01-29|periodical=Enforcement News|publisher=Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong|url=http://www.sfc.hk/sfcPressRelease/EN/sfcOpenDocServlet?docno=03PR287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bagh Ali's daughter [[Amina Mariam Bokhary]] was notable for her legal problems in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="TheStandard20081203"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=21&amp;art_id=75193&amp;sid=21725207&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20081203&amp;fc=4 |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |title=Sobering times for judge's niece |periodical=The Standard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604035613/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=21&amp;art_id=75193&amp;sid=21725207&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20081203&amp;fc=4 |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.singpao.com/NewsArticle.aspx?NewsID=74459&amp;Lang=tc |title=撞車拒吹波波 包致金姪女摑警員 (Refuses breathalyzer after car accident; Judge Kemal Bokhary's niece attacks police officer) |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2010-01-29 |periodical=Sing Pao |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151729/http://www.singpao.com/NewsArticle.aspx?NewsID=74459&amp;Lang=tc |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Wen Wei Po|url=http://paper.wenweipo.com/2010/01/28/HK1001280015.htm|date=2010-01-28|accessdate=2010-01-29|title=叔大法官 舅夏佳理 (Paternal uncle a big judge; maternal uncle Ronald Arculli)", Wen Wei Po, 28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delivery''' is the process of transporting goods from a source location to a predefined destination. There are different delivery types. [[Cargo]] (physical goods) are primarily delivered via [[roads]] and [[Rail transport|railroads]] on land, shipping lanes on the sea and [[airline]] networks in the air. Certain specialized goods may be delivered via other networks, such as [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] for liquid goods, [[power grids]] for electrical power and [[computer networks]] such as the [[Internet]] or [[broadcasting|broadcast]] networks for electronic information.&lt;ref name="Nishio Kishino 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Nishio | first=S. | last2=Kishino | first2=F. | title=Advanced Multimedia Content Processing: First International Conference, AMCP'98, Osaka, Japan, November 9-11, 1998, Proceedings | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | year=2003 | isbn=978-3-540-48962-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQdrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 | page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general process of delivering goods is known as [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. The study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called [[logistics]]. Firms that specialize in delivering commercial goods from point of production or storage to [[point of sale]] are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as [[Package delivery|delivery services]]. [[Mail|Postal]], [[courier]], and [[relocation services]] also deliver goods for commercial and private interests.

==Consumer goods delivery==

Most consumer goods are delivered from a point of production ([[factory]] or [[farm]]) through one or more points of storage ([[warehouse]]s) to a point of sale ([[retail store]]), where the consumer buys the good and is responsible for its transportation to point of consumption. There are many variations on this model for specific types of goods and modes of sale. Products sold via catalogue or the Internet may be delivered directly from the manufacturer or warehouse to the consumer's home, or to an [[Packstation|automated delivery booth]]. Small manufacturers may deliver their products directly to retail stores without warehousing.

Some manufacturers maintain [[factory outlet]]s which serve as both warehouse and retail store, selling products directly to consumers at wholesale prices (although many retail stores falsely advertise as factory outlets). Building, construction, landscaping and like materials are generally delivered to the consumer by a contractor as part of another service. Some highly perishable or hazardous goods, such as [[radioisotopes]] used in [[medical imaging]], are delivered directly from manufacturer to consumer.

Home delivery is often available for [[fast food]] and other convenience products, e.g. [[pizza delivery]].&lt;ref name="Haig 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Haig | first=M. | title=Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive &amp; Survive | publisher=Kogan Page | series=Kogan Page Series | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7494-4826-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4AJ0AU58a4C&amp;pg=PA277 | page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes home delivery of [[supermarket]] goods is possible.&lt;ref name="Hill Jones Schilling 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hill | first=C.W.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G.R. | last3=Schilling | first3=M.A. | title=Strategic Management: Theory &amp; Cases: An Integrated Approach | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-305-14272-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0PAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SL3-PA59 | page=3-PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A milk float is a small [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV), specifically designed for the delivery of fresh [[milk]]. A new form of delivery is emerging on the horizon of the internet age: Delivery by the crowd e.g. crowd delivery. In this concept an individual not necessarily contracted by the vendor performs the delivery of goods to the destination. Sometimes, private [[courier]] companies will also deliver [[consumer goods]] on a regular basis for companies like [[E-commerce]] businesses.

==Delivery vehicles==
{{See also|Autonomous car}}
[[File:An ASDA Mercedes Benz Sprinter delivery van.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asda|ASDA]] [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] vans for delivering groceries to customers' doors]]
[[File:Worksman delivery trike.jpg|thumb|Delivery tricycle]]
[[File:Commercial. Elmhurst Dairy BAnQ P48S1P07599.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn dairy delivery vehicle in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada in 1942]]
The consumer demand for Supermarkets to deliver to their door created the need for a mixed temperature controlled vehicle on 3.5T chassis. These vehicle bodies were initially built with the traditional GRP sandwich panels but as more damage resistant lightweight materials with better insulation properties have become available companies have been developing Advanced Home Delivery Vehicles. The 2012 Commercial Vehicle Show in the UK saw the new JDC PolyBilt design, one of the latest of these "Plastic" bodies that can also be recycled at the end of its service life unlike the traditional GRP which ends up as landfill.

Vehicles are often specialized to deliver different types of goods. On land, [[semi-trailer]]s are outfitted with various [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] such as box trailers, flatbeds, car carriers, tanks and other specialized trailers, while [[railroad]] [[trains]] include similarly specialized cars. [[Armored car (valuables)|Armored cars]], [[dump truck]]s and [[concrete mixer]]s are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, [[merchant ships]] come in various forms, such as [[cargo ship]]s, [[oil tankers]] and [[fishing boat]]s. [[Freight aircraft]] are used to deliver cargo.

Often, [[passenger]] vehicles are used for delivery of goods. These include [[buses]], [[van]]s, [[Pickup truck|pick-ups]], [[Automobile|cars]] (e.g., for mail or pizza delivery), [[motorcycles]] and [[bicycles]] (e.g., for newspaper delivery). A significant amount of freight is carried in the cargo holds of passenger ships and aircraft. Everyday travelers, known as a [[casual courier]], can also be used to deliver goods.

Delivery to remote, primitive or inhospitable areas may be accomplished using [[general aviation|small aircraft]], [[snowmobiles]], [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[dog sled]]s, [[pack animal]]s, on foot, or by a variety of other transport methods.

==Periodic deliveries==
Some products are delivered to consumers on a periodic schedule.&lt;ref name="Golden Raghavan Wasil 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last=Golden | first=B.L. | last2=Raghavan | first2=S. | last3=Wasil | first3=E.A. | title=The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges | publisher=Springer US | series=Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces Series | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-387-77778-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3ta5ne3-owC&amp;pg=PA93 | page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, home delivery of many goods was much more common in urban centres of the developed world. At the beginning of the 20th century, perishable farm items such as milk, eggs and ice, were delivered weekly or even daily to customers by local farms. [[Milkmen]] delivered milk and other farm produce. With the advent of home refrigeration and better distribution methods, these products are today largely delivered through the same retail distribution systems as other food products. [[Iceman (occupation)|Icemen]] delivered ice for [[iceboxes]] until the popularization of home refrigerator rendered them obsolete in most places. Similarly, laundry was once picked up and washed at a commercial [[laundry]] before being delivered to middle-class homes until the appearance of the [[washing machine]] and [[Clothes dryer|dryer]] (the lower classes washed their own and the upper classes had live-in servants). Likewise deliveries of coal and wood for home heating were more common until they were replaced in many areas by [[natural gas]], oil, or electric heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view_rew?CONTENT_ID=2786|title=The days of door-to-door delivery|date=11 March 2010|last=Herzog|first=Lawrence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308202349/http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view_rew?CONTENT_ID=2786|archive-date=8 March 2012|work=Edmonton Real Estate Weekly: It's Our Heritage|volume=28|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some products, most notably [[home heating oil]], are still delivered periodically. Human blood may be delivered to hospitals on a periodic schedule.&lt;ref name="Golden Raghavan Wasil 2008"/&gt;

Milk delivery continued until the mid-twentieth century across North America. For example, the last milk delivery by horse-and-wagon in [[Edmonton]] was in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epl.ca/infofile-detail?subject_detail=Milk%20Delivery%20-%20Edmonton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829062550/http://www.epl.ca/infofile-detail?subject_detail=Milk%20Delivery%20-%20Edmonton|archive-date=29 August 2012|title=Infofile Detail - Milk Delivery - Edmonton| publisher=Edmonton Public Library}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milkman joke]]s continue in circulation long after. Related lines of [[Jeannie C. Riley]]'s 1968 hit song "[[Harper Valley PTA]]" say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''There's old Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he's asked me for a date,&lt;br /&gt;And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Plot==
Naomi Bishop ([[Anna Gunn]]) is a senior [[investment bank]]er who deals with [[IPO]]s. After her latest project is undervalued she faces professional setbacks including clients losing confidence in her work. To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform. 

Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan ([[Alysia Reiner]]), an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor ([[James Purefoy]]), a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in [[insider trading]]. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails. 

While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable. Despite having a nagging feeling that something is wrong, the numbers check out and Naomi continues to try to sell the shares of the company to investors. Michael, who has had no new insider trading tips to pass on to his friends at investment firm Titanite, tries unsuccessfully to hack into Naomi's phone.

Vice President Erin Manning (Sarah Megan Thomas), Naomi's assistant on the IPO, learns that Marin has been fired. To warn Naomi of this, she goes to Michael's home after not being able to reach Naomi and ends up leaking the information to him in the hope that he will be able to get her a promotion, something Naomi has been unable to do for her. Michael leaks the tips to his friends at Titanite and then sends the story to an old college roommate who is a tech journalist.

Naomi figures out that it was Erin who betrayed her, based on her having a green pen, the same type of pen that Michael uses. When the shares open, confidence is lost and the company loses a third of its value on the first day of trading. 

Michael changes jobs to Titanite, neglecting to take Erin with him. Naomi is fired, while Erin assumes her position. Unable to crack the case from the outside, Samantha interviews for a high-paying corporate position, saying that she is in it for the money using words from a speech she heard Naomi give at an alumni event.

On [[review aggregator]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 81%, based on 84 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 6.4/10.

[[Ignatiy Vishnevetsky]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote: "''Equity'' may not be the fanciest or flashiest of financial thrillers—more like off-brand [[David Fincher]] or [[Steven Soderbergh]]—but it gets the job done. Its major players are all women trying to make careers in boys’ club professions [...]; that's all the motivation the movie offers and perhaps all that it really needs. It skips past the usual handwringing over the temptations of capitalist wealth and just gets right to the risk-taking and double-crossing, assuming (rightly) that viewers don't need a character to have a backstory, a tragic secret, and a dead spouse, best friend, or parent to understand why they'd do anything to hold on to a career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vishnevetsky|first1=Ignatiy|title=A woman fights to hold on to her career on Wall Street in Equity |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/woman-fights-hold-her-career-wall-street-equity-240164 |website=[[The A.V.

'''Expander System Sweden AB''' is a Swedish company that designs, manufactures, and sells a pivot-pin system for commercial heavy machinery and equipment.  Their headquarters is in [[Åtvidaberg]], [[Sweden]]. It was founded in 1986 by Everth and Roger Svensson. The Expander Group includes two subsidiaries, Expander Americas Inc, in the [[United States]], and Expander Deutschland GmbH, in [[Germany]].

The expander system consists of patented products that are intended to take the place of conventional pivot pins in [[heavy machinery]] and equipment. Conventional pivot pins may wear in a way that requires a costly repair process for pivot lug holes, called [[Boring (manufacturing)|line boring]]. The expander system uses expansion sleeves that can eliminate this wear problem.

'''Glen Tonche''' is an [[Estate (land)|estate]] atop Mount Tonche, in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], near [[Shokan, New York|Shokan]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

The estate's house was built in 1928 as the summer family compound of American businessman [[Raymond Pitcairn]], whose family founded [[PPG Industries]].

==Design==
Under Pitcairn ownership the {{convert|18740|sqft|0|adj=on|abbr=off}} compound on {{convert|22|acre|0|abbr=off}} was largely made up of two main wings connected by a covered walkway. The balance of Mount Tonche{{spaced ndash}} over {{convert|1000|acre|km2|abbr=off}}{{spaced ndash}} is under restrictive preservation.

The property as a whole reflects a blend of [[Tudor architecture|Tudor-style architecture]] with some [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts-and-Crafts]] influences. The south wing was a [[pentagon]] configuration housing the main kitchen, two servants' quarters, six guest bedrooms, six full baths, and a massive glass-enclosed mountaintop porch. The wing also featured a 29-by-36-foot dining hall capable of seating 100 or more guests. The north wing housed the library, eleven bedrooms, seven full baths and two-and-one-half baths, three-room servant's quarters, as well as a great room with {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall|abbr=off}} floor-to-ceiling windows and {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|abbr=off}} vaulted ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970329183633/http://adirondackrealestate.com/glentonche.html "Rob Grant &amp; Associates Real Estate"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfer from Pitcairn ownership==
The estate remained in the Pitcairn family until it was put on the market in 1995 for $3.9 million, then $2.9 million, then in late 1998 down to $1.95 million,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206051110/http://adirondackrealestate.com/html/glentonche.html "Rob Grant &amp; Associates Real Estate{{spaced ndash}} Adirondack Real Estate, Catskills Mountains Estate, Hudson Valley Retreat, New York Real Estate, Adirondack Real Estate, Catskills Mountains Estate, Hudson Valley Retreat, New York Real Estate, Adirondack Real Estate"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; at which time it was sold to photographer and musician Randall Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/press/00/0307bowiesbower.htm|title=Bowie's Bower| work = [[The New York Observer]]|date= July 21, 2003|author=Golson, Blair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allaire Studios==
The first record recorded at Allaire was ''Harvest Home'' by Jay Ungar in 1999. The studio was then substantially renovated and reopened in 2001 and has remained open since then &lt;ref&gt;Randall Wallace, owner of Glen Tonche/Allaire Studios (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;where rock musician [[David Bowie]] recorded his album ''[[Heathen (David Bowie album)|Heathen]]'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=1769&amp;dept_id=74969&amp;newsid=9940385&amp;PAG=461&amp;rfi=9|title=Ch-Ch-Change of Scenery Awaits Bowie in Shokan| work = [[Daily Freeman]] |author=Smith, Jesse J.|date= August 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his next one, ''[[Reality (David Bowie album)|Reality]]'' (2003) &lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Reality/release/4189179&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[singer-songwriter]] [[Norah Jones]] recorded her debut album ''[[Come Away with Me]]'' (2002). During five weeks in late 2006, the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] recorded the album ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/SAlyrics.htm/ "Rush Snakes &amp; Arrows"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resale==
Reconfigured from the Pitcairn ownership the main house included nineteen bedrooms with three separate apartments on the property. The estate was listed on the market in 2007/2008 with an asking price of $13 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Real Estate Listings Page|url=http://www.heathercronerrealestate.com/our_list_view.cgi?pid=69|accessdate= January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed span|date=June 2012|text=However, the property was removed from the formal market in the first quarter of 2008.}} The property returned on the market in June 2009 at {{convert|22|acre|m2}} for a price of $8,850,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagegreenrealty.com/idx/residential/20092755/details.html].&lt;/ref&gt;  Unsold it was removed from the market. In June 2012, Wallace indicated that he would again be relisting the property for sale in the near future for $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/realestate/zeus-of-the-catskills.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Glen Tonche was permanently withdrawn from the market and restored and reopened as the recording studio Allaire Studios, managed by its owner Randall Wallace and his wife Janet who live on-site.

'''Howard Homan Buffett''' (August 13, 1903 – April 30, 1964) was an American businessman, investor, and politician. He was a four-term [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[United States Representative]] for the state of [[Nebraska]]. He was the father of [[Warren Buffett]], the famed American billionaire businessman and investor.

==Early life==
Howard Buffett was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] to Henrietta Duvall Buffett and Ernest P. Buffett, owners of a grocery business. Ernest P. Buffett's paternal ancestors hail from northern Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/06/11/100060549/index.htm?cnn=yes|title=The Buffett mystery&amp;nbsp; - June 11, 2007|first=By Matthew Boyle, Fortune|last=writer|website=archive.fortune.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffett attended [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] and graduated from the [[University of Nebraska]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] in 1925. While a student, Buffett was a brother of the [[Alpha Sigma Phi|Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity]]. He married Leila Stahl on December 27, 1925. The Buffetts were active members of Dundee Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpcomaha.org/|title=Dundee Presbyterian Church, Omaha website|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to secure a job in the family grocery business, he started a small stock brokerage firm.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Schroeder, The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life  (Random House, Inc., 2009) books.google.com/books?id=OdpWOjo7EeQC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ({{ISBN|0553384619}}, {{ISBN|978-0-553-38461-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Entering the [[investment]] business, Buffett also served on the Omaha [[board of education]] from 1939 to 1942. In 1942 he ran for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in the Nebraska district in which Omaha was located. In that election, Buffett was seen as "a Republican [[sacrificial lamb]] in [[Nebraska's 2nd congressional district|Nebraska's second district]] when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]] was a popular wartime leader."&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Klein, Philip (2011-09-20) [http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/buffett-vs-buffett Buffett's dad was the Ron Paul of his day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119122137/http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/buffett-vs-buffett |date=2012-01-19 }}, ''[[Washington Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he went on to win the Republican nomination in the [[primary election|primary]] and then the subsequent [[general election]].

He was reelected twice. In 1948 he again was the Republican nominee for another term, but was defeated for reelection; however, he was the Republican nominee for the office again in 1950 and won the office back. In 1952 Buffett decided against seeking another term and returned to his investment business in Omaha, [[Buffett-Falk &amp; Co.]], in which he worked until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;"Howard Buffett." ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''.[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B001039]&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as the campaign manager for conservative Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] in Taft's [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1952|1952 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name=Dionne/&gt;

According to [[Warren Buffett]] biographer [[Roger Lowenstein]]:

{{quote|'Unshakably ethical, Howard refused offers of junkets and even turned down a part of his pay. During his first term, when congressional salary was raised from $10,000 to $12,500, Howard left the extra money in the Capitol disbursement office, insisting that he had been elected at the lower salary.' His wife said he considered only one issue when deciding whether or not to vote for a bill: 'Will this add to, or subtract from, human liberty?'&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;}}

==Political philosophy==
Howard Buffett is remembered for his highly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] stance, having maintained a friendship with [[Murray Rothbard]] for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph R. Stromberg|Stromberg, Joseph]], [http://www.antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=3398 The Old Cause, "Howard Homan Buffett: An American Original" (April 24, 2001)], ''[[Antiwar.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He "would invariably draw 'zero' ratings from the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] and other [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] groups."&lt;ref name=Chronicles&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard45.html Life in the Old Right], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]'', first published in ''[[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]]'', August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffett was a vocal critic of the [[Truman Doctrine]] and the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt; Of the Truman Doctrine, he said: "Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns."&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Laurence (2006-12-04) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance98.html Bill Kauffman: American Anarchist], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Buffett was also "one of the major voices in Congress opposed to the [[Korean War|Korean adventure]],"&lt;ref name=Chronicles/&gt; and "was convinced that the United States was largely responsible for the eruption of [[Korean War|conflict in Korea]]; for the rest of his life he tried unsuccessfully to get the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] to declassify the testimony of [[CIA]] head Admiral [[Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter]], which Buffett told [Rothbard] established American responsibility for the Korean outbreak."&lt;ref name=Rothbard&gt;[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the floor of Congress, he said of [[military interventionism]] that,

{{quote|Even if it were desirable, America is not strong enough to police the world by military force. If that attempt is made, the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home. Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns. Persuasion and example are the methods taught by the Carpenter of Nazareth, and if we believe in Christianity we should try to advance our ideals by his methods. We cannot practice might and force abroad and retain freedom at home. We cannot talk world cooperation and practice power politics.&lt;ref name=Rothbard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Kauffman]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=4OrJGe4qA04C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Ain't my America: the long, noble history of antiwar conservatism and Middle American anti-imperialism] (Macmillan, 2008), pg. 114   ({{ISBN|0805082441}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8244-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the summer of 1962, he wrote "an impassioned plea ... for the abolition of the [[Conscription|draft]]" in the ''[[New Individualist Review]]''.&lt;ref name=Dionne&gt;[[E.J. Dionne|Dionne, E.J.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQMAsT7HlEsC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=%22E.J.+Dionne%22+%22Murray+Rothbard%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z_wxxTdy3h&amp;sig=FbkKdViAPcEfBAUuJXDIRBjXjRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LQROTci7Fc_UgAfFtaUU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Why Americans Hate Politics], pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Buffett wrote:

{{quote|When the American government conscripts a boy to go 10,000 miles to the jungles of Asia without a declaration of war by Congress (as required by the Constitution) what freedom is safe at home? Surely, profits of [[U.S. Steel]] or your private property are not more sacred than a young man's right to life.&lt;ref name=Dionne/&gt;}}

In addition to non-interventionism overseas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://townhall.com/columnists/ryanjamesgirdusky/2012/02/01/the-other-buffett-rule-n1298094|title=The Other Buffett Rule|first=Ryan James|last=Girdusky|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard Buffett strongly supported the [[gold standard]] because he believed it would limit the ability of government to inflate the money supply and spend beyond its means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig12/buffett1.1.1.html|title=Human Freedom Rests on Gold Redeemable Money - LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Warren Buffett]] is not an advocate of the gold standard.&lt;ref&gt;French, Doug (2009-04-03) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/french/french112.html The Trouble With Warren Buffett], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary North (economist)|North, Gary]] (2010-05-29) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north849.html The Wall Street Journal's War On Gold], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia was formed with the granting of a [[Royal Charter]] on 19 June 1928, to Thomas Brentnall, George Mason Allard and Henry Joshua Wise on behalf of the public accountants of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/accfinwp/68 | title=Some Professionalisation Strategies Of Australian Accountancy | publisher=School of Accounting &amp; Finance, University of Wollongong | work=Working Paper 2 | year=1995 | accessdate=12 December 2013 | author=Cooper, K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ISSN=1548-6583 | url=http://www.davidpublishing.org/DownLoad/?id=7815 | title=The Accounting Profession: A Descriptive Study of the Common and Code Law Countries | author=Altintas, Nalan | journal=Journal of Modern Accounting and Auditing |date=July 2012 | volume= 8 | issue= 7 | pages=932–950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICAA was the first accountancy body outside the United Kingdom to receive a Royal Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.cengagebrain.com/content/jones82010_0170182010_02.01_chapter01.pdf | title=Financial Accounting Theory, 3rd Edition | publisher=Cengage Learning Australia | author=Jones, Stewart | year=2010 | location=Victoria Australia | isbn=9780170182010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 1929 The Earl Marshal of England granted the current arms to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/241140?uid=3737536&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102546083277 | title=Comparative Professional Accountancy - Australia | author=Murphy, Mary | journal=The Accounting Review |date=Jan 1959 | volume=34 | issue=1 | pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms include the Latin motto 'Nec Timens Nec Favens' which translates to 'Without Fear or Favour'.

The Institute now operates under a Supplemental Royal Charter (amended from time to time) granted by the [[Governor-General]] on behalf of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 19 August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/files/documents/Institute_Supplemental_Royal_Charter2005.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand===
After voting on the merger with the [[New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants]] the bodies formed [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] 31 December 2014.

CA ANZ is a professional body of over 120,000 Chartered Accountants around the world. CA ANZ focuses on the education and lifelong learning of its members, and on advocacy and thought leadership in areas of public interest and business.

==Admission to membership==
To become a member of the Institute, Chartered Accountants complete the Chartered Accountants Program which includes study of the Graduate Diploma in Chartered Accounting (GradDipCA) and three years of practical experience. Entry to the Program is available for graduates who hold an accounting degree, however those holding non-accounting degrees may also be permitted entry after some additional requirements are met.

===Accounting degree===

To take this path you will have either a bachelor or master's degree in commerce, business or accounting from an Institute accredited Australian university.  The commerce and business degrees will require a major in accounting, in order to qualify.

===Non Accounting degree===

There are three routes for non-accounting graduates can take to qualify for the Chartered Accountants Program:
# Institute accredited Graduate Conversion course: Available from most Australian universities
# Entrance exam: Available for non-accounting graduates with significant on-the-job accounting experience and employer support
# A Graduate Certificate of Chartered Accounting Foundations from Deakin University.

===Graduate Diploma in Chartered Accounting===
The GradDipCA component of the Chartered Accountants Program consists of the following five modules which each take approximately 14 weeks of part-time study to complete:
* Auditing and Assurance
* Taxation
* Management Accounting and Applied Finance (As of 1 January 2013)
* Financial Accounting and Reporting
* Capstone (as of 1 January 2014)

The Institute is the only Australian professional accounting body that is a government accredited Higher Education provider.
Unlike other Australian accounting designations, the Chartered Accountants Program leads to the awarding of a Graduate Diploma.
The Australian Chartered Accountant qualification is recognised as an “approved qualification” - a significant requirement for auditor registration purposes in the UK.

===Practical experience===
To meet the practical experience requirements to become a Chartered Accountant in Australia, you must:
# Be employed with an organisation recognised by the Institute for at least 17.5hpw whilst completing the GradDipCA
# Recording your work experience with a Chartered Accountant mentor
# Apply for full membership after completing the GradDipCA and accumulating at least three years of practical work experience.

==Membership==

There are a number for different membership categories:

* Members: Have the designation CA after their name.
* Fellows: Have the designation FCA (Fellow Chartered Accountant) after their name. These members have been nominated for advancement Fellowship and have been a continuous member for 10 years and have been in a senior position for seven years. To be advanced to Fellow the member must have demonstrated 'leadership'
* Affiliate membership: Have an accounting degree and at least five years membership, but have not completed the Chartered Accountants Program.
* Teacher of Accountancy: For teachers to obtain membership, they are required to have completed a Doctorate or Masters by research with a major in an accounting related field, held a senior academic position for not less than five years, have appropriate Australian Taxation and Corporation Law knowledge and have references from two Chartered Accountants and their Head of School, and another significant academic
* Certificate of Public Practice: Firms or members who offer their services to the public as 'Chartered Accountants'.

==Continuing education==

Chartered Accountants continue their education to ensure they are able to provide the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. A Chartered Accountant must complete a total of 120 hours of Continuing Professional Education every three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/Members/Training-requirements/How-to-meet-the-requirements/FAQs-Training-requirements | title=FAQs Training requirements | publisher=ICAA | accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical Standards==
The institute collaborates with [[CPA Australia]] and the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] in supporting the [[Accounting Professional &amp; Ethical Standards Board]] (APESB), founded in 2006.
APESB publishes ethics-related standards that must be followed by accountants in Australia based on the international standards published by the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Aims of IVHM==
The aims of IVHM are to enable better management of vehicle and vehicle fleet health.
*Improve [[safety]] through use of diagnostics and prognostics to fix faults before they are an issue.
*Improve [[availability]] through better maintenance [[Planned maintenance|scheduling]]
*Improve [[reliability (engineering)|reliability]] through a more thorough understanding of the current health of the system and prognosis based maintenance
*Reduce total cost of maintenance through reduction of unnecessary maintenance and avoidance of unscheduled [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance]]

This is achieved through correct use of reliable sensing and prognosis systems to monitor part health and also using usage data to assist in understanding the load experienced and likely future vehicle load.

==History==

===Origins===
It has been suggested that IVHM as a named concept has been around since the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;Aaseng, G.B. Blueprint for an integrated vehicle health management system.  In proceedings of the 20th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, Daytona Beach, Florida, USA, 14–18 October, vol. 1, pp. 3.C.1-1-3.C.1-11&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, there does not seem to be much in the way of written evidence of this.  IVHM as a concept grew out of popular aviation maintenance methods.  It was a natural next step from condition based maintenance.  As sensors improved and our understanding of the systems concerned grew, it became possible to not just detect failure but also to predict it.  The high unit cost &amp; high maintenance cost of aircraft &amp; spacecraft made any advance in maintenance methods very attractive.  
[[NASA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/humaninspace/humansinspace-ivhm.html&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first organisations to use the name IVHM to describe how they wanted to approach maintenance of spacecraft in the future.  They created NASA-CR-192656,&lt;ref&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  Research and technology goals and objectives for integrated vehicle health management (IVHM). Report NASA-CR-192656, October 1992, NASA Technical Reports Server https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930013844&amp;hterms=192656&amp;qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallpartial%2520%26Ntk%3DAll%26N%3D0%26Ntt%3D192656&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 with the assistance of the General Research Corporation and the Orbital Technologies Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orbitec.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a goals &amp; objectives document in which they discussed the technology and maintenance concepts that they believed would be necessary to enhance safety while reducing maintenance costs in their next generation vehicles.  Many companies since then have become interested in IVHM and body of literature has increased substantially.  There are now IVHM solutions for many different types of vehicle from the [[Joint Strike Fighter (video game)|JSF]] to commercial haulage vehicles.

===First space prognostics===
The first published history of predicting spacecraft equipment failures occurred on the 12 Rockwell/U.S. Air Force Global Positioning System Block I (Phase 1) satellites using non-repeatable transient events (NRTE) and GPS Kalman filter data from the GPS Master Control Station, between 1978 and 1984 by the GPS Space and Ground Segment Manager. NRTEs were isolated to the GPS satellites after mission operations support personnel replayed the real-time satellite telemetry ruling out RF and land-line noise caused from poor [[Eb/No]] or [[Signal-to-noise ratio|S/N]] and data acquisition and display system processing problems. The GPS satellite's subsystem equipment vendors diagnosed the NRTEs as systemic noise that preceded the equipment failures because at the time, it was believed that all equipment failures occurred instantaneously and randomly and so equipment failures could not be predicted (e.g. equipment failures exhibited memoryless behavior). Rockwell International GPS Systems Engineering Manager ordered a stop to predicting GPS satellite equipment failures in 1983 claiming it wasn't possible and the company was not on contract to do so. The prognostic analysis that was completed on the GPS satellite telemetry was published quarterly contractually as a CDRL to the GPS Program Office personnel and a wide variety of Air Force subcontractors working on the GPS program.

===Further development===
One of the key milestones in the creation of IVHM for aircraft was the series of [[ARINC]] standards that enabled different manufacturers to create equipment that would work together and be able to send diagnostic data from the aircraft to the maintenance organisation on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Sudolsky, M; ARINC 573/717, 767 and 647A: The Logical choice for Maintenance recording and IVHM Interface Control or Frame Updates, Annual Conference of the Prognostics and Heath Management Society, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ACARS]] is frequently used to communicate maintenance and operational data between the flight crew and the ground crew.  This has led to concepts which have been adopted in IVHM.

Another milestone was the creation of [[health and usage monitoring systems]](HUMS) for [[helicopters]] operating in support of the [[Drilling rig|Oil rigs]] in the [[North Sea]].  This is key concept that usage data can be used to assist maintenance planning.
[[FOQA]] or Flight Data systems are similar to HUMS as they monitor the vehicle usage.  They are useful for IVHM in the same way as they allow the usage of the vehicle to be thoroughly understood which aids in the design of future vehicles.  It also allows excessive loads and usage to be identified and corrected.  For example, if an aircraft was experiencing frequent heavy landings the maintenance schedule for the undercarriage could be changed to ensure that they are not wearing too fast under the increased load.  The load carried by the aircraft could be lessened in future or operators could be given additional training to improve the quality of the landings.

The growing nature of this field led [[Boeing]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boeing.co.uk/ViewContent.do?id=41525&amp;aContent=Integrated%20Vehicle%20Health%20Management%20Centre&lt;/ref&gt; to set up an IVHM centre with [[Cranfield University]] in 2008 to act as a world leading research hub.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/ivhm/aboutus/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The IVHM centre has since then offered the world's first IVHM Msc course and hosts several PhD students researching the application of IVHM to different fields.

==Philosophy==
[[File:IVHM Graphic.pdf|thumb|center|upright=3|This graphic depicts the information flow within the IVHM concept as described by Professor Ian Jennions et al. of the IVHM Centre, Cranfield University. This graphic also appears in a similar form in the 2011 IVHM book.&lt;ref&gt;Jennions, I.K, Integrated Vehicle Health Management: Perspectives on an Emerging Field URL:http://books.sae.org/book-r-405&lt;/ref&gt;]]
IVHM is concerned not just with the current condition of the vehicle but also with health across its whole [[:wikt:life cycle|life cycle]].  IVHM examines the vehicle health against the vehicle usage data and within the context of similar information for other vehicles within the fleet.  In use vehicles display unique usage [[characteristic subgroup|characteristics]] and also some characteristics common across the fleet.  Where usage data and system health data is available these can be analysed to identify these characteristics.  This is useful in the 
Identification of problems unique to one vehicle as well as identifying trends in vehicle degradation across the entire fleet.

IVHM is a concept for the complete maintenance life cycle of a vehicle (or machine plant installation).  It makes extensive use of [[embedded system|embedded]] [[sensors]] and self-monitoring equipment combined with [[prognostics]] and [[diagnostic]] reasoning.  In the case of vehicles it is typical for there to be a data acquisition module on-board and a diagnostic unit.  Some vehicles can transfer selected data back to base while in use through various rf systems.  Whenever the vehicle is at base the data is also transferred to a set of maintenance computers that also process that data for a deeper understanding of the true health of the vehicle.  The usage of the vehicle can also be matched to the degradation of parts and improve the [[prognostics]] prediction accuracy.

The remaining useful life is used to plan replacement or repair of the part at some convenient time prior to failure.  The inconvenience of taking the vehicle out of service is balanced against the cost of unscheduled maintenance to ensure that the part is replaced at the optimum point prior to failure.  This process has been compared to the process of choosing when to buy financial options as the cost of scheduled maintenance must be balanced against the risk of failure and the cost of unscheduled maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, G.; Sandborn, P.; Pecht, M; ," Using Real Options to Manage Condition-Based Maintenance Enabled by PHM", 2011 IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management, Denver, Colorado, 20–23 June 2011 URL: http://www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/2011/Real-Options_Manage_Condition-based_PHM_abstract.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This differs from [[Condition-based maintenance]](CBM) where the part is replaced once it has failed or once a threshold is passed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifetime-reliability.com/free-articles/maintenance-management/condition-based-maintenance.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This often involves taking the vehicle out of service with at an inconvenient time when it could be generating revenue.  It is preferable to use an IVHM approach to replace it at the most convenient time.  This allows the reduction in waste component life caused by replacing the part too early and also reducing cost incurred by unscheduled maintenance.  This is possible due to the increased prognostic distance provided by an IVHM solution. There are many technologies that are used in IVHM.  The field itself is still growing and many techniques are still being added to the body of knowledge.

==Architecture==
Health monitoring sensors are designed into the vehicle and report to a data processing unit.  Some of the data may be manipulated on board for immediate system diagnosis and prognosis.  Less time critical data is processed off board.  All the historical data for the vehicle can be compared with current performance to identify degradation trends at a more detailed level than could be done on board the vehicle.  This is all used to improve reliability and availability and the data is also fed back to the manufacturer for them to improve their product.&lt;ref&gt;Jennions, I.K; "The story so Far – Development of an IVHM Centre," 14th Australian International Aerospace Congress, 2 March 2011, URL:http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/ivhm/pdf/aiac14%20keynote.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A standard architecture for IVHM has been proposed as the OSA-CBM&lt;ref&gt;Swearingen, K.; Majkowski, W.; Bruggeman, B.; Gilbertson, D.; Dunsdon, J.; Sykes, B.; , "An Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance Overview," Aerospace Conference, 2007 IEEE  pp. 1-8, 3–10 March 2007; doi: 10.1109/AERO.2007.352921. URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4161678&amp;isnumber=4144550&lt;/ref&gt; standard which gives a structure for data gathering, analysis and action.  This is intended to facilitate interoperability between IVHM systems of different suppliers.
The key parts within OSA-CBM are
*Data acquisition (DA)
*Data manipulation (DM)
*State detection (SD)
*Health assessment (HA)
*Prognosis assessment (PA)
*Advisory generation (AG)
These are laid out within [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 13374&lt;ref&gt;ISO. Geneva, Switzerland, 2002, ISO 13374-1, Condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines – Data processing, communication and presentation – Part 1: General Guidelines. URL: http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=21832&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is not intended to replace safety critical warnings such as an aircraft's flight management system but instead to complement them and perhaps also leverage existing sensors for assistance with system health monitoring.  Ideal systems to monitor are those systems, subsystems &amp; structural elements which are likely to show graceful degradation so that they can be repaired or replaced at a convenient time prior to failure.  This gives a saving over condition based maintenance as once a part has failed often a vehicle cannot be used until repaired.  This often results in scheduling difficulties if the vehicle fails when it was needed for revenue generation and cannot be used.  In contrast IVHM can be used to replace the part during vehicle downtime prior to failure.  This ensures that it can continue to generate revenue as scheduled.

Communications between the vehicle and the maintenance organisation are crucial to fixing faults in a timely manner.  The balance of how much data should be sent to the maintainer during use and how much should be downloaded while in maintenance is a one that must be judged carefully.  One example of this is what is known as [[fault forwarding]]. When an aircraft experiences a fault the flight management system reports it to the flight crew but also sends a message through [[ACARS]] to the maintenance team so that they can start their maintenance planning before the aircraft has landed.  This yields a time advantage as they know some of the parts and personnel required to fix the fault before the aircraft has landed. However the communication link does cost money and has a limited bandwidth so the worth of this health &amp; usage data must be judged carefully with consideration given as to whether it should be transmitted or merely downloaded during the next maintenance or as part of the operator shutdown process.

A particular feature of inter-professional associations is that the membership is made up of associations that represent the individual chain professions. This is in contrast, for example, to commodity associations in the [[United States]] where membership is largely of individuals and companies. Many developing countries have few or no associations that cover an entire commodity chain and there would appear scope for the development of such organizations to promote improved liaison with governments.&lt;ref name="Shepherd"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Shepherd, A. W., Cadilhon, J-J and Galvez, E.|title=Commodity Associations – A tool for supply chain development?|url= ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/i0945e/i0945e00.pdf|year=2009|publisher= FAO|location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-professional associations in developing countries==
In developing countries, inter-professional associations are becoming an increasingly important form of participatory development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (John E. Lamb) (2012): Establishing and Strengthening Farmer, Commodity, and Interprofessional Associations. Agricultural and Rural Development, Washington&lt;/ref&gt; 
Factors influencing the importance of these associations in the development of the agro-food sector include:
* A clear definition of the mandate of the association;
* The level of resources at its disposal;
* The skills of its management and directors;
* The level of support and commitment from members towards the association.

The main functions of an association are to define, represent, defend and promote the interests of its members. Inter-professional associations are much more prevalent in Latin America than in other developing regions,&lt;ref&gt;Giuliani, E., Pietrobelli, C. &amp; Rabellotti R. 2005. Upgrading in Global Value Chains: Lessons from Latin American Clusters. World Development 33(4), 549–573&lt;/ref&gt; although French and Canadian government support has led to development of such associations in [[Francophone Africa]], based on the models from those two countries.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inter-reseaux.org/IMG/pdf/Panorama_des_interprofessions_GD.pdf Duteurtre, G. 2007. Panorama des organisations interprofessionnelles dans le monde. PACD, Sénégal.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia, the concept is even rarer. A notable exception is [[Vietnam]] where the government has encouraged the development of inter-professional organizations to help structure those sectors whose products have export potential, such as tea, coffee, and fruit.

'''Joshua Kwabena Siaw''', popularly known as '''J. K. Siaw''' (January 1923 – October 1986), was a [[Ghana]]ian [[industrialist]] and philanthropist, who in 1969 established Tata Brewery Ltd. – now known as [[Guinness Ghana Breweries]], also as Achimota Brewery Company (ABC). He is notable for opening the largest wholly African-owned brewery company in [[West Africa]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201504241848.html "Ghana: What Did Rawlings Know About Konadu's Acquisition Of National Assets?"] AllAfrica.com, 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 all his assets were confiscated by the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana|AFRC]] regime of Ghana under false allegations of tax evasion. He died in [[London]], in exile, in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=allgs&amp;gss=sfs28_ms_f-2_s&amp;new=1&amp;rank=1&amp;msT=1&amp;gsfn=Joshua%20Kwabena&amp;gsln=Siaw&amp;MSAV=0&amp;msbdy=1923&amp;cpxt=1&amp;cp=11&amp;catbucket=rstp&amp;uidh=000 Ancestry UK, "Joshua Kwabena Siaw - Ancestry UK".] Ancestry UK, accessed 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Joshua Kwabena Siaw was born in [[Obomeng]], a small town in the [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]] of Ghana, in January 1923. His father came from Akwaseho and his mother from [[Juaben]] in the [[Ashanti Region]]. J. K. Siaw worked with his father on a cocoa farm before attending school, aged 12, in 1935, and he took to basket-making as a way to make more money to further his own education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_Tata.html?id=uzPUAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Story of Tata''], "a very comprehensive account of the life of Mr. Joshua Kwabena Siaw ... one of Ghana's most prominent business men".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Teacher ===
In 1942, aged 19, Siaw became a teacher of Standard One class in [[Akwaseho]]. After a couple of months he went to work at the Orthodox Mission School and then to the Bremang Gold Dredging Company near Bogoso, in [[Ghana]]'s Western Region. After just one month, he went to Effiduase Banko to work again as a teacher from June 1943 to March 1945.
Siaw then went to work at the New Juaben Grammar School but left after a year because the headmaster, Mr. Sarkodea, was mismanaging the school. Siaw established Christ College in 1946 with his father, before apprenticing with a pharmacist for a year. Christ College evolved into Ghana Secondary School in Effiduase by 1976.&lt;!--- Therefore J. K. Siaw was contributing to Ghana’s education for decades before he became a well-known industrialist. (unnnecessary comment?)---&gt;

=== Cocoa broker ===
Siaw then decided to go into business and borrowed £50 (£1500.00 in 2013 relative value) to start up as a cocoa broker. In four months he had made £600 (£18,000.00 in 2013 relative value) profit. In April 1950 he became a siding clerk at Kwahu Praso, transporting cocoa to [[Accra]], Ghana's capital. He repaid the £200 security charge for the clerking employment with interest in six months and was bound for a further six months, by contract, but he decided to stay for only four.
In 1953 he worked as a siding clerk, this time for the Cocoa Purchasing Company, which paid £6 a month. He became a cocoa and timber transporter in 1954.

=== Entrepreneur ===
In 1957, he began selling enamelware until the [[Government of Ghana]] under [[Kwame Nkrumah]] banned the importation of those goods.

In 1964, Siaw's first request to the government to be granted permission to set up a brewery was rejected. He applied again in 1967 and that application too was rejected on the grounds that licences had been given to Ashanti and [[Takoradi]] breweries. Despite being offered an investment of 400,000 cedis from Siaw, Takoradi brewery could not happen.

== Tata Brewery ==
A third application to the government to set up a brewery was successful and approved 26 July 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annualreportsghana.com/Home/Documents/Circulars/Companies/Ghana-Breweries-(Prospectus,-Listing-by-Introducti.aspx "Ghana Breweries Propectus"], 2 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The approval was given to "Tata Trading Company" to establish a brewery in [[Cape Coast]] in the [[Central Region, Ghana]], "a place of fashion, scholarship, and beauty". A suitable site could not be found in Cape Coast and the project was relocated to Achimota, a town on the Accra-Nsawam Road.&lt;br /&gt;

The new National Redemption Council (NRC) government attempted to renegotiate the competing interests of the state, local businessmen, workers, and foreign capital. Loans and tax incentives were promised to Ghanaian businessmen who went into manufacturing.&lt;ref name=Akyeampong /&gt; 
 
Tata Brewery Ltd was commissioned on 30 January 1973, Siaw's 50th birthday. It was officially opened by the then Head of State Colonel [[Ignatius Kutu Acheampong]], who said of the event: "It is the single-minded and single-handed effort of Mr. J. K. Siaw... which has been responsible for what we see around us today. Mr. Siaw is an excellent example of the innate ability of the Ghanaian to rise to the needs of the occasion". Siaw had wanted "his Brewery to stand for centuries to come", "even longer than the famous [[Osu Castle|Christiansborg Castle]]". J. K. Siaw, established Tata Brewery Limited, the first fully Ghanaian-owned brewery in the country.

Tata Company secured exclusive export rights for the "Maltex" drink to neighbouring [[Togo]], Dahomey ([[Benin]]), Upper Volta ([[Burkina Faso]]), [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]], and [[The Gambia]] from [[Albani Brewery|Albani Breweries Limited]], a Danish firm operating in Ghana. The company was the first brewery to introduce draught beer into the country.

The [[Ghana Commercial Bank]] provided a loan of 950,000 cedis for the project to begin, with a pre-requisite that Siaw deposited 200,000 cedis. By 1976, the brewery employed 750 Ghanaians and only four expatriates. Siaw produced his own brand of beer - Tata Pilsner Beer.

"In the country's bid to industrialize, the alcohol industry has played a pioneering role."&lt;ref name=Akyeampong&gt;Emmanuel Akyeampong, "The State and Alcohol Revenues: Promoting 'Economic Development' in Gold Coast/Ghana, 1919 to the Present", ''Social History'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern Continental Bank ===

August 25th 1977 J.K Siaw formed The Modern Continental Bank together with Mr Kwadwo Ohene-Ampofo a legal practitioner.

=== Philanthropy ===
For the workers and their families there was a clinic, a subsidised canteen and free transport to work. Siaw sought to build housing for the workers not too far from the site. Vaccinations were provided free of charge to the workers and their families.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Siaw presented to the [[Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital]] an electro-cardiograph, a piece of equipment the hospital was deficient of.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Siaw also donated towards the construction of a hospital in Akwaseho in 1975 and begun the building of a road from Akwaseho to Obomeng,&lt;ref&gt;George Antwi, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200304290290.html "Ghana: J. K. Siaw Remembered"], AllAfrica, 29 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a project that ceased when the 1979 AFRC regime seized his assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houblon.net/spip.php?article3971 "Achimota Brewery To Return To Owners"], ''The Heritage'', 30 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; No subsequent governments have completed the road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printstatgh.com/article_detail.php?enc_id=d%2F%2BJctYajzdhUsUMqtUJ6OeORwQEVwi0Ba0mkDIl6VanmyFJlN11CmBuljFjtdyW0Tc5pjwdpl%2FeRoN%2Bv5tv3w%3D%3D "Govt urged to support Twenedurase-Akwasiho road construction"], ''[[The Ghanaian Times]]'', 1 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siaw was the subject of a book by [[J. Benibengor Blay]] entitled ''The Story of Tata'' (c.1976).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Story_of_Tata.html?id=uzPUAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Story of Tata''], "a very comprehensive account of the life of Mr. Joshua Kwabena Siaw ... one of Ghana's most prominent business men".&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1979: AFRC regime ==
See [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana]]

Siaw was among the businessmen targeted by the AFRC&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=48730 "Siaw's Seized Assets"], Ghana Web, 22 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; under the "house cleaning" exercise against corruption.&lt;ref name=Akyeampong /&gt; The AFRC were under the impression that Ghana's wealthiest businessmen, of whom J. K. Siaw was the most prominent, must have acquired their wealth through corruption facilitated by the country's former leaders, including Lt. Gen. [[Akwasi Afrifa]], Gen. Acheampong and Lt. Gen. [[Fred Akuffo]], who were all executed. During the short time that the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council was the government of Ghana (4 June 1979 until 24 September 1979), Siaw was arrested on numerous occasions, and his house looted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=24540 "'We want our brewery back' - Tata Brewery owner’s son"], GhanaWeb, 3 June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Junior soldiers raided his properties for a catalogue of items, including a £3000.00 gold watch (£33000.00 in 2013 relative value),&lt;ref name=ModernGhana&gt;[http://www.modernghana.com/news/28865/1/how-soldiers-looted-jk-siaw.html "How soldiers looted J.K. Siaw"], ModernGhana.com, 11 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; until he was released secretly by a junior soldier and left for [[Liberia]].

The tax-evasion charges totalled ¢10 million (as of 1979) however, they were false allegations.&lt;ref name=ModernGhana /&gt;

== Life in exile ==

=== Liberia Brewery ===
Following from the upheaval in Ghana in 1979, Siaw started again in Liberia, which by comparison to Ghana was a very safe and peaceful country in West Africa at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanareview.com/NEW/shownews1.php?class=all&amp;date=2011-02-09&amp;id=46330 "GRi Database view".]&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNDC petitions===
Siaw petitioned the [[PNDC]] government, which came into power with the overthrow of the government of [[Hilla Limann]], who had been supported by the AFRC in the 1979 elections. The PNDC government systematically targeted businesses of other businessmen as well as Siaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyguideghana.com/?p=83475 "B. A. Mensah—-A Man Of Strength"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616020123/http://www.dailyguideghana.com/?p=83475 |date=16 June 2013 }} ''Daily Guide'', 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Investigation Committee, created in 1982, was created to investigate corruption in public office. It reviewed cases of persons whose assets were confiscated by the state during the three-month rule of the AFRC. The NIC "found that the confiscation of all the assets of J. K. Siaw, owner of the former Tata Brewery, on the grounds that he engaged in over-invoicing and under-invoicing during the Acheampong period was a travesty of justice".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CgFaCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=J+K+Siaw&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gozzpUginD&amp;sig=yvuseUENgeCKLj0AztSNkgWYm2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcl4GN4dfNAhUrAcAKHUxrC_s4ChDoAQghMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=J%20K%20Siaw&amp;f=false "Corruption and Development in Africa: Lessons from Country Case Studies"], K. Hope, B. Chikulo.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Siaw left Liberia to live in [[South London]], until he died in October 1986. He had sent numerous petitions to the military government [[PNDC]] and had applied for safe entry to be allowed back into Ghana without risk of arrest. His body was flown back to Ghana in December of that year. He did not receive his assets back and was considered a criminal by the state, despite the allegations being baseless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghanaweb.com/mobile/wap.small/news.article.php?ID=29964 "Siaw paid all taxes after all"], from ''The Ghanaian Chronicle'', 27 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of property and compensation issue==
In the 1990s under the NDC government, successor to the PNDC government and AFRC, Tata Brewery (by then Achimota Brewery Company) was privatised. The [[International Finance Corporation]] provided a US$3.5 million loan and a US$1 million equity investment to help finance the US$24.5 million privatization, rehabilitation, and expansion of Achimota Brewery Company (ABC) in Accra, Ghana. The sale of the brewery by the Government of Ghana represented the largest non-mining privatization in Ghana by that time.&lt;ref&gt;Asimina Caminis,
 [http://ifcext.ifc.org/ifcext/pressroom/ifcpressroom.nsf/1f70cd9a07d692d685256ee1001cdd37/07fcb8c7fb38447d85256962004c7b09?OpenDocument PRIVATIZATION, REHABILITATION, AND EXPANSION OF GHANAIAN BREWERY FINANCED BY IFC"], International Finance Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; The IFC also acquired an 11% stake in the business.

J. K. Siaw's family have not since received any compensation for the ordeal that they went through. ---&gt;Ghana's subsequent [[New Patriotic Party|NPP]] government announced its intention to compensate victims of the previous military regimes and return some seized assets&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghanaweb.net/GhanaHomePage/soccer/artikel.php?ID=110281 "PNDC, AFRC excesses and de-confiscation ..."], GhanaWeb, 8 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the then government returned eight houses to the family&lt;ref&gt;[http://ama.ghanadistricts.gov.gh/?arrow=nws&amp;read=19875 "Accra: Former heads of state to get assets"], ''Daily Graphic'', 22 October 2008. Accra Metropolitan Assembly website.&lt;/ref&gt; on a "where is, as is basis", meaning they were made to accept the properties in the condition the government was prepared to return them. It was hinted that compensation would be paid to those whose properties were sold,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/200810/21696.php "Confiscated properties to be returned"], Joy Online, 16 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; yet despite Tata Brewery being sold twice since confiscation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/election2008/artikel.php?ID=243947 "Governments use de-confiscation for political expedience - Siaw"], GhanaWeb, 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the family received no compensation on that single property, nor on the list of items looted from Siaw's numerous properties.

{{Admiralty law}}

A '''Liner Conference System''' (also called a "shipping conference") is an agreement within the [[sea transport|shipping industry]] in relation to [[ocean liner]]s. Typically, the agreement is between two or more [[shipowner|shipping companies]] to provide scheduled cargo and/or passenger service on a particular trade route under uniform rates and common terms.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture notes: The Liner Conference is an organisation whereby a number of shipowners offer their services on a given sea route on conditions agreed by the members. Conferences are oligopolistic* associations of shipping lines formed for the purpose of restricting competition between members and protecting them from outside competition. They achieve their object
by controlling prices and limiting entry into the trade. The most important method employed to this aim is to establish a common tariff of freight rates and passenger fares. By limiting sailings and ports of call and by offering incentives (deferred rebate system and contract system) to loyal shippers, they provide a regularity of service to exporters that may not exist otherwise. Often when conferences perform special services, such as lifting unprofitable cargo or resorting to
chartering to cover temporary shortages of tonnage, they pool the losses or profit on such operations.
A shipping company usually belongs to several conferences. Members are left free to compete for traffic by the quality and efficiency of their service. Membership is international by character. Shippers frequently associate themselves into Councils to negotiate with Conferences on a footing of equal strength, as a countervailing power.
* An [[oligopoly]] is a formal or loose association of companies that act together so as to exercise the powers of monopoly. Revenue in some cases is pooled, and shared according to some formula."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a Liner Conference System allows [[shipowner]]s to club together, enabling them to continue to operate a regular "liner service" and maintain requisite standards of service, there is a downside.  Such agreements may establish protectionist organisations that can involve [[monopoly]] abuse and possible breach of [[competition law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=1562676&amp;fileOId=1566038 Thesis on Liner Conferences]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, under [[European Community Law]], article 101&lt;ref&gt;Art.101 (1). The following shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market: all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the internal market, and in particular those which:

(a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions;

(b) limit or control production, markets, technical development, or investment;

(c) share markets or sources of supply;

(d) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage;

(e) make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.

It is, however, generally agreed that evidence is in favour of this system: it has been concluded that no realistically possible combination of shipping companies can force unreasonable rates and that shipping companies that provide regular sailings with good ships and maintain staffs and organizations in ports to handle and dispatch cargoes—irrespective of whether trade is good or bad—are entitled to some protection against the casual vessel that picks up an occasional cargo at cut rates."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Suárez y Suárez''' (23 March 1896 – 23 July 1987) was a Spanish immigrant to Mexico who became a successful entrepreneur and patron of the arts.
He is known for the [[Casino de la Selva]] in Cuernavaca, the [[Hotel de México]], and the adjacent [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]].

==Early years (1896–1919)==

Manuel Suárez y Suárez was born on 23 March 1896 in Téifaros, {{convert|3|km}} from [[Navia, Asturias]].
He was the second son of a family of ten.
His parents were cousins, Balbina Suárez Rodríguez of Téifaros and Manuel Suárez Fernández of Loredo, Villayón.
They grew potatoes and grain, and had two cows and a donkey.
He received a basic education in the village school, and acquired a love of books.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
Manuel's older brother Joaquin moved to Mexico to work on the dairy farm of his uncle Joaquín Rodríguez y García Loredo, but when he arrived found his uncle had died. 
Joaquin became a clerk at the wholesale grain merchant Casa Peral Alverde and saved up to fund Manuel's journey to Mexico.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}

In the spring of 1911 at the age of 15 Manuel emigrated to Mexico.
He was hired by the Casa Peral Alvede to travel through the north and center of Mexico buying crops.
In May 1914 he was captured by the insurgents under [[Pancho Villa]].
He was almost shot, but then was made a lieutenant colonel and served on Villa's general staff for almost a year before being given leave to return to Mexico City.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
The Suárez brothers prospered and were able to bring their three younger brothers to join them.
From 1918 to 1919 Manuel studied at the School of Commerce in [[Gijón]].{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}

==Inter-war period (1919–42)==

In 1919 Manuel and Joachim Suárez left the Casa Peral Alverde and founded the La Mexicana grocery store in the [[La Merced (neighborhood)|La Merced neighborhood]] of Mexico City.
In 1923 Manuel left this business and founded a building supply company named Eureka in partnership with the son of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]], the future President of Mexico.
He later became the sole owner of this business.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
He undertook contracts to build infrastructure for the states' improvemement boards (''Juntas De Mejoras'').
Part of his fortune came from buying land at low cost in places such as [[Acapulco]], [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], [[Veracruz]], [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Tijuana]], [[Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]] and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juarez]] that he later sold after these communities started to develop.{{sfn|Siqueiros era menos comunista que yo}}

[[File:Mural de Renau.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the mural "La Hispanidad" by [[Josep Renau]], salvaged from the Casino de la Selva]]
The first constitutional governor of [[Morelos]] state, Vicente Estrada Cajigal&lt;sup&gt;([[:es:Vicente Estrada Cajigal|es]])&lt;/sup&gt;, authorized construction of a casino complex in Cuernavaca by the Compañía Hispanoamericana de Hoteles.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
This was  a consortium of Mexican businessmen backed by President [[Abelardo L. Rodríguez]].{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}
Suárez was the building contractor.
The Casino de la Selva was inaugurated in 1931 near the train station.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=69}}
It was briefly the most luxurious watering spot in the Americas until the Garci-Crespo Hotel opened in [[Tehuacán]] in 1934.{{sfn|Walsh|2018|p=141}}
However, the owners were unable to pay their debts to the state or to the builders.
Suárez was the main creditor and acquired the property in 1934.
That year the new president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] took office. 
One of his first decrees banned gambling in Mexico since he saw casinos as centers of vice.
Suárez retained the property but ran it purely as a hotel.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}

Suárez and the Valencian architect [[Jesús Martí Martín]] founded the company Vías y Obras (Roads and Works), which built facilities in the ports of [[Veracruz]], [[Acapulco]] and other cities.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
In 1936 Suárez  bought the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz.
That year he went to Italy to buy machinery for Eureka.
He had trouble with the authorities of the [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] regime, who seized a cross of diamonds and pearls he had bought for one of his daughters, and from then on was opposed to Italian Fascism.
However, he supported General [[Francisco Franco]] with supplies during the [[Spanish Civil War]].
Between 1936 and 1941 he invested in sugar mills in [[Sonora]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Tepic]] and [[Sinaloa]].{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}

==Years of prosperity (1942–66)==
[[File:Felix candela en Casino.jpg|thumb|Dining room in front of the auditorium at Casino de la Selva]]
During [[World War II]] (1939–45) Mexico declared war on the Axis in 1942.
Suárez helped develop the system of replacing imports by local production.
He said later that President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] (1940–46) offered to make him Minister of the Economy three times, but he refused on the basis that business should be separate from politics.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
Suárez was also a close friend of President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]] (1946–52), who promoted development of tourism.{{sfn|Flaherty|2016|p=254}}
He loved art, and promoted the career of contemporary artists such as [[Dr. Atl ]] (Gerardo Murillo), [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jorge González Camarena]], [[José Reyes Meza]], [[Francisco Icaza]] and [[Josep Renau]].{{sfn|Celebran mecenazgo de Suárez y Suárez}}

Suárez wanted the Casino de la Selva to be a gathering place for intellectuals and artists, and commissioned various works of art for the walls and gardens.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
He hired Mexican and Spanish artists such as José Reyes Meza and Josep Renau to decorate the walls with murals showing Mexican history from the pre-Columbian period to the modern age.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}
The murals would cover an area of {{convert|600|m2}}.{{sfn|Casino de la Selva, golpe al patrimonio artístico}}
The hotel became the center of cultural activity in Cuernavaca and was visited by artists, writers and political activists.{{sfn|Contreras|2009|p=87}}

At the end of the 1950s the construction company of the brothers Félix, Antonio and Julia Candela built a dining room attached to an auditorium at the Casino de la Selva, and a non-denominational chapel in place of the fountain at the entrance, all with shell roofs.
[[Félix Candela]]'s pupil, the architect Juan Antonio Tonda&lt;sup&gt;([[:fr:Juan Antonio Tonda Magallón|fr]])&lt;/sup&gt;, designed the shells and about 30 bungalows in the south of the site and oversaw construction.
Later the chapel was converted to a nightclub, the Club Jano, and then the Discoteca Mambo.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=70}}
The dining room, the ''Salón de los Relojes'' (Salon of the Clocks), had a roof formed of five paraboloid sections with a large clock hanging from the central point where the arcs intersected showing the times of places around the world.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}
The auditorium, reached via the ''Salón de los Relojes'', had a single hyperbolic paraboloid roof and contained the mural ''La farándula'' (Showbiz) by the Mexican artist [[Francisco Icaza]], a tribute to the German playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=71}}

[[File:Vista del World Trade Center desde la Torre Latinoamericana de la Ciudad de México.JPG|thumb|World Trade Center, Mexico]]

==Last years (1966–87)==

Suárez opened three restaurants in Mexico City, and in 1966 embarked on building the Gran Hotel de México (now the [[World Trade Center Mexico City|World Trade Center]]).{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
Suarez conceived the idea of building a major business and tourist complex named Mexico 2000, centered around the huge Hotel de México.{{sfn|Santa Cruz|2002|p=1170}}
From the 1970s until his death he put most of his energy into the project, which grew out of control.{{sfn|Alarcón Azuela|2011|p=72}}

The hotel was to be the largest in the Americas, {{convert|237|m}} high with 1,500 rooms.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
It was to be 51 stories high with 1,508 hexagonal rooms that could house 3,100 guests.
A panoramic elevator would be able to carry 100 tourists, and 19 other elevators for normal passengers, and there would be one covered and one open air panoramic terrace.
A heliport would be equipped with customs.
There would be four cafeterias and six restaurants, with a revolving restaurant on the top floor, five reception halls, a 3000-person convention room, a {{convert|21500|sqft}} spiral-shaped shopping mall, a theatre, museum and so on.
The building was unfinished when Suarez died, and remained an unfinished skeleton for many years.{{sfn|Gallo|2004|p=64}}

The [[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]] was built  in the grounds of the hotel, with murals by the painter [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]].
It was started early in the 1970s and completed before Siqueiros died in 1974.
The building's exterior is a [[dodecahedron]], while the interior is an octagon.
It was built by the architects [[Guillermo Rossell de la Lama]], Ramón Miquela Jáuregui and Joaquín Álvarez Ordonéz.{{sfn|Santa Cruz|2002|p=1170}}

[[File:PolyforumSiqueiros06.jpg |thumb |[[Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros]], with statue of Sigueros and Suárez in front]]
Suárez built a workshop for Siqueiros in Cuernavaca, [[La Tallera]], to help him work as efficiently as possible.{{sfn|Flaherty|2016|p=109}}
The Polyforum has twelve huge exterior panels holding murals by Siqueros that depict the March of Humanity, showing the evolution from the past to the present and giving a view of the future. Most of the other surfaces of the building were also painted by Siqueros, making the building's exterior the largest mural in the world.{{sfn|Hodge|2013|loc=PT257}}
The exterior mural covers over {{convert|120000|sqft}} and depicts the march of humanity on Earth towards the Cosmos.
The interior depicts the march of humanity in Latin America.{{sfn|Santa Cruz|2002|p=1170}}
Most of the murals of the Polyforum were taken from drawings that Siqueros made while in prison for his revolutionary opinions in 1960–64.{{sfn|Santa Cruz|2002|p=1170}}

==Death and legacy==

Don Manuel Suárez died in [[Mexico City]] in 1987 at the age of 91.{{sfn|Gracia Noriega|2009}}
He was buried in the pantheon of Santa Cruz del Pedregal.{{sfn|Muerto Manuel Suarez, Hyatt  ...}}

Suárez amassed a collection of around 4,000 paintings.{{sfn|Muerto Manuel Suarez, Hyatt  ...}}
The [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]] holds 50 pieces from his huge collection.{{sfn|Celebran mecenazgo de Suárez y Suárez}}
He married twice and had twenty children: Manuel, Sergio, José, Jorge, Miguel Angel, Carlos, Lilia, Raquel, Silvia, Marisol, Margarita, Maricarmen, Concepción, Alfredo, Marcos, Manuel, Angélica, Beatriz, Ernesto and Fernando.{{sfn|Muerto Manuel Suarez, Hyatt  ...}}
In August 1987 it was reported that Hyatt would lend $30 million to the Suárez Group to complete the first 400 rooms on the ten highest levels of his hotel for what would now be called the Hotel de México Hyatt.{{sfn|Muerto Manuel Suarez, Hyatt  ...}}
Eventually the Hotel de México was converted into the World Trade Center, an office building, in 1995.{{sfn|Santa Cruz|2002|p=1170}}{{sfn|Gallo|2004|p=64}}
In July 2005 the World Trade Center was sold at auction for $58 million by the government's Fondo Bancario de Protección al Ahorro ([[Fobaproa]]).{{sfn|Castellanos |Zuñiga|2005}}
The Casino de la Selva was demolished in the fall of 2002 and replaced by two large box stores.{{sfn|Mitchell|2007|p=17}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5949">'''Dr. Meriwether Lewis Anderson''' (June 23, 1805 - March 5, 1862) was a prominent Virginia physician and politician.

Anderson was born at "Locust Hill" in [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] to Edmund Anderson and Jane Meriwether Lewis, the sister of [[Meriwether Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minor|first=Louisa H.

==Locust Hill==
Anderson was born at Locust Hill the home of his grandmother Lucy Meriwether Lewis. The estate was acquired in 1730 by his great-grandfather Col. Robert Lewis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Edgar|title=Albemarle County in Virginia: giving some account of what it was by nature, of what it was made by man, and of some of the men who made it|year=1901|publisher=The Michie company|location=Charlottesville, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anderson had spent most of his life at Locust Hill in part due to his fathers inadequacies in business. He inherited the property on the death of his grandmother in 1837 shortly after which the main house burned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minor|first=Louisa H.

'''National Public Lands Day''' is celebrated annually at public lands in the [[United States]] on the fourth Saturday of September.  A signature event of the [[National Environmental Education Foundation]], it promotes both popular enjoyment and [[Volunteering|volunteer]] conservation of [[public land]]s.

Three federal agencies and 700 volunteers launched the first National Public Lands Day in 1994.  By 2010, participation grew to 170,000 volunteers at over 2,000 sites across the country, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories.&lt;ref name="National Public Lands Day Draws Record Numbers of Volunteers Coast-to-Coast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neefusa.org/npld|title=National Public Lands Day|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=NEEFusa.org|accessdate=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to National Public Lands Day being a fee-free day (free entry day) at many federally managed lands, volunteers who participate at federal land sites are rewarded with coupons for free entry into their favorite federal public land areas that have entrance fees.&lt;ref name="BLM20080821"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blm.gov/nv/st/en/res/national_public_lands.html| title=Helping Hands for America's Lands| publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]| date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2008-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 event featured an initiative to plant one million trees in honor of the 75th anniversary of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].&lt;ref name="Civilian Conservation Corps"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| title=Civilian Conservation Corps| publisher=PublicLandsDay.org| accessdate=2011-07-12| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060340/http://www.publiclandsday.org/partners/civilian-conservation-corps| archivedate=2011-10-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal was exceeded, with more than 1.6 million trees planted. The 2009 event featured a [[Preview screening|preview]] of ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]'', which began airing the next night on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations nationwide.  The preview was sent to each [[national park (US)|national park]] on [[DVD]] and aired in their [[visitor center]] [[auditorium]]s. Other National Public Lands Day events occurred on September 24, 2011 and  September 29, 2012.

'''Process chemistry''' is the arm of pharmaceutical chemistry concerned with the development and optimization of a synthetic scheme and pilot plant procedure to manufacture compounds for the drug development phase. Process chemistry is distinguished from [[medicinal chemistry]], which is the arm of pharmaceutical chemistry tasked with designing and synthesizing molecules on small scale in the early drug discovery phase.

Medicinal chemists are largely concerned with synthesizing a large number of compounds as quickly as possible from easily tunable chemical building blocks (usually for [[Structure-activity relationship|SAR]] studies). In general, the repertoire of reactions utilized in discovery chemistry is somewhat narrow (for example, the [[Buchwald-Hartwig amination]], [[Suzuki coupling]] and [[reductive amination]] are commonplace reactions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roughley|first=S. D.|author2=Jordan, A. M.|title=The medicinal chemist's toolbox: an analysis of reactions used in the pursuit of drug candidates|journal=J. Med. Chem.|year=2011|volume=54|pages=3451–79|doi=10.1021/jm200187y|pmid=21504168}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, process chemists are tasked with identifying a chemical process that is safe, cost and labor efficient, “green,” and reproducible, among other considerations. Oftentimes, in searching for the shortest, most efficient synthetic route, process chemists must devise creative synthetic solutions that eliminate costly functional group manipulations and oxidation/reduction steps.

This article focuses exclusively on the chemical and manufacturing processes associated with the production of small molecule drugs. [[Biologics|Biological medical products]] (more commonly called “biologics”) represent a growing proportion of approved therapies, but the manufacturing processes of these products are beyond the scope of this article. Additionally, the many complex factors associated with chemical plant engineering (for example, heat transfer and reactor design) and [[drug formulation]] will be treated cursorily.

== Process chemistry considerations ==
Cost efficiency is of paramount importance in process chemistry and, consequently, is a focus in the consideration of pilot plant synthetic routes. The drug substance that is manufactured, prior to formulation, is commonly referred to as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and will be referred to as such herein. API production cost can be broken into two components: the “material cost” and the “conversion cost.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dach|first=R.|author2=Song, J. J. |author3=Roschangar, F. |author4=Samstag, W. |author5= Senanayake, C. H. |title=The eight criteria defining a good chemical manufacturing process|journal=Org. Process Res. Dev.|year=2012|volume=16|pages=1697–1706|doi=10.1021/op300144g}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ecological and environmental impact of a synthetic process should also be evaluated by an appropriate metric (e.g. the EcoScale).

An ideal process chemical route will score well in each of these metrics, but inevitably tradeoffs are to be expected. Most large pharmaceutical process chemistry and manufacturing divisions have devised weighted quantitative schemes to measure the overall attractiveness of a given synthetic route over another. As cost is a major driver, material cost and volume-time output are typically weighted heavily.

=== Material cost ===
The material cost of a chemical process is the sum of the costs of all raw materials, intermediates, reagents, solvents and catalysts procured from external vendors. Material costs may influence the selection of one synthetic route over another or the decision to outsource production of an intermediate.

=== Conversion cost ===
The conversion cost of a chemical process is a factor of that procedure's overall efficiency, both in materials and time, and its reproducibility. The efficiency of a chemical process can be quantified by its atom economy, yield, volume-time output, and environmental factor (E-factor), and its reproducibility can be evaluated by the Quality Service Level (QSL) and Process Excellence Index (PEI) metrics.

[[File:Atom Economy - Claisen and Wittig Example.pdf|300px|thumbnail|right|An illustrative example of atom economy using the Claisen rearrangement and Wittig reaction.]]

==== Atom economy ====

The [[atom economy]] of a reaction is defined as the number of atoms from the starting materials that are incorporated into the final product. Atom economy can be viewed as an indicator of the “efficiency” of a given synthetic route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trost|first=B. M.|title=The atom economy - a search for synthetic efficiency|journal=Science|year=1991|volume=254|pages=1471–7|doi=10.1126/science.1962206|pmid=1962206|issue=5037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;AE = \frac{\text{MW(product)}}{\sum \text{MW(raw materials)}}\times 100\%&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the [[Claisen rearrangement]] and the [[Diels-Alder|Diels-Alder cycloaddition]] are examples of reaction that are 100 percent atom economical. On the other hand, a prototypical [[Wittig reaction]] has especially poor atom economy (merely 20 percent in the example shown).

Process synthetic routes should be designed such that atom economy is maximized for the entire synthetic scheme. Consequently, “costly” reagents such as protecting groups and high molecular weight leaving groups should be avoided where possible. An atom economy value in the range of 70 to 90 percent for an API synthesis is ideal, but it may be impractical or impossible to access certain complex targets within this range. Nevertheless, atom economy is a good metric to compare two routes to the same molecule.

==== Yield ====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
[[Yield (chemistry)|Yield]] is defined as the amount of product obtained in a chemical reaction the yield of practical significance in process chemistry is the isolated yield—the yield of the isolated product after all purification steps.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In a final API synthesis, isolated yields of 80 percent or above for each synthetic step are expected.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The definition of an acceptable yield depends entirely on the importance of the product and the ways in which available technologies come together to allow their efficient application; yields approaching 100% are termed quantitative, and yields above 90% are broadly understood as excellent.&lt;ref&gt;In an academic perspective, Furniss, et al., in ''Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry'', describes yields around 100% as ''quantitative'', yields above 90% as ''excellent'', above 80% as ''very good'', above 70% as ''good'', above 50% as ''fair'', and yields below this as ''poor''.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math chem title="An illustrative example of convergent synthesis"&gt;
\begin{array}{|r|r|r|}
\hline
&amp; \text{Illustrative Example} &amp; \text{Overall Yield}\\
\hline
\color{BrickRed}\text{Linear Synthesis} &amp; \ce{A -&gt;[85\%] B -&gt;[85\%] C -&gt;[85\%] Product} &amp; \color{BrickRed}{61.4\%}\\
\hline
\color{PineGreen}\text{Convergent Synthesis} &amp; \left. \begin{matrix}\ce{A -&gt;[85\%] B} \\ \ce{D -&gt;[85\%] E} \end{matrix} \quad \right\} \ce{-&gt; Product} &amp; \color{PineGreen}{72.3\%}\\

\hline
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
There are several strategies that are employed in the design of a process route to ensure adequate overall yield of the pharmaceutical product. The first is the concept of [[convergent synthesis]]. Assuming a very good to excellent yield in each synthetic step, the overall yield of a multistep reaction can be maximized by combining several key intermediates at a late stage that are prepared independently from each other.

Another strategy to maximize isolated yield (as well as time efficiency) is the concept of [[one-pot synthesis|telescoping synthesis]] (also called one-pot synthesis). This approach describes the process of eliminating workup and purification steps from a reaction sequence, typically by simply adding reagents sequentially to a reactor. In this way, unnecessary losses from these steps can be avoided.

Finally, to minimize overall cost, synthetic steps involving expensive reagents, solvents or catalysts should be designed into the process route as late stage as possible, to minimize the amount of reagent used.

In a pilot plant or manufacturing plant setting, yield can have a profound effect on the material cost of an API synthesis, so the careful planning of a robust route and the fine-tuning of reaction conditions are crucially important. After a synthetic route has been selected, process chemists will subject each step to exhaustive optimization in order to maximize overall yield. Low yields are typically indicative of unwanted side product formation, which can raise red flags in the regulatory process as well as pose challenges for reactor cleaning operations.

==== Volume-time output ====
The volume-time output (VTO) of a chemical process represents the cost of occupancy of a chemical reactor for a particular process or API synthesis. For example, a high VTO indicates that a particular synthetic step is costly in terms of “reactor hours” used for a given output. Mathematically, the VTO for a particular process is calculated by the total volume of all reactors (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that are occupied times the hours per batch divided by the output for that batch of API or intermediate (measured in kg).

:&lt;math chem&gt;VTO=\frac{\text{nominal volume of all reactors} [\ce{m}^3]*\text{time per batch} [\ce h]}{\text{output per step} [\ce{kg}]}&lt;/math&gt;

The process chemistry group at Boehringer-Ingelheim, for example, targets a VTO of less than 1 for any given synthetic step or chemical process.

Additionally, the raw conversion cost of an API synthesis (in dollars per batch) can be calculated from the VTO, given the operating cost and usable capacity of a particular reactor. Oftentimes, for large-volume APIs, it is economical to build a dedicated production plant rather than to use space in general pilot plants or manufacturing plants.

==== Environmental factor ([[Green chemistry metrics|e-factor]]) and process mass intensity (PMI) ====
Both of these measures, which capture the environmental impact of a synthetic reaction, intend to capture the significant and rising cost of waste disposal in the manufacturing process. The E-factor for an entire API process is computed by the ratio of the total mass of waste generated in the synthetic scheme to the mass of product isolated.

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{\sum \text{mass of waste}}{\text{mass of isolated product}}=\frac{\sum \text{mass of materials}-\text{mass of isolated product}}{\text{mass of isolated product}}&lt;/math&gt;

A similar measure, the process mass intensity (PMI) calculates the ratio of the total mass of materials to the mass of the isolated product.

&lt;math&gt;PMI=\frac{\sum \text{mass of materials}}{\text{mass of isolated product}} = E +1&lt;/math&gt;

For both metrics, all materials used in all synthetic steps, including reaction and workup solvents, reagents and catalysts, are counted, even if solvents or catalysts are recycled in practice. Inconsistencies in E-factor or PMI computations may arise when choosing to consider the waste associated with the synthesis of outsourced intermediates or common reagents. Additionally, the environmental impact of the generated waste is ignored in this calculation; therefore, the environmental quotient (EQ) metric was devised, which multiplies the E-factor by an “unfriendliness quotient” associated with various waste streams. A reasonable target for the E-factor or PMI of a single synthetic step is any value between 10 and 40.

==== Quality service level (QSL) ====
The final two "conversion cost" considerations involve the reproducibility of a given reaction or API synthesis route. The quality service level (QSL) is a measure of the reproducibility of the quality of the isolated intermediate or final API. While the details of computing this value are slightly nuanced and unimportant for the purposes of this article, in essence, the calculation involves the ratio of satisfactory quality batches to the total number of batches. A reasonable QSL target is 98 to 100 percent.

==== Process excellence index (PEI) ====
Like the QSL, the process excellence index (PEI) is a measure of process reproducibility. Here, however, the robustness of the procedure is evaluated in terms of yield and cycle time of various operations. The PEI yield is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{PEI yield}=\frac{\text{average yield}\cdot 100\%}{\text{aspiration level yield}}=\frac{\text{average yield}\cdot 100\%}{\frac{\text{median yield}+\text{best yield}}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In practice, if a process is high-yielding and has a narrow distribution of yield outcomes, then the PEI should be very high. Processes that are not easily reproducible may have a higher aspiration level yield and a lower average yield, lowering the PEI yield.

Similarly, a PEI cycle time may be defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{PEI cycle time}=\frac{\text{aspiration level cycle time}\cdot 100\%}{\text{average cycle time}}=\frac{\frac{\text{median cycle time}+\text{best cycle time}}{2}}{\text{average cycle time}}&lt;/math&gt;

For this expression, the terms are inverted to reflect the desirability of shorter cycle times (as opposed to higher yields). The reproducibility of cycle times for critical processes such as reaction, centrifugation or drying may be critical if these operations are rate-limiting in the manufacturing plant setting. For example, if an isolation step is particularly difficult or slow, it could become the bottleneck for an API synthesis, in which case the reproducibility and optimization of that operation become critical.

For an API manufacturing process, all PEI metrics (yield and cycle times) should be targeted at 98 to 100 percent.

=== EcoScale ===
In 2006, Van Aken, et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Aken|first=K.|author2=Strekowski, L. |author3=Patiny, L. |title=EcoScale, a semi-quantitative tool to select an organic preparation based on economical and ecological parameters|journal=Beilstein J. Org. Chem.|year=2006|volume=2|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the safety and ecological impact of a chemical process, as well as minor weighting of practical and economical considerations. Others have modified this EcoScale by adding, subtracting and adjusting the weighting of various metrics. Among other factors, the EcoScale takes into account the toxicity, flammability and explosive stability of reagents used, any nonstandard or potentially hazardous reaction conditions (for example, elevated pressure or inert atmosphere), and reaction temperature. Some EcoScale criteria are redundant with previously considered criteria (e.g. E-factor).

=== Boehringer Ingelheim HCV protease inhibitor (BI 201302) ===
Macrocyclization is a recurrent challenge for process chemists, and large pharmaceutical companies have necessarily developed creative strategies to overcome these inherent limitations. An interesting case study in this area involves the development of novel NS3 protease inhibitors to treat [[Hepatitis C]] patients by scientists at [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faucher|first=A-M. |author2=Bailey, M.

Two significant shortcomings were immediately identified with the initial scale-up route to BILN 2061, depicted in the scheme below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yee|first=N. K. |author2=Farina, V. |author3=Houpis, I. N. |author4=Haddad, N. |author5=Frutos, R. P. |author6=Gallou, F. |author7=Wang, X-J. |author8=Wei, X. |author9=Simpson, R.

Chem.|year=2006|volume=71|pages=7133–7145|doi=10.1021/jo060285j}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The macrocyclization step posed four challenges inherent to the [[Cross metathesis|cross-metathesis]] reaction.

# '''High dilution''' is typically necessary to prevent unwanted dimerization and oligomerization of the diene starting material. In a pilot plant setting, however, a high dilution factor translates into lower throughput, higher solvent costs and higher waste costs.
# '''High catalyst loading''' was found to be necessary to drive the [[Ring-closing metathesis|RCM]] reaction to completion. Because of high licensing costs of the ruthenium catalyst that was used (1st generation [[Grubbs' catalyst|Hoveyda catalyst]]), a high catalyst loading was financially prohibitive. Recycling of the catalyst was explored, but proved impractical.
# '''Long reaction times''' were necessary for reaction completion, due to slow kinetics of the reaction using the selected catalyst. It was hypothesized that this limitation could be overcome using a more active catalyst. However, while the second-generation Hoveyda and Grubbs catalysts were kinetically more active than the first-generation catalyst, reactions using these catalysts formed large amounts of dimeric and oligomeric products.
# An '''epimerization risk''' under the cross-metathesis reaction conditions. The process chemistry group at Boehringer-Ingelheim performed extensive mechanistic studies showing that epimerization most likely occurs through a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeng|first=X. |author2=Wei, X. |author3=Farina, V. |author4=Napolitano, E. |author5=Xu, Y. |author6=Zhang, L. |author7=Haddad, N. |author8=Yee, N. K. |author9=Grinberg, N. |author10=Shen, S. |author11=Senanayake, C. H.|title=Epimerization reaction of a substituted vinylcyclopropane catalyzed by ruthenium carbenes: mechanistic analysis|journal=J. Org. Chem.|year=2006|volume=71|pages=8864–8875|doi=10.1021/jo061587o}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the Hoveyda catalyst employed in this scheme minimizes epimerization risk compared with the analogous Grubbs catalyst.

Additionally, the final double [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]] sequence to install the [[quinoline]] heterocycle was identified as a secondary inefficiency in the synthetic route.

[[File:BILN 2061 Synthetic Scheme.pdf|1000px|frameless|center]]

Analysis of the cross-methathesis reaction revealed that the conformation of the acyclic precursor had a profound impact on the formation of dimers and oligomers in the reaction mixture. By installing a [[Tert-butyloxycarbonyl protecting group|Boc protecting group]] at the C-4 amide nitrogen, the Boehringer-Ingelheim chemists were able to shift the site of initiation from the vinylcyclopropane moiety to the nonenoic acid moiety, improving the rate of the intramolecular reaction and decreasing the risk of epimerization. Additionally, the catalyst employed was switched from the expensive 1st generation Hoveyda catalyst to the more reactive, less expensive Grela catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grela|first=K.|author2=Harutyunyan, S. |author3=Michrowska, A. |title=A highly efficient ruthenium catalyst for metathesis reactions|journal=Angew.

Additionally, the process chemistry team envisioned a [[Nucleophilic aromatic substitution|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar]] strategy to install the quinoline heterocycle, instead of the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 strategy that they had employed for the synthesis of BILN 2061. This modification prevented the need for inefficient double inversion by proceeding through retention of stereochemistry at the C-4 position of the hydroxyproline moiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=X. |author2=Shu, C. |author3=Haddad, N. |author4=Zeng, X. |author5=Patel, N.

[[File:BI 201302 Synthetic Scheme.pdf|1200px|frameless|center]]

It is interesting to examine this case study from a VTO perspective. For the unoptimized cross-metathesis reaction using the Grela catalyst at 0.01 M diene, the reaction yield was determined to be 82 percent after a reaction and workup time of 48 hours. A 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 35&amp;nbsp;kg of desired product. For the unoptimized reaction:

&lt;math&gt;\text{VTO} = \frac{6\text{ m}^{3} \times 48\text{ h}}{35\text{ kg}} = 8.2\text{ m}^{3} \cdot \text{ h / kg}&lt;/math&gt;

This VTO value was considered prohibitively high and a steep investment in a dedicated plant would have been necessary even before launching Phase III trials with this API, given its large projected annual demand. But after reaction development and optimization, the process team was able to improve the reaction yield to 93 percent after just 1 hour (plus 12 hours for workup and reactor cleaning time) at a diene concentration of 0.2 M. With these modifications, a 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 799&amp;nbsp;kg of desired product. For this optimized reaction:

&lt;math&gt;\text{VTO} = \frac{6\text{ m}^{3}\times 13\text{ h}}{799\text{ kg}} = 0.1\text{ m}^{3} \cdot \text{ h / kg}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, after optimization, this synthetic step became less costly in terms of equipment and time and more practical to perform in a standard manufacturing facility, eliminating the need for a costly investment in a new dedicated plant.

=== [[Biocatalysis]] and enzymatic engineering ===
Recently, large pharmaceutical process chemists have relied heavily on the development of enzymatic reactions to produce important chiral building blocks for API synthesis. Many varied classes of naturally occurring enzymes have been co-opted and engineered for process pharmaceutical chemistry applications. The widest range of applications come from [[Aldo-keto reductase|ketoreductases]] and [[transaminase]]s, but there are isolated examples from [[hydrolases]], [[aldolase]]s, oxidative enzymes, [[esterase]]s and [[dehalogenase]]s, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bornscheuer|first=U.

One of the most prominent uses of biocatalysis in process chemistry today is in the synthesis of [[Januvia]]®, a [[DPP4 (gene)|DPP-4]] inhibitor developed by Merck for the management of [[type II diabetes]]. The traditional process synthetic route involved a late-stage enamine formation followed by rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation to afford the API [[sitagliptin]]. This process suffered from a number of limitations, including the need to run the reaction under a high-pressure hydrogen environment, the high cost of a transition-metal catalyst, the difficult process of carbon treatment to remove trace amounts of catalyst and insufficient stereoselectivity, requiring a subsequent recrystallization step before final salt formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savile|first=C.

Merck’s process chemistry department contracted [[Codexis]], a medium-sized biocatalysis firm, to develop a large-scale biocatalytic reductive amination for the final step of its sitagliptin synthesis. Codexis engineered a transaminase enzyme from the bacteria Arthrobacter through 11 rounds of directed evolution. The engineered transaminase contained 27 individual point mutations and displayed activity four orders of magnitude greater than the parent enzyme. Additionally, the enzyme was engineered to handle high substrate concentrations (100 g/L) and to tolerate the organic solvents, reagents and byproducts of the transamination reaction. This biocatalytic route successfully avoided the limitations of the chemocatalyzed hydrogenation route: the requirements to run the reaction under high pressure, to remove excess catalyst by carbon treatment and to recrystallize the product due to insufficient enantioselectivity were obviated by the use of a biocatalyst. Merck and Codexis were awarded the [[Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award]] in 2010 for the development of this biocatalytic route toward Januvia®.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Busacca|first=C.

=== Continuous/flow manufacturing ===
In recent years, much progress has been made in the development and optimization of [[Flow chemistry|flow reactors]] for small-scale chemical synthesis (the [http://web.mit.edu/chemistry/jamison/ Jamison Group] at MIT and [http://www.leygroup.ch.cam.ac.uk/ Ley Group] at Cambridge University, among others, have pioneered efforts in this field). The pharmaceutical industry, however, has been slow to adopt this technology for large-scale synthetic operations. For certain reactions, however, continuous processing may possess distinct advantages over batch processing in terms of safety, quality and throughput.

A case study of particular interest involves the development of a fully continuous process by the process chemistry group at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] for an [[asymmetric hydrogenation]] to access a key intermediate in the synthesis of LY500307,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=M. D. |author2=May, S. A. |author3=Calvin, J. R. |author4=Remacle, J. |author5=Stout, J. R. |author6=Dieroad, W. D. |author7=Zaborenko, N. |author8=Haeberle, B. D. |author9=Sun, W-M. |author10=Miller, M. T. |author11=Brannan, J. |title=Development and scale-up of a continuous, high-pressure, asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, workup, and isolation|journal=Org. Process Res. Rev.|year=2012|volume=16|pages=1017–1038|doi=10.1021/op200362h}}&lt;/ref&gt; a potent [[Estrogen receptor beta|ERβ]] agonist that is entering clinical trials for the treatment of patients with [[schizophrenia]], in addition to a regimen of standard antipsychotic medications. In this key synthetic step, a chiral rhodium-catalyst is used for the enantioselective reduction of a tetrasubstituted olefin. After extensive optimization, it was found that in order to reduce the catalyst loading to a commercially practical level, the reaction required hydrogen pressure up to 70 atm. The pressure limit of a standard chemical reactor is about 10 atm, although high-pressure batch reactors may be acquired at significant capital cost for reactions up to 100 atm. Especially for an API in the early stages of chemical development, such an investment clearly bears a large risk.

An additional concern was that the hydrogenation product has an unfavorable [[eutectic point]], so it was impossible to isolate the crude intermediate in more than 94 percent ee by batch process. Because of this limitation, the process chemistry route toward LY500307 necessarily involved a kinetically controlled [[crystallization]] step after the hydrogenation to upgrade the enantiopurity of this penultimate intermediate to &gt;99 percent ee.

[[File:LY500307 Continuous Flow Synthesis.pdf|800px|frameless|center|Comparison of the batch and continuous flow processes toward LY500307.]]

The process chemistry team at Eli Lilly successfully developed a fully continuous process to this penultimate intermediate, including reaction, workup and kinetically controlled crystallization modules (the engineering considerations implicit in these efforts are beyond the scope of this article). An advantage of flow reactors is that high-pressure tubing can be utilized for hydrogenation and other hyperbaric reactions. Because the head space of a batch reactor is eliminated, however, many of the safety concerns associated with running high-pressure reactions are obviated by the use of a continuous process reactor. Additionally, a two-stage mixed suspension-mixed product removal (MSMPR) module was designed for the scalable, continuous, kinetically controlled crystallization of the product, so it was possible to isolate in &gt;99 percent ee, eliminating the need for an additional batch crystallization step.

This continuous process afforded 144&amp;nbsp;kg of the key intermediate in 86 percent yield, comparable with a 90 percent isolated yield using the batch process. This 73-liter pilot-scale flow reactor (occupying less than 0.5 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; space) achieved the same weekly throughput as theoretical batch processing in a 400-liter reactor. Therefore, the continuous flow process demonstrates advantages in safety, efficiency (eliminates the need for batch crystallization) and throughput, compared with a theoretical batch process.

'''The Queen's Awards for Enterprise''' is an awards programme for [[United Kingdom|British]] businesses and other organizations who excel at international trade, innovation or sustainable development. They are the highest official UK awards for British businesses.   The scheme was established as The Queen's Award to Industry by a [[Royal warrant (document)|royal warrant]] of 30 November 1965, and individual categories have been known in the past as The Queen's Awards for Export, Export Achievement, Technology, Technological Achievement and Environmental Achievement. The scheme also includes an award for individuals, [[The Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion]].

==History==
Every April winners of the Queen’s Awards for Enterprise are officially announced in a special Gazette supplement. The Queen's Award to Industry, the scheme's original title, was instituted by Royal Warrant in 1965. It became the Queen's Awards for Export and Technology in 1975, with Environmental Achievement added in 1992. In 1999, the scheme became the Queen's Awards for Enterprise with International Trade, Innovation and Sustainable Development as the categories. In 2017, a fourth category was introduced, Promoting Opportunity (through social mobility). Since 2005, individuals have also been recognised with the Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion. As of 2017, this individual award has been rested.

In [[arbitration]], the '''repeat-player effect''' is a proposition that, outside of the [[collective bargaining]] context, employers attain more favorable outcomes in arbitration.&lt;ref name=bingham&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bingham|first=Lisa|title=Employment Arbitration: The Repeat Player Effect|journal=Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal|year=1997|volume=1|pages=189–220|ssrn=1324411}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Factors contributing to the repeat-player effect include employers' having more information to gain an advantage in the arbitrator selection process, as well as influence on arbitrators, who may want to rule in the employer's favor to be selected in future arbitrations.&lt;ref name=colvin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colvin|first=Alexander J.

Eisenhower]] to 2008, its effect on American society, and how the military and private business spheres interact with each other. The book received positive reviews in [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] and ''[[Inter Press Service]]'', and critical reviews by Jeffrey St. Clair of ''CounterPunch'', and in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''.

==Synopsis==
Nick Turse explores how the industrial complex of the United States military has pervaded the everyday lives of Americans. Turse investigates the relationship between the Pentagon and the Hollywood entertainment industry, military actions in the civilian sphere, and joint projects between the U.S. military and companies including [[NASCAR]] and [[Marvel Comics]]. Turse describes how military tacticians and flyers were outfitted with [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] [[PowerBook]]s. He illustrates how the military has attempted innovative methods to reach out to and recruit contemporary youth, including making "friends" on [[MySpace]]. Turse notes that the research and development budget of the military, and its spending in the private sector, has increased dramatically over the last few years. The book posits that many changes have occurred since [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s military-industrial complex, and relates the changes to the present day.

==Reception==
The book was reviewed in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'', where it was recommended: "For those who like their journalism fevered and their politics pat."&lt;ref name="kirkus"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Kirkus Reviews staff | title =The Complex – Or, buy an iPod, kill an Iraqi | journal =[[Kirkus Reviews]] | publisher =Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | date =January 15, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Engelhardt]] of ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine wrote, "It's an eye-opener on the degree to which we are, without realizing it, a militarized society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Engelhardt  | first =Tom  |authorlink=Tom Engelhardt | title =The Golden Age of the Military-Entertainment Complex  | work =[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]  | date =March 20, 2008  | url =https://www.motherjones.com/commentary/tomdispatch/2008/03/golden-age-of-the-military-entertainment-complex.html  | accessdate = 2008-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engelhardt called ''The Complex'' a "superb book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Engelhardt | first =Tom|authorlink=Tom Engelhardt | title =  Hungry and Without Options in New York| work =[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | date =April 26, 2009  | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/2009/04/hungry-and-without-options-new-york | accessdate = 2009-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey St. Clair of ''CounterPunch'' was critical, and commented: "This is a Bush-bashing book that maliciously elides the uncomfortable fact that many of the contractor scandals that penetrated the mainstream press in Bush-time where ''[sic]'' actually set in motion in the 1990s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =St. Clair  | first =Jeffrey  | title =Booked Up  | work =CounterPunch  | publisher =www.counterpunch.org  | date =April 26, 2008  | url =http://www.counterpunch.org/stclair04262008.html  | accessdate =  2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Barsanti of ''[[PopMatters]]'' gave the book a rating of 3 out of a possible 10, and wrote, "''The Complex'' is an airless and rather pointless recitation of facts that feels cut-and-pasted rather than written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Barsanti  | first =Chris | title = The Complex: How the Military Invades Our Everyday Lives | work = [[PopMatters]] | publisher = PopMatters Media, Inc.  | year = 2009 | url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/the-complex-by-nick-turse/ | accessdate =  2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Gharib reviewed the book for ''[[Inter Press Service]]'', and noted: "Turse's book carefully tracks the Defense Department's money trail to everything from traditional defense contractors to a handful of Southern catfish restaurants to Dunkin' Donuts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Gharib  | first =Ali  | title =Book Shows Pentagon's Ties to Hollywood, Dunkin' Donuts | work =[[Inter Press Service]] | date =June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria Segal of ''[[The Guardian]]'' reviewed the book and commented, "Much of Turse's research holds the Pentagon up to ridicule: their golf courses, the fast-food-addicted army that waddles rather than marches on its stomach. Yet the book turns sinister when it exposes desperate recruiters who allow white supremacists to join up, or defence department plans to develop 'weaponised' moths and sharks. References to The Matrix could make Turse seem a paranoid geek. Unfortunately, this is no sci-fi fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Segal  | first = Victoria | title = Saturday Review: Paperbacks: Non-fiction: The Complex , by Nick Turse | work =[[The Guardian]] | publisher =Guardian Newspapers Ltd | date =June 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Swanson of ''[[Political Affairs Magazine]]'' wrote, "Nick Turse has done something pretty amazing in producing an entertaining account of the almost limitless variety of ways in which our money is wasted by what he calls the military industrial technological entertainment academic media corporate matrix, or 'The Complex' for short".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Swanson | first = David | title = Where Your Tax Dollar Will and Will Not Go | work = [[Political Affairs Magazine]] | language =  | publisher = www.politicalaffairs.net | date =April 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], a '''virtual airline''' is an [[airline]] that has [[outsource]]d as many possible operational and business functions as it can, but still maintains effective control of its core business.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Contracting out services within the aviation industry has reportedly become so common that many carriers could be classed as having features of a virtual airline, although it is arguable whether any current carriers meet a strict definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;

The term is also used to describe travel companies and ticket agencies that market themselves as airlines, but are unlicensed and with flights undertaken by licensed operators often in the livery of the virtual airline.

==Origins==

Virtual airlines originated following the drastic changes brought about by the [[Airline Deregulation Act of 1978]]. During the hyper-competitive years immediately following deregulation, [[mainline (flight)|major airlines]] found it increasingly unprofitable to compete against start-up carriers on many routes they currently served. Instead of forfeiting the routes entirely, the larger carriers often made marketing arrangements with smaller airlines to fly under the "banner", or  [[aircraft livery]], of the larger airline. These [[regional airline]]s, mimicking the well known major airlines in adverts and prescribing to make connections as seamless as possible, soon abandoned their own local service routes. In most cases, the regional airlines found it more profitable to serve the mainline hubs as a feeder operation rather than operate on their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
