{{History of Oman}}

The '''2011 Omani protests''' were a series of protests in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]] country of [[Oman]] that occurred as part of the [[revolutionary wave]] popularly known as the "[[Arab Spring]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brecorder.com/world/global-business-a-economy/19759-oman-budget-gap-rises-to-658mn-in-q1-spending-up.html Oman budget gap rises to $658mn in Q1, spending up].

Protesters demanded salary increases and lower costs of living. On 20 February 2011, protesters welcomed a move by the government to increase the [[minimum wage]].&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera.

Public sector Omani employees have received wage increases in the past, but the private sector was so far overlooked.

==Anti-government protests==

===Muscat protests===
About 200 protesters marched on 17 January demanding salary increases and lower costs of living. The protest surprised international observers,  who have viewed Oman as a "politically stable and sleepy country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/oman-protestors-call-for-fight-against-corruption--374524.html |title=Oman protestors call for fight against corruption – Culture &amp; Society |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date=18 January 2011|accessdate=29 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110222074905/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/oman-protestors-call-for-fight-against-corruption--374524.html| archivedate= 22 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewed protests termed as the ''Green March'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofoman.com/innercat.asp?detail=41806&amp;rand=uVGjVlZjQUKJ2MN73tEvK9Y92v |title=Public petition: People awaiting response |author=Fahad Al Ghadani |work=Times of Oman |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717060358/http://www.timesofoman.com/innercat.asp?detail=41806&amp;rand=uVGjVlZjQUKJ2MN73tEvK9Y92v |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred on 18 February, inspired by the serious unrest in fellow Gulf state Bahrain. 350 people marched, demanding an end to corruption and better distribution of oil revenue.&lt;ref name="spinner1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spinner |first=Jackie |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2285656/ |title=Middle East protests: Oman's peaceful anti-corruption march |work=Slate |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters also carried signs with slogans of support for the Sultan.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/02/19/Oman-protests-peaceful-so-far/UPI-96551298131400/ |title=Oman protests peaceful so far |agency=United Press International|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police did not intervene in the gathering, the petition calling for the reforms will be handed to Oman's Sultan Qaboos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20110219/162677613.html |title=Hundreds stage peaceful march in Oman demanding reforms |agency=RIA Novosti |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests were reported to be "peaceful, well-organised and very disciplined." Tents had been set up with separate accommodations for men and women. Placards with protest slogans had also been translated into English, French and German for the international media.&lt;ref name="nl"/&gt;

On 11 August 2014, a six-story building under construction in the '''''U Place Condotel condominium''''' project, collapsed in [[Pathum Thani province]], [[Thailand]]. The collapse resulted in 14 deaths and 25 injuries to the construction workers working on the building.

== Background ==

The collapse building was part of a six building project, including two finished buildings with residents. The building project is owned by Plook Plang Co. Ltd.&lt;ref name=BP_20140814 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PPP_20140815 /&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Casualties included [[Cambodia]]n nationals who were construction workers.&lt;ref name=PPP_20140815&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sokheng|first1=Vong|last2=Barron|first2=Laignee|title=Bodies pulled from rubble|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/bodies-pulled-rubble|accessdate=15 August 2014|work=[[The Phnom Penh Post]]|date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rescue operation was concluded on 14 August 2014, after all victims were found.&lt;ref name=BP_20140815 /&gt;

== Cause ==

A flaw in the construction design was cited as the cause for collapse. [[Column]]s at the perimeter of the building were not strong enough to support the weight of cement being poured on the roof, leading to a structural failure.&lt;ref name=BP_20140814&gt;{{cite news|title=Police arrest 4 over collapse|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/426646/police-arrest-4-over-collapse|accessdate=15 August 2014|work=[[Bangkok Post]]|publisher=The Post Publishing PCL|date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Iraq War (2014–present)}}

The '''2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict''' occurred in and around the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish region]] of northern [[Iraq]], and began on 15 October 2017, as a result of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017|Iraqi Kurdistan referendum in 2017]] held on September{{nbsp}}25. The diplomatic crisis between the [[Federal government of Iraq|Iraqi Government]] and the [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] (KRG) escalated into all out conflict when the [[Peshmerga]] ignored repeated warnings by Iraqi prime minister [[Haider al-Abadi]] to hand over Kirkuk peacefully to Iraqi forces. The Peshmerga stated they would not take commands from the central Government of Iraq but from the autonomous Kurdish region, this was tantamount to a declaration of rebellion against the state of Iraq. After a several weeks stand-off at the gates of Kirkuk, Iraqi troops were given orders to attack on 15 October. Despite having a significant disadvantage in terms of numbers, the attacking force was superior in equipment and discipline, and had effective tactics and coordination.&lt;ref name="veconomist" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=After all but defeating the jihadists, Iraq’s army turns on the Kurds|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730417-dreams-independent-kurdistan-are-now-tatters-after-all-defeating|work=[[The Economist]]|date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Peshmerga were routed from the entire city of Kirkuk within a day and the Iraqi army pushed further north ejecting the Peshmerga from the entirety of Kirkuk province and neighbouring [[Sinjar]], [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]] and the Nineva plains.. The conflict marked a major set-back in Kurdish hopes for an independent nation as the KRG had lost 40 percent of land under its jurisdiction and their main source of revenue,&lt;ref name="ANF News"/&gt; the kirkuk oil fields. This meant the KRG was now reliant on an annual budget from the central government. The KRG made to sign a pledge to not seek independence again as a precondition to the end of the conflict. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kerkük'te Türkmenler güvenliklerini kendileri sağlamaya başladı|url=http://aa.com.tr/tr/dunya/kerkukte-turkmenler-guvenliklerini-kendileri-saglamaya-basladi/939408|work=Anadolu Ajansı}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main article|Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017}}
The [[President of the Kurdistan Region|President of the Iraqi Kurdistan Region]], [[Masoud Barzani]], facilitated the [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017|Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum in September 2017]]. This provoked the [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] [[Haider al-Abadi]] to demand that the referendum result be cancelled, and called on the [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]] to initiate dialogue "in the framework of the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraqi PM calls on Kurdistan to cancel referendum, start dialogue|url=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/portada/iraqi-pm-calls-on-kurdistan-to-cancel-referendum-start-dialogue/50000260-3391820|work=www.efe.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Iraq began to move its forces into areas seized by the [[Kurdistan Regional Government|KRG]] after the entry of ISIL, and all the disputed areas outside the Kurdish Region, including Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=خطة انتشار القوات العراقية في المناطق المتنازع عليها مع كردستان|url=https://arabic.sputniknews.com/arab_world/201710181026854198-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=الحشد الشعبي: لا بد أن تنسحب البشمركة لحدود 2003|url=https://arabic.sputniknews.com/arab_world/201710241026978762-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B4%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%88-2003/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle of Kirkuk==
{{see also|Battle of Kirkuk (2017)}}
The Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] ignored a deadline given by Iraq to withdraw by 15{{nbsp}}October 2017. This led to the Iraqi forces and the [[Popular Mobilization Forces|PMU militia]] retaking Kirkuk and its province on the same day. Within 15 hours, the city of [[Kirkuk]] and the nearby [[K-1 Air Base]], along with surrounding oilfields, were retaken by Iraqi forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baghdad: Iraqi forces in full control of Kirkuk|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/baghdad-iraqi-forces-full-control-kirkuk-171016133409720.html|accessdate=17 October 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international coalition described the events as "...coordinated movements, not attacks...", with most Peshmerga withdrawing without much of a fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coalition Statement on Military Movements Near Kirkuk|url=http://www.inherentresolve.mil/News/News-Releases/Article/1343292/coalition-statement-on-military-movements-near-kirkuk/|work=Operation Inherent Resolve}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was likely due to the fact that Hero and Bafel Talabani, leaders of the PUK Peshmerga, struck a deal with the Iraqis to withdraw without a fight without notifying the KDP Peshmerga. This, in turn, led to the collapse of Kurdish defenses, and led to accusations of betrayal on part of the Talabani family by the KDP, since the day before the battle of Kirkuk both parties met in Dukan and agreed to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mutual accusations after the withdrawal|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/181020171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Iraqi forces advanced on and captured the city of [[Tuz Khurmatu]] in the [[Saladin Province]], 60&amp;nbsp;km south of Kirkuk,&lt;ref name="AAT"&gt;{{cite news|title=Baghdad forces seize Tuz Khurmatu amid Kirkuk operation|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/baghdad-forces-seize-tuz-khurmatu-amid-kirkuk-operation/938885|accessdate=17 October 2017|work=Anadolu Agency|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Kifri]] in the [[Diyala Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peshmerga to withdraw from Dilaya governorate – Egypt Today|url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/27939/Peshmerga-to-withdraw-from-Dilaya-governorate|accessdate=17 October 2017|work=Egypt Today|date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31{{nbsp}}October, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that Iraq had regained control of all disputed areas. At a press conference, al-Abadi also accused certain KRG-linked media outlets of "openly inciting violence against federal forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq govt forces in control of all ‘disputed’ areas: PM|url=http://aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iraq-govt-forces-in-control-of-all-disputed-areas-pm/952985|work=Anadolu Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abadi announced that the government planned to start paying the salaries of Peshmerga and civil servants working for KRG, stating, "We will soon be able to pay all the salaries of the Peshmerga and the employees of the region."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq to pay Kurdish Peshmerga, civil servants, says PM|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-economy/iraq-to-pay-kurdish-peshmerga-civil-servants-says-pm-idUSKBN1D02C5?il=0|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central government later listed 13 preconditions for dialogue including, a handwritten note of annulment of the referendum, which the federal court ruled illegal and KRG respected the ruling but didn't formally renounce it.

The '''Fourth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]]''' (WFYS) was held in 1953, in [[Bucharest]], the capital of [[Romania]].

The [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]] organized this festival against a background of what it described as persecution of [[Communism|communists]], such as in [[West Germany]], where Philipp Müller, a delegate to the 3rd WFYS had been killed during a demonstration, and in the [[United States]], where [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] had been convicted of [[espionage]] on behalf of the [[Soviet Union]], and executed. Other stated goals of the festival were to protest against the [[Korean War]] and to support the anti-colonial movements in the [[France|French]] colonies of [[Algeria]] and [[Vietnam]]. With this background, the festival and its preparation became anti-war demonstrations.

It was held 2–14 August 1953, at the newly-built [[Stadionul Naţional (1953)|23 August Stadium]]. More than 30,000 young people from 111 countries participated in the Festival.

The motto of the festival was '''''No! Our generation will not serve death and destruction!'''''.

The festival's sports programme featured an [[Athletics at the 1953 World Festival of Youth and Students|athletics competition]].&lt;ref name=GBR&gt;[http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/uie.htm World Student Games (UIE)]. GBR Athletics. Retrieved on 2014-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''6th [[World Festival of Youth and Students]]''' (Russian: Всемирный фестиваль молодёжи и студентов) was opened on 28 July 1957, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. The festival attracted 34,000 people from 130 countries. This became possible after the bold political changes initiated by [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. It was the first World Festival of Youth and Students held in the Soviet Union, which was opening its doors for the first time to the world.&lt;ref name="russiatoday.ru"&gt;[http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/11587 Moscow marks 50 years since youth festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215123836/http://www.russiatoday.ru/features/news/11587 |date=2007-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khrushchev reforms, known as [[Khrushchev's Thaw]], resulted in some changes in the Soviet Union. Foreigners could come for a visit, and people were allowed to meet foreigners, albeit only in groups under supervision. However, that did not stop people from making friends. Russian foreign language students volunteered as interpreters.

Music from many world cultures came to USSR with the festival. People were dancing on the streets holding hands with foreigners from all over the world. Jazz musician [[Aleksei Kozlov (musician)|Aleksey Kozlov]] had a chance to play with foreign musicians. The popular ensemble [[Druzhba (band)|Druzhba]] from [[Leningrad]] became the winner of the First Prize&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pjecha Edita |url=http://www.geocities.com/wlad_11514/polacyen.htm#pjecha |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kjLATXyC?url=http://www.geocities.com/wlad_11514/polacyen.htm |archivedate=2009-10-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in popular music, thanks to its lead singer, [[Edita Piekha|Edyta Piecha]],&lt;ref name="russiatoday.ru"/&gt; the star of the 1950s who could sing in many languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19333">An '''advanced persistent threat''' ('''APT''') is a stealthy computer network attack in which a person or group gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period. The term's definition was traditionally associated with nation-state sponsorship, but over the last few years we’ve seen multiple examples of non-nation state groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cybereason.com/blog/advanced-persistent-threat-apt|title=What is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)?|last=Maloney|first=Sarah|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An APT may have either business or political motives. APT processes require a high degree of covertness over a long period of time. The "advanced" process signifies sophisticated techniques using malware to exploit vulnerabilities in systems. The "persistent" process suggests that an external [[command and control (malware)|command and control]] system is continuously monitoring and extracting data from a specific target. The "threat" process indicates [[HUMINT|human involvement]] in [[Active measures|orchestrating]] the attack.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/6309905/Advanced_Persistent_Threat_-_APT |title=Advanced Persistent Threat - APT |author= Dr. Sam Musa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APT usually refers to a group, such as a [[government]], with both the capability and the intent to target, persistently and effectively, a specific entity. The term is commonly used to refer to [[Internet|cyber]] threats, in particular that of [[Internet]]-enabled espionage using a variety of intelligence gathering techniques to access sensitive information,&lt;ref name="Dell SecureWorks"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anatomy of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)|url=https://www.secureworks.com/resources/sb-advanced-threat-protection-with-dell-secureworks|publisher=Dell SecureWorks|accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but applies equally to other threats such as that of traditional espionage or attacks.&lt;ref name="Command Five Pty Ltd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are you being targeted by an Advanced Persistent Threat?|url=http://www.commandfive.com/apt.html|publisher=Command Five Pty Ltd|accessdate=2011-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406182451/http://www.commandfive.com/apt.html|archive-date=2011-04-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recognized attack vectors include infected media, [[Supply chain attack|supply chain compromise]], and human intelligence and deception. The purpose of these attacks is to place custom malicious code on one or multiple computers for specific tasks and to remain undetected for the longest possible period. Knowing the attacker artifacts, such as file names, can help a professional make a network-wide search to gather all affected systems.&lt;ref name="maliciousfilehunter.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Search for malicious files|url=https://www.maliciousfilehunter.com/feature-live-search.php|publisher=Malicious File Hunter|accessdate=2014-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individuals, such as an individual adversary, are not usually referred to as an APT, as they rarely have the resources to be both advanced and persistent even if they are intent on gaining access to, or attacking, a specific target.&lt;ref name="commandfive.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The changing threat environment&amp;nbsp;...|url=http://www.commandfive.com/threats.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120724104653/http://www.commandfive.com/threats.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-24|publisher=Command Five Pty Ltd|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and targets==
Warnings against targeted, socially-engineered emails dropping trojans to exfiltrate sensitive information were published by UK and US [[Computer emergency response team|CERT]] organisations in 2005. This method was used throughout the early 1990's and does not in itself constitute a APT.  The term "advanced persistent threat" has been cited as originating from the [[United States Air Force]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessing Outbound Traffic to Uncover Advanced Persistent Threat|url=http://www.sans.edu/student-files/projects/JWP-Binde-McRee-OConnor.pdf|publisher=SANS Technology Institute|accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Colonel Greg Rattray cited as the individual who coined the term. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Forrester's Cyber Threat Intelligence Research|url=http://blogs.forrester.com/rick_holland/13-02-14-introducing_forresters_cyber_threat_intelligence_research|publisher=Forrester Research|accessdate=2014-04-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415054512/http://blogs.forrester.com/rick_holland/13-02-14-introducing_forresters_cyber_threat_intelligence_research|archive-date=2014-04-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term APT was used within telecommunications carriers years previously.

The [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]], which targeted the computer hardware of [[Iran's nuclear program]], is one example. In this case, the Iranian government might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat.

Within the [[computer security]] community, and increasingly within the media, the term is almost always used in reference to a long-term pattern of sophisticated computer network exploitation  aimed at governments, companies, and political activists, and by extension, also to attribute attributes to the groups behind these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Persistent Threats: Learn the ABCs of APTs - Part A|url=https://www.secureworks.com/blog/advanced-persistent-threats-apt-a|website=SecureWorks|publisher=SecureWorks|accessdate=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced persistent threat (APT) as a term may be shifting focus to computer based hacking due to the rising number of occurrences. [[PC World]] reported an 81 percent increase from 2010 to 2011 of particularly advanced targeted computer attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olavsrud|first=Thor|title=Targeted Attacks Increased, Became More Diverse in 2011|url=http://www.pcworld.com/printable/article/id,254730/printable.html|publisher=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses holding a large quantity of [[personally identifiable information]] are at high risk of being targeted by advanced persistent threats, including:&lt;ref name="Dell SecureWorks"/&gt;

A Bell Canada study provided deep research in to the anatomy of APTs and uncovered widespread presence in Canadian government and critical infrastructure. Attribution was established to Chinese and Russian actors.

==Characteristics==
Bodmer, Kilger, Carpenter and Jones defined the following APT criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Reverse Deception: Organized Cyber Threat Counter-Exploitation]] |author=Sean Bodmer |author2=Dr. Max Kilger |author3=Gregory Carpenter |author4=Jade Jones |year=2012 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Osborne Media |isbn=978-0071772495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Objectives&amp;nbsp;– The end goal of the threat, your adversary
* Timeliness&amp;nbsp;– The time spent probing and accessing your system
* Resources&amp;nbsp;– The level of knowledge and tools used in the event (skills and methods will weigh on this point)
* Risk tolerance&amp;nbsp;– The extent the threat will go to in order to remain undetected
* Skills and methods&amp;nbsp;– The tools and techniques used throughout the event
* Actions&amp;nbsp;– The precise actions of a threat or numerous threats
* Attack origination points&amp;nbsp;– The number of points where the event originated
* Numbers involved in the attack&amp;nbsp;– How many internal and external systems were involved in the event, and how many people's systems have different influence/importance weights
* Knowledge source&amp;nbsp;– The ability to discern any information regarding any of the specific threats through online information gathering (you might be surprised by what you can find by being a little proactive)

==Life cycle==
[[File:Advanced persistent threat lifecycle.jpg|right|Diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat (APT) which repeats itself once complete.]]
Actors behind advanced persistent threats create a growing and changing risk to organizations' financial assets, intellectual property, and reputation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outmaneuvering Advanced and Evasive Malware Threats|url=https://www.secureworks.com/resources/wp-outmaneuvering-advanced-and-evasive-malware-threats|website=Secureworks|publisher=Secureworks Insights|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by following a continuous process or [[kill chain]]:
# Target specific organizations for a singular objective
# Attempt to gain a foothold in the environment (common tactics include [[spear phishing]] emails)
# Use the compromised systems as access into the target network
# Deploy additional tools that help fulfill the attack objective
# Cover tracks to maintain access for future initiatives

The global landscape of APTs from all sources is sometimes referred to in the singular as "the" APT, as are references to the actor behind a specific incident or series of incidents, but the definition of APT includes both actor and method.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2013, Mandiant presented results of their research on alleged Chinese attacks using APT methodology between 2004 and 2013&lt;ref name="mandiant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ |title=APT1: Exposing One of China's Cyber Espionage Units |year=2013 |publisher=Mandiant}}&lt;/ref&gt; that followed similar lifecycle:
* '''Initial compromise'''&amp;nbsp;– performed by use of [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] and [[spear phishing]], over email, using [[zero-day virus]]es. Another popular infection method was planting [[malware]] on a website that the victim's employees will be likely to visit.
* '''Establish Foothold'''&amp;nbsp;– plant [[remote administration software]] in victim's network, create net backdoors and tunnels allowing stealth access to its infrastructure.
* '''Escalate privileges'''&amp;nbsp;– use [[exploit (computer security)|exploits]] and [[password cracking]] to acquire administrator privileges over victim's computer and possibly expand it to [[Windows domain]] administrator accounts.
* '''Internal reconnaissance'''&amp;nbsp;– collect information on surrounding infrastructure, trust relationships, [[Windows domain]] structure.
* '''Move laterally'''&amp;nbsp;– expand control to other workstations, servers and infrastructure elements and perform data harvesting on them.
* '''Maintain presence'''&amp;nbsp;– ensure continued control over access channels and credentials acquired in previous steps.
* '''Complete mission'''&amp;nbsp;– exfiltrate stolen data from victim's network.

In incidents analysed by Mandiant, the average period over which the attackers controlled the victim's network was one year, with longest&amp;nbsp;– almost five years.&lt;ref name="mandiant" /&gt; The infiltrations were allegedly performed by Shanghai-based [[PLA Unit 61398|Unit 61398]] of [[People's Liberation Army]]. Chinese officials have denied any involvement in these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-china-hacking-idUSBRE91I06120130220 |title=China says U.S. hacking accusations lack technical proof |year=2013 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previous reports from Secdev had previously discovered and implicated Chinese actors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nartv.org/mirror/ghostnet.pdf |title=GhostNet” was a large-scale cyber spying operation}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Terminology==
Definitions of precisely what an APT is can vary, but can be summarized by their named requirements below:&lt;ref name="Command Five Pty Ltd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commandfive.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's an APT? A Brief Definition|url=https://www.damballa.com/knowledge/advanced-persistent-threats.php|publisher=Damballa|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=2010-01-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211122715/http://www.damballa.com/solutions/advanced-persistent-threats.php| archivedate= 11 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Advanced''&amp;nbsp;– Operators behind the threat have a full spectrum of intelligence-gathering techniques at their disposal. These may include computer intrusion technologies and techniques, but also extend to conventional intelligence-gathering techniques such as telephone-interception technologies and satellite imaging. While individual components of the attack may not be classed as particularly "advanced" (e.g. [[malware]] components generated from commonly available do-it-yourself malware construction kits, or the use of easily procured exploit materials), their operators can typically access and develop more advanced tools as required. They often combine multiple targeting methods, tools, and techniques in order to reach and compromise their target and maintain access to it.  Operators may also demonstrate a deliberate focus on operational security that differentiates them from "less advanced" threats.
* ''Persistent''&amp;nbsp;– Operators give priority to a specific task, rather than opportunistically seeking information for financial or other gain. This distinction implies that the attackers are guided by external entities. The targeting is conducted through continuous monitoring and interaction in order to achieve the defined objectives. It does not mean a barrage of constant attacks and malware updates. In fact, a "low-and-slow" approach is usually more successful. If the operator loses access to their target they usually will reattempt access, and most often, successfully.  One of the operator's goals is to maintain long-term access to the target, in contrast to threats who only need access to execute a specific task.
* ''Threat''&amp;nbsp;– APTs are a threat because they have both capability and intent. APT attacks are executed by coordinated human actions, rather than by mindless and automated pieces of code. The operators have a specific objective and are skilled, motivated, organized and well funded. Note that actors are not limited to nation states.

==Mitigation strategies==
There are hundreds of millions{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} of malware variations, which makes it extremely challenging to protect organizations from APT. While APT activities are stealthy and hard to detect, the command and control network traffic associated with APT can be detected at the network layer level with sophisticated methods. Deep log analyses and log correlation from various sources is of limited usefulness in detecting APT activities.  It is challenging to separate noises from legitimate traffic. Traditional security technology and methods have been ineffective in detecting or mitigating APTs. Active cyber defence has yielded greater efficacy in detecting and prosecuting APTs (find, fix, finish) when applying cyber threat intelligence to hunt and adversary pursuit activities.

[[File:Balloon release by South Korean activists.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|South Korean activists releasing balloons]]
{{Human Rights in North Korea |expanded=all}}
'''Balloon propaganda campaigns in Korea''' include both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]n propaganda [[Airborne leaflet propaganda|leaflet campaigns]] through the use of balloons as a distribution method since the [[Korean War]]. A variety of other contents have also been included with the balloons. Originally, these campaigns were organized by the governments and militaries of the Korean states. Contemporarily, however, they are mainly organized by South Korean [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) that regularly involve themselves in [[balloon release]] events that aim to send materials [[Censorship in North Korea|censored in North Korea]], as well as various other goods, to the North Korean people.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=7}}{{sfn|Jung|2014|pp=23–25}}&lt;ref name="Aljazeera_2012"/&gt;{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|pp=1–4}}

The main motivations of the South Korean balloon campaigns have been a desire to support [[democratization]] and to incite a regime change in [[North Korea]]. However, the effectiveness of such leaflet campaigning has been debated. Furthermore, the balloon drops may have worsened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and the launches have also been met with increasing opposition from the South Korean society. The North Korean state has targeted propaganda to South Koreans soldiers on the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ) in retaliation against Southern propaganda campaigns.

The official stance of both the [[South Korean government|South]] and [[North Korean government]]s has been against the continuing balloon drops. However, the South Korean government has been hesitant to intervene in the launches by activists due to concerns about [[freedom of expression]]. However, some actions by officials, like banning the use of boats in balloon launches, have greatly reduced the amount of leaflets flying into North Korea. In recent years, there have been few cases of official leaflet droppings by either state. However, government organized [[psychological warfare]] between the Korean states largely disappeared in the aftermath of the [[Sunshine Policy]], regardless of renewed tensions since.

== History ==
[[File:Korea DMZ sentry.jpg|thumb|alt=South Korean sentry post with a patrolling soldier seen from north in Korean Demilitarized Zone|A South Korean sentry post seen from North Korea in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)]]

The origins of propaganda campaign competitions on the [[Korean Peninsula]] can be traced back to the [[Korean War]], when the [[United Nations Command|United Nations forces]] shelled Chinese and North Koreans with an estimated total of 2.5 billion leaflets. A historical study has estimated that the amount of leaflets was so great that it would have been enough to cover the whole peninsula under a layer 35 leaflets thick. In comparison, North Koreans only spread 30 million leaflets during the war.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=16}} The Korean balloons can also be compared with the German situation during the Cold War with ''{{transl|de|mauerseglers}}'' (wall sailors) sending balloons with goods over the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref name="Evans_2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-29751650 |title=South Koreans wage chocolate propaganda war with chocolate pie |last=Evans |first=Stephen |date=24 October 2014 |website=[[BBC]] |publisher= |access-date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balloon drops were organized by the South Korean state until the beginning of the [[Sunshine Policy]] under the [[Kim Dae-jung administration]]. Both Koreas halted [[psychological warfare]] for the duration of 2004–2010; in addition to balloons, this prohibited radio broadcasts, billboards and loudspeakers on the DMZ.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=3}}{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} The North Korean state had originally demanded that as a precondition for the [[Inter-Korean summit#First Summit (June 13–15, 2000)|first Inter-Korean summit]] in 2000, and the request was later accepted by the Kim Dae-jung administration.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} After the [[Bombardment of Yeonpyeong|Yeonpyeong incident]] in 2010, balloon drops were organized by the [[Ministry of National Defense (South Korea)|defense ministry]] in late 2010 for some time, but they have since been suspended again after having lasted for a year.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9580747/North-Korea-drops-propaganda-leaflets-over-border.html |title=North Korea drops propaganda leaflets over border |date=2 October 2012 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher= |access-date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a few instances of similar balloon propaganda campaigns launched by North Korea to South Korea; however, campaigns on the Korean Peninsula primarily target North Korea.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=7}} There was a balloon release by North Korea in July 2012 as a response to an official South Korean military leaflet campaign in the aftermath of the Yeonpyeong incident.&lt;ref name="Telegraph2012" /&gt;

In 2010, there was public support for a hard line against North Korea during increased tensions, but the support declined by 2011.&lt;ref name="Barsley2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-softens-stance-towards-north |title=South Korea softens stance towards north |date=20 November 2011 |last=Barsley |first=Daniel |website=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |publisher= |access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in late 2014 revealed that recent developments had turned many in South Korea against leaflet campaigns: 58 percent of respondents were against the balloon launches.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014" /&gt;

In May 2018, both Koreas made a commitment to end the balloon propaganda campaign and an attempt made by North Korean defectors to continue the campaign was sabotaged by the South Korean government.&lt;ref name=may1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=may5&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/05/south-korea-sabotages-anti-north-korea-leaflet-drop/&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean propaganda during the Korean War, through its extensive leafletting involving 2.5 billion leaflets, was also intended to display the [[capitalist world]]'s ability to outproduce its [[Communist world|communist rivals]].{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=16}} A study by [[Yi In-hwa|I. H. Lee]] found that bias against North Koreans in the South Korean society was prefigured in the visual forms of United Nations propaganda during the Korean War.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=17}} In comparison, North Korean propaganda during the war largely mirrored contemporary [[Soviet propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Friedman2006" /&gt;

Jin-Heon Jung claims there has been little change in the contents and aims of South Korean leaflets themselves since the transition from military launches to civilian launches.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=26}} Historically, there have been some oversights in [[cross cultural sensitivity|cultural sensitivities]] in leaflets, such as in translation from [[North–South differences in the Korean language|South Korean orthography to North Korean orthography]]. For instance, North Koreans did not understand words like ''Hŏnggari'' ({{Langnf||Korean|[[Hungary]]|links=no}}) or ''Ssoryŏn'' ({{Langnf||Korean|[[Soviet Union]]|links=no}}), as they are written in North Korea as ''Wengari'' and ''Rossiya'', respectively.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=28}} The leaflets include a mix of scandals, information and enticements. Some of the leaflets include proselytism for [[Born again (Christianity)|born again]] [[Evangelicalism#Korea|Evangelicalism]],&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo2014" /&gt; or [[Gospel]]s from the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = North Korea Bible | work = Billionbibles.org | date = 2013 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://www.billionbibles.org/north-korea/north-korea-bible.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; One leaflet reportedly provocatively compared [[Kim Il-sung]] to [[Jesus]] in its message, saying: "Believe Jesus Christ instead of Kim Il Sung".{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=27}} During the Cold War, the propaganda competition evolved to resemble a struggle between the two relatively new influences in Korea: communism and Christianity.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=13}}&lt;ref name="Faiola2005" /&gt; High-ranking defector [[Hwang Jang-yop]]'s actions have also been featured in the leaflets.&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo2014" /&gt;

Balloon drops by the South Korean government historically included—in addition to the propaganda leaflets—sweets, lighters, tobacco and pornography.{{sfn|VICE News|2015|loc=16:00–16:40}} Today, the contents launched by non-governmental organizations include various kinds of media and other goods and essentials.

Contemporary leaflets dropped by North Korean government have relatively simple contents, and are reminiscent of propaganda used by the North. The leaflets include various slogans, and North Koreans are known for including racist or sexist contents in propaganda.&lt;ref name="BBC_2016"/&gt; In 2016 some balloons were filled with trash in addition of propaganda leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korea-sends-balloons-filled-with-toilet-paper-and-rubbish-over-border-as-propaganda-war-a6849146.html |title=North Korea sends balloons 'filled with toilet paper and rubbish' over border as propaganda war continues |last=Dearden |first=Lizzie |date=2 February 2016 |website=[[The Independent]] |publisher= |access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaflets from the past decades had more varied contents.&lt;ref name="Friedman2006"/&gt;

== South Korean organizations involved ==

Recent organizations involved with the balloon campaigns include North Korean defectors' organizations, South Korean evangelical Protestants and conservatives, various organizations of other Christian denominations and United States based organizations.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=9}} In the participating [[North Korean defectors]]' organizations, ex-military members are overrepresented. Women constitute up to 70 percent of North Korean defectors; however, it is mainly men from relatively elite or military background who lead the balloon campaigns.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} The defectors' organizations are the most active ones; the two main organizations for flying leaflets to North Korea are [[Fighters for a Free North Korea]] and [[North Korean Christian Association]].&lt;ref name="ChosunIlbo2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2014/10/16/2014101600781.html |title=How Propaganda Flyers Try to Win Over N.Koreans |date=16 October 2014 |website=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fighters for a Free North Korea, [[Campaign for Helping North Koreans in Direct Way]], North Korean Christian Association and [[North Korean People's Liberation Front]] are among the active balloon releasing defectors' groups.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} However, [[Park Sang-hak]] claims that, unlike other defector groups, Fighters for a Free North Korea does not receive funding from the government—they have a couple of hundred supporters who donate five to ten U.S. dollars a month.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=1}} Some of the defector activists, like the North Korean People's Liberation Front, have contacts across the Chinese border area, and smuggle media across the rivers to North Korea.&lt;ref name="RadioAustralia2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/north-korean-defectors-to-launch-party |title=North Korean defectors to launch party |date=2012 |website=[[Radio Australia]] |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native South Korean NGOs involved include the [[National Action Campaign for Freedom and Democracy in Korea]], [[Korean Parents League]], [[Chogabje.com]], [[Family Association of South Korean POWs and Abductees]], [[Cornerstone Ministries]], and various others. [[Suzanne Scholte]] from the [[Defense Forum Foundation]] is the chairwoman of the [[North Korea Freedom Coalition]]. The North Korea Freedom Coalition is among the biggest supporters of the organizations involved. Anonymous Christian donors and overseas churches are also a noteworthy source of funding.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}}

Park Sang-hak has described their motives as trying to break the [[Freedom of information|information curtain]] and raise the people's consciousness to encourage North Koreans in overthrowing their leaders.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=1}} The [[Human Rights Foundation]] stresses its beliefs on [[freedom of speech]], [[self-determination]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of movement]] and [[democratization|democracy]].&lt;ref name="HumanRightsFoundation2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://humanrightsfoundation.org/news/hrf-hacks-north-korea-balloon-launch-aims-to-break-information-monopoly-00345 |title=HRF Hacks North Korea; Balloon Launch Aims to Break Information Monopoly |date=15 January 2014 |website=[[Human Rights Foundation]] |publisher= |access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to hoping to topple the regime and agitating, the involved human rights organizations advocate causes like helping refugees, doing humanitarian work for [[Disability in North Korea|disabled people living in North Korea]], proselytizing Christianity, and various other causes.&lt;ref name="Faiola2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/09/AR2005080901402.html |title=An Act of Subversion, Carried by Balloons |last=Faiola |first=Anthony|date=10 August 2005 |website=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher= |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hodges2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2011" /&gt;

=== Role of Protestant Evangelicalism ===
{{Further|Christianity in Korea}}

[[Protestant]] [[Evangelicalism#Korea|Evangelicalism]] is a common contemporary denominator for the majority of NGOs involved with the balloon drops since the drops became essentially privatized.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=7}} Jin-Heon Jung argues that there has been a polarization in the South Korean society since start of the [[Sunshine Policy]]: as the polarization between states decreased, the ideological and political polarization within South Korea increased. Jung notes that Evangelical church leaders have led protests against both regimes.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=25}} Unlike in other Asian nations, like [[Christianity in Japan|Japan]], South Koreans did not resist Western missionaries, and as a result, Christianity became politically linked to the [[anti-communist]] movement in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Faiola2005" /&gt; The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s [[North Korea–United States relations#North Korea policy under George W. Bush|hard line towards North Korea]] and funding for anti-North organizations has also had an important impact on the formation of an international human rights movement against North Korea.&lt;ref name="Faiola2005" /&gt;{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=25}}

There has also been competition between the two major Broadcasting companies in South Korea during the Cold War in the messages sent to the North Korean people. These companies are the government-run [[Korean Broadcasting System]] (KBS) and the private Evangelical Protestant [[Far East Broadcasting Company|Far East Broadcasting Corporation]].{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=14}}

Jin-Heon Jung points out that 80 percent of North Koreans arriving in the South Korea identify themselves as Christians. These defectors will rely on and stay in touch with churches. Many of them assume leadership positions as activists against the North Korean regime.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}}

== Types of balloons ==
[[File:South Korean activists VOA 2014-01-15.webm|thumb|Activists launching propaganda balloons]]

The balloons most commonly used by NGOs are unconventional transparent 12-meter long cylindrical helium- or hydrogen-filled balloons.&lt;ref name="Blistein2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farivar2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/north-korean-defector-fights-pyongyang-with-thumbdrive-laden-balloons/ |title=North Korean defector fights Pyongyang with thumbdrive-laden balloons |last=Farivar |first=Cyrus |date=25 February 2014 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher= |access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturdy double-walled greenhouse plastic is used for the balloons.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=3}} The balloons include propaganda messages written on the surface in [[Korean script]].

The launches have been met with resistance from the locals living nearby.&lt;ref name="Feffer2014"/&gt; Fear has also been harmful for local tourism and business.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=4}} Residents of the city of Paju living near the launch site of Imjingak tried to stop balloons from being launched in October 2014 by blocking the way with tractors.&lt;ref name="Feffer2014"/&gt; The locals were joined by left-wing activists supporting rapprochement.

The [[climate of Korea]] poses a challenge for the launches, as the winds blow east for 80 percent of the year and only occasionally blow from the south to the north.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=4}} Balloons sometimes end up in the sea or back to South Korea.&lt;ref name="Park2016"/&gt; There has been a case of the leaflets falling over Seoul due to [[Climate of Seoul|unreliable weather]].{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=4}}

== North Korean counter-campaigns ==

In addition to using balloons as a means of delivery, North Koreans have also used rockets to send leaflets to the DMZ. Many of the retrieved [[Cold War|Cold-War era]] leaflets included maps. One of the leaflets found on the DMZ included a map of Cho Dae-hum's route of [[South Korean defectors|defection to North Korea]] across the DMZ. Many North Korean leaflets during the Cold War gave instructions, in addition to maps, to help the targeted South Korean soldiers in defecting.&lt;ref name="Friedman2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psywarrior.com/NKoreaH.html |title=Communist Korean War Leaflets |last=Friedman |first=Herbert A. |date=5 January 2006 |website=www.psywarrior.com |publisher= |access-date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea restored its balloon leaflet campaign in July 2012 during increased peninsular tensions after the failed [[North Korean missile tests|missile test]] involving [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3]] earlier in April. The propaganda leaflets targeting western border areas in October 2012 praised pro-North activists and criticized the South Korean defense ministry's "anti-Pyongyang education program". This leaflet campaign occurred after South Korea resumed their own balloon leafletting campaign after the bombardment of [[Yeonpyeong]] in 2010–2011. In October 2012, a total of around 16,000–17,000 North Korean leaflets were found by patrolling South Korean soldiers. That had been, according to the South Korean defense ministry, the second time in 2012 they discovered North Korean leaflets after North Korea resumed leafletting in July. There had been a 12-year long break with North Korean leafletting.&lt;ref name="Aljazeera_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph2012" /&gt; It was reported in 2016 that North Korea was still using leaflets. Unlike in the past, North Korea has adopted a new way of showing its disapproval through propaganda instead of resorting into using military force by shooting across the border.&lt;ref name="BBC_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35349686 |title=North Korea is dropping leaflets on the South – what do they say? |date=19 January 2016 |website=[[BBC]] |publisher= |access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT_2016"/&gt; In response to the [[2016 South Korean political scandal]], North Korea intensified leaflet drops supporting the removal of President [[Park Geun-hye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/02/graphic-pro-north-korea-leaflets-found-in-downtown-seoul|title=Graphic, pro-North Korea leaflets found in downtown Seoul|first=Chad|last=O'Carroll|publisher=NK News|date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/02/n-korean-leaflets-with-sexually-explicit-cartoons-of-park-found-in-seoul|title=N.Korean leaflets with sexually explicit cartoons of Park found in Seoul|first=Dagyum|last=Ji|publisher=NK News|date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, North Korean leaflets attacking Donald Trump were found in Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/02/n-korean-leaflets-found-again-in-seoul-one-of-which-targets-donald-trump/|title=N.Korean leaflets found again in Seoul, one of which targets Donald Trump|first=Chad|last=O'Carroll|publisher=NK News|date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, North Korea dropped leaflets promoting rapprochement with the South in the upcoming Winter Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nknews.org/2018/02/new-pro-pyongyang-leaflets-celebrate-olympic-participation-inter-korean-talks|title=New pro-Pyongyang leaflets celebrate Olympic participation, inter-Korean talks|first=Chad|last=O'Carroll|publisher=NK News|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea has warned its citizens that the goods carried by the balloons from South Korea are poisoned, but the North Korean people have been known to ignore these warnings.&lt;ref name="Park_2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=6660 |title=South Korean Leaflets Dust South Hwanghae Province |author=Park In Ho |date=4 August 2010 |website=[[Daily NK]] |publisher= |access-date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their size, the balloons are easy to track.&lt;ref name="Park2016"/&gt; North Korea has been accused of intercepting the balloons and poisoning their contents to convince its citizens that South Koreans do not have good intentions.

As some defectors dress in military-style uniforms and sunglasses, this has been a point for objections.&lt;ref name="Evans_2014"/&gt; Additionally, there is an estimated three to five percent support for the [[far-left]] and the Kim regime in South Korea.&lt;ref name="Bond2015" /&gt;

== Government positions ==

=== North Korean government ===

The North Korean state routinely threatens people involved in the balloon drops.&lt;ref name="Pearson2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kang2015" /&gt; [[Uriminzokkiri]] carried a threatening message in 2013 accusing the activists of acting as human shields for the North Korean activist defectors present.&lt;ref name="Pearson2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nknews.org/2013/06/north-korea-threatens-to-attack-u-s-human-rights-activists/ |title=North Korea threatens to attack U.S. human rights activists |last=Pearson |first=James |date=28 June 2013 |website=[[NK News]] |publisher= |access-date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat of the [[Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland|Committee for Peaceful Reunification]], ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' and the [[National Defense Commission]] have repeatedly condemned the South Korean government's policy on North Korea. The state of North Korea holds the government of South Korea responsible for the balloon drops, and has demanded for harder actions against the activists. North Korea has also threatened military action.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kang2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/08/116_184105.html |title=NK threatens attack on leaflet senders |author=Kang Seung-woo |date=3 August 2015 |website=[[The Korea Times]] |publisher= |access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 December 2012, the Secretariat issued a statement demanding then presidential candidate [[Park Geun-hye]] to terminate [[President of South Korea|president]] [[Lee Myung-bak]]'s policy and to fulfill her [[South Korean presidential election, 2012|presidential election]] pledge.&lt;ref name="Unification2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eng.unikorea.go.kr/content.do?cmsid=1919&amp;mode=view&amp;page=9&amp;cid=32705 |title=Weekly Report on North Korea from December 1 to December 7, 2012 (No.1129) |date=12 December 2012 |publisher=[[Ministry of Unification]]|access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification warned that provokers will be held fully accountable and that the relations of the two states would be again pushed to a catastrophe in the event that the launch would be allowed to happen.&lt;ref name="FlorCruz2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/north-korea-threatens-annihilate-south-korean-group-behind-anti-kim-jong-un-leaflets-1703855 |title=North Korea Threatens To 'Annihilate' South Korean Group Behind Anti-Kim Jong Un Leaflets |last=FlorCruz |first=Michelle |date=13 October 2014 |website=[[International Business Times]] |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rodong Sinmun'' stated in October 2014 that the South Korean government's tolerance of the balloon launches is comparable to an act of war.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014" /&gt;

North Korea has reacted most seriously to the leaflets slandering the [[List of leaders of North Korea|leaders of North Korea]].{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=26}} In summer 2015, one such leaflet launch carried death threats not only to prominent military leaders, but to [[Kim Jong-un]] and his wife [[Ri Sol-ju]] too, which provoked Committee for Peaceful Reunification to respond three days after the launch. The committee accused that leaflet campaigning could not be conducted without protection from the South Korean [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|National Intelligence Service]], [[Ministry of National Defense (South Korea)|Ministry of National Defense]] or [[Ministry of Unification]].&lt;ref name="Kang2015" /&gt;

=== South Korean government ===

The South Korean police occasionally prevents balloon releases out of fear that North Korea may retaliate and endanger civilians living nearby. The government has claimed that the actions of the activists are within freedom of expression, and has appealed to the activists not to commit provocations towards North Korea.&lt;ref name="Guardian2015" /&gt; Chairman [[Kim Moo-sung]] of the [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] was concerned that hardline anti-North Korea activists might not be helping [[inter-Korean relations]], after a balloon launch provoked a shoot-out across the Korean Demilitarized Zone on 10 October 2014.&lt;ref name="Kim2014" /&gt; As a response to the criticism that the government is not doing enough to stop the balloon launches, president Park Geun-hye said that the issue would be "dealt with in a way that considers both freedom of expression and the safety of local residents".&lt;ref name="Won-je2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/674603.html |title=N. Korean refugee group holds surprise launch of propaganda leaflets |author=Son Won-je |date=21 January 2015 |website=[[The Hankyoreh]] |publisher= |access-date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior official from the [[Unification ministry]] spoke anonymously and remarked that previously they tried to stop the balloon releases, but since the [[Cheonan sinking|''Cheonan'' sinking]], they have left the matter to the local police to solve. The local police intervene only if there is violence, or a threat of it.&lt;ref name="Guardian2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/world/asia/27iht-korea.html?_r=0 |title=Balloon-Borne Messages to North Korea Have Detractors on Both Sides of Border |last=McDonald |first=Mark |date=26 April 2011 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |access-date=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness and outcomes ==

[[File:Pyongyang city scape.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Pyongyang cityscape with the Ongnyu bridge crossing the Taedong river on the foreground|Some activists claim they can reach [[Pyongyang]] (pictured) with their balloons.]]

Multiple organizations involved in the campaigns are in competition with each other as they try to acquire financing for their actions. Ideological differences and different motivations between secular and Christian activists have also caused mutual resentment.&lt;ref name="McDonald2011" /&gt; Controversially, some organizations have been accused of lying about their leaflets reaching North Korea by a North Korean defector and Evangelical Christian Lee Min-bok, who is a leading figure in the leafletting along with Park Sang-Hak.&lt;ref name="McDonald2011" /&gt; He accused other organizations of launching balloons from [[Imjingak]] even though it would be impossible to reach North Korea's capital, [[Pyongyang]], from there. He suspects that the balloons would fly to the [[Sea of Japan]] or, at best, to the [[Taebaek Mountains|mountains]] in the [[Kangwon Province (North Korea)|Kangwon]] province. He criticized them for trying to get media attention to increase funding.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=30}} One such launch suspected to be promoting fundraising was made on 19 January 2015 by Human Rights Foundation and Fighters for a Free North Korea.&lt;ref name="Won-je2015" /&gt; Kim Hueng-kang from [[North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity]] says that the balloons are good for pressuring North Korea, even though they tend to fall near the DMZ due to the winds, where there are mostly soldiers to see the leaflets. Park Sang-hak has retained confidence in the balloons, as he says that hundreds of defectors have told to him about having been reached by the leaflets.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=4}} Lee Min-bok has said that "[t]he balloon launch is a primitive humanitarian activity for human rights, which opens eyes, ears and mouths of North Korean people that have been closed by the North Korean regime".&lt;ref name="Padden2014" /&gt; Lee Min-bok also downplayed the chance of war breaking out as a result of the balloon launches.&lt;ref name="Padden2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/anti-north-korean-balloon-acitivist-promise-propaganda-campaigning/2484579.html |title=N. Korean Defector Vows More Airborne Leafleting |last=Padden |first=Brian |date=15 October 2014 |website=[[Voice of America]] |publisher= |access-date=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian organizations have also had their motives questioned. The Christian activists have been accused of being more interested in proselytizing than actually saving people. For instance, a balloon landing on the roof of a farmer's house could bring trouble to the family. Furthermore, [[Christian literature]] is an especially dangerous material to have in North Korea.&lt;ref name="Feffer2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ips-dc.org/koreas-balloon-war/ |title=Korea’s Balloon War |last=Feffer |first=John |date=6 November 2014 |website=[[Institute for Policy Studies]] |publisher= |access-date=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korean American missionary Douglas Shin has said that Christians have picked up a banner to help North Koreans, and that "some people don't like using the word crusade, but that's exactly what this is—a crusade to liberate North Korea".&lt;ref name="Faiola2005" /&gt; South Korean and U.S. officials and analysts agree that the effects of missionary work are difficult to assess. Furthermore, they say that changing North Korea through religion is very difficult.&lt;ref name="Faiola2005" /&gt;

Jin-Heon Jung reports that a North Korean ex-intelligence agent, Lee Min-bok, told that soldiers indeed liked to see pornographic South Korean pictures; however, they saw it as a sign that the South Korean capitalist society was a completely rotten one. Another North Korean having served as a soldier recalled that he felt disgusted by the pictures.&lt;ref name="McDonald2011" /&gt;{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=19}} Other ex-soldiers like Lim Young-sun, who runs the online television channel [[Unification Broadcasting]], which shows [[North Korean propaganda]] to help in understanding the culture of the North,{{sfn|VICE News|2015|loc=17:40–18:15}} have stated that the leaflets and contents like candy dropped on the North Korean soil actually calmed their initial hostility towards the South Koreans.{{sfn|VICE News|2015|loc=17:10–17:20}}&lt;ref name="Hodges2015" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2016 that there has been no reliable study on how many North Koreans read the leaflets, or how they react on them.&lt;ref name="NYT_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/world/asia/south-north-korea-balloon-drop.html |title=A ‘Balloon Warrior’ Subverts North Korea, Thousands of Leaflets at a Time |author=Choe Sang-Hun |date=14 October 2016 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, South Korean people are known to mostly ignore North Korean leaflets as South Korea is a democratic society with distinct political values.&lt;ref name="BBC_2016"/&gt;

[[Andrei Lankov]] of [[Kookmin University]] thinks that leaflets that can only contain a relatively short text are unlikely to convince their readers and as such are ineffective in comparison to, for instance, radio programs.&lt;ref name="Lankov2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lankov|first=Andrei|title=The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-939003-8|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Lee Jung-hoon from [[Yonsei University]] is not convinced that an organization such as North Korean People's Liberation Front is able to truly destabilize the North Korean regime, whatever methods they used, as they would have challenges trying to infiltrate North Korean society and posing as an alternative to the regime.&lt;ref name="RadioAustralia2012" /&gt;

Professor Lee Woo-young of the [[University of North Korean Studies]] questions how it would be possible to demand North Korea to stop its hostile actions, as sending leaflets across the border is a violation of the [[Inter-Korean Basic Agreement]] from 1992. In the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, both governments agreed to stop hostile actions against each other.&lt;ref name="Kang2013" /&gt;

[[Suzanne Scholte]] of the [[Defense Forum Foundation]], an organization working mainly for [[Sub-Saharan]] self-determination and North Korean human rights, has called the balloons "nuclear missile[s] of truth and hope for North Korean people".{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=7}}

Director [[John Feffer]] from [[Foreign Policy in Focus]] argues that the activists should learn from the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Polish 'self-limiting revolution']] (the Second Solidarity) [[History of Solidarity#Second Solidarity (1988–89)|in 1988–1989]], as pushing one's own government too hard can be harmful to the cause. He criticizes the activists for making maximalist claims about the smuggled information, and for refusing to compromise, as they try to reach their goals. Feffer considers the activists' actions to be harmful because they put human lives in danger, harm inter-Korean dialogue and harm the democratic legitimacy of the South Korean state.&lt;ref name="Feffer2014" /&gt;

However, the launching of balloons has provoked North Korea to threaten activists by warning that it would shell the areas with balloon launches.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=26}} In October 2014, the North Korean border guards' attempt to shoot down some of the balloons led to a firefight due to North Korean shots landing near a South Korean military base and a residential area.&lt;ref name="Guardian2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FlorCruz2014" /&gt; A North Korean spy was arrested in 2011 and accused of trying to assassinate balloon campaign activist Park Sang-hak.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2014|p=2}} In 2014, a North Korean agent posing as a defector was arrested for reportedly attempting to assassinate Choi Jung-hoon, another activist involved in the balloon drops and the commander of the North Korean People's Liberation Front.&lt;ref name="Hodges2015" /&gt; Jin-Heon Jung points out that the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=31}} The balloons may contribute to a decay of the remaining cooperation between the Korean governments; activists have been blamed of eagerly trying to destroy any cooperation between the governments.&lt;ref name="Feffer2014" /&gt;

==Commitment to end Balloon Propaganda==
On May 1, 2018, North and South Korea leaders made a commitment to ending all border propaganda, including the balloon propaganda campaign.&lt;ref name=may1&gt;https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-05/south-korea-faces-decision-over-leaflets-ties-warm-north&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment was enforced by South Korea on May 5, when an official from Unification Ministry ordered a group of North Korean defectors led by Lee Min-bok to halt their anti-North Korean balloon campaign.&lt;ref name=may1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=may5 /&gt;

==Establishment of Buffer Zone==
On November 1, 2018, both Koreas established buffer zones near the Korean border.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2018/11/01/0200000000AEN20181101002500315.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Agreement on the Implementation of the
Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain, hot air balloons cannot travel within 25 km of the DMZ &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncnk.org/sites/default/files/Agreement%20on%20the%20Implementation%20of%20the%20Historic%20Panmunjom%20Declaration%20in%20the%20Military%20Domain.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bandi Chhor Divas''' ("Day of Liberation") (ਬੰਦੀ ਛੋੜ ਦਿਵਸ) is a [[Sikhism|Sikh]] holiday which coincides with the day of [[Diwali]]. Sikhs historically celebrated Diwali along with Hindus, with [[Guru Amar Das]] explicitly listing it along with [[Vaisakhi]] as a festival for Sikhs.&lt;ref name="ColeSambhi1995p135"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Owen Cole|author2=Piara Singh Sambhi|title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zIC_MgJ5RMUC&amp;pg=PA135|year= 1995|publisher= Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-13-4|pages=135–136}}, '''Quote:''' "Since the time of Guru Amar Das it has been customary for Sikhs to assemble before their Guru on three of the most important Hindu festival occasions - Vaisakhi, Divali and Maha Shivaratri".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Kuiper|title=The Culture of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8PJFLeURhsC&amp;pg=PA127 |year=2010|publisher= The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-61530-149-2|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: a Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874557-0|pages=28-29, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 20th century, Sikh religious leaders increasingly called Diwali as Bandi Chhor Divas, and the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] adopted this name along with the [[Nanakshahi calendar]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=nesbitt122&gt;{{cite book|author=Eleanor Nesbitt|title=Sikhism: a Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XebnCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-874557-0|page=6, 122-123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Hindu festival of [[Diwali]] whose significance is based on the texts and scriptures of [[Hinduism]], Bandi Chhor Divas celebrates a Sikh historic event related to the sixth Guru, [[Guru Hargobind]]. According to Sikh history, on this day, Guru Hargobind was released from prison by the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] who freed 52 other Hindu kings with him.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis G. Jestice, [https://books.google.com/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA345 Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEP0Ty-GuVEC&amp;pg=PA48 Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed by Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Knut A.

The Bandi Chhor Divas is celebrated in a manner similar to Diwali, with the lighting of homes and Gurdwaras, feasts, gift giving and family time. It is an important Sikh celebration along with Vaisakhi, Maghi, Holi with Hola Mohalla and [[Guru Nanak Gurpurab|Gurpurab]].&lt;ref name=nesbitt122/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DQeKTUXphPMC&amp;pg=PA29 Glimpses of Sikhism By Major Nahar Singh Jawandha]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Description==
{{Sikhism sidebar}}

In addition to ''Nagar keertan'' (a street procession) and an ''Akhand paath'' (a continuous reading of [[Guru Granth Sahib]]), Bandi Shor (Shodh) Divas is celebrated with a fireworks display. The Shri Harmandir Sahib, as well as the whole complex, is festooned with thousands of shimmering lights. The temple organizes continuous ''[[kirtan]]'' singing and special musicians. Sikhs consider this occasion as an important time to visit Gurdwaras and spend time with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh|title=Sikhism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8yWAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT86 |year=2011|publisher =I.B.Tauris|isbn =978-0-85773-549-2|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Too many people, he wrote, were being persuaded by his teachings, and if the Guru would not become a Muslim the Panth had to be extinguished. Jahangir believed that Guru Arjan was a Hindu who pretended to be a saint and that he had been thinking of forcing Guru Arjan to convert to Islam or his false trade should be eliminated, for a long time. Mughal authorities seem plain to have been responsible for Arjan's death in custody in Lahore, and this may be accepted as an established fact. Whether the death was by execution, the result of torture, or drowning in the Ravi River remains unresolved.

Jahangir responded by jailing the 14 year old Guru Hargobind at [[Gwalior Fort]] in 1609, on the pretext that the fine imposed on Guru Arjan had not been paid by the Sikhs and Guru Hargobind.&lt;ref name=mandair48&gt;{{cite book|title= Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed|author= Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BEP0Ty-GuVEC&amp;pg=PA48|publisher= [[A &amp; C Black]]|year= 2013|isbn= 9781441117083|page= 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear as to how much time he spent as a prisoner.

The '''Battle of Boju''' ({{zh|t=柏舉之戰}}) was the decisive battle of the war fought in 506 BC between [[Wu (state)|Wu]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]], two major kingdoms during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of ancient China. The Wu forces were led by [[King Helü of Wu|King Helü]], his brother [[Fugai]], and Chu exile [[Wu Zixu]]. According to [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', [[Sun Tzu]], the author of ''[[The Art of War]]'', was a main commander of the Wu army, but he was not mentioned in the ''Zuo Zhuan'' and other earlier historical texts.  The Chu forces were led by ''[[Prime minister (Chu State)|Lingyin]]'' (prime minister) [[Nang Wa]] (also known as Zichang) and ''Sima'' (chief military commander) [[Shen Yin Shu]]. The Wu were victorious, and captured and destroyed the Chu capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]].

==Background==
Wu was originally a minor state east of Chu, which was a major power of the Spring and Autumn Period and was frequently at war with the state of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], the other major power north of Chu. In order to check Chu's expansion, Jin made an alliance with Wu, trained the Wu army, and taught them to use chariots. Wu gradually grew stronger, and in 584 BC defeated Chu for the first time and annexed the Chu city of [[Zhoulai]]. In the following 70 years Chu and Wu fought ten wars, with Wu winning most of them.&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.gov.cn/big5/hist/2009-07/22/content_4005805.htm |title=柏舉之戰 (Battle of Boju) |publisher=China Ministry of Defense |date=22 July 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425142249/http://www.mod.gov.cn/big5/hist/2009-07/22/content_4005805.htm |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[King Ping of Chu]], the corrupt official [[Fei Wuji]] induced the king to marry the bride of Crown Prince Jian.  Fearing the revenge of the prince when he would become king, Fei persuaded King Ping to exile Prince Jian and kill his advisor Wu She along with his son Wu Shang.  Wu She's second son [[Wu Zixu]] escaped to the state of Wu and vowed revenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_040.htm |title=楚世家 (House of Chu) |work=[[Records of the Grand Historian]] |author=[[Sima Qian]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310023405/http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_040.htm |archivedate=10 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fei Wuji was later executed by Nang Wa and Shen Yin Shu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ctext.org/lv-shi-chun-qiu/shen-xing/zh |script-title=zh:慎行 |work=呂氏春秋 ([[Lüshi Chunqiu]]) |language=Chinese |author=[[Lü Buwei]] |accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kingdom of Wu, Wu Zixu became a trusted advisor of Prince Guang and helped him assassinate his cousin [[King Liao of Wu]]. Prince Guang ascended the throne and was known as [[King Helü of Wu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_066.htm |title=伍子胥列传 (Biography of Wu Zixu) |work=[[Records of the Grand Historian]] |author=[[Sima Qian]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of the Wu-Chu War==
[[File:Chinese plain 5c. BC-en.svg|right]]
''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', one of the earliest Chinese works of narrative history compiled in the 4th century BC, gives a detailed account of the battle and the larger war.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=xwomen/texts/chunqiu.xml&amp;style=xwomen/xsl/dynaxml.xsl&amp;chunk.id=d2.17&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;doc.lang=bilingual |title=BOOK XI. DUKE DING |work=[[Zuo Zhuan]] |author=[[Zuo Qiuming]] |language=Chinese, English| accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 506 BC, during the reign of [[King Zhao of Chu]], King Helü decided to invade Chu. The king personally led the army, along with his younger brother Fugai and Wu Zixu.  Wu was joined by the minor states of [[Cai (state)|Cai]] and [[Tang (state)|Tang]] whose monarchs had been held prisoners by the Chu prime minister Nang Wa. The Wu army sailed up the [[Huai River]] and then left their ships and marched to the east bank of the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]]. In response, Nang Wa and chief military commander Shen Yin Shu led the Chu army to the west bank of the Han, across the river from the invaders.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

Shen Yin Shu devised a plan in which Nang Wa would take up defensive positions with the main army along the Han River, while Shen would go north to [[Fangcheng County|Fangcheng]] on Chu's northern frontier, and lead the troops stationed there to destroy the Wu ships left on the Huai River as well as block the three passes on the Wu army's return route.  Nang Wa would then cross the Han River and the two forces would simultaneously attack the Wu army from both the front and the back. Nang accepted the plan, and Shen departed for Fangcheng.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

After Shen's departure, however, the historiographer Shi Huang (史皇) said to Nang Wa that the people of Chu hated Nang and loved Shen Yin Shu, and that if he followed Shen's plan then Shen would take all the credit for the victory and Nang would be doomed. Nang had a change of heart and decided to cross the river and attack right away.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

The two armies fought three battles between the Xiaobie (southeast of present-day [[Hanchuan]])&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt; and [[Dabie Mountains]] and the Wu forces were victorious. Convinced that he could not win, Nang Wa wanted to flee but was dissuaded by Shi Huang.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

On the 19th day of the 11th month ([[Chinese calendar]]),&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt; the two armies were drawn up at Boju. Fugai asked King Helü for permission to attack, saying that Nang Wa was cruel and his soldiers had no will to fight, and that if he attacked the Chu soldiers were sure to flee.  King Helü denied his request, but Fugai decided to disobey the king and attack anyway with his own force of 5,000 men. As he predicted, the Chu soldiers fled and the Chu army was routed.  Shi Huang was killed in the battle and Nang Wa escaped to the state of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]].&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

Fugai then pursued the Chu army to Qingfa River, waited until half of them had crossed the river, and then attacked and defeated them again.  Later, the Wu army caught up with the Chu soldiers when they were having their meal. The Chu soldiers fled, and the Wu troops ate their food, resumed the pursuit, and defeated them again at Yongshi River (雍澨, present-day Sima River in [[Jingshan County]]).&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt; After winning five battles, the Wu army reached [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]], the capital of Chu.  King Zhao of Chu escaped first to [[Yun County, Hubei|Yun]], and then to the state of [[Sui (state)|Sui]], and the Wu army captured Ying.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

Shen Yin Shu had by now returned and defeated the Wu forces at Yongshi, but he was wounded three times in as many battles. Not wanting to be captured alive, he ordered officer Wu Goubi to kill him and bring his head home.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the fall of Ying, [[Shen Baoxu]], an official of Chu and a former friend of Wu Zixu, went to the [[State of Qin]] to plead for assistance. At first the Qin ruler [[Duke Ai of Qin|Duke Ai]] refused to help, but after Shen spent seven days crying in the palace courtyard, Duke Ai was moved by his devotion and agreed to send troops to assist Chu.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

In 505 BC, the Qin and Chu armies jointly defeated Wu in several battles. In September, Fugai returned to Wu and declared himself king. King Helü was therefore forced to return and defeated Fugai, who fled and sought refuge in Chu. King Zhao of Chu then returned to the capital Ying.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Historian Fan Wenlan considers the Battle of Boju and the Wu-Chu War the first large-scale war of the [[Eastern Zhou Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;  Chu, one of the most powerful states in the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn Period]], would never regain its former strength and Wu reached the zenith of its power.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;  However, Wu was unable to hold on to its territorial gains and its strength would not last for long. In 473 BC, only three decades after it almost conquered the Kingdom of Chu, the Kingdom of Wu itself would be conquered by the rising power of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] to its south.

The battle is largely attributed to the famous Chinese general [[Sun Tzu]]. In the ''[[Art of War]]'' it was said that Sun Tzu led the forces of Wu during the battle. However, there has been no records of his participation in the battle. The ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', the primary source of the battle, does not mention Sun Tzu at all.&lt;ref name="zuozhuan"/&gt;

{{Computer hacking}}

A '''black hat hacker''' (or '''black-hat hacker''') is a [[Hacker (term)|hacker]] who "violates computer security for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain".&lt;ref name="Moore2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=Cybercrime: Investigating High Technology Computer Crime|year=2005|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Company|isbn=1-59345-303-5|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The term's origin is often attributed to [[hacker culture]] theorist [[Richard Stallman]] (though he denies coining it)&lt;ref name="Counterintuitive"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-counterintuitive-history-of-black-hats-white-hats-and-villains|title=The Counterintuitive History of Black Hats, White Hats, And Villains|last=Laskow|first=Sarah|date=January 27, 2017|website=[[Atlas Obscura]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629024647/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-counterintuitive-history-of-black-hats-white-hats-and-villains|archive-date=June 29, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=June 29, 2018|quote=In early hacking circles, there was a whole separate term to refer to malicious hacking: those people were called crackers. Across the internet, Richard Stallman, who founded the GNU Project and Free Software Foundation, is often credited with coining the term 'black hat' hacker, but he says that’s not correct. 'I have never used terms 'X-hat hacker' because I reject the use of 'hacking' to refer to breaking security,' he says. Where did the term come from then? 'I don't know where,' he says.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to contrast the exploitative hacker with the [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] hacker  who hacks protectively by drawing attention to vulnerabilities in computer systems that require repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien, Marakas|first=James, George|title=Management Information Systems |year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill/ Irwin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-752217-9|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black hat/white hat terminology originates in the [[Western (genre)| Western genre]] of popular American culture, in which [[black and white hat symbolism in film|black and white hats]] denote villainous  and heroic cowboys respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVnA8pQmS54C&amp;pg=PA26 |title=Ninja Hacking: Unconventional Penetration Testing Tactics and Techniques |first=Thomas |last=Wilhelm |first2=Jason |last2=Andress |publisher=Elsevier |year=2010 |pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival''' is an annual four-day [[music festival]] developed and produced by [[Superfly Presents]] and [[AC Entertainment]].  Since its first year in 2002, it has been held at what is now [[Great Stage Park]] on a  650-acre (263 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) farm in [[Manchester, Tennessee]], USA.  The festival typically starts on the second Thursday in June and lasts four days. Main attractions of this festival are the multiple stages featuring live music with a  diverse array of musical styles including [[indie rock]], [[classic rock]], [[world music]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[Americana (music)|americana]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music]], [[folk music|folk]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[reggae]], [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic music|electronic]], and other [[alternative music]]. Musical acts play from around noon until 3:00am or later.

The festival began with a focus on [[jam band]]s and folk rock; it has diversified in recent years but continues to pay tribute to its roots.  Notable acts have included [[Eminem]], [[U2]], [[Phish]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Radiohead]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Kanye West]], [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The White Stripes]], [[Neil Young]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Tom Petty]], [[The Dead (band)|The Dead]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[James Brown]], [[Wilco]], [[Bon Iver]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Mumford and Sons]], [[Of Monsters and Men]], [[Jay Z]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Black Keys]], [[Zac Brown Band]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], [[The Police]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[The Strokes]], [[The Black Crowes]], [[Metallica]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[Kings of Leon]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Dead &amp; Company]], and [[Widespread Panic]].  The festival features craftsmen and artisans selling unique products, food and drink vendors, a comedy tent, silent disco, cinema tent, and a [[Ferris wheel]].

Bonnaroo Music Festival was largely influenced by rock concerts of the late 1960s and early 1970s, as well as the massive [[Phish festivals]] of the late 1990s.  The festival is a nod to the [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey International Pop Music Festival]] (1967), the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1970)|Atlanta International Pop Festival]] (1969, 1970), and most famously the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Music &amp; Art Fair]] (1969).

The festival was ranked in 2003 by [[Rolling Stone magazine|''Rolling Stone'' magazine]] as one of the "50 Moments That Changed Rock &amp; Roll",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumnus.tennessee.edu/2012/05/the-birth-of-bonnaroo/|title=The Birth of Bonnaroo|first=Wayne|last=Bledsoe|publisher=Tennessee Alumnus Magazine|date=May 11, 2012|accessdate=June 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Festival of the Decade" by ''[[Consequence of Sound]],'' and among the 10 Best Festivals by ''[[GQ Magazine]]''.

==History==
Bonnaroo was established by Ashley Capps of AC Entertainment and Kerry Black (graphic design), Rick Farman (festival operations), Richard Goodstone (marketing), and Jonathan Mayers (programming) of Superfly Productions.

The first Bonnaroo Music Festival took place in 2002. The founders chose "bonnaroo" (Creole slang meaning a really good time) for its literal meaning and to honor the rich New Orleans music tradition they had enjoyed in college. Bonnaroo was popularized by New Orleans R&amp;B singer [[Dr. John]] with his 1974 album ''[[Desitively Bonnaroo]].''&lt;ref name="buchanan"&gt;{{cite web|first = Leigh|last = Buchanan|url = http://www.inc.com/magazine/201106/how-we-did-it-superfly-presents.html|title = The Founders of Superfly Presents and Brains Behind Bonnaroo|publisher = Inc.com|date = 2011-05-31|accessdate = 2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |last=Dougherty |first=Steve |title=Dr. John's Unlikely New Partner |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=March 30, 2012 |page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnaroo is derived from the French ''"bonne"'' /bɔn/ the feminine agreement of ''"bon"'' /bɔ̃/ meaning "good," and the French ''"rue"'' /ry/ meaning "street," translating roughly to ''"the best on the streets"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/arts/music/bonnaroo-journal.html |title=Jon Pareles at the Bonnaroo Music Festival|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders were inspired by music festivals they attended in the 1990s, including those put on by the band [[Phish festivals|Phish]], and events held in [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] and [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]]. They found a site in [[Manchester, Tennessee]] that had facilities and good highway access. Using only their website for ticket sales, they sold out the festival in about two weeks. By 2003, the festival had been named by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine as one of the 'top 50 moments in rock &amp; roll.' Comedy acts such as Jim Breuer were first added in 2005. In 2007, Bonnaroo purchased the land for the festival, creating Great Stage Park with all of its iconic features. They installed a permanent main stage in 2010.&lt;ref name="buchanan"/&gt;

In 2016, AC entertainment was purchased by Live Nation Entertainment.  Following the very weak attendance for the 2016 event, Live Nation responded with performances by U2, Lorde, The Weeknd, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2017, returning the attendance to 65,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Live Nation Buys AC Entertainment." ''The Tennessean''. Retrieved 2016-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
On January 10, 2007, Bonnaroo organizers Superfly Productions and AC Entertainment purchased a major portion of the site where the annual music festival is held. The purchase of {{convert|530|acre|km2}} encompassed all of the performance areas and much of the camping and parking area used for the annual festival; the festival will continue to lease another {{convert|250|acre|km2}} that currently serve as additional parking and camping. Since its inception, Bonnaroo has contributed more than $1 million directly to [[Coffee County, Tennessee|Coffee County]] organizations.

In addition to the festival's annual charitable contributions, its activities help generate annual revenue for the county. Measured in a 2005 study, the economic impact of the event on Coffee County was more than $14 million in business revenues and more than $4 million in personal income. The Bonnaroo music festival makes most of its income from the fans.

The festival regularly contributes to charities including Doctors Without Borders, Head Count, MusiCares, Habitat for Humanity, Boys and Girls Club of America, Rock the Earth, the American Red Cross, and the Sierra Club. It provided aid to assist local organizations following disasters such as the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], 2005 [[Hurricane Katrina]], Nashville floods, and Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

By 2013, the direct and indirect economic impact of the festival since inception was estimated at $51 million, including $2.9 million in tax revenue for the year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2013/may/20/study-bonnaroo-has-51m-economic-impact/|title=Study: Bonnaroo has $51M economic impact|author=|publisher=Knoxville News Sentinel|date=May 20, 2013|accessdate=June 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
Bonnaroo actively supports recycling and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonnaroo.com/festival/greening-activism.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123072138/http://www.bonnaroo.com/festival/greening-activism.aspx |date=January 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, A Greener Festival recognized Bonnaroo's efforts for the previous three years with an award.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agreenerfestival.com/2011/10/46-festivals-win-our-coveted-award/ |title=46 Festivals Win The Coveted Greener Festival Award |publisher=Agreenerfestival.com |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Bonaroo said it prevented having to collect 120 tons of trash by encouraging fans to recycle. Food and drink are sold in organic and recyclable materials to create less waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnaroo.com/get-involved/sustainability/greening-history |title=13 Years of Green &amp;#124; Bonnaroo 2015 |publisher=Bonnaroo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; AGF auditors review festivals, as well as requiring their self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="award"/&gt; As of late, Bonnaroo initiates many "green" activities during the festival, such as Planet Roo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bonnaroo.com/activities/environment-health-wellness|title = Save the Planet|date = |access-date = February 4, 2016|website = Bonnaroo|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a hub advocating sustainability and effective change toward the environment.

==Accolades==
When the festival first began in 2002, USA Today referred to Bonnaroo as "The culmination of a musical movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2002/2002-06-25-bonnaroo.htm |title=Bonnaroo bands jam for a wider audience |work=USA Today |date=June 25, 2002 |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN described it as: "Music and subculture melted together into a pot of creative bubbling energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joseph Van Harken CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/18/sprj.cas03.bonnaroo.cover/index.html?iref=allsearch |title=Raising the Bonnaroof - Jun. 18, 2003 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, it was named "Best Festival" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, calling it "the ultimate over-the-top summer festival."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20200609/page/23 |title=The 125-Plus People, Places and Things Ruling the Rock &amp; Roll Universe : Rolling Stone |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2015-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404161938/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20200609/page/23 |archivedate=April 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' also recognized Bonnaroo as one of “50 moments that changed rock &amp; roll.”

''The New York Times'' said "Bonnaroo has revolutionized the modern rock festival" in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/arts/summer-festivals-pop-and-jazz-bonnaroo-jams-in-everyone.html?pagewanted=10 |title=SUMMER FESTIVALS: POP AND JAZZ; Bonnaroo Jams In Everyone|newspaper= The New York Times|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' called it the "Best festival of the summer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZ4ej5RmWFUC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;ots=okcnTlPbPw&amp;dq=%25E2%2580%259CBest%20festival%20of%20the%20summer%25E2%2580%259D%20%25E2%2580%2593%20SPIN&amp;pg=PA110%23v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=SPIN - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Which.jpg|thumb|Which Stage at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, TN.]]
The official venues located at Bonnaroo often change from year to year. The following are some of the more permanent venues.

* Centeroo: The central area of Bonnaroo. Served by two main entrances, it encloses nearly all of the festival activity. Various merchants and activities supplement the music-related activities located here. While Centeroo is open 24 hours a day, musical artists generally only play from noon until the evening, followed by the unopposed headlining act. Afterwards, late-night sets usually run from midnight until the early morning, sometimes as late as 5 or 6 AM.
* What Stage: The main stage of the festival is the largest. What Stage is open from approximately noon until midnight (late night sets usually over by 3am). Traditionally, the headlining act each day will play on the What Stage; no other acts perform at that time. 
* Which Stage: The second stage generally features the last performance before that of the headlining act each night. After the headlining act performs, a late-night show generally follows here.
* This Tent and That Tent: These tents serve as a combined tertiary tier for musical performances. Late-night shows also generally occur in all three of these venues, along with the yearly Superjam, a [[:wikt:one-off|one-off]] combination of various musicians performing at the festival.
* The Other: This third, smaller stage hosts many of the event's EDM acts and often runs in to the late hours of the night. The Other was originally a tent (Other Tent), similar to This Tent and That Tent, but was transformed into a stage (with EDM in mind) ahead of the 2017 event.
* Who Stage and New Music On Tap: Who and NMOT have smaller viewing areas and feature many of the lesser-known acts playing the event over the course of the weekend.
* Comedy Tent: This tent is reserved for comedy acts, such as stand-up comedians.

==Notable performances==
[[The Beastie Boys]] performed on the main stage on June 12, 2009. With the passing of [[Adam Yauch]] nearly three years later, this would mark the band's final performance.

[[R&amp;B]] singer [[D'Angelo]] marked his return to American stages for the first time in over 12 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/03/watch-dangelo-questloves-bonnaroo-superjam|title=Watch DAngelo &amp; Questlove’s Bonnaroo Superjam|author=|date=March 20, 2013|website=consequenceofsound.net|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on June 9, 2012 with a surprise performance at the festival's annual Superjam. He was backed by members of the R&amp;B collective The [[Soulquarians]], most notably [[Questlove]], [[James Poyser]] and [[Pino Palladino]], with guest guitarist [[Jesse Johnson (musician)|Jesse Johnson]]. The set was composed almost entirely of covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/bonnaroo-superjam/2012/great-stage-park-manchester-tn-33df3cb9.html|title=Bonnaroo Superjam Setlist at Bonnaroo 2012|author=|date=|website=setlist.fm|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2014, [[soul music]] singer [[Bobby Womack]] would give his final performance before passing away on June 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2672939/Legendary-soul-singer-Bobby-Womack-dies-age-70.html|title=Legendary soul singer Bobby Womack dies age 70|author=|date=|website=dailymail.co.uk|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
[[Image:Bonnarooooooooo-bot.JPG|thumb|right|300px|alt=A robot with wavy tentacle arms.|Graffiti by Nashville artist Ryan McCauley on the Graffiti Wall, which separates Centeroo from the campsites.]] Available to the Bonnaroo public throughout the week are various activity tents. These tents become most popular with the night crowd, with such activities set up as The Silent Disco tent, and other club or bar-themed venues. In the Silent Disco, each person entering is given a set of headphones that sync with the DJ and the music. Everyone is listening to the same song through the headphones while appearing from the outside to be dancing to no music at all.

The Comedy Tent has featured such comedians as [[Mike Birbiglia]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]]. The Cinema tent, showing a variety of mainstream and independent movies, is popular, in part because it is air conditioned.  The Broo’ers Festival tent features independent breweries from all over the United States.

Outside the big tents, Planet Roo hosts a variety of non-profit organizations sharing information on healthy lifestyles and resource conservation. Splash-a-Roo (a giant slip-n-slide area) and a giant mushroom fountain provide practical ways to beat the heat. Bonnaroo creators designated the wall surrounding Centeroo, colloquially called "the Graffiti Wall", as a place for street artists to paint their choices.

The campgrounds consist of ten pods organized by the producers with activities and services for the campers. Each pod has an information and medical booth, and a community art project. Many of the pods also feature barns with activities going day and night, and offering a place to relax or purchase refreshments. Often the community art projects develop as joint projects between invited artists and the campers: past festival pods have featured birdhouse construction, decorating stretched canvas, a giant Lite Brite-like panel, and huge frames and raw clay which festival goers shaped to their taste. Some of the art installations are finished prior to the festival. In addition to information, medical services and an art project, each pod offers public showers for $10 each.

In 2009, Bonnaroo featured the Bungaloo, a community art project that invited festival goers each to paint a small tile. These were affixed to 10-foot water drops suspended between The Other Tent and This Tent. With each tile painted, the festival-goer could vote for the charity of choice. Bungaloo, a new online paint company, made a $1000 donation to the charity with the most votes.

== Soopergroop ==
In 2013, Bonnaroo brought its stage to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lucas|last=Shaw |url=http://www.thewrap.com/bonnaroo-launches-soopergroop-documentary-series-exclusive |title=Bonnaroo Launches 'Soopergroop' Documentary Series (Exclusive) |publisher=Thewrap.com |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with talent and Bonnaroo fans, Bonnaroo and Los Angeles production company Kids At Play created Soopergroop – a band created from four musical acts brought together over four days to create and share original works at Bonnaroo 2013 and launch Bonnaroo’s YouTube channel. The channel’s title, Bonnaroo 365, refers to the celebration’s intention to be part of fans’ daily lives. YouTube’s position with musician and fans – amassing 1.9 billion views of music videos in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html |title=Statistics |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; – made it an essential platform for the music festival.

They met for the first time at Bonnaroo in June. Their work process over the four-day festival was the subject of an eight-part documentary series by Kids At Play released on Bonnaroo’s YouTube Channel.

The Comedy Central hit show Broad City makes mention of the festival in the episode ‘B&amp;B NYC’ (S:3, E:07) and also make a comment about the festival at 1 other time. In fact, the girls were invited to do a comedy performance in 2014. They rode around thinking they wouldn’t be noticed, but plenty of fans spotted them and got high fives or photo ops in.

On November 8 of the same year, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] eventually decided that Marcos be buried at Heroes' Cemetery on an unspecified date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court allows Libingan burial for Marcos|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/08/1641728/supreme-court-allows-libingan-burial-marcos|work=The Philippine Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The burial of Marcos took place on November 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Late dictator Marcos buried at Libingan ng mga Bayani|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/18/16/late-dictator-marcos-buried-at-libingan-ng-mga-bayani|work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burial of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], particularly at the Heroes' Cemetery has been a controversial issue as critics, particularly victims of human rights violations during the [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law era]], and participants of the [[People Power Revolution]] have opposed attempts to bury Marcos, who they deem as unfit to be buried at the particular cemetery due to his authoritarian rule, and allege that the Marcos family has yet to return money illegally removed from the country's treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/08/anti-marcos-burial-protesters-stage-rallies/|title=Anti-Marcos burial protesters stage rallies|date=8 November 2016|work=[[Manila Bulletin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion on his burial remains split: 50 percent of the 1,800 respondents of a survey conducted by [[Social Weather Stations|SWS]] in February 2016 said Marcos “was worthy to be buried at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani” while the other half rejected a hero’s burial.&lt;ref name="ABS-CBN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/focus/03/13/16/is-philippines-ready-for-a-state-burial-for-marcos/|title=Is Philippines ready for a state burial for Marcos?|date=14 March 2016|work=[[ABS-CBN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were conflicting claims on where the deceased Marcos wished to be buried. Former Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan III, one of the signatories of an agreement to move Marcos' body from [[Hawaii]] to the Philippines during the term of then President [[Fidel V. Ramos]], said that Marcos wished to be buried beside his mother in his hometown in [[Batac, Ilocos Norte]], while his wife [[Imelda Marcos]] said that his wish was to be buried in Manila insisting that he should be buried at the Heroes' Cemetery.

Former Presidents [[Corazon Aquino]] and Fidel V. Ramos had opposed moves to bury Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery during their respective terms, while Former President [[Joseph Estrada]] attempted to bury Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery but later cancelled the burial. [[Rodrigo Duterte]], during the campaign period and debates and as well having won the presidential elections, repeatedly asserted his plans for the burial of the remains claiming the act is in accordance with the existing laws of the Philippines, as well as an insisting the burial will be an instrument for the beginning of "nation-wide healing" but the plan was met with criticism due to claims of [[historical revisionism]] or [[historical negationism|negationism]]. The burial of Marcos, with [[military honors]], was conducted in a private ceremony on November 18, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/18/16/afp-we-only-followed-marcoses-wish-to-keep-burial-secret|title=AFP: We only followed Marcoses' wish to keep burial secret|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It resulted in widespread expressions of indignation and nationwide protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/11/19/Protesters-Marcos-burial.html|title=Protesters take to streets to denounce Marcos 'Libingan' burial|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Transfer of Marcos' body from Hawaii===
After Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989, his family attempted to bring his remains from [[Hawaii]] to the Philippines but the administration President [[Corazon Aquino]] imposed a ban against the entry of Marcos' remains into the country. This was lifted on October 9, 1991 by Aquino on the condition that Marcos' burial would not be used for political purposes and on the condition that the body of Marcos be flown directly to Laoag. Aquino's executive secretary [[Franklin Drilon]] said that a "heroes burial" would be allowed if held in Marcos' home province instead of Manila. Imelda Marcos, the wife of Ferdinand Marcos opposed the move saying that the dying wish of her husband was to be buried in Manila.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino agrees to Marcos burial|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=msFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T-oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3917%2C3019396|accessdate=16 August 2016|agency=New York Times News Service|publisher=Gainesville Sun|date=10 October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1992, the Philippine government stated that it may not oppose the burial of Marcos anywhere in [[Metro Manila]] provided that Marcos' body was flown into the country after the [[Philippine general election, 1992|1992 Philippine election]] in May.

The transfer of Marcos' body would not be done until the administration of President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].

According to Rafael Alunan III, former Interior Secretary and one of the signatories of the agreement, the third clause was agreed upon due to "wounds [that] were still fresh in the minds of many people" and to avoid potential instability. He also said that the former President Marcos wanted to be buried beside his mother in Batac, Ilocos Norte.&lt;ref name=ilocosburial/&gt; Also according to Alunan, after the signing of the agreement, Imelda Marcos crossed out the burial clause and wrote in that Marcos was to be "temporarily interred" instead of being buried in Ilocos Norte. Alunan said that the terms of agreement could not be changed after it was signed but Mrs. Marcos insisted and came up with a new agreement paper with the changed clause. The revised paper was not signed by the government.&lt;ref name=nolongerbinding/&gt;

It was on September 7, 1993 that the body of Ferdinand Marcos was flown into the Philippines. From Hawaii the body was flown to [[Guam]] then to Laoag in Ilocos Norte. The body of Marcos was not buried but was instead preserved in a refrigerated crypt hosted inside the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos Presidential Center]].&lt;ref name=ilocosburial/&gt; In Honolulu, Hawaii, Marcos' body was also stored in a refrigerated crypt.&lt;ref name=nstmayallow/&gt;

===Cancelled 1998 Heroes' Cemetery burial===
Ramos' successor [[Joseph Estrada]] attempted to organize a burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery. Then President-elect Estrada had negotiations with Marcos' wife Imelda who initially also demanded state honors for the burial but later agreed to a burial without state honors. It was determined that Marcos would be buried on July 11, 1998. The planned burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery still received opposition even after state honors were not to be included in the planned burial. Former President Corazon Aquino was among those who opposed the move. Estrada remained firm on his decision until&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Estrada stands firm on Marcos burial|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z9QtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7zEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2257%2C77564|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=The Nation|date=16 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 1998 when Estrada decided against the plan amidst public opposition saying that it would be better if the Marcos family agreed that Ferdinand Marcos be buried in Batac to put an end to "bitter differences" and give rest to "various emotions and sentiments that flared up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=End to Marcos burial dispute|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3vxOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3hQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5346%2C2540787|accessdate=16 August 2016|publisher=New Straits Times|date=13 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Batac burial recommendation===
In April 2011, then President Benigno Aquino III tasked then Vice President [[Jejomar Binay]] to study whether to bury Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery or not. The Office of the Vice President received 3,000 responses from various political parties, sectors, organizations, and members of the public on the issue. Binay recommended the burial of Marcos in his hometown of Batac with full military honors. Aquino did not act on the recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Binay camp: Aquino sat on proposal to bury Marcos in Ilocos Norte|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/143276-binay-camp-aquino-failed-proposal-bury-marcos-ilocos|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=Rappler|date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 Heroes' Cemetery burial===
[[Rodrigo Duterte]] supported the burial of Ferdinand Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery, even before he assumed presidency and expressed this stance at [[Rodrigo Duterte presidential campaign, 2016|his presidential campaign]] in the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 elections]]. Duterte has expressed that a burial of Marcos at the site would commence the "healing" of the Philippines and pointed out Marcos' idealism and vision for the country through his projects which "stood the test of time" and that Marcos' dictatorship "remains to be debated". Duterte previously stated that Marcos could have been the best president if not for the abuses during the Martial law period under Marcos' watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ranada|first1=Pia|title=Duterte in Ilocos Norte: I will allow Marcos' burial in Heroes' Cemetery|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/123061-duterte-marcos-burial-libingan-bayani|accessdate=15 August 2016|publisher=Rappler|date=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[PiliPinas Debates 2016 – Visayas leg|Visayas leg]] of the [[PiliPinas Debates 2016]], Duterte and fellow candidate [[Jejomar Binay]] expressed their support for a Marcos burial at the heroes' cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential candidates' stand on divorce, death penalty, Marcos|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/03/20/Roxas-Binay-Duterte-Poe-Santiago-divorce-death-penalty-Marcos.html|accessdate=15 August 2016|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 burial==

===Announcement and rationale===
On August 7, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte gave the order to bury former President Ferdinand Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery saying that Marcos was qualified to be buried at the cemetery due to being a "former president and a soldier". Duterte said he was open to demonstrations against the burial plan but insisted that the former President was qualified to be buried at the cemetery. He also added that the burial date may be moved to September 11 which was the birthday of the deceased president.&lt;ref name=confirms&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte confirms Marcos burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/07/marcos-libingan-ng-mga-bayani-burial.html|accessdate=15 August 2016|publisher=CNN Philippines|date=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amidst criticism that Marcos did not deserve to be buried at the cemetery, Duterte said that burying Marcos at the site did not equate to Marcos being a "hero in the true sense of the word". He pointed out that former soldiers and presidents are allowed to be buried at the cemetery and that he would be violating the law if he did not push through with the burial and added that the previous administrations should have passed a law to bar Marcos from being buried at the Heroes' Cemetery. Duterte said he doesn't care about the dispute regarding the authenticity of Marcos' war medals and the non-appearance of Marcos' alleged World War II service in United States records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duterte: Marcos burial at Libingan ng Mga Bayani 'doesn't mean he's a hero'|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/577299/news/nation/duterte-marcos-burial-at-libingan-ng-mga-bayani-doesn-t-mean-he-s-a-hero|accessdate=15 August 2016|work=GMA News|agency=JST|date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opinion summary====

=====Concurring=====
The concurring judges said that the Supreme Court cannot decide on the matter since it is a political question which was deemed not justiciable. They argue that President Duterte did not abuse his discretion when he allowed the burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery. It was noted that the petitioners failed to specify a specific law that was allegedly violated by proceeding the burial.&lt;ref name=summarycourt&gt;{{cite news|title=SC media briefer on Marcos burial decision|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/11/08/16/read-sc-media-briefer-on-marcos-burial-decision|accessdate=12 November 2016|agency=ABS-CBN News|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the judges disagreed with the dissenting opinion that Marcos is disqualified to be buried at the said site due to Marcos' ouster following the [[People Power Revolution]], which the dissenters consider as an act of Marcos [[Military discharge|being dishonorably discharged]]. It was noted that while Marcos was also the commander of chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the position is not a military position and the particular clause in the 1987 Constitution which gave the designation to Marcos only enshrines the principle of supremacy of civilian authority over the military. It was concluded that Marcos could not be prosecuted before the court martial therefore he could not be "dishonorably discharged, reverted or separated" under the AFP Regulations G 161-1375. Marcos ouster through the People Power Revolution is judged to be extra-constitutional and direct sovereign act of the people which was concluded to be outside the scope of the court. Marcos was also found not to have convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude and court cases cited by the petitioners abroad were decided to have no bearing due to the cases being civil in nature.&lt;ref name=summarycourt/&gt;

It was added that it's up to the people to decide on the matter. The concurring judges also clarified that the court is exercising judicial restraint on an issue they say is "truly political in nature" and that the resulting stigma of Ferdinand Marcos' Martial Law regime will "not be forgotten by the Filipino people" and Marcos' burial at the cemetery "will not rewrite history".&lt;ref name=summarycourt/&gt;

=====Dissenting=====
[[File:0040jfVigils demonstrations Media coverages Ferdinand Edralin Marcos Burial Cases Judgmentfvf 02.jpg|thumb|left|Protesters opposing the burial of Marcos.]]
The Chief Justice said that the burial disregards both international and domestic laws in regards to giving justice to victims of human rights abuses during Marcos' term. The Philippine government was noted to have an obligation to provide compensations to the victims, both monetary and non-monetary, the latter of which includes symbolic reparation. The burial of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery was deemed by the dissenters as contrary to  symbolic reparation entitled to the victims. By allowing the burial, President Duterte was "encouraging impunity". Marcos was described as "a dictator forced out of office and into exile after causing twenty years of political, economic, and social havoc in the country".&lt;ref name=summarycourt/&gt;

The argue that Marcos' ouster following the People Power Revolution disqualified him from being buried at the Heroes Cemetery even if the claim of him being awarded the Medal of Valor is indisputable since he was deposed by the "sovereign action of the people" which was described as "the strongest form of dishonorable discharge from office".&lt;ref name=summarycourt/&gt;

Chief Justice Maria Lourdes P. A. Sereno, in her dissent, affirmed that the Court must take cognizance of the issues presented in order to preserve the Constitution as well as the judiciary’s own prerogatives under the Constitution. She maintained that the President acted with grave abuse of discretion in ordering the interment at LNMB because it violated domestic law and international law in relation to the obligations to do justice for human rights victims. After a review of the applicable international agreements and protocols, the Chief Justice pointed out that the Philippines is bound to affirmatively protect the rights of the human rights victims under martial law by providing effective reparations, which would include monetary compensation as well as non-monetary remedies (such as symbolic reparation). The Chief Justice pointed out that the interment of the Marcos remains at LNMB would be the antithesis of symbolic reparation. She also pointed out that the interment would run counter to the duty to combat impunity as well as to preserve memory—all of which are international commitments that the Philippines is bound to observe.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Preparation===
Following the Supreme Court decision, preparations for the burial were commenced. Ilocos Norte Governor and daughter of Ferdinand Marcos, [[Imee Marcos]] says that the burial will be done with "simple rites like an ordinary soldier", and insisted that the event will not be a state funeral but a "funeral for a soldier" which she says her father wished for. She also added that the family is willing to airlift the former President's remains from Batac to [[Fort Bonifacio]].&lt;ref name=simplerites&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kabiling|first1=Genalyn|last2=Lazaro|first2=Freddie|title=FM to have a simple soldier’s burial – Governor Imee|url=http://news.mb.com.ph/2016/11/10/fm-to-have-a-simple-soldiers-burial-governor-imee/|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=Manila Bulletin|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Monica Church in [[Sarrat]], the Immaculate Conception Church in Batac, and the Saint Agustine Church in [[Paoay]] were earlier prepared for the wake for former President Marcos before the burial at the Heroes' Cemetery.&lt;ref name=simplerites/&gt;

The Philippine National Police were informed on the night of November 17, 2016 that the burial will take place the day after.&lt;ref name="buriedtoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcos to be buried at Heroes' Cemetery today|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152813-ferdinand-marcos-heroes-burial|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=Rappler|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police confirmed the scheduled burial in the morning of November 18.&lt;ref name=pditoday&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aurelio|first1=Julie|last2=De Jesus|first2=Julliane Love|last3=Sabillo|first3=Kristine Angeli|title=PNP confirms Marcos burial at Libingan ng mga Bayani today|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/845387/pnp-confirms-marcos-burial-at-libingan-ng-mga-bayani-today|accessdate=18 November 2016|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The November 18 burial was scheduled to take place at noon.&lt;ref name="buriedtoday"/&gt;

The remains of Ferdinand Marcos was airlifted from Ilocos Norte at 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. ([[UTC+8]]) and was brought to the Heroes' Cemetery in Fort Bonifacio in Taguig.&lt;ref name=pditoday/&gt; Marcos was then buried in his grave at the Heroes' Cemetery in a burial ceremony closed to the public. Marcos' wife [[Imelda Marcos]] and his children were in attendance, as well as the late president's only living sibling at the time, Fortuna Marcos-Barba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guinto|first1=Joel|title=Late dictator Marcos buried at Libingan ng mga Bayani|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/18/16/late-dictator-marcos-buried-at-libingan-ng-mga-bayani|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=ABS-CBN News|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a hundred were in attendance including personnel from the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and reportedly PNP Chief [[Ronald dela Rosa]]. Military honors were given including a [[21-gun salute]] during the rites.&lt;ref name="confidentially"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delavin|first1=Imee Charlee|title=Marcos confidentially buried  at Heroes’ Cemetery|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&amp;title=marcos-confidentially-buriedbrat-heroes-cemetery&amp;id=136601|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=BusinessWorld|date=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no public announcement of the burial plan, and the public only became aware of the plan shortly before the burial. The Marcos family requested the government to conduct the burial in private, and confidentially. A budget was allocated by the government on the burial and the exceeding budget reportedly will be shouldered by the Marcoses. No exact figures regarding the budget allocated for the burial rites were disclosed.&lt;ref name="confidentially"/&gt;

Ferdinand Marcos was buried in a marble finished tomb with a cauldron that has a flame burning inside.&lt;ref name="confidentially"/&gt;

2013-2017 [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] (CBCP) president Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop [[Socrates Villegas]], a protegé of late Manila Archbishop [[Jamie Sin]] during [[People Power Revolution|EDSA 1986]], said through text to [[Rappler]], on the same day, that he is saddened with the decision and "the burial is an insult to the EDSA spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cardinal Sin's protegé on Marcos burial: 'An insult'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/151738-archbishop-villegas-marcos-burial-insult-edsa|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villegas also stated that he backed the anti-Marcos protests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 13:30 PM PHT Wed, November 30, 2016 |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/11/30/Villegas-backs-anti-Marcos-protesters.html |title=Archbishop gives blessing to anti-Marcos protesters |publisher=CNN Philippines |date=2016-11-30 |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him much hated by many Filipinos for his actions, with people claiming that the church should not interfere with state issues. 

Unlike Villegas, then-[[Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lipa|Lipa Archbishop]] [[Ramon Arguelles]], who was still the sitting Lipa Archbishop, called on Filipinos for prayers and forgiveness for the Marcos family, encouraging pro and anti-Marcos groups to pray for Marcos' soul, while condemning groups calling for exhumation with the words "give the dead peace, respect Marcos' body".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macairan |first=Evelyn |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/20/1645587/respect-marcos-body-bishop-tells-public |title=Respect Marcos’ body, bishop tells public &amp;#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star |publisher=philstar.com |date=2016-11-20 |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/18/16/bishop-calls-for-respect-prayers-for-marcos |title=Bishop calls for respect, prayers for Marcos &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News |publisher=News.abs-cbn.com |date= |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] remained silent on the burial and instead chose to offer prayers for the Marcos family and the Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/100044/silence-cardinal-tagle |title=The silence of Cardinal Tagle &amp;#124; Inquirer Opinion |publisher=Opinion.inquirer.net |date= |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late [[Leopoldo S.

A poll conducted by the [[Social Weather Stations]] (SWS) in March 2011 showed that opinion is split.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/216523/news/nation/sws-pinoys-divided-on-marcos-burial-issue |title=SWS: Pinoys divided on Marcos burial issue  |date=March 30, 2011 |publisher=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same trend appears in a follow up poll by SWS in February 2016. However validated voters instead of just anyone who is 18 years and above as done in the 2011 poll, where queried for the 2016 poll.&lt;ref name="ABS-CBN"/&gt;

An initiative called Bawat Bato ({{literal translation|For each stone}}) was launched, urging those who oppose the plan to dump stones with names of victims of abuses during the Martial Law era of Ferdinand Marcos or a personal message at the proposed site of the burial of Marcos within the Heroes' Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mateo|first1=Janvic|title=Rock against Marcos: Group protests Libingan burial|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/06/29/1597750/rock-against-marcos-group-protests-libingan-burial|accessdate=15 August 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2016, a group of people participated in a protest run around the Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City led by Fr. Robert Reyes.&lt;ref name=nohero105&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/796654/marcos-burial-as-a-hero-a-terrible-insult-to-history "‘Marcos’ burial as a hero a terrible insult to history’"]. Philippine Daily Inquirer.&lt;/ref&gt; Reyes said, “whom, in the minds of martial law victims, is a traitor and dictator, is a terrible insult to history and the country itself.”&lt;ref name=nohero105/&gt;

About 2,000 people protested against the burial plans, saying that Marcos was not a hero; organizers clarified that the protests were not against the Duterte administration itself, but were targeted towards the burial plan.&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite news|title=Marcos 'hero's burial plan prompts Philippines protests|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/08/marcos-hero-burial-plan-sparks-philippines-protests-160814102232553.html|accessdate=15 August 2016|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that Rafael Alunan said that those who oppose the burial plans of Marcos at the Heroes' Cemetery could invoke the 1992 agreement with the Marcos family and the Philippine government under then President Fidel V. Ramos&lt;ref name=ilocosburial/&gt; but he clarified on August 17, 2016 that the agreement was a memorandum of understanding which is not binding compared to a formal agreement or deal.&lt;ref name=nolongerbinding/&gt;

On September 30, Ateneo de Manila University wrote a memorandum, stating that the students should wear black T-shirts on [[UAAP Season 79]] to protest the Marcos burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ateneo, La Salle community asked to wear black in basketball match|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/sports/09/30/16/ateneo-la-salle-community-asked-to-wear-black-in-basketball-match|work=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170814134343/http://www.ateneo.edu/ls/news/solidarity-memo-community-re-oct-2-2016-ateneo-la-salle-game SOLIDARITY MEMO TO THE COMMUNITY RE: THE OCT. 2, 2016 ATENEO-LA SALLE GAME].

On November 6, Former President [[Benigno Aquino III]] described the burial as a “desecration” of the Libingan ng mga Bayani. The next day, Aquino briefly joined the crowd at the Luneta for the “Pray for 8” event, a prayer rally calling at least eight justices of the Supreme Court to vote against the interment of Marcos.&lt;ref name=olse070roberts085&gt;{{cite news|title=Aquino: Burial for Marcos a ‘desecration’ of Libingan|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/841712/aquino-burial-for-marcos-a-desecration-of-libingan|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former DILG secretary [[Mar Roxas]] and senator [[Francis Pangilinan]] later joined the group.&lt;ref name=olse070roberts085/&gt;

Following the 8 November decision of Supreme Court allowing the burial of Marcos, government officials and politicians of the country expressed their disappointment and frustration; among them was Senator Pangilinan calling the decision "shameful and deplorable."&lt;ref name=marcos027&gt;{{cite news|title=VP, senators disappointed and sad as Supreme Court allows burial in hero's cemetery for Marcos|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/11/08/vp-senators-disappointed-supreme-court-decision-marcos-burial.html|work=CNN Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pangilinan also describes the Supreme Court's decision  “This is a horrible day for democracy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pangilinan on hero’s burial for Marcos: Horrible day for democracy|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/842130/pangilinan-on-heros-burial-for-marcos-horrible-day-for-democracy|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incumbent [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Leni Robredo]] was saddened with the decision; Senator [[Bam Aquino]] saying that "my heart goes out to the thousands of victims during the darkest years in Philippine history."&lt;ref name=marcos027/&gt;

====November 18 burial====
[[File:EDSA Shrine, Robinsons Corporate Bldg. - panoramio.jpg|220px|thumb|EDSA Shrine where the main protests are held.]]
On 18 November, the day of Marcos burial, various groups gathered in some places. Among those who gathered to opposed the burial was a group of youth. The League of Filipino Students described the transfer of Marcos remains for the eventually successful burial the former president as being done like "a thief in the night." They also criticized the government's involvement in the burial of the former president which they describe as a "fascist dictator". The [[Kabataan]] condemn the burial labeling it as a "grave travesty" and as "''galawang Hokage''" (lit. ''[[Hokage]]'' move;  ''Hokage'' is a high-ranked [[ninja]] in the ''[[Naruto (anime)|Naruto]]'' anime franchise).&lt;ref name=fmarcos226&gt;{{cite news|title=Galawang Hokage: Youth protest sudden Marcos burial at LNMB|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/589346/news/nation/galawang-hokage-youth-protest-sudden-marcos-burial-at-lnmb|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice President Robredo expressed disappointment stating that “like a thief in the night, the Marcos family deliberately hid the information of burying former President Marcos today from the Filipino people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘From hidden wealth to hidden burial: Marcoses disrespecting law’—Leni|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/845427/from-hidden-wealth-to-hidden-burial-marcoses-disrespecting-law-leni|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from various universities and other groups joined the protest held across the country including [[Metro Manila]], [[Cebu City]], [[Davao City]], etc.&lt;ref name=fmarcos195&gt;{{cite news|title=Protests swell nationwide vs. Marcos burial|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/589380/news/nation/protests-swell-nationwide-vs-marcos-burial|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Franklin Drilon]] gave a statement about the burial, “like what Marcos did for 21 years, he caught us off-guard like a thief in the night.

On November 25, 2016, the day called by the protestors "National Day of Unity and Rage" and "Black Friday", various groups in the country held [[mass demonstration]]s in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schedule: November 25 rallies vs Marcos|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/153258-november-25-luneta-grand-rally|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left-leaning groups called on President Duterte to end his alliance with Marcoses.&lt;ref name="bbm016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Luneta protesters to Duterte: End alliance with Marcos family|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/153622-luneta-november-25-duterte-end-alliance-marcos|work=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Marcos protestors and Marcos loyalists started a debate on the issue after the two sides made an encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-, pro-Marcos groups face off for 'debate' at Luneta|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590238/news/nation/anti-pro-marcos-groups-face-off-for-debate-at-luneta|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Serena Diokno, chairperson of the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] (NHCP) submitted her resignation on November 29, 2016 in protest of the Marcos burial. She said that the burial "erases the memory of the lives lost and destroyed" during the Ferdinand Marcos administration and that it " mocks the collective action the Filipinos" took to remove Marcos from his post as President. She added that Duterte could have taken a "higher ground" by disallowing the burial despite the Supreme Court decision not to stop the then burial plan. She also praised the youth who expressed their opposition to the burial which she described as an act "in defense of History" and said she would personally join mass demonstrations scheduled on November 30, 2016. Her resignation will be effective on December 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Javier|first1=Kristian|title=Diokno resigns as NHCP chair over Marcos burial|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/11/29/1648635/diokno-resigns-nhcp-chair-over-marcos-burial|accessdate=29 November 2016|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last week of November, several [[Facebook]] users who expressed their opinions against the burial of Marcos were locked out of their accounts.&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite news|title=Cyber Tokhang?

Female activists, mostly students, who joined the Marcos burial protest became targets of cyberbullying for their actions. Photos of the female protesters were filled with misogynist and chauvinist comments alongside death and rape threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stacy de Jesus @stacydejesus |url=http://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/153042-facebook-comments-anti-marcos-girl-rape-threats |title='Let's gang bang her': Anti-Marcos protester gets rape threats |publisher=Rappler.com |date=2016-11-21 |accessdate=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Scholastica College students have been victimized in a similar scenario.

Thousands of protesters gathered again on 30 November, [[Andrés Bonifacio|Bonifacio Day]], at the [[People Power Monument]] in [[Quezon City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands return to EDSA to protest Marcos hero’s burial|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/590762/news/nation/thousands-return-to-edsa-to-protest-marcos-hero-s-burial|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Marcos groups hold protests on Bonifacio Day|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/11/30/Anti-Marcos-protests-Bonifacio-Day.html|work=CNN Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16765">The '''causes of the [[Dutch Revolt]]''' and the ensuing [[Eighty Years War]], considered to have started in June 1568, were a number of incidents and frictions had accumulated between the Dutch provinces and their [[Habsburgs|Habsburg]] overlord.

==Causes of the war==
The direct cause of this war was similar to the slogan, ''[[No taxation without representation]]''. Under the Habsburgs, the [[Low Countries]] were formally named unceremoniously "''De landen van herwaarts over''" and in French "''Les pays de par deça''". Translated, the phrases mean "those lands around here" for the Dutch, and "those lands around there" for the French. While they were being taxed beyond what they were willing to pay, these far-away provinces were being continually [[admonish]]ed for seeing to their own business without permission from the throne, which at that time was indeed far away, in Spain. Each request for special permission would take at least four weeks for a response from Spain.

This unrest over [[taxation]] without representation was amplified by a strong presence of Spanish troops brought in to oversee the order in these provinces. Meanwhile, a parallel religious revolt was seen as a direct threat to the (Roman Catholic) Spanish throne, by the spread of the [[Anabaptism]] of the Dutch reformer [[Menno Simons]] and the teachings of foreign Protestant leaders like [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]], culminating with the [[Beeldenstorm]], a country-wide outburst of [[iconoclasm]] in 1566.

The date for the formal start of hostilities is often cited as the execution of the statesmen [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]] and [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn]], on the main square in [[Brussels]] on June 5, 1568. This double execution (for their protest against the [[Spanish Inquisition]]) was just the beginning of a wave of destruction, seen as a counter-attack to the Beeldenstorm, by [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba]] across all of the provinces. This episode ended poetically, four years later, in the total destruction of Lamoral's home in the (far) north, [[Egmond Castle]], along with the neighbouring [[Egmond Abbey]].

==Events leading to rebellion==
===Abdication of Charles V as Philip II becomes king===
When [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] began the gradual abdication of his several crowns in October 1555, his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] took over as overlord of the conglomerate of duchies, counties and other feudal [[fief]]s known as the Habsburg Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Technically they formed the [[Burgundian Circle]] that, under the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], was to be transferred as a unit in hereditary succession in the [[House of Habsburg]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this was a personal union of seventeen provinces with little in common beyond their overlord and a constitutional framework [[Timeline of Burgundian and Habsburg acquisitions in the Low Countries|painfully assembled]] during the preceding reigns of [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian]] and Habsburg rulers. This framework divided power between city governments and local nobility, provincial States and royal [[stadtholder]]s, and a central government of three collateral councils,&lt;ref&gt;the Council of State, Privy Council and Council of Finances&lt;/ref&gt; assisting (usually) a Regent, and the [[States-General of the Netherlands]]. The balance of power was heavily weighted toward the local and regional governments. Like his predecessors, Philip II had to ceremonially affirm those constitutional documents (like the [[Joyous Entry of 1356|Joyous Entry of Brabant]]) before his accession to the ducal throne. Beyond these constitutional guarantees, the balance of power between local and central government was guaranteed by the dependence of the central government on extraordinary [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] (''Beden'') granted by the States-General when ordinary tax revenues fell short of the financing requirements of the central government (which occurred frequently, due to the many wars Charles waged).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Koenigsberger, pp. 184-192&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing Spanish influence in the Netherlands===
Though he was in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;
   Unless otherwise indicated, "Netherlands" and "Netherlandish"
   refer here to the entire area of the Habsburg Netherlands and
   its inhabitants, whereas "Dutch Republic" and "Dutch" will
   refer to the country, currently known as the [[Netherlands]],
   and its inhabitants.
&lt;/ref&gt; in January, 1556, Philip II did not assume the reins of government in person, as he had to divide his attentions between England (where he was king-consort of [[Mary I of England]]), the Netherlands, and Spain. He therefore appointed a governor-general [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]], and subsequently from 1559 on, a Regent (his half-sister [[Margaret of Parma]]) to lead the central government on a day-to-day basis. As in the days of Charles V, these [[regent]]s governed in close cooperation with Netherlandish [[grandee]]s, such as [[William the Silent|William, Prince of Orange]], [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn]], and [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]. But (other than Charles) he also introduced a number of Spanish councillors in the Council of State, foremost [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle]], a French-born cardinal. These people gained a preponderant influence in the Council, much to the [[wikt:chagrin|chagrin]] of the Netherlandish old guard.

When Philip left for Spain in 1559 (as it turned out, permanently) the central government therefore already experienced political strains, and those were exacerbated by the question of religious policy. Like his father, Philip was a fervent enemy of the Protestant teachings of [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and the [[Anabaptist]]s. Charles had legally defined ''[[heresy]]'' as "treason against God" (or French ''lèse-majesté divine'') an "exceptional crime" that was outside the purview of normal legal procedures as laid down in the Netherlandish legal privileges.  He therefore outlawed heresy in special ''[[placard]]s'' that made it a capital offense, to be prosecuted by a Netherlandish version of the [[Inquisition]]. Between 1523 and 1566, more than 1,300 people were executed as [[Heresy|heretic]]s, far more relative to the overall population than, for instance, in France.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''placards'', and the policy of repression of heresy in general, were highly unpopular, not just with prospective adherents of the Protestant faiths, but also with the Catholic population and the local governments, who considered it an intrusion on their prerogatives. Towards the end of Charles' reign, enforcement had therefore become quite lax. Philip, however, insisted on rigorous enforcement and this caused more and more popular unrest. In the province of Holland, for instance, there were riots in the late 1550s during which the mob freed some condemned persons before their execution.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

To support and strengthen the attempts at [[Counter-Reformation]], issuing from the [[Council of Trent]], Philip launched a wholesale organizational reform of the Catholic Church in the Netherlands in 1559 (with Papal approval). This amounted to the introduction of fourteen new [[diocese]]s instead of the old three. This new [[hierarchy]] was to be headed by Granvelle as [[archbishop]] of the new archdiocese of [[Mechelen]]. The reform was especially unpopular with the old church hierarchy as the new dioceses were to be financed by transferring a number of rich abbeys that were traditionally in the gift of the high aristocracy. The new bishops were to take the lead in the enforcement of the anti-heresy ''placards'' and to intensify the Inquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch nobility in opposition===
Granvelle's perceived aggrandizement helped focus the opposition against him. The grandees under the leadership of Orange engineered his recall in 1564. Emboldened by this success Orange intensified his attempts to obtain religious toleration. He persuaded Margaret and the Council to ask for a moderation of the ''placards'' against heresy. Philip delayed his response, however, and in the meantime the opposition against his religious policies gained more widespread support. When Philip finally rejected the request for moderation in his [[Letters from the Segovia Woods]] of October, 1565, this only fanned the flames. A group of members of the lesser nobility, among whom [[Louis of Nassau]], a younger brother of Orange, and the brothers John and [[Philips of Marnix, lord of Saint-Aldegonde|Philip of St. Aldegonde]], prepared a petition for the abolition of the Inquisition for Philip. This [[Compromise of Nobles]] was supported by about 400 nobles, both Catholics and Protestants. It was presented to Margaret on April 5, 1566 at an audience for about 300 members of the Compromise which Margaret found rather intimidating. (According to legend the petitioners were dismissed as [[Geuzen|''gueux'']] (beggars) by one of Margaret's courtiers; the rebels would later use that name as a rallying cry). Margaret was sufficiently impressed to order the suspension of the ''placards'' pending Philip's final decision on April 9.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unrest and Spanish military reaction===
The suspension of the ''placards'' emboldened the Protestants. Many returned from exile. Calvinists started to organize open-air sermons outside the city walls of many cities. Though these meetings were peaceful, their size alone caused anxiety for the authorities, especially as some of the people attending bore arms. Then, the situation deteriorated rapidly. On August 1, 1566, 2000 armed Calvinists tried to  force entry to the walled town of [[Veurne]]. Shortly thereafter Calvinist weavers from the industrial area around [[Ypres]] attacked churches and destroyed religious statuary. This [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic fury]] ({{lang-nl|[[Beeldenstorm]]}}) spread like wildfire across the Netherlands. The authorities at first did not react. The central government was especially disturbed by the fact that in many cases the civic militias refused to intervene. This seemed to portend insurrection. Margaret, and also authorities at lower levels, made further concessions to the Calvinists, like designating certain churches for Calvinist worship. However, the provincial governors, foremost [[Philip of Noircarmes]] of Hainaut, who suppressed the revolt of the Calvinists led by [[Guido de Bres]] in [[Valenciennes]], and Orange as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland, took decisive action to quell the disturbances. In March 1567 at the [[Battle of Oosterweel]] a motley army of Calvinists under John of St. Aldegonde was defeated by a royalist army and all rebels summarily executed, while Orange prevented the citizens of nearby Antwerp to come to the rebels' aid. In April, 1567 the situation in the country was such, that Margaret could report to Philip that order had been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, pp. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

However, news travelled slowly and the court in Madrid had received a rather exaggerated impression of the severity of the situation. In September, 1566 Philip had decided to travel himself to the Netherlands to restore order, but debate among the two factions at the Spanish court, led by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] and the [[Ruy Gomez de Silva, Prince of Eboli|Prince of Eboli]], about the advisability of this journey grew fierce. Eventually it was decided to send an army from Italy under the command of Alba. Margaret's emissary arrived at the court on April 17, 1567, the same day when Alba departed on his mission, too late to prevent the fateful intervention&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;
{{History of the Low Countries}}
Alba's army of about 10,000 Spanish and Italian mercenaries reached the Netherlands by way of the [[Spanish Road]] in August, 1567. Alba was supposed to act as military governor-general, while Margaret would remain in office as Regent. Alba acted in such a presumptuous way, however, that Margaret soon resigned in protest. Alba thereafter was in sole command. He commenced by establishing a [[Council of Troubles]] on September 5, 1567. This council soon conducted a severe campaign of repression of suspected heretics and people deemed guilty of the already extinguished insurrection. Many high-ranking officials were arrested on various pretexts, among whom the Counts of Egmont and Horne. The victims of the repression were found in all social strata. A total of about 9,000 people were eventually convicted by the council, though only 1,000 were actually executed, as many managed to go into exile. One of the latter was Orange, who forfeited his extensive possessions in the Netherlands, like most of the people being [[Proscription|proscribed]]. The victims were not necessarily only Protestants. For instance, the Counts of Egmont and Horne, executed for treason on June 5, 1568, protested their Catholic orthodoxy on the scaffold.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, pp. 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition in exile===
The many exiles found asylum in the few areas in neighboring countries that welcomed Calvinists, like the [[Huguenot]] areas in France, England, and [[Emden]] or [[Wesel]] in Germany. Many were ready to join an armed fight, but the fate of the rebels at Oosterweel had shown that irregular forces did not stand a chance against well-disciplined troops. A better organized effort was needed to lead such an effort, and Orange was uniquely well-placed. As a sovereign prince of the Holy Roman Empire&lt;ref&gt;The [[principality of Orange]] in present-day France at the time was an independent [[fief]] of the Empire.&lt;/ref&gt; Orange was in a sense the equal of Philip, in his capacity of Count of Holland, for instance. Orange was therefore entirely within his rights to make war on Philip (or, as he for the moment preferred, on Philip's "bad advisor" Alba). This was important in a diplomatic context as it legitimized Orange's efforts to hire mercenaries in the principalities of his German "colleagues," and enabled him to issue [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] to the many Calvinist seamen who had embarked on a career of piracy from economic desperation. Such letters elevated the latter, the so-called [[Geuzen|Sea Beggars]], to the status of [[privateer]]s, which enabled the authorities in neutral countries, like the England of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], to accommodate them without legal embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;As a matter of fact, the English probably welcomed the opportunity to obtain cargo and ships at fire-sale prices, when the privateers came to dispose of their prizes; the arrangement was mutually beneficial.&lt;/ref&gt; Orange's temporary abode in [[Dillenburg]] therefore became the command center for plans to invade the Netherlands from several directions at once.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis of Nassau crossed into [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] from [[East Frisia|East Friesland]] and defeated a small royalist force at [[Heiligerlee]] on May 23, 1568. The [[Battle of Heiligerlee (1568)|Battle of Heiligerlee]] is usually considered the start of the [[Dutch revolt]] as it was at this moment that the series of protests and unrest had culminated in armed conflict.

The '''Chatsbury/Bungonia bushfires''' of 1965 was a series of [[bushfire]]s that burned from March 5 to March 14, 1965.  The fires destroyed the [[Southern Highlands, New South Wales]] villages of [[Tallong, New South Wales|Tallong]], [[Wingello, New South Wales|Wingello]], and most of the surrounding [[orchard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History: 1950-1969: The growth of local brigades|url=http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/about-us/history|website=NSW Rural Fire Service|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fire is thought to be ignited by a spark from a Chatsbury Station [[angle grinder]].  It quickly spread and covered 620,000 acres and destroyed the areas' livestock.  It is thought to be the greatest disaster in the area.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Chris|title=Remembering the 1965 Chatsbury-Bungonia Fire|url=http://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/2919539/remembering-the-1965-chatsbury-bungonia-fire-photos-audio/|website=Goulburn Post|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people were killed. 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello.  The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near [[Nowra]] on the South Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History: 1950-1969: The growth of local brigades|url=http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/about-us/history|website=NSW Rural Fire Service|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: ''Eestimaa Kommunistlik Partei'', in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Estonii'') was a [[political party]] in [[Estonia]]. The party, initially known as '''Communist Party of Estonia (on CPSU platform)''' (EKP (NLKP platvormil)), and was formed in 1990 through a split in the original [[Communist Party of Estonia|EKP]]. The split occurred at the 20th congress of EKP in March 1990, as a reaction against the decision of the congress to separate EKP from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Immediately after the independence decision of EKP, the pro-Soviet delegates left the congress venue. The convened their own rival 20th congress on March 26, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Miljan, Toivo. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XKWRct15XfkC Historical dictionary of Estonia]''. [[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]: Scarecrow Press, 2004. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; EKP(NLKP platvormil) elected its own [[Central Committee]], headed by its First Secretary Alexander Gusev, and would function as a separate party from EKP.&lt;ref&gt;Ishiyama, John T./Breuning, Marijke. ''Ethnopolitics in the New Europe''. [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arti"&gt;Ishiyama, John T.. ''Representational Mechanisms and Ethnopolitics: Evidence from Transitional Democracies in Eastern Europe''; published in East European Quarterly, Vol. 33, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was often perceived, along with [[Intermovement]], as representing the resistance of the [[Russians|Russian]] population in Estonia against independence. However unlike the split in the [[Communist Party of Latvia]], the split in EKP did not follow ethnic lines. A study on the electoral patterns of the [[Estonian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|1990 Estonian Supreme Soviet election]] showed that the EKP(NLKP platvormil) candidates had a support of just 13.3% of the non-Estonian voters.&lt;ref name="arti"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolstø, Pål. ''National integration and violent conflict in post-Soviet societies : the cases of Estonia and Moldova''. [[Lanham, Maryland|Lanham]]: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002. p. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, when the split in EKP occurred in 1990 party units in Russian-dominated town like [[Narva]], [[Sillamäe]] and [[Kohtla-Järve]] decided to retain their membership in EKP rather than joining EKP(NLKP platvormil).&lt;ref name="ishi"&gt;Ishiyama, John T./Breuning, Marijke. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VTdaIcZOkg0C Ethnopolitics in the New Europe]''. [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998. p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the analogous split in the Communist Party of Latvia, EKP(NLKP platvormil) failed to gain control over any major portion of the resources and personnel of the EKP after the split.&lt;ref name="ishi"/&gt;

On 20 June 1990 the name of the party was changed to '''Communist Party of Estonia (CPSU)''' (EKP (NLKP)).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knowbysight.info/1_ESTON/08256.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

EKP (NLKP) held its 21st Party Congress in the fall of 1990 (counting the twenty party congresses of EKP as theirs). The congress elected an Estonian, [[Lembit Annus]], as the new First Secretary. With the new leadership followed a less confrontational approach that its Latvian counterpart.&lt;ref name="arti"/&gt; In April 1991 Annus expressed willingness to enter a coalition government in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;Ishiyama, John T./Breuning, Marijke. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VTdaIcZOkg0C Ethnopolitics in the New Europe]''. [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998. p. 87, 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to the March 3, 1991 referendum on Estonian independence, the party organized a referendum of its own. The vote took place in the cities Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe and Narva. The question of the referendum was "Do you want the sovereign Estonia to remain within the composition of the USSR?". Unlike the main referendum, all residents (including Soviet troops) could take part. Only the results from Sillamäe were made public, with a turnout of 83%. 89% of the voters in Sillamäe had voted yes in the referendum.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Metcalf, Lee Kendall. ''Outbidding to Radical Nationalists: Minority Policy in Estonia, 1988–1993'', published in ''Nations and Nationalism'', Volume 2 Issue 2, p. 213-234&lt;/ref&gt;

The party supported the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 coup]]. Following the defeat of the coup, the party was declared illegal by the Estonian government on August 22, 1991.&lt;ref name="met"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~dab/coup/RLA/91-161.RLA.txt&lt;/ref&gt; At the time [[Central Committee]] secretary of the party was Pavel Panfilov.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.oswego.edu/~dab/coup/RLA/91-157.RLA.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, a very small group named '''Communist Party of Estonia''' of former members carried on their cause, initially their grouping was affiliated with the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (SKP-KPSS),&lt;ref&gt;http://kprf.ru/kpss/&lt;/ref&gt; but when SKP-KPSS split in 2001 they joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Shenin)|Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] of [[Oleg Shenin]]. The party carried out a congress in 1999, and elected a Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc9906/sovpeop.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coney-catching''''' is [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] [[slang]] for theft through trickery. It comes from the word "coney" (sometimes spelled ''conny''), meaning a [[rabbit]] raised for the table and thus tame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Shakespeare: The World as Stage]]|last=Bryson|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Bryson|year=2007|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-074022-1|oclc=136782567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coney-catcher was a thief or [[confidence trick|con man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/history/crime%20and%20the%20law/coney-catching.html;jsessionid=C8C564E298896F480646F6D8C1AEBC4B|title=Coney-catching|date=4 January 2011|accessdate=22 March 2013|publisher=[[University of Victoria]]|work=Internet Shakespeare Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a practice in medieval and Renaissance England in which devious people on the street would try to con or cheat vulnerable or gullible pedestrians. The term appears in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], and in the John Florio translation of Montaigne's essay, "[[Of the Cannibals]]."

The term was first used in print by [[Robert Greene (16th century)| Robert Greene]] in a series of 1592 pamphlets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]|chapter=Robert Greene's Social Pamphlets|year=1907–1921|publisher=[[Bartleby.com]] (online edition)&amp;nbsp;/ [[Cambridge University Press]] (original)|editor1-last=Ward|editor1-first=Adolphus William, Sir|editor2-last=Waller|editor2-first=Alfred Rayney|editor3-last=Trent|editor3-first=William Peterfield|editor4-last=Erskine|editor4-first=John|editor5-last=Sherman|editor5-first=Stuart Pratt|editor6-last=Van Doren|editor6-first=Carl|isbn=1-58734-073-9|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/214/1604.html|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.exclassics.com/cony/conyintro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the titles of which included "The Defence of Conny-catching," in which he argued there were worse crimes to be found among "reputable" people, and "A Disputation betweene a Hee Conny-catcher and a Shee Conny-catcher."  Kirby Farrell wrote a book called ''Cony-catching'' in 1971.
Virginia Woolf mentions "cony catchers" in her book "Orlando".

'''Cronyism''' is the practice of partiality in awarding jobs and other advantages to friends, family relatives or trusted colleagues, especially in [[politics]] and between politicians and supportive organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/cronyism|title=cronyism American English definition and synonyms - Macmillan Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, this includes appointing "cronies" to positions of authority, regardless of their qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cronyism?s=t|title=the definition of cronyism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronyism exists when the appointer and the beneficiary such as an appointee are in social or business contact. Often, the appointer needs support in his or her own proposal, job or position of authority, and for this reason the appointer appoints individuals who will not try to weaken his or her proposals, vote against issues, or express views contrary to those of the appointer. Politically, "cronyism" is derogatorily used to imply buying and selling favors, such as: votes in legislative bodies, as doing favors to organizations, giving desirable ambassadorships to exotic places, etc.&lt;ref name="Daniel Garza"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government Cronyism is Back|url=https://au.linkedin.com/pub/steven-jenkins/a2/ba6/7a3 April 2012|author=Daniel Garza|date=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "crony" first appeared in 17th-century [[London]], according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and is believed to be derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''chronios'' (χρόνιος), meaning "long-term".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/crony?view=uk|title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, &amp; Grammar|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less likely but oft-quoted source is the supposed [[Irish language|Irish]] term ''Comh-Roghna'', which translates as "close pals", or mutual friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition|url=http://crony.askdefine.com/|publisher=askdefine.com|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
{{refimprove|date=February 2016}}
Government officials are particularly susceptible to accusations of cronyism, as they spend [[tax]]payers money. Many democratic governments are encouraged to practice administrative [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] in [[accounting]] and contracting, however, there often is no clear delineation of when an appointment to government office is "cronyism".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ced.org/cronycapitalism CED.com, official website of: The Committee for Economic Development (CED), "Crony Capitalism: Unhealthy Relations Between Business and Government"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not unusual for a politician to surround him- or herself with highly qualified subordinates, and to develop social, business, or political friendships leading to the appointment to office of friends, likewise in granting government contracts. In fact, the counsel of such friends is why the officeholder successfully obtained his or her powerful position; therefore, cronyism usually is easier to perceive than to demonstrate and prove. Politicians with representatives of business, other special interests, as unions and professional organizations get "crony-business" done in political agreements, especially by "reasonable" and lucrative honorariums to the politician for making speeches, or by legal donations to ones election campaign or to ones political party, etc.{{cn|date=July 2018}}{{original research?|date=July 2018}}

In the private sector, cronyism exists in organizations, often termed "[[Old boy network|the old boys club]]" or "the golden circle", again the boundary between cronyism and "networking" is difficult to delineate.&lt;ref name="Staff 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Old Boys’ Clubs Make The Market More Efficient?|url=http://thefreemarketeers.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/do-old-boys-clubs-make-the-market-more-efficient/|publisher=The Free Marketeers|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Staff|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, cronyism describes relationships existing among mutual acquaintances in private organizations where business, business information, and social interaction are exchanged among influential personnel. This is termed [[crony capitalism]], and is an ethical breach of the principles of the market economy; in advanced economies, crony capitalism is a breach of market regulations.

Given crony capitalism's nature, these dishonest business practices are frequently (yet not exclusively) found in societies with ineffective legal systems. Consequently, there is an impetus upon the legislative branch of a government to ensure enforcement of the legal code capable of addressing and redressing private party manipulation of the economy by the involved businessmen and their government cronies.

The economic and social costs of cronyism are paid by society. Those costs are in the form of reduced business opportunity for the majority of the population, reduced competition in the market place, inflated consumer goods prices, decreased economic performance, inefficient business investment cycles, reduced motivation in affected organizations, and the diminution of economically productive activity.&lt;ref name="Staff 2010"/&gt;  A practical cost of cronyism manifests in the poor workmanship of public and private community projects. Cronyism is self-perpetuating; cronyism then begets a culture of cronyism. This can only be apprehended by a comprehensive, effective, and enforced legal code, with empowered government agencies which can effect prosecutions in the courts.

All appointments that are suspected of being cronyism are controversial. The appointed party may choose to either suppress disquiet or ignore it, depending upon the society's level of freedom of expression and individual personal liberty.

Some instances of cronyism are readily transparent.  As to others, it is only in hindsight that the qualifications of the alleged "crony" must be evaluated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4541">'''Doomination''' was a touring metal music festival with performances by many [[doom metal]] and [[death metal]] groups. It was organized by the members of the now defunct American band [[Morgion (band)|Morgion]], the Irish doom metal band [[Mourning Beloveth]] and the Yorkshire progressive doom metal band [[The Prophecy (band)|The Prophecy]]. The tour was intended to bring together the best of the underground doom metal and doom/death metal acts to create a traveling doom metal showcase, helping to bring new life into the scene and spurring on many bands to be more adventurous when considering when, where and how to tour. The original tour and the tours which followed were well received by the metal press with articles and reviews being published in ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'', ''Loud'', ''Feedback'' and ''Abode for Forlorn Souls'', the latter publishing full interviews with each of the three Doomination bands as well as excerpts from Christian Moore-Wainwright's (ex [[The Prophecy (band)|The Prophecy]] guitarist) tour diary.

==History==
The first Doomination tour started on 7 February 2003 at Eamon Dorans in [[Dublin]] with another ten dates in the UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and The Netherlands. The core acts of the tour were Morgion, Mourning Beloveth and The Prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=7650 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - MORGION, MOURNING BELOVETH, THE PROPHECY To Team Up For '2003 Doomination Tour'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319153025/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=7650 |date=2007-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the acts participating in the tour were Ataraxie, Autumnal, Desire, Despond, Karseron, Panthiest and Process of Guilt.

The Doomination of Europe was followed in August 2003 by The Doomination of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=13553 Blabbermouth.Net - Doomination Of America: Tour Dates Announced&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000011/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=13553 |date=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by members of Morgion, this tour had Mourning Beloveth, The Prophecy and Orodruin. Morgion had to pull out of the tour due to a car accident involving the guitarist Gary Griffiths. The tour had a host of supporting acts including Vex, The Gates Of Slumber, Asunder and Negative Reaction.

The last leg of the Doomination Tour was scheduled over three weeks across September and October 2004. This tour had The Prophecy and the Australian doom band [[The Eternal (band)|The Eternal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=26105 BLABBERMOUTH.NET - THE PROPHECY, THE ETERNAL: Doomination Of Europe II Tour Dates Revealed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222723/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=26105 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour widened its coverage, visiting Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK. The tour followed the ideals of the previous Doomination tours by inviting the best of the underground to play in support of the tour.

An attempt to organise The Doomination of Europe III was made in 2007 with Keen of The Crow (with former Morgion Members). However, because of costs, the tour did not go ahead.

{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}
The '''European Union Withdrawal Agreement (Public Vote) Bill 2017–19''' is a [[private member's bill]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to make provision for the holding of a “public vote” ([[referendum]]) in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Gibraltar]] following the conclusion of negotiations by [[HM Government|Her Majesty's Government]] and the [[European Union]] on whether to support the proposed exit deal for the [[Brexit|United Kingdom's Withdrawal from the European Union]] or to remain a [[Member state of the European Union|member state of the EU]]. The bill is sponsored by English [[Labour and Co-operative|Labour Co-operative]] MP [[Gareth Thomas (English politician)|Gareth Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/europeanunionwithdrawalagreementpublicvote.html|title=European Union Withdrawal Agreement (Public Vote) Bill (HC Bill 208) — UK Parliament|website=services.parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public vote==
The Bill proposes that a “public vote” (referendum) is held in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Gibraltar]] before 1 February 2019 on whether to support the proposed [[Withdrawal Agreement]] which would take the UK out of the [[European Union]] or whether to reject the proposed agreement and remain a [[Member state of the European Union|member state of the EU]]. 

The Bill also requires the Secretary of State to lay before each [[Houses of Parliament (United Kingdom)|House of Parliament]] a copy of the proposed Withdrawal Agreement no later than 31 October 2018.

=== Proposed public vote question===

The Bill stipulates the proposed question to appear on ballot papers:
{{Quotation|"Do you support the Government’s proposed United Kingdom and Gibraltar Agreement for withdrawal from the European Union or Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?"|sign=|source=}}
With the responses to the question to be:
{{Quotation|Support the proposed Withdrawal Agreement
Remain a member of the European Union|sign=|source=}}
The Bill also orders the question to be printed in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

===Definition of public vote===
The Bill proposes to legally define the referendum as a “public vote” as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

(1) Subject to the following paragraphs—

:(a) the provisions of Part 7 of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (general provision about referendums) apply to the public vote under this Act, and

:(b) those provisions shall apply as if, for the words “referendum” and “referendums” in each case where they appear, the words "public vote" and "public votes" respectively.

(2) It shall the duty of all public authorities, in publications and communications about the public vote provided for under this Act, to use the term "public vote" and not to use the term "referendum".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Outcome==
The Bill stipulates that the proposed Withdrawal Agreement cannot be ratified unless the following two conditions are met, as follows, if more votes are cast in favour of “Support the proposed Withdrawal Agreement”:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Result of the Public Vote'''

(1) The Government shall not conclude any agreement on terms of withdrawal from the European Union, or on the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, until the conditions in subsection (2) are met.

(2) The conditions are that—

:(a) more votes are cast in the public vote held under section 2 in favour of the answer "Support the proposed Withdrawal Agreement" than the answer "Remain a member of the European Union", and

:(b) the terms of withdrawal from the European Union have been approved by resolution in both Houses of Parliament.

(3) The resolutions, under subsection (2)(b), in both Houses of Parliament must be passed within one week after the result of the public vote, held under section 2, is declared.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Majority for withdrawal===
If more votes are cast in favour of "Support the proposed Withdrawal Agreement" then both Houses of Parliament is required to vote on whether to ratify the proposed Withdrawal Agreement within one week of the public vote result being declared and requires the Secretary of State to repeal the provisions to remain in the EU as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

(7) If—

:(a) more votes are cast in the public vote in favour of the answer “Support the proposed Withdrawal Agreement” than “Remain a member of the European Union”, and

:(b) the resolutions, under subsection (2)(b), in both Houses of Parliament approve the terms of withdrawal from the European Union, the Secretary of State must by regulations repeal section 5 (“provisions to remain in the European Union”).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Majority for remain===
If more votes are cast in favour of “Remain a member of the European Union” then the Bill proposes to automatically repeal the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]] upon the result of the public vote and requires the Prime Minister to notify the EU of the UK's retraction of its [[Article 50]] notice as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Result of the public vote: provisions to remain in the European Union'''

(1) The European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 is repealed.

(2) The Prime Minister must notify the European Commission of the retraction of the notification under Article 50(2) of the [[Treaty on European Union]] of the United Kingdom’s intention to leave the European Union.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Power to precipitate an early General Election==
The Bill legislates that if both conditions that are required to rectify the proposed Withdrawal Agreement cannot be legally met (i.e., the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by "public vote," but is rejected by Parliament) then the Bill states that the provisions of section 2 of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] automatically comes into effect within one week of the result, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] the provisions of section 2 of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] ("early parliamentary general election") shall apply in these circumstances as if the [[House of Commons]] had passed a motion under section 2(2) of that Act.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Frank William Abagnale Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|ə|ɡ|n|eɪ|l}}; born April 27, 1948) is an American security consultant known for his history as a former [[confidence trick|con man]], [[cheque fraud|check forger]], and [[impostor]] between the ages of 15 and 21. He became one of the most famous impostors ever,&lt;ref&gt;Salinger, Lawrence M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=P41ij0GoFL4C&amp;q=Abagnale#v=snippet&amp;q=Abagnale&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of white-collar and corporate crime]: A – I, Volume 1'', page 418, {{ISBN|0-7619-3004-3}}, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities, including an airline pilot, a physician, a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|U.S. Bureau of Prisons]] agent, and a [[lawyer]]. He escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a [[List of U.S. federal prisons|U.S. federal penitentiary]]) before he was 21 years old.&lt;ref name="usnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-collar/2008/05/19/how-frank-abagnale-would-swindle-you|title=How Frank Abagnale Would Swindle You|work=U.S. News | first=Luke |last=Mullins|date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served fewer than five years in prison before starting to work for the federal government. He is  currently a consultant and lecturer for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] academy and field offices. He also runs Abagnale &amp; Associates, a financial fraud consultancy company.

Abagnale's life story inspired the [[Academy Award]]-nominated feature film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002), starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Abagnale and [[Tom Hanks]] as the FBI agent pursuing him, as well as a [[Catch Me If You Can (musical)|Broadway musical]] of that name and a TV series ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', which are based on his [[Catch Me If You Can (book)|autobiography]] of the same name.

== First con ==
His first victim was his father, who gave Abagnale a gasoline credit card and a truck to assist him in commuting to his part-time job. In order to get date money, Abagnale devised a scheme in which he used the gasoline card to "buy" tires, batteries, and other car-related items at gas stations and then asked the attendants to give him cash in return for the products. Ultimately, his father was liable for a bill worth $3,400. Abagnale was only 15 at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Abagnale, Frank (2000). Catch Me If You Can. Broadway Paperbacks. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-7679-0538-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/scams/frank_abagnale/index.html |title=Skywayman: The Story of Frank W.

== Bank fraud ==
Abagnale's early [[confidence trick]]s included writing [[personal check]]s on his own overdrawn account. This, however, would only work for a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so he moved on to opening other accounts at different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time through experimentation, he developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect copies of checks such as payroll checks, depositing them, and encouraging banks to advance him cash on the basis of his account balances. Another trick he used was to magnetically print his account number on blank deposit slips and add them to the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: 'Catch Me if You Can' Conman Abagnale Tells How to Prevent Fraud|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/banking/2012/12/crime-doesnt-pay-warns-catch-me-if.html?page=all |work=Minneapolis Business Journal |first=Jim |last=Hammerand |date=December 11, 2012 |accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech, Abagnale described an occasion when he noticed the location where airlines and car rental businesses, such as United Airlines and Hertz, would drop off their daily collections of money in a zip up bag and then deposit them into a drop box on the airport premises. Using a security guard disguise he bought at a local costume shop, he put a sign over the box saying "Out of Service, Place deposits with security guard on duty" and collected money in that manner. Later he disclosed how he could not believe this idea had actually worked, stating with some astonishment: "How can a drop box be out of service?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/896806932|title=Profiling the fraudster : removing the mask to prevent and detect fraud|last=Padgett|first=Simon|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781118929759|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=159|oclc=896806932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impersonations ==

=== Airline pilot ===
Later Abagnale decided to impersonate a pilot in order to look more legitimate when cashing checks. He obtained a uniform by calling [[Pan American World Airways]] (Pan Am), telling the company that he was a pilot working for them who had lost his uniform while getting it cleaned at his hotel, and obtaining a new one with a fake employee&amp;nbsp;ID number. He then forged a [[Federal Aviation Administration]] pilot's license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=biography.com |title=Frank Abagnale Biography |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pan Am estimated that between the ages of 16–18, Abagnale flew more than {{convert|1000000|mi|km}} on more than 250&amp;nbsp;flights and flew to 26 countries by [[Deadheading (employee)|deadheading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Catch me if you can |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-catch-me-if-you-can-sunrise-20161026-story.html |newspaper=Sun-Sentinel |department=Local: Broward}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a company pilot, he was also able to stay at hotels free during this time. Everything from food to lodging was billed to the airline company. Notably, however, Abagnale did not fly on Pan Am planes – believing his charade could potentially be identified by actual Pan Am pilots possessing actual company identification and background.

Abagnale stated that he was often invited by actual pilots to take the controls of the plane in-flight. On one occasion, he was offered the courtesy of flying at {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. He took the controls and enabled the autopilot, "very much aware that I had been handed custody of 140&amp;nbsp;lives, my own included ... because I couldn't fly a kite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abagnale | first1=Frank W. |last2=Redding |first2=Stan |title=Catch me if you can |year=2000 |publisher=Broadway |isbn=978-0-7679-0538-1 |pages=3–4 |chapter=The Fledgling (1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching assistant ===
He said that he worked as a sociology teaching assistant at [[Brigham Young University]] for a semester, under the name Frank Adams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Physician ===
For eleven months, Abagnale impersonated a chief [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]] in a Georgia hospital under the alias Frank Williams. He chose this course after he was nearly arrested disembarking from a flight in New Orleans. Afraid of possible capture, he retired temporarily to Georgia. When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as "doctor", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote "pilot". After befriending a real doctor who lived in the same apartment complex, he agreed to act as a supervisor of resident [[Internship (medicine)#United States|interns]] as a favor until the local hospital could find someone else to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work. However, he was nearly exposed when an infant almost died from [[oxygen deprivation]] because he had no idea what a nurse meant when she said there was a "[[blue baby]]". He was able to fake his way through most of his duties by letting the interns handle the cases coming in during his late-night shift, setting broken bones and other mundane tasks. He left the hospital only after he realized he could put lives at risk by his inability to respond to life-and-death situations.&lt;ref name=Catch/&gt;

=== Attorney ===
While posing as Pan Am First Officer "Robert Black", Abagnale forged a [[Harvard University]] law transcript, passed the Louisiana [[bar exam]], and got a job at the Louisiana State Attorney General's office at the age of nineteen. He told a flight attendant he had briefly dated that he was also a [[Harvard Law School]] student, and she introduced him to a lawyer friend. Abagnale was told the bar needed more lawyers and was offered a chance to apply. After making a fake transcript from Harvard, he prepared himself for the compulsory exam. Despite failing twice, he claims to have passed the bar exam legitimately on the third try after eight weeks of study, because "Louisiana, at the time, allowed you to take the Bar over and over as many times as you needed. It was really a matter of eliminating what you got wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his biography, he described the premise of his legal job as a "gopher boy" who simply fetched coffee and books for his boss. However, a real Harvard graduate also worked for that attorney general, and he hounded Abagnale with questions about his tenure at Harvard. Naturally, Abagnale could not answer questions about a university he had never attended. Eight months later he resigned after learning the man was making inquiries into his background.

== Capture and imprisonment ==
Abagnale was eventually arrested in [[Montpellier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spielberg-ocr.com/arrest.html|title=Arrests of the Escape Artist Frank Abagnale - Spielberg, Abagnale and OCR|first=Ivo|last=Vynckier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, in 1969 when an [[Air France]] attendant he previously dated recognized him and informed police. When the French police arrested him, 12 countries in which he had committed fraud sought his [[extradition]]. After a two-day trial, he first served time in [[Perpignan]]'s prison—a one-year sentence that the presiding judge at his trial reduced to six months. At Perpignan he was held nude in a tiny, filthy, lightless cell that he was never allowed to leave. The cell lacked a mattress, plumbing, and electricity, and food and water were strictly limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=2281 |title=Abu Ghraib and other prisons around the world |work=ON LINE Opinion |first=Mark S. |last=Lawson |date=June 11, 2004 |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then extradited to Sweden, where he was treated more humanely under Swedish law. During trial for forgery, his defense attorney almost had his case dismissed by arguing that he had created the fake checks and not forged them, but his charges were instead reduced to swindling and fraud. Following another conviction, he served six months in a [[Malmö]] prison, only to learn at the end of it he would be tried next in Italy. Later, a Swedish judge asked a U.S. State Department official to revoke his passport. Without a valid passport, the Swedish authorities were legally compelled to deport him to the United States, where he was sentenced to 12 years in a federal prison for multiple counts of forgery.&lt;ref name=Conway&gt;{{cite book |last=Conway |first=Allan |title=Analyze This: What Handwriting Reveals |publisher=PRC Publishing |edition=1st |year=2004 |page=64 |isbn=978-1-85648-707-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged escapes ==
While being deported to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British [[Vickers VC10|VC-10]] airliner as it was turning onto a taxiway at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK International Airport]]. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to [[Grand Central Terminal]]. After stopping in [[The Bronx]] to change clothes and pick up a set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's [[Montreal-Pierre Elliot Trudeau International Airport|Dorval airport]] to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a [[Mac's|Mac's Milk]], he was apprehended by a constable of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] while standing in line at the ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In April 1971, Abagnale reportedly escaped from the Federal Detention Center in Atlanta, Georgia, while awaiting trial. In his book, Abagnale considers this to be one of the most infamous [[List of prison escapes|escapes]] in history. During the time, U.S. prisons were being condemned by civil rights groups and investigated by congressional committees. In a stroke of luck that included the accompanying [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshal]] forgetting his detention commitment papers, Abagnale was mistaken for an undercover prison inspector and was even given privileges and food far better than the other inmates. The [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|Federal Department of Corrections]] in Atlanta had already lost two employees as a result of reports written by undercover federal agents and Abagnale took advantage of their vulnerability. He contacted a friend (called in his book "Jean Sebring") who posed as his fiancée and slipped him the business card of "Inspector C.W. Dunlap" of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|Bureau of Prisons]], which she had obtained by posing as a freelance writer doing an article on fire safety measures in federal detention centers. She also handed over a business card from "Sean O'Riley" (later revealed to be [[Joseph Shea (FBI agent)|Joseph Shea]]), the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent in charge of Abagnale's case, which she doctored at a stationery print shop. Abagnale told the corrections officers that he was indeed a prison inspector and handed over Dunlap's business card as proof. He told them that he needed to contact FBI Agent Sean O'Riley on a matter of urgent business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

O'Riley's phone number (actually the number altered by Sebring) was dialed and picked up by Jean Sebring at a payphone in an Atlanta shopping mall, posing as an operator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Later, he was allowed to meet unsupervised with O'Riley in a predetermined car outside the detention center. Sebring, incognito, picked Abagnale up and drove him to an Atlanta bus station, where he took a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus to New York, and soon thereafter, a train to Washington, D.C. Abagnale then bluffed his way through an attempted capture by posing as an FBI agent after being recognized by a motel registration clerk. Still intent on making his way to Brazil, Abagnale was picked up a few weeks later by two [[NYPD]] detectives when he inadvertently walked past their unmarked police car.&lt;ref name=Catch/&gt;

== Legitimate jobs ==
In 1974, after he had served less than five years of his 12-year sentence at Federal Correctional Institution in [[Petersburg, Virginia]], the United States federal government released him on the condition that he help the federal authorities, without pay, to investigate crimes committed by fraud and scam artists, and sign in once a week.&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt; Unwilling to return to his family in New York, he left the choice of parole up to the court and it was decided that he would be paroled in Texas.

After his release, Abagnale tried numerous jobs, including cook, grocer, and movie projectionist, but he was fired from most of these after it was discovered he had been hired without revealing his criminal past. Finding these jobs unsatisfying, he approached a bank with an offer. He explained to the bank what he had done and offered to speak to the bank's staff and show them various tricks that "[[cheque fraud|paperhangers]]" use to defraud banks. His offer included the condition that if they did not find his speech helpful, they would owe him nothing; otherwise, they would owe him only $50 with an agreement that they would provide his name to other banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abagnale|first=Frank W.|title=The Art of the Steal|year=2001|publisher=Broadway Books|page={{page needed|date=April 2011}}|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SntY2J0wfPMC&amp;pg=PT17|isbn=9780767910910}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that, he began a legitimate life as a security consultant.&lt;ref name=a&amp;a /&gt;

He later founded Abagnale &amp; Associates, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma,&lt;ref name="a&amp;a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abagnale.com/|title=Abagnale &amp; Associates|accessdate=May 20, 2007|publisher=Abagnale &amp; Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; which advises companies on fraud issues. Abagnale also continues to advise the FBI, with whom he has associated for over 40 years, by teaching at the [[FBI Academy]] and lecturing for FBI field offices throughout the country. According to his website, more than 14,000 institutions have adopted Abagnale's fraud prevention programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abagnale.com/aboutfrank.htm "aboutfrank"], ''abagnale.com'' webpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abagnale testified before the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] in November 2012 about the vulnerabilities of senior citizens to fraud, particularly stressing the ubiquitous use of [[Social Security number#Identity theft|Social Security number]]s for identification included on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] cards.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffenach, Glenn, [http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2012/11/26/5-anti-fraud-tips-from-an-ex-fraudster/ "5 anti-fraud tips from an ex-fraudster"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'' blog, November 26, 2012.

== Veracity of claims ==
The authenticity of Abagnale's criminal exploits was questioned even before the publication of ''Catch Me If You Can''. In 1978, after Abagnale had been a featured speaker at an anti-crime seminar, a ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' reporter looked into his assertions. Phone calls to banks, schools, hospitals and other institutions Abagnale mentioned turned up no evidence of his cons under the aliases he used. Abagnale's response was that "Due to the embarrassment involved, I doubt if anyone would confirm the information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newsthinking.com/story.cfm?SID=166

In 2002, Abagnale himself addressed the issue of his story's truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website which said in part: "I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Abagnale &amp; Associates, Comments| url=http://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm | accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media appearances ==
Abagnale appeared on the TV quiz show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' in 1977, along with two contestants presenting themselves as him.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|5w9NsxWFYFU}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{episode needed|date=October 2013}}

In the 1970s, he also appeared at least three times as a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', and was interviewed on one occasion by guest host [[George Carlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson episodes (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/80934410|title=The Tonight Show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s Abagnale was featured as a recurring guest on the UK television series ''[[The Secret Cabaret]]'', produced by [[Open Media]] for [[Channel 4]]. The show dealt with magic and illusions; Abagnale featured as an expert exposing various confidence tricks.

Abagnale's semi-autobiographic book, ''[[Catch Me if You Can (book)|Catch Me If You Can]]'', was turned into a movie of the same name, by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002, featuring actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Abagnale. The real Abagnale made a [[cameo appearance]] in this film as a French police officer taking DiCaprio into custody.&lt;ref name=cameo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/17/easter-eggs-movies_n_5985844.html |title=11 Easter Eggs You Never Noticed In Your Favorite Movies |last1=Van Luling |first1=Todd |date=October 17, 2014 |website=The Huffington Post |publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc. |accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movie eventually became the basis for a musical, [[Catch Me If You Can (musical)|of the same name]], which opened in 2011 with [[Aaron Tveit]] as Abagnale. The musical received four [[Tony Award]] nominations, including one for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]], winning [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Best Actor In A Musical]] for [[Norbert Leo Butz]].

In 2016, Abagnale appeared in a television commercial for [[IBM]].

In 2017, Abagnale appeared in Talks at Google. In an hour long talk consisting of 'his own point of view on his real personal life' and answers to several audience' questions, he dwells  in detail about his juvenile adventures, family relations, life as both a con and later as a government official and what is to happen to the global security scenario  within the upcoming five years or so.

In 2018, Abagnale appeared in a televised [[blockchain|Blockchain]] Nation Conference in Miami, sponsored by AMREC (American Renewable Energy Corporation), where he spoke about blockchain technology. His quote "I think you would have to be pretty ignorant not to realise that blockchain is the way for the future, it is the best way to secure information 100 percent, so I think you will see banks, especially accounting practices and accounting firms, all move to the blockchain, keeping records through blockchain. It will be the best way to do so because you cannot break the blockchain, you cannot hack into the blockchain, you can’t change anything in the blockchain." was identified as noteworthy by Yahoo Finance and Fortune Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bcnation.com|title=Blockchain Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amrec.com/news-amrec-blockchain-nation|title=AMREC - American Renewable Energy Corporation |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blockchain-adopted-every-bank-catch-225334677.html|title=Yahoo Finance |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2018/05/29/frank-abagnale-blockchain-banks/|title=Fortune Magazine |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Abagnale lives in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], with his wife Kelly, whom he met while working undercover for the FBI. They have three sons, Scott, Chris, and Sean.&lt;ref name="abagnale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abagnale.com/news092010.asp|title=Charleston Profile: Bona Fide |work=Charleston Mag via abagnale.com|first=Stephanie|last=Hunt|date=September 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott works for the FBI.
Abagnale cites meeting his wife as the motivation for changing his life. He has said, "She met me as someone else with a completely different background and when the assignment was over I had broken protocol, because you’re never supposed to do this, but I told her who I really was because I wanted to continue to see her. She accepted what I told her and eventually we got married and have been married ever since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stenning, Paul | authorlink=Paul Stenning | title= Success - By Those Who've Made It.

Abagnale and [[Joseph Shea (FBI agent)|Joseph Shea]], the FBI agent on whom the character of Carl Hanratty (played by [[Tom Hanks]]) was based in the film ''Catch Me If You Can'', remained close friends until Shea's death.&lt;ref name=joseph-shea-obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Joseph Shea|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/atlanta/obituary.aspx?n=joseph-shea&amp;pid=14745271&amp;fhid=3694|accessdate=November 3, 2013|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=August 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joseph-shea&gt;{{cite web|title=An Obituary for Joseph Shea|url=http://www.spielberg-ocr.com/hanratty.html#Shea|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], leader of the Calvinist French [[Huguenot]] faction, is shot to death by a man in the hire of [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], leader of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], an event which precipitates the [[St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in August 1572.

===Philip II===

[[William Shakespeare]] wrote ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'' (1596), ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' (1599), ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'' (1592), ''[[Henry VI, part 2]]'' (1591), and ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]'' (1591),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. Complete works (6th ed). New York: Longman, 2008. http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/&lt;/ref&gt; based on events during the reigns of [[John of England]], king from 1199 to 1216, [[Henry V of England]], king from 1413 to 1422, [[Henry VI of England]], king from 1422 to 1461 and from 1470 to 1471, [[Philip II of France]], king from 1180 to 1223, [[Charles VI of France]], king from 1380 to 1422, and [[Charles VII of France]], king from 1422 to 1461.

In the first scene of ''King John'', [[John of England]] receives a message from [[Philip II of France]], demanding that he abdicate his throne to his nephew, [[Arthur I of Brittany]], believed to be the rightful heir. When John refuses, war is declared. But to obtain a stronger claim to his throne and to appease the French (act 2, scene 1), John agrees to a marriage contract between [[Blanche of Castile]], his niece, and [[Louis the Lion]], Philip's son (1200). In 1203, John captures Arthur, who eventually dies (act 4, scene 3).

===Charles VI===

As a part of the [[Hundred Years' War]], 1337–1453, the English forces invade France, besieging [[Harfleur]] (1415), act 3, scene 1, and defeat the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415). In the final scene, the king marries [[Catherine of Valois]] (1420), daughter to King Charles VI.

In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 2'', King Henry VI of England marries [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, of the [[House of Valois]], niece to King Charles VII, arranged by the marquis of Suffolk, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]] as a way to influence the young king through her. In the marriage contract, the English lose the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine and no dowry is given ([[Treaty of Tours]], 1445). In the final scene, the Yorkists are victorious after the [[First Battle of St Albans]] (1455) during the [[War of the Roses]].

The '''International Festival of Muslim Cinema Golden Minbar''' is an annual event which provides a forum for Muslim [[filmmaker]]s. It is a showcase for Islamic Cinema and [[Muslim Cinema]]. It provides a place for meetings and an exchange of experience among the filmmakers of [[Russia]], the Muslim countries and the world. The festival is open to not only Muslims, but also the representatives of other faiths creating films.

The high award of the festival is the Golden Minbar [[statuette]] in the shape of a reel of cine-film with the ends transforming into the waves carrying the ark with a [[Minbar]] - a place from where the [[Imam]] preaches.

Like the first festival, the second «Golden minbar» festival also was held in Kazan under the motto «[[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]] and [[political correctness]]».

The '''International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam''' (IABR) is a bi-annual international event bringing together international knowledge and experience in various design disciplines (architecture, urban planning and landscape architecture), and presenting this knowledge and experience to a broader audience.

Unlike other events such as the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]], the IABR is a thematically designed research biennal; each edition addresses a pressing issue, from the perspective of current (Dutch) practices within an international context, and always with a focus on the future of the city. 

The IABR implements its agenda by means of international research projects, exhibitions, master classes, workshops, conferences, lectures, debates, essays, a website, blogs, a catalogue, book, brochures, film, DVD, etc. Since the fourth edition, in 2009, the IABR has increasingly combined its research projects with concrete urban planning assignments. Particularly in the cities of Rotterdam, Istanbul and São Paulo, the biennale is actively  involved in the actual development of the city.

The 7th edition of the IABR, THE NEXT ECONOMY–, opens in April 2016.

The most recent Joyous Entries took place in 2013 in honour of the Belgian king.

==Ceremonial reception==
A Joyous Entry is a particular form of, and title for, the general phenomenon of ceremonial entries into cities by rulers or their representatives, which were celebrated with enormous [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry and festivities throughout Europe from at least the late Middle Ages on. The leading artists available designed temporary decorated constructions such as [[triumphal arch]]es, groups of musicians and actors performed on stands at which the procession halted, the houses on the processional route decorated themselves with hangings, flowers were thrown, and fountains flowed with wine. The custom began in the [[Middle Ages]] and continued until the [[French Revolution]], although less often in Protestant counties after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. A formal first visit to a city by an inheritor of the [[Monarchy of Belgium|throne of Belgium]] upon his accession and since 1900 for a [[crown prince]] upon his marriage, is still referred to as a "Joyous Entry", a reminder of this tradition of the [[Rechtsstaat|rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vitiaz.ru/congress/en/thesis/200.html Museum of the World Ocean — The thirtieth anniversary of the international conferences (schools) for marine geology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925042158/http://vitiaz.ru/congress/en/thesis/200.html |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nieuwsbank"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nieuwsbank.nl/inp/2000/01/0124E013.htm Nieuwsbank interactief Nederlands persbureau]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charter of liberties==
In the [[Duchy of Brabant]] the term Joyous Entry was also applied to the charter of liberties that a new ruler was obliged to swear to uphold upon their formal first reception, dating back to the [[Joyous Entry of 1356]]. One of the functions of the [[Council of Brabant]] was to ensure that new legislation did not contravene or abrogate the liberties established in the Joyous Entry.&lt;ref&gt;D. De Stobbeleir, "Verzet tegen de hervormingen van Jozef II en de staatsgreep van 18 juni 1789", tr. M. Erkens, in ''Doorheen de nationale geschiedenis'' ([[State Archives in Belgium]], Brussels, 1980), pp. 262–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kingdom of Belgium ==
In Belgium this ceremonial reception of the new sovereign has continued since 1830. Ceremonial entries are performed by the new royal couple in the capitals of the provinces after the installation of the King. The same goes for the Duke of Brabant, who  after his marriage presents the new duchess of Brabant to the public. The most recent Joyous Entries were organised in honour of [[Philippe of Belgium|King Philippe]] and [[Queen Mathilde of Belgium|Queen Mathilde]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20130723_00667925 De Blijde Intredes van Filip en Mathilde], ''[[De Standaard]]'', 23 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karyn Kupcinet''' (March 6, 1941 &amp;ndash; November 28, 1963) was an [[Americans|American]] stage, film, and television actress. She was the only daughter of Chicago columnist and television personality [[Irv Kupcinet]].

Kupcinet had a brief acting career during the early 1960s. Six days after the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], her body was found at her [[West Hollywood, California]], home. It has been theorized that Kupcinet's death, officially ruled a [[homicide]], was connected to the assassination or was the result of an accidental fall. In the 1960s, Irv Kupcinet publicly dismissed the theories linking his daughter to the President's death.  In 1992, ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' referred briefly to her alleged connection to the assassination, which prompted Kupcinet to describe the television broadcast as "an atrocious outrage" and "calumny".  Karyn Kupcinet's death remains officially unsolved.

==Early life==
Kupcinet was born Roberta Lynn Kupcinet' in Chicago to Irv Kupcinet, a [[sportswriter]] for the ''Chicago Daily Times'', and his wife, Esther "Essee" Solomon Kupcinet. She acquired the nickname "Cookie" during her childhood. She made her acting debut at age 13 in the Chicago production of ''Anniversary Waltz'', and went on to attend [[Pine Manor College]] for a semester, eventually studying at the [[Actors Studio]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Karyn Kupcinet and Skip Ward - 1961.jpg|thumb|180px|Kupcinet with Skip Ward in ''Mrs. G. Goes to College'', 1961]]
Kupcinet was encouraged into acting by her mother,&lt;ref name="Kup"&gt;{{cite web |last=Felsenthal |first=Carol |title=The Lost World of Kup |work=Chicago Magazine |url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2004/The-Lost-World-of-Kup/index.php?cp=6&amp;si=5  |date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given access to producers through the reputation of her father and his ''Kup's Column'' in the ''Sun-Times''.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt; In 1961, [[Jerry Lewis]] offered Kupcinet a role in the film ''[[The Ladies Man]]'', where she appeared in a bit part as one of dozens of young ladies in a Hollywood boardinghouse. In 1962, she appeared in the role of [[Annie Sullivan]] in a [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]] summer theater production of ''[[The Miracle Worker]]''.&lt;ref name="Kup" /&gt; She appeared in guest roles on television, including ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[The Wide Country]]'', ''[[G.E. True]]'', and ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]''. In addition to guest spots, Kupcinet had a regular role in the primetime series ''[[Mrs. G. Goes to College]]'' (retitled ''The Gertrude Berg Show'' during its short run).&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0475432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kupcinet's last onscreen appearance was on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' in the role of Penny Ames, entitled, "The Case of the Capering Camera". The episode aired on [[CBS]] on January 16, 1964, nearly two months after her death.&lt;ref name=imdb /&gt; It was also the final on-screen appearance of [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], who was no longer able to do the show due to his emphysema. Collins played Lt. Tragg.

==Personal life==
By 1961, Kupcinet was living in Hollywood and was getting positive reviews for her acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=John|title=The Tales of Hollywood the Bizarre|year=1992|publisher=SP Books|isbn=1-56171-142-X|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1962, a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' interviewer, assigned to help Kupcinet promote ''The Gertrude Berg Show'', noted her talking exclusively about food and her weight.&lt;ref name="berg"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Lydia |title=No Starch, No Sweets |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1962-03-29 |page=C11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1962, Kupcinet filmed a guest-star appearance on ''The Wide Country'' and had her first meeting with one of the series' stars, [[Andrew Prine]],&lt;ref name=ellroy1&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellroy|first=James|title=Crime Wave: Reportage and Fiction From the Underside of L.A.|year=1999|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=0-375-70471-X|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began a relationship with him.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ellroy1"/&gt; However, the relationship was problematic, Kupcinet was abusing [[diet pill]]s along with other prescription drugs,&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt; and she had been arrested for [[shoplifting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=John|title=The Tales of Hollywood the Bizarre|year=1992|publisher=SP Books|isbn=1-56171-142-X|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems in Kupcinet's relationship with Prine were mainly due to Prine's objections to making the relationship exclusive. After Kupcinet underwent an illegal [[abortion]] in July 1963, the relationship cooled and Prine began dating other women. In turn, Kupcinet began spying on Prine and his new girlfriend.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;

The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] later determined Kupcinet had sent threatening and profane messages, consisting of words and letters she had cut out of magazines, to Prine and herself.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;  When Prine told her by telephone about the messages that had been left on his doorstep, she said she had received them, too.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;  They met to show the messages to each other.  She seemed puzzled.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;  Soon after her death, investigators for the sheriff's department found her fingerprints on the papers and the [[Scotch tape]].&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;

The weight problems had started in high school when Kupcinet began taking diet pills. Her weight remained an issue while at Pine Manor College. The pressure to stay thin intensified after Kupcinet arrived in Hollywood, and she soon began abusing diet pills along with other [[prescription drug]]s.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;

==Death==
On the last day of her life, Kupcinet had dinner with future ''[[Lost in Space]]'' cast member [[Mark Goddard]] and his wife, Marcia Rogers Goddard, at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in [[Beverly Hills]] (near [[Mulholland Drive]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Seymour|last= Korman|title=4 Face Quiz in Starlet's Slaying |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/572226612.html?dids=572226612:572226612&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Dec+02%2C+1963&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=4+Face+Quiz+in+Starlet%27s+Slaying&amp;pqatl=google |quote=Four male friends of Karyn Kupcinet, 22, Hollywood starlet, have been asked to take lie detector tests in the investigation of her murder, police said tonight. ...

The couple said Kupcinet only toyed with her food during the meal. Marcia Goddard told two officers from the L.A. County Sheriff's Office that during dinner with Kupcinet "... her lips seemed numb.

Kupcinet apparently went straight home after dining with her friends. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. They told detectives they watched TV, including ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]'', with Kupcinet. They all drank coffee until she fell asleep, sitting next to them on the couch. She awoke and went to her room. The men either turned the TV set off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume), and made sure the door was locked behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend, Andrew Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The three young men watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellroy|first=James|title=Crime Wave: Reportage and Fiction From the Underside of L.A.|year=1999|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=0-375-70471-X|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goddards went to Kupcinet's apartment on November 30, after she failed to telephone the couple as promised. Mark Goddard stated that he had a "funny feeling" that something was wrong.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt; Upon arriving at Kupcinet's apartment, the couple found her nude body lying on the couch. Mark Goddard initially assumed that she had died from a drug overdose.&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt; Upon searching Kupcinet's apartment, police found prescriptions for [[Desoxyn]], [[Miltown]], Amvicel, and other medications.&lt;ref name="ellroy1"/&gt; Authorities also found a note written by Kupcinet that reflected in some detail her emotions regarding issues in her life (i.e., parents, self-image, problems with boyfriend) and people she admired.&lt;ref name=hollywood /&gt;

Coroner Harold Kade concluded that due to a broken [[hyoid]] bone in her throat, Kupcinet had been strangled. Her death was officially ruled a homicide.&lt;ref name=kup7&gt;{{cite news |last=Felsenthal |first=Carol |title =The Lost World of Kup |work=[[Chicago Magazine]] |date =June 2004 |url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/June-2004/The-Lost-World-of-Kup/index.php?cp=6&amp;si=5 |pages=7 |accessdate=2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators from the L. A. County Sheriff's Office determined that Kupcinet had told Andrew Prine by telephone the same story about the abandoned baby that she had told the Goddards, and it was false.&lt;ref name=ellroy/&gt; Neither the sheriff's office nor the Los Angeles Police Department had received a report of a baby found abandoned anywhere in her apartment building on her last day alive or the previous day.&lt;ref name=ellroy/&gt;

===Theories===

====Lover's quarrel====
During the course of their investigation, the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] named Andrew Prine as one of their chief suspects.  When questioned by law enforcement, Prine said he had talked with Kupcinet twice by phone on Wednesday, the day before her murder, claiming he was trying to patch up a lover's quarrel between them.  Detectives considered it possible that after Prine learned the anonymous threat letters both he and Kupcinet had received had been created by Kupcinet herself, that and their unresolved argument gave him a motive for murder.  In addition, both Edward Rubin and Robert Hathaway, the two men who had possibly been the last to see her alive, were friends of Prine.  They were also eventually named as suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-24/news/ct-per-flash-karyn-kupcinet-1124-20131124_1_death-assassination-essee | title=Karyn Kupcinet 1963 death still unsolved | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=November 24, 2013 | accessdate=July 7, 2015 | author=By Stephan Benzkofer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nwitimes.com/entertainment/columnists/offbeat/offbeat-chicago-gossip-columnist-kup-never-forgot-beloved-daughter/article_1fc80669-8892-58bd-a1e4-2ace6a82fb6b.html | title=OFFBEAT: Chicago gossip columnist Kup never forgot beloved daughter | publisher=Northwest Indiana Times | date=November 29, 2013 | accessdate=July 7, 2015 | author=Phil Potempa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kup"/&gt;

In 1988, Kupcinet's father Irv published a memoir in which he revealed that he and his wife Essee (Karyn's mother) believed that Andrew Prine had had nothing to do with Karyn's
murder.&lt;ref name="Kupcinet 1988 186–188"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kupcinet|first=Irving|title=Kup: A Man, An Era, A City|publisher=Bonus Books|year=1988|pages=186–188|isbn=0-933893-70-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was suspicious of a person, still alive when he wrote his memoir, who had no connection to Prine.&lt;ref name="Kupcinet 1988 186–188"/&gt;

====Alleged connection to JFK====
Kupcinet's death was first mentioned in connection with the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] in 1967 by researcher [[Penn Jones, Jr.]] in the self-published book ''Forgive My Grief II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones, Jr. |first=Penn |url=http://www3.baylor.edu/Library/BCPM/JFK/Jones/PennJones.html |title=Papers of Penn Jones Jr. Kennedy Assassination Materials 1963-1998 |publisher=Baylor Collections of Political Materials. Baylor University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828042443/http://www3.baylor.edu/Library/BCPM/JFK/Jones/PennJones.html |archivedate=2006-08-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones cited an [[Associated Press]] wire service story about an unidentified woman who placed a phone call on November 22, 1963, from the vicinity of [[Oxnard, California]], about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and Jones claimed this woman was Kupcinet.

The woman, who dialed her local operator roughly 20 minutes before the shooting of the president in Dallas, stated that he was going to be shot. Jones alleged that "Karyn Kupcinet" was attempting to warn someone of the impending assassination. Jones claimed that she was told of the imminent assassination by her father, who allegedly had been given advance notice by Oswald's killer [[Jack Ruby]], whom Irv Kupcinet had met in Chicago in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/kupcinet.htm |title=Dead in the Wake of the Kennedy  Assassination: Hollywood Homicide |first=John C. |last=McAdams |publisher=Marquette University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones speculated Karyn Kupcinet had been murdered by representatives of the [[Italian-American Mafia]] who silenced her and sent a message to her father to remain silent about why JFK and Oswald had been shot and who was actually responsible.&lt;ref name=zapruder&gt;{{cite news |last=Fecteau |first=Paul |title=Zapruder’s Stepchildren: The Most Fascinating People in J.F.K. Assassination Lore |date=2005–2006 |url=http://www.washburn.edu/faculty/pfecteau/zap.htm#kupcinet |publisher=Washburn University |accessdate =2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Irv Kupcinet denied that he or his daughter had prior knowledge of the shootings of the president or Oswald. This was supported by Karyn Kupcinet's friends, actor [[Earl Holliman]], Holliman's then-girlfriend, and Karyn's boyfriend Andrew Prine, all of whom traveled to [[Palm Springs]] with Karyn on November 22. Karyn Kupcinet reportedly seemed upset and shocked about television and radio coverage of the shootings that she saw and heard in Palm Springs.&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;  She did not reveal any foreknowledge of the events.&lt;ref name=hollywood/&gt;

In 2013, the ''[[Ventura County Star]]'' commemorated the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination with a long article about the unknown woman who had used a phone in the vicinity of Oxnard, 50 miles away from Karyn Kupcinet's home, immediately before the shooting of JFK.&lt;ref name="oxnard"&gt;[http://www.vcstar.com/news/mystery-oxnard-area-caller-whispers-about-jfks-death-minutes-before-shooting-ep-292158144-351553551.html Mystery Oxnard-area caller whispers about JFK's death minutes before shooting], ''Ventura County Star'', November 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing FBI documents that were declassified decades after the events of November 1963, the ''Ventura County Star'' article claims that two telephone operators with [[GTE|General Telephone Company]] who listened to the unknown woman talking for approximately 15 minutes gave the FBI a description of her voice.&lt;ref name="oxnard"/&gt;  FBI agents questioned the two operators a very short time after JFK's death.&lt;ref name="oxnard"/&gt; Their description did not match Kupcinet's voice in the slightest, especially regarding her age bracket.&lt;ref name="oxnard"/&gt;   The 2013 ''Ventura County Star'' article adds that the two operators believed the woman on the phone was "mentally disturbed."&lt;ref name="oxnard"/&gt;

Regarding Irv Kupcinet's connection to Jack Ruby, one year his senior, the [[Warren Commission]] determined that many men in their age bracket had interacted with Ruby in Chicago before 1947, when he moved from Chicago to Dallas.&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/ |year=1964 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=786 |chapter=Appendix 16: A Biography of Jack Ruby |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix-16.html |ref={{harvid|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Appendix 16|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission questioned many Chicagoans who had interacted with Ruby.&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"/&gt; None of them had prior knowledge that he was going to shoot Oswald.&lt;ref name="WCR-A16"/&gt;

===Media attention===
During the production and subsequent release of [[Oliver Stone|Oliver Stone's]] film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', Irv Kupcinet attacked the movie and the [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] surrounding it.&lt;ref name=hollywood /&gt; When the film's box-office success led to a wave of media attention about the JFK conspiracy, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' broadcast a list of mysterious deaths, including that of Karyn Kupcinet. Irv Kupcinet responded to the ''Today'' broadcast in his column in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' of February 9, 1992:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The NBC ''Today Show'' on Friday [February 7] carried a list of people who died violently in 1963 shortly after the death of President John F. Kennedy and may have had some link to the assassination. The first name on the list was Karyn Kupcinet, my daughter. That is an atrocious outrage. She did die violently in a Hollywood murder case still unsolved. That same list was published in a book years ago with no justification or verification.

The book left the impression that some on the list may have been killed to silence them because of knowledge of the assassination. Nothing could be further from the truth in my daughter's case. The list apparently has developed a life of its own and for ''Today'' to repeat the calumny is reprehensible. Karyn no longer can suffer pain by such an inexcusable mention, but her parents and her brother Jerry can.&lt;ref name=hollywood /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 30, 1999, an episode of ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'', entitled "Death of a Dream: Karyn Kupcinet", detailed Kupcinet's life and theories regarding her death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tv.yahoo.com/death-of-a-dream-karyn-kupcinet-the-e-true-hollywood-story/show/7465/castcrew;_ylt=Av2GIyY6vDV3LBvFmgq10XCSo9EF ''Death of a Dream: Karyn Kupcinet: The E! True Hollywood Story'']. Yahoo TV.com.&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2017}}

==Legacy==
Irv and Essee Kupcinet established a playhouse at [[Shimer College]] in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Severo |first=Richard |title=Irv Kupcinet, 91, Dies; Chronicled Chicago for 60 Years |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3D81E39F932A25752C1A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |date=2003-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Irv Kupcinet and his wife also founded the Karyn Kupcinet International School for Science, a summer research internships program at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shur |first=Cindy |url=http://www.juf.org/news/obit.aspx?id=10712 |title=Remembering Irv Kupcinet |publisher=Jewish United Fund |date=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Kupcinet's niece, actress Kari Kupcinet-Kriser, and [[Washburn University]] professor Paul Fecteau, began work on a book about Kupcinet's unsolved murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fecteau |first=Paul |url=http://www.washburn.edu/faculty/pfecteau/kupcinet.htm |title=A Search for Karyn Kupcinet |publisher=Washburn University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kuhikugu''' is an archaeological site located in [[Brazil]], at the headwaters of the [[Xingu River]], in the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. The area around Kuhikugu is located in part of the [[Xingu National Park]] today. Kuhikugu was first uncovered by anthropologist Michael Heckenberger, working alongside the local [[Kuikuro]] people, who are the likely descendants of the original inhabitants of Kuhikugu.&lt;ref name="Heckenberger"&gt;
{{cite book|last= Heckenberger |first= Michael J. |title= The Ecology of Power: Culture, Place, and Personhood in the Southern Amazon, A.D. 1000-2000 |date= 2005-01-10 |publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Psychology Press]] |isbn= 9780415945998 |pages= 95-102 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hAKratAxR18C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Kuhikugu,+which+means%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kEG6EmpUa2&amp;sig=THqOGR0FobI6PVBWuXz3DCgNCSc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4_H2sbfWAhXmgFQKHTx_Au8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kuhikugu%2C%20which%20means%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Archaeological complex and history==
In the broad sense, the name refers to an archaeological complex including twenty towns and villages, spread out over an area of around {{convert|7700|sqmi|km2}}, where close to 50,000 people may have once lived.  Kuhikugu was likely inhabited from a period of time around 1,500 years ago to a time as recently as 400 years ago, when the people living there were likely killed by diseases brought over by [[Europe]]ans.&lt;ref name="Heckenberger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grann"&gt;{{cite book|last= Grann |first= David |authorlink= David Grann |title= The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon |publisher= [[Vintage Books]] |series= Vintage Departures Series |date= 2010-01-26 |isbn= 9781400078455 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QPih33JBeMwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:mjUTYzplSmcC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_r-iNtbfWAhUmjlQKHdEiBW4Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Settlement X11==
Strictly speaking, Kuhikugu is settlement '''X11''' of this complex, located near Porto dos Meinacos on the eastern shore of [[Lake Kuhikugu]] (now Lagoa Dourada) at {{Coord|12|33|30|S|53|6|40|W|type:landmark_region:BR|display=inline,title}}. There, as well as at other former settlements of the Kuhikugu complex, [[satellite imagery]] reveals that even today the forest differs from surrounding pristine areas, and ground-based exploration reveals this to be an effect of the [[anthrosol]] (cf. ''[[terra preta]]''), known to the Kuikuro as ''[[egepe]]''. Directly to the north of the X11 site there is a Kuikuro village, the small size of which provides an interesting comparison to the large area of ''egepe'' which indicates the prehistoric settlement.&lt;ref name="Amazonia" /&gt;

Large defensive ditches and palisades were built around some of the communities at Kuhikugu.&lt;ref name="Heckenberger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazonia"&gt;[http://plaza.ufl.edu/duin/Xtra/AMAZONIA%201492.%20HECKENBERGER.htm Heckenberger, Michael J.; Kuikuro, Afukaka; Kuikuro, Urissapá Tabata; Russell, J. Christian; Schmidt, Morgan; Fausto, Carlos; and Franchetto, Bruna. "Amazonia 1492: Pristine Forest or Cultural Parkland?"] ''[[Science (journal)|Science.]]'' April 25, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Large plazas also exist at some of the towns throughout the region, some around {{convert|490|ft|m}} across.&lt;ref name="Heckenberger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Amazonia" /&gt;  Many of the communities at Kuhikugu were linked, with roads which bridged some rivers along their paths, and with canoe canals running alongside some of the roads.&lt;ref name="Amazonia" /&gt;  Fields of [[mandioca]] ([[cassava]]) may have existed around the communities at Kuhikugu, suggesting that the people there were farmers.&lt;ref name="Amazonia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heckenberger, Michael J. "Manioc Agriculture and Sedentism in Amazonia: The Upper Xingu Example." ''Antiquity.'' September 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dams and ponds which appear to have been constructed in the area also suggest that the inhabitants of Kuhikugu may have been involved with fish farming, which is still practised by some of their modern day Kuikuro descendants.

There is a possibility that legends regarding Kuhikugu may have influenced the British explorer Lieutenant Colonel [[Percy Fawcett]] to go on his ill-fated last expedition in 1925, looking through the Amazon rainforest for what he called "[[Lost City of Z|City Z]]".&lt;ref name="Grann" /&gt;

The 2013 Lagos Countdown was met with criticism from some participants as ticket distribution was held differently from the 2012 event, as tickets were not free and required that many participants purchase their own tickets via [[scalpers]] or to acquire tickets via Countdown sponsors.&lt;ref name=SR&gt;{{cite web|last1=OKULAJA|first1=AYO|title=How Lagos Countdown 2013 Was A Let Down|url=http://saharareporters.com/2014/01/11/how-lagos-countdown-2013-was-let-down|publisher=Sahara Reporters|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about this, the corporate affairs manager of LASAA responded that while tickets were not intended to have been sold, the different distribution tactics were enacted as a form of crowd control and to avoid potential issues due to overcrowded space.&lt;ref name=SR /&gt;

Lagos Countdown was renamed One Lagos Fiesta in 2015.

The '''Muscovite Civil War''', or '''Great Feudal War''', was a prolonged conflict that cast its shadow over the entire reign of [[Vasily II of Moscow]] (from 1425 to 1453). The two warring parties were [[Vasily II of Moscow|Vasily II]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Prince of Moscow]], as one party, and his uncle, [[Yury of Zvenigorod|Yury Dmitrievich]], the [[Principality of Zvenigorod|Prince of Zvenigorod]], and the sons of Yuri Dmitrievich, [[Vasily Kosoy]] and [[Dmitry Shemyaka]], as the other party. In the intermediate stage, the party of Yury conquered Moscow, but in the end, Vasily II regained his crown. It was the first civil war in the history of [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]], whose largely peaceful rise had been predicated on a lack of conflict within the ruling family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623786/Vasily-II|title=Vasily II|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=18 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] of 1236-1241 left the Russian principalities subjugated by the [[Golden Horde]].  In the 13th-15th centuries, the Khan of the Golden Horde appointed the Great Prince, who in the 14th century resided in Moscow.  In the 13th century the medieval Rus' consisted of a set of relatively small and weak principalities, fighting and making alliances against each other. The larger states (like the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the [[Novgorod Republic | Republic of Novgorod]]) progressively conquered or absorbed the smaller ones. One bigger principality, the Grand Duchy of Moscow, grew due to a series of clever policies and became the biggest one in central Rus'. In 1380 [[Dmitry Donskoy]], the prince of Moscow, even managed to fight the troops of Golden Horde in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] and win. Whereas formally Moscow remained dependent on the Horde, and the Khan needed to approve position of the Prince, the Grand Duchy of Moscow had become a major regional power, and the Moscow princes aimed to conquer the remaining lands around Moscow and to append them to their Grand Duchy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==First period (1425-1434)==
[[File:Kniazia i boyare.jpg|thumb|The Muscovite boyars pledge their support to the dethroned Vasily II]]

In 1389, Dmitry Donskoy died. He appointed his son [[Vasily I of Moscow|Vasily Dmitrievich]] as successor, with the provision that if Vasily were to die as an infant, his brother, [[Yury of Zvenigorod|Yury Dmitrievich]], would be the successor. Vasily died in 1425 and left a child, [[Vasily II of Moscow|Vasily Vasilyevich]], whom he appointed as the Grand Prince (known as Vasily II). This was against the existing rule, where the oldest living brother and not a son, should have received the crown. Yury thus became a pretender and moved from [[Zvenigorod]], his main residence, to [[Galich, Russia|Galich]], to be farther from Moscow. 

In 1428 Yury Dmitrievich formally conceded, under pressure from [[Photius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Photius]], who personally travelled to Galich. However, in 1431 Yury decided to seek the title of Prince of Moscow with the Khan of the Horde. The Khan ruled in favor of Vasily, and additionally ordered Yury to give Vasily the town of [[Dmitrov]], which he owned. The formal pretext to start a war was found in 1433, when during the marriage feast of Vasily his mother, [[Sophia of Lithuania]], insulted Vasily Yuryevich, the son of Yury, in public. Both sons of Yury, Vasily and Dmitry, left for Galich. They plundered [[Yaroslavl]], ruled by an allied of Vasily II, allied with their father, collected an army, and defeated the army of Vasily II. Subsequently, Yury Dmitrievich entered Moscow, declared himself the Great Prince, and sent Vasily II to [[Kolomna]]. Eventually, however, he did not prove himself as an efficient head of state, having alienated some Muscovites who fled to Kolomna, and even alienating his own sons. Eventually, Yury allied with Vasily II against the sons of Yury and returned the Moscow Princedom to Vasily II, who, in his turn, started to persecute former supporters of Yury. Vasily then sent an army against his cousins, sons of Yury, Vasily Yuryevich and Dmitry Shemyaka, in 1434. His army was defeated in a major battle, in which troops of Yury were fighting against Vasily. Vasily conquered Galich, and Yury openly joined his sons. The army of Vasily II was finally defeated close to [[Rostov]]. Yury became the Prince of Moscow again, but suddenly died, and his son, [[Vasily Kosoy|Vasily Yuryevich]], became his successor. At this point, Vasily II was in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and was preparing to travel to the Horde to leave a complaint with the Khan.&lt;ref name="solovyev"&gt;{{cite book|last=Соловьев |first=Сергей Михайлович|script-title=ru:История России с древнейших времен|url=http://magister.msk.ru/library/history/solov/solv04p2.htm|accessdate=December 20, 2011|volume=4|language=Russian|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second period (1434-1436)==
The brothers of Vasily Yuryevich — Dmitry Shemyaka and [[Dmitry Krasny]] — refused to lend him any support. Anticipating that Vasily would not be able to keep Moscow for long, they preferred to ally with Vasily II so that eventually they could get additional lands from him. Indeed, Vasily gave [[Rzhev]] and [[Uglich]] to Dmitry Shemyaka and [[Bezhetsk|Bezhetsky Verkh]] to Dmitry Krasny. Vasily Yuryevich was driven out of Moscow; he also lost [[Zvenigorod]] to Vasily II and was left landless, forced to flee to [[Novgorod]]. 

In 1435, Vasily managed to collect an army in [[Kostroma]] and moved in the direction of Moscow. He lost a battle on the bank of the [[Kotorosl River]] to Vasily II and fled to [[Kashin (town)|Kashin]]. He then managed to conquer [[Vologda]] and built up a new army with the support of [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]]. With this new army he moved again to the south and encountered Vasily II in Kostroma. The two armies were stationed on two banks of the [[Kostroma River]] and could not start fighting immediately. Before the fight started, the two cousins concluded a peace treaty. Vasily Yuryevich recognized Vasily II as the Great Prince and got [[Dmitrov]]. However, he only spent a month in Dmitrov and subsequently moved to Kostroma and further to Galich and to [[Veliky Ustyug]]. In Veliky Ustyug, the army formed in Vyatka, which had supported Yuri Dmitrievich for a long time, and joined Vasily. Vasily Yuryevich plundered Veliky Ustyug and with the army went south again. In early 1436, he lost a battle in [[Skoryatino]], close to Rostov, to Vasily II, and was captured. 

Subsequently, when the Vyatka people continued to attack the lands belonging to the Grand Prince, Vasily II ordered to have Vasily Yuryevich blinded. Vasily Yuryevich was known after that as Vasily Kosoy. He lived until 1448, but chronicles do not mention him between 1436 and 1448; apparently he was imprisoned all this time. At the same time Vasily II released Dmitry Shemyaka, who had been exiled to Kolomna, and concluded a treaty with him similar to the treaty he previously concluded with Vasily Kosoy, returning Shemyaka all his lands.&lt;ref name="solovyev"/&gt;

==Third period (1436-1453)==
[[File:Facial Chronicle - b.14, p. 119 - Blinding of Vasiliy II.jpg|thumb|The Blinding of Vasily II, a miniature from the [[Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible]]]]

In the early 1440s Vasily II was mostly busy with the wars against the [[Khanate of Kazan]]. The Khan, [[Ulugh Muhammad]], besieged Moscow in 1439. Dmitry Shemyaka, despite being under the oath of allegiance, failed to appear in support of Vasily. After the Tatars left, Vasily chased Shemyaka, forcing him to flee to Novgorod again. Subsequently, Shemyaka returned to Moscow and confirmed his allegiance. In 1444, Tatars led by [[Mustafa (Khan)|Mustafa]], the Khan of the [[Golden Horde]], plundered the Ryazan lands, before being defeated by a much larger army sent by Vasily. In 1445, Ulugh Muhammad conquered Nizhny Novgorod, was defeated in a skirmish near [[Murom]], but won the second battle in [[Suzdal]], capturing, among other prominent Muscovites, Vasily II.&lt;ref name="solovyev"/&gt;

Vasily was released after negotiations, having promised to pay an enormous [[ransom]]. This resulted in an increase of taxes and, consequently, in discontent, which strengthened the party of Dmitry Shemyaka. In early 1446, Vasily was captured by Shemyaka in the [[Trinity Sergius Lavra]], brought to Moscow, blinded, and then sent to [[Uglich]]. Shemyaka started to reign as the Prince of Moscow. In the fall of 1446 he traveled to Uglich to seek peace with Vasily. They made a deal, Vasily gave an oath of allegiance and promised not to seek the Great Princedom any more, and in return he was released and got [[Vologda]] in his possession. In Vologda, Vasily traveled to the [[Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery]], and the [[hegumen]] released him from the oath. Vasily immediately started preparations for the war against Shemyaka.

In addition, Shemyaka and his ally, Prince [[Ivan of Mozhaysk]], ruled inefficiently, did not manage to attract allies, and nobility started to defect from Moscow to Vologda. Vasily also managed to ally with Kazan Tatars. In the end of 1446, when Dmitry Shemyaka was out in [[Volokolamsk]], the army of Vasily II entered Moscow. Vasily then started to chase Shemyaka and Mozheysky, who had to retreat, with both armies ravaging and plundering the country. In 1447, they asked for peace, and agreed to accept the superiority of Vasily. Nevertheless, Dmitry Shemyaka continued resistance, trying to attract the allies and to collect a big enough army to fight against Vasily. In 1448, Vasily started military action, which included mostly Northern lands up to [[Veliky Ustyug]] and with some interruptions continued till 1452, when Shemyaka was finally defeated and fled to Novgorod. In 1453, he was poisoned there following a direct order of Vasily.&lt;ref name="solovyev"/&gt;

Subsequently, Vasily managed to remove all local princes who previously supported Shemyaka. In particular, Ivan Mozheysky had to flee with their family to [[Lithuania]], and the [[Principality of Mozhaysk]] was made a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Similarly, the [[Principality of Serpukhov]] was made a part of the Grand Duchy, and the [[Principality of Vereya]] remained after the war the only independent state in Moscow lands.&lt;ref name="solovyev"/&gt;

'''Operation Niki''' ({{lang-el|Επιχείρηση Νίκη}}), named after the goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], was a [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] [[airlift]] operation during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] that was carried out on 21/22 July 1974, with the aim of transporting a battalion of [[Greek people|Greek]] commandos from [[Chania International Airport|Souda]], [[Crete]] to [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]]. Upon their arrival, the aircraft were engaged in [[friendly fire]], which resulted in the loss of 33 men and the destruction of three aircraft.&lt;ref name="Mitsenas"&gt;Γεώργιος Δ. Μήτσαινας.

==Background==
Since the 1950s, Greece had established a foreign policy favoring the [[Enosis|union]] of Cyprus with Greece. In 1960, the Republic of Cyprus was established with [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]] being its two founding communities. [[Archbishop]] [[Makarios III|Makarios]] was elected as its first [[President of Cyprus|President]]. Makarios came to believe that unification of the island with Greece was not possible and pursued a policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]].

After a [[military coup]] in April 1967, a right-wing [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military junta]] seized power in [[Athens]]. The Greek juntists suspected Makarios for not being truly in favor of unification and prepared five plans to overthrow him between 1971 and 1974.&lt;ref name="Athanasopulos"&gt;Haralambos Athanasopulos. ''Greece, Turkey and the Aegean Sea: A Case Study in International Law'', McFarland &amp; Co, 2001. {{ISBN|0786409436}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QnlyjuKJa8YC&amp;dq=1974+cypriot+coup&amp;q=1967#v=onepage&amp;q=EOKA-B&amp;f=false p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, on 15 July 1974, a [[1974 Cypriot coup d'état|military coup d'état]] orchestrated by the [[Cypriot National Guard]] and the junta of Athens succeeded in deposing Makarios and replacing him with nationalist [[Nikos Sampson]]. On the pretext of a peacekeeping operation, [[Turkey]] took military action code-named [[Operation Atilla]] and [[Military operations during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded Cyprus]] on 20 July 1974.&lt;ref name="Constandinos"&gt;Andreas Constandinos. ''America, Britain and the Cyprus Crisis of 1974: Calculated Conspiracy or Foreign Policy Failure?'', AuthorHouse, 2009. {{ISBN|1438989067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations and departure==
The Greek leadership in Athens was largely taken by surprise. The political situation deteriorated rapidly due to the Turkish invasion and the junta was soon at the verge of total collapse. Despite an initial order for implementation, the existing military plans for the reinforcement of the defenses in Cyprus were cancelled. In a climate of confusion and indecision, it was eventually decided to send one commando battalion by air. An initial plan to airlift a battalion based in northern Greece from [[Thessaloniki Airport|Thessaloniki airport]] using requisitioned [[Boeing 720]] aircraft of [[Olympic Airways]] was cancelled.&lt;ref name="Vlassis"&gt;Σάββας Δ. Βλάσσης. ''Επιχείρηση Νίκη. Αερομεταφορά αντί αεραπόβασης'', Καταδρομή, καλοκαίρι 2007, [http://www.doureios.com/Books/NIKI.low.pdf σελ. 68-75], archived [http://www.webcitation.org/732VfPlEx here].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was decided to airlift another unit from [[Chania International Airport|Souda airport]], using almost the entire transport fleet of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] at the time. The unit chosen was the [[1st_Raider/Paratrooper_Brigade_(Greece)|Alpha Raider Squadron]] reinforced with men from the amphibious-capable Gamma Raider Squadron. Thus, in the late afternoon of July 21, a fleet of 20 [[Nord Noratlas|Noratlas]] and 10 [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] aircraft were relocated to Souda airport, base of the [[:el:115 Πτέρυγα Μάχης|115 Combat Wing]].&lt;ref name="Mitsenas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solanakis"/&gt;

According to orders, the transport aircraft would secretly take off at night with five minutes separation and fly without fighter escort. To avoid detection, they would fly at low altitudes below 200 ft in full radio silence with minimum lights and no visual contact between them. They would land in Nicosia, unload the force and take off immediately for the return to Greece under the cover of darkness. Each aircraft would carry four airmen (two pilots, a [[flight engineer]] and a [[Air navigation|navigator]]) and approximately 30 commandos with their weapons and ammunition.&lt;ref name="karkaletsis"&gt;Σ. Καρκαλέτσης. ''Αποστολή «Νίκη» 1974: Η επιχείρηση αυτοκτονίας της πολεμικής αεροπορίας στην Κύπρο'', Αεροπορική Ιστορία, [http://www.livepedia.gr/content-providers/periskopio/aeroporiki-istoria/3699X.pdf τ. 42, Αυγ. - Σεπ. 2006].&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that the 750 km flight to Cyprus would last around three hours. As a result, the latest time at which an aircraft could take off, fly to Cyprus, unload and depart before dawn was 24:00. The first plane departed Souda at around 22:35 and the departure plan was followed by the first five aircraft. Afterwards, several delays resulted in only thirteen Noratlas aircraft of the [[:el:354 Μοίρα Τακτικών Μεταφορών|354th Sqdn. "Pegasus"]] managing to take off before the midnight time limit. Two more aircraft, the second of which carried the unit's heavy weapons and ammunition but no troops, ignored orders and took off at 00:20 and 00.23.&lt;ref name="Solanakis"/&gt; These planes were numbered in the order of their departure, receiving codes ''Niki-1'' to ''Niki-15''. The remaining five Noratlases and all the C-47 did not take off.&lt;ref name="Vlassis"/&gt;

The Cypriot National Guard lacked an air force, hence Turkey had full air superiority over the island. [[Turkish Air Force]] had bombed Nicosia airport and only one third of the runway was usable.

Of the fifteen Noratlases that took off, thirteen made it to Cyprus and the remaining two landed on Crete and [[Rhodes Maritsa Airport|Rhodes]] due to mechanical problems. Upon arrival at [[Nicosia International Airport|Nicosia]] at around 02:00 AM, the aircraft were engaged by Greek Cypriot anti-aircraft gunners of the 195 MEA/AP battalion, who were uninformed about their arrival and mistook them for a Turkish airborne assault. As a result, the 4th Noratlas (''Niki-4'') received heavy fire and was shot down two miles short of the runway with the loss of four crew and twenty seven commandos. Two more commandos were killed and ten wounded on-board ''Niki-6'', which landed with both engines severely damaged.&lt;ref name="Mitsenas"/&gt; One more Noratlas aircraft (''Niki-3'') was badly damaged and could not take off again. Another aircraft (''Niki-12'') did not have sufficient fuel for the return flight. These aircraft were destroyed on the ground by Greek-Cypriot forces, following orders of the Hellenic Air Force Headquarters. The rationale for doing so was that Greece was not officially at war with Turkey, thus any evidence of Greek involvement in the operations in Cyprus should be erased. The remaining nine aircraft managed to return safely to Greece after unloading their troops.&lt;ref name="Mitsenas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solanakis"/&gt;

==Return of remains==
The remains of ''Niki-4'' and the bodies of most of the men it carried were hastily buried on a hill, which is now a military cemetery and war memorial known as [[Makedonitissa Tomb]]. In summer 2015, excavations started at Makedonitissa with the aim to recover any human remains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/06/cyprus-greek-military-plane-shot-down-1974-discovery-nicosia Cypriot officials say they may have found Greek aircraft shot down in 1974], The Guardian, 6/8/2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After 14 months, DNA identification of those on board was completed and the remains of sixteen Greek soldiers were handed over to their relatives in early October, 2016, 42 years after their death.&lt;ref name="kathimerini"&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/213013/interactive/ekathimerini/special-report/waiting-for-answers-for-42-years Waiting for answers for 42 years], Kathimerini, 18/10/2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Operation Niki has been characterized as suicidal.&lt;ref name="Solanakis"/&gt; It was ill-prepared and used unreliable, ageing aircraft that flew very low with nothing but a gyrocompass to guide them. Most aircraft crews and commandos were unfamiliar with the terrain at their destination. Ground forces at Nicosia had not been notified in time about their arrival. The operation had no tactical justification but merely a symbolic and morale-boosting character.&lt;ref name="Vlassis"/&gt; The rationale of an airlift instead of an [[airdrop]] operation has also been criticized.&lt;ref name="Vlassis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Solanakis"/&gt; Nevertheless, the transported Greek commando unit who was given the Greek Cypriot designation 35 Raider Squadron (35 MK), fought gallantly during the [[Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus#Second_Turkish_invasion.2C_14.E2.80.9316_August_1974|second Turkish invasion]] of August 1974 and contributed decisively to saving [[Nicosia]] from falling into Turkish hands. Ironically, the unit had no casualties in the battlefield. With the exception of the order to Lt Cdr [[Eleftherios Handrinos|E. Handrinos]] to turn back his vessel (L-172 ''Lesvos'') and disembark the [[Hellenic Force in Cyprus|ELDYK]] troops he had picked up the previous day, Operation Niki marked the only Greek attempt to reinforce the defense of Cyprus during the invasion. 

No military investigation was ever ordered regarding the circumstances of the tragic loss of Niki-4 and neither anyone was held responsible. The Greek junta collapsed on 23 July 1974, mainly because of the events in Cyprus.

'''The Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA)''' was one of the [[alphabet agencies]] of the [[New Deal]] established by the administration of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. Created on May 28, 1935, the PRRA's first directors included American journalist and politician [[Ernest Gruening]] and Puerto Rican educator and politician [[Carlos E. Chardón|Carlos Chardón]]. Falling under the authority of the [[Department of the Interior]] and the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA) its primary goals were to establish long term economic stability in [[Puerto Rico]] during the [[Great Depression]] through job creation, land distribution, public works projects, as well as environmental and health initiatives. The agency was officially liquidated on February 15, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History of Puerto Rico|last=Dietz|first=James|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United States Government Manual, 2011|last=Office of the Federal Register|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=not paginated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rico in the American Century: A History Since 1898|last=Ayala|first=Cesar|last2=Bernabe|first2=Rafael|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Chapel Hill|pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;small&gt;The Great Depression in Puerto Rico&lt;/small&gt; ==

=== Economic Background and Standard of Living ===

By time the [[Great Depression]] arrived in 1929, working class Puerto Rican citizens, especially rural agricultural laborers, were already facing economic hardship. After Spain ceded sovereignty of Puerto Rico to the United States following the 1898 [[Spanish–American War]] the island increasingly became economically dependent on the United States through an unbalanced colonial trade relationship that favored U.S. sugar, tobacco, coffee, and fruit companies. By 1910, four U.S. sugar corporations held near monopolies on sugar cane cultivation and sugar production had multiplied by 331%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz,|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=154–155.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rico in the American Century|last=Ayala|first=|last2=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=102.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1921, the United States Tobacco Trust also held monopolies on cigarette and cigar markets in Puerto Rico, giving them an economic advantage over small scale tobacco farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; While American companies expanded and profited, sugarcane and other agricultural workers saw little to no change in wages between 1898 and 1920 and Puerto Rican laborers generally experienced a poor standard of living. Malnutrition, poor sanitation, lack of sewage systems, and dangerous working and living conditions led to high mortality rates due to workplace accidents and diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, malaria, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Early Life Conditions and Rapid Demographic Changes in the Developing World|last=McEniry|first=Mary|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rican Politics and the New Deal|last=Mathews|first=Thomas|publisher=University of Florida Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Gainesville|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Deal for the Tropics|last=Rodriguez|first=Manuel|publisher=Markus Wiener|year=2011|isbn=|location=Princeton|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years immediately preceding the depression, negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico’s two primary exports, raw sugar and coffee, due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade. 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36% and by 1933 Puerto Rico’s per capita income dropped 30% (by comparison, unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8% reaching a height of 25% in 1933).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Deal for the Tropics|last=Rodriguez|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1510.|title=Graph of U.S. Unemployment Rate: 1930-1945|last=|first=|date=|website=American Social History Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average wages for employed agricultural workers in 1931 ranged from roughly 23 cents per day for children, 25 cents per day for women, 60 cents per day for men, a number that varied due to the seasonal nature of their employment. Since the majority of Puerto Rico’s arable land was reserved for export crops, 98% of Puerto Rican family income was spent on food and other necessities, which were imported from the United States and sold at inflated prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Deal for the Tropics|last=Rodriguez|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=96–98, 86, 139.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, agricultural exports to U.S. comprised 94.3% of total Puerto Rican exports and food accounted for roughly 33% of total imports by 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=119, 122, 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor Strikes and Social Unrest ===

High unemployment rates and low wages at the start of the Great Depression led to increased labor unrest in Puerto Rico, which alarmed American officials and business interests. Beginning in August 1933 and lasting through the next two years, numerous violent strikes broke out among roughly 16,000 workers in the textile, stevedore, tobacco, taxi, and sugar industries and boycotts were called against American petroleum and electric corporations. American officials were also alarmed by the radical labor organizing leadership of Puerto Rican nationalists [[Pedro Albizu Campos|Albizu Campos]] and Jose Enamorado Cuesta who also called for independence from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors combined with the economic fallout of the depression prompted the Roosevelt Administration to create relief, recovery and reconstruction policies specifically aimed at Puerto Rico.

== &lt;small&gt;Early New Deal Relief and Reconstruction Efforts&lt;/small&gt; ==

=== The Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration (PRERA) ===

The first New Deal agency created to improve conditions in Puerto Rico was the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration (PRERA) in 1933. The PRERA worked under the authority of the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) and through matching grants would provide direct relief funding and the creation of jobs through public works initiatives. Under its directors, the Roosevelt appointee [[James Bourne]], and the island’s governor, the American [[Robert H. Gore]], the PRERA received only $770,000 from the federal government due to oversights in application processes. By the fall of 1933, the PRERA was unable keep up with the flood of relief applications from Puerto Ricans, which totaled approximately 50,000 per month. Adding to the program’s relative ineffectiveness was the 1933 implementation of an agricultural tax under the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA). The tax was leveled on surplus crops and served to increase food prices for Puerto Rican families who were already at a financial breaking point. The PRERA’s primary successes came with its implementation of disease control measures, the building highway infrastructure, and in its distribution of food to needy families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plan Chardón ===

In 1934, recognizing a need for long term economic recovery and reform, a proposal was crafted by assistant secretary of agriculture, [[Rexford Tugwell|Rexford G. Tugwell]], University of Puerto Rico rector [[Carlos E. Chardón|Carlos Chardón]], and Puerto Rican Liberal Party senator [[Luis Muñoz Marín]]. Entitled Plan Chardón, it called for the restructuring and decolonization of the Puerto Rican economy through the government acquisition of private U.S. sugar company land and mills. The acreage and production sites were to be taken under a rarely enforced land tenure measure written into the 1900 [[Foraker Act]] and the 1917 [[Jones Act (Puerto Rico)|Jones Act]]. The 500-acre law, which stipulated that corporations operating in Puerto Rico were forbidden from owning more than 500 acres of land, was usually circumvented by proxy landownership and absenteeism. Under the proposed Chardón system the confiscated land would be redistributed to small-scale farmers and the landless who would in turn process sugar locally rather than ship it to the United States for refining. Other proposed projects included the creation of island-based fruit and vegetable canning and bottling facilities, and the promotion of island tourism and the cardboard manufacturing industries. The central intent of the plan was to break the monopolies of American corporations, diversify the economy, and to utilize available labor in the promotion of locally sourced industrial and agricultural development with the hope of raising the overall Puerto Rican standard of living. Plan Chardón was never officially enacted, as it did not receive the required approval of the U.S. secretary of agriculture. Further thwarting its implementation were questions of financing and the lobbying of U.S. sugar companies. Critics such as [[Pedro Albizu Campos|Albizu Campos]] claimed the plan and subsequent reconstruction efforts were not radical enough in that they still facilitated Puerto Rico’s political and economic cooperation with the United States. Campos also called for a change in the 500-acre law that would amend the land owning quota to 300 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=102, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rican Politics|last=Mathews|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5, 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rico: Freedom and Power in the Caribbean|last=Lewis|first=Gordon K.|publisher=MR Press|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;small&gt;The Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA)&lt;/small&gt; ==

=== Establishment ===

On May 28, 1935 the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) was created by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] under executive order 7057 and would operate under the authority of the Department of Interior and its secretary [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rican Politics|last=Mathews|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeled on Plan Chardón, the PRRA fell under the direction of American [[Ernest Gruening]] and [[Carlos E. Chardón|Carlos Chardón]]. Gruening and Chardón oversaw a large bureaucratic agency whose administrators consisted of young Puerto Rican New Deal liberals, many of whom would become integral actors, along with [[Luis Muñoz Marín]], in creating the pro-United States [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico]] (''Partido Popular Democratico'', or PPD) in 1938. With the $35 million in allotted federal funds it received in late 1935, the PRRA instituted a variety of initiatives that were mostly experimental in nature, but geared toward changing the Puerto Rican socioeconomic infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History of Puerto Rico|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Projects ===

In the early years of its existence, the PRRA’s projects included the creation of public housing and parks as well as the construction of a fully functional cement factory, which provided essential materials for the construction of hurricane proof buildings. In 1935 and 1936 it purchased the Ponce Electric Company and two large centrals (sugar processing factories) in [[Arroyo, Puerto Rico|Arroyo]] and [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico|Arecibo]]. Island wide, it established health clinics and parasite eradication programs for farm animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the PRRA built a model coffee farm and instituted reforestation and soil erosion projects in Puerto Rico’s rural regions. The PRRA also organized a Producer’s Association among small coffee and fruit farmers, which offered financial assistance and provided instruction in the use of new agricultural and marketing techniques. By 1936 the administration had employed between 50,000 and 60,000 Puerto Rican workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=154–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freedom and Power|last=Lewis|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most enduring program of the PRRA was its rural electrification program. The project facilitated the construction of seven hydroelectric dams and extended power lines and stations across the island, bringing affordable power to thousands of rural citizens for the first time in Puerto Rico’s history. In addition to providing power, the hydroelectric dams also provided crucial flood control, irrigation for crops, and improved the quality of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Deal in Puerto Rico: Public Works, Public Health, and the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, 1935-1955|last=Burrows|first=Geoff G.|publisher=CUNY Academic Works|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrification program also helped to create the infrastructure for the future urban industrialization efforts under [[Operation Bootstrap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition and Problems ===

Although another initial intention of Chardón-influenced PRRA was to seek enforcement of the 500-acre law and aid in land distribution among Puerto Rican citizens, the agency took no steps in this regard as it was not within its legal power to do so. Legal enforcement of the 500-acre law came with the Puerto Rican government’s 1940 victory in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case against the Robert Hermanos Company, which owned 12,000 acres on the island. This pivotal lawsuit upheld the validity of the 500-acre law and set the stage for subsequent land reform in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, the Land Authority of Puerto Rico was created under legislation entitled Law 26 of April 12, 1941. The Land Authority’s ''parcelas'' provision allowed for the allotment of one to three acres of land to many poor, rural landless workers. With Chardón as its head, by 1945 the organization had parceled out plots to 14,000 families and by 1959 the number of families with acreage reached 52,287.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=184–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rican New Deal policies also did little in the way in improving wages for the island’s workers. In 1940, the average per capita income for Puerto Rican workers remained roughly the same as per capita income from1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economic History|last=Dietz|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its inception other problems such as minor financial mismanagement, opposition from members of the U.S. Congress and sugar companies also plagued the PRRA, and it was also criticized by the Puerto Rican Republican-Socialist coalition for purported political and economic corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Century|last=Ayala|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rican Politics|last=Mathews|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=241, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years after its inception, statistics show that PRRA expenditures often benefitted business interests in the United States. By 1938, the program’s total funding had reached $57,953,189.00 an estimated 12 percent of which had been used to buy goods and supplies from the mainland. Additionally, approximately 80 cents per dollar spent by the administration was funneled back into the United States economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rican Politics|last=Mathews|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquidation ===

The PRRA was officially dismantled by an act of Congress (67 Stat 584, August 15, 1953) on February 15, 1955, but its actual demise began as early as the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The United States Government Manual, 2011|last=Office of the Federal Register|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=not paginated}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the administration received only $7 million in operating costs, just over half of its estimated budgetary requirements of $13 million and due to economic constraints, several of its initiatives were stalled. As a result, the insular government increasingly gained financial and administrative control over many of the PRRA’s projects. Particularly hard hit were educational, health, and sanitation facilities. By [[World War II]], Puerto Rico was forced to limit the services of or close numerous health care clinics, hospitals, and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puerto Rican Politics and the New Deal|last=Mathews|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rico’s location in the Caribbean and proximity to the United States, the Panama Canal, and Cuba made a place of strategic importance during World War II and the Cold War. Although the PRRA continued to receive aid from Washington, D.C. until 1955, most of its funding was directed toward the military fortification of the island rather than on its initial goal of economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Deal in Puerto Rico|last=Burrows|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freedom and Power|last=Lewis|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=155, 535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quentin Tarantino Film Festival''', or '''QT-Fest''', is a semi-annual film and multimedia event held by the [[Austin Film Society]] in [[Austin, Texas]] and attended by film director [[Quentin Tarantino]].  Most recently, the Alamo Drafthouse theater in downtown [[Austin, Texas]] has been the selected venue.  The event usually takes place for a few days, and Tarantino screens a selection of his favorite films using prints he owns.

Usually Tarantino programs films to a theme such as 1980s horror night or [[Poliziotteschi|Italian crime films]] of the 1970s. All films come from his private collection of prints and generally have influenced the creation of his own films. He uses the festival not only as a platform to show off his collection of rare film reels but also to promote forgotten genres, directors, actors or studios.

The festival has taken place six times, plus a "best of" featuring films shown in previous festivals. Tarantino introduces all the films himself, shows trailers for all kinds of films and discusses the films with attendees. He does not talk about himself or his movies during the festival, preventing journalists or fans from gaining information about current or future projects. However, as in the case of QT 5, he has used the festival to set the mood for coming projects or showcase some of the influences on his work.

==Lineup listings==

QT Fest started in 1997 at the Dobie Theater near the [[University of Texas]]. The event moved to the [[Alamo Drafthouse]] Downtown for QT3, where it remained until the site's closure in 2007.  After QT 5 in 2001, there was a hiatus before QT 6 in 2005.

Doležal, who maintains that she identifies as black, fueled a national debate in the United States about racial identity. Doležal's critics state that she has committed [[cultural appropriation]] and fraud; Doležal and her defenders state that her self-identification is genuine, even if not based on race or ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Dolezal in Center of Storm, Is Defiant, ‘I Identify as Black’|date=June 16, 2015|last1=Johnson|first1=Kirk|last2=Pérez-Peña|first2=Richard|last3=Eligon|first3=John|authorlink2=Richard Pérez-Peña|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/rachel-dolezal-nbc-today-show.html|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2015 television interview, Doležal publicly stated for the first time since the controversy began that she was born white but still identified as black.&lt;ref name="Time born white"/&gt;&lt;ref name="People born white"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Today born white"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the controversy, Doležal was dismissed from her position as an Instructor in [[Africana Studies]] at [[Eastern Washington University]] and removed by the Spokane City Council as Chair of the Police Ombudsman Commission over "a pattern of misconduct."&lt;ref name="theguardian-commission" /&gt; She subsequently published her memoir, [[In Full Color (memoir)|''In Full Color'']], where she defended her claims.&lt;ref name="Fonrouge" /&gt; [[Netflix]] has released a documentary on Doležal, ''[[The Rachel Divide]]'', which describes her history and self-identification, and examines the arguments of her and her critics.

Doležal was raised as a [[Pentecostal]].

Following the completion of high school, Doležal attended [[Belhaven University]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], receiving her bachelor's degree in 2000.

Her parents and brother said that when Doležal applied to Howard, because of her art work, the admissions office assumed she was black and awarded her a scholarship.

==Career==

===Art===

Doležal created a fountain sculpture installed in a downtown Spokane location in June 2005.

In a November 2, 2015 interview on ''[[The Real (TV series)|The Real]]'', Doležal publicly acknowledged for the first time since the controversy began that she was white. She said, "I acknowledge that I was biologically born white to white parents, but I identify as black".&lt;ref name="Time born white"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4096959/rachel-dolezal-white/|last1=Frizell|first1=Sam|title=Rachel Dolezal: I Was Born White|accessdate=November 2, 2015|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="People born white"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mercedes Lara|first1=Maria|title=Rachel Dolezal Admits She Was 'Biologically Born White' but Maintains That She Identifies as Black|url=http://www.people.com/article/rachel-dolezal-admits-white-the-real-show-video|magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=November 2, 2015|date=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Today born white"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Serico|first1=Chris|title=Former NAACP leader Rachel Dolezal: 'I was biologically born white'|url=http://www.today.com/news/former-naacp-leader-rachel-dolezal-i-was-biologically-born-white-t53636|accessdate=November 2, 2015|publisher=Today.com|date=November 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2017 interview with ''[[The Guardian]],'' Doležal said that she sees race as a social construct. At Howard, she was introduced to the theory that racial identity had been devised in colonial times as a method of control. She embraced this concept wholeheartedly after her divorce, and decided to "flee from feeling like I had to do things in a way that was acceptable to other people." Soon afterward, she began sunbathing to darken her skin, applying [[sunless tanning|bronzers]] to maintain the look. She also began wearing her hair in dreadlocks and weaves, and checked the box for "black" or "African American" on employment and medical history forms.&lt;ref name=grovel/&gt; According to her adoptive brother, Ezra, Rachel began changing her appearance as early as 2009, when she began using hair products that she'd seen Ezra's biological sister use. She began darkening her skin and perming her hair sometime around 2011. When Ezra moved in with Rachel in 2012, she told him that Spokane-area residents knew her as black, and warned him, "Don't blow my cover." Ezra believed that Rachel was essentially putting on "[[blackface]]" by changing her appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/rachel-dolezals-brother-says-she-warned-dont-blow-my-cover|title=Rachel Dolezal’s Brother Says She Warned: "Don’t Blow My Cover"|last=Nashrulla|first=Tasneem|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|date=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spokane's main newspaper ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' has called her "Spokane’s undisputed heavyweight champion of racial appropriation."&lt;ref name="spokesman17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/dec/01/shawn-vestal-rachel-dolezal-remains-unabashedly-ra/|title=Shawn Vestal: Rachel Dolezal remains unabashedly Rachel Dolezal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims about her father===

Her uncle Dan Doležal said that his niece first claimed that a black friend named Albert Wilkerson was her real father around 2012–13, saying that "it caused my brother quite a bit of pain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rachel-dolezal-older-brother-accused-child-molestation-article-1.2257560| title= Rachel Dolezal supporting victim who accused her brother of child molestation, suggests parents outed her as white in retaliation | first1= Nancy |last1=Dillon |first2=Larry |last2=McShane| work= New York Daily News| date= June 14, 2015| accessdate= June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doležal has in interviews referred to her father as her "stepfather",&lt;ref name="easterneronline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easterneronline.com/35006/eagle-life/a-life-to-be-heard/ |title= A Life to be Heard|work=easterneronline.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said her "black father" had fled the [[Deep South]] "because a white cop was hunting him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3125009/Rachel-Dolezal-lied-interview-claiming-father-black-fled-Deep-South-assaulting-police-officer-later-Marine-white-subordinates-tried-kill-three-times.html|title=Rachel Dolezal lied in interview claiming her father was black and fled Deep South |work=Mail Online | location=London|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doležal's mother said she has never met Albert Wilkerson and that Rachel Doležal does not have a stepfather.&lt;ref name=Selle2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3125009/Rachel-Dolezal-lied-interview-claiming-father-black-fled-Deep-South-assaulting-police-officer-later-Marine-white-subordinates-tried-kill-three-times.html |title=Rachel Dolezal and fictitious 'dad's Deep South exodus': Newly uncovered interview shows her claiming she had a black father who fled because a white cop was hunting him |last=Spargo |first=Chris |date=15 June 2015 |work=[[The Daily Mail (UK)|The Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 interview, Doležal said she was "punished by skin complexion" by her mother and "white stepfather", and compared this alleged punishment to the punishment suffered by black slaves.&lt;ref name=Selle2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="easterneronline" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/spokane-naacp-leaders-parents-shes-not-being-rational/|title=Spokane NAACP leader's parents: ‘She's not being rational'|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/naacp-leader-accused-of-pretending-to-be-black.html|title=NAACP Leader Accused of Pretending to Be Black |work=Daily Intelligencer|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother Ezra Doležal said the accusations of physical punishment were false.&lt;ref name="cnn-23"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/13/us/washington-rachel-dolezal-adopted-brother/|title=Rachel Dolezal's biracial appearance is "blackface," brother says | website=CNN.com|first1=Ray |last1=Sanchez |first2= Ben |last2=Brumfield|date=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to the controversy===

The revelations about Doležal's ancestry and her other claims provoked a range of reactions. Angela Schwendiman, a colleague of Doležal's at Eastern Washington University, expressed her belief that Doležal perceived herself as black internally, and that "she was only trying to match how she felt on the inside with her outside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Elisha |last=Fieldstadt |first2=Giselle |last2=Lamarre |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/embattled-naacp-president-rachel-dolezal-will-address-race-controversy-monday-n374986 |title=NAACP Chapter President Rachel Dolezal Plans to Address Race Controversy Monday |publisher=NBC News |date=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly Cedric Bradley, a colleague of hers at Spokane's NAACP, suggested it mattered little to him whether Doležal was actually black or not. What did matter to him was her proven track record in social justice work. "It's not about black and white," Bradley stated, "it's about what we can do for the community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inlander.com/Bloglander/archives/2015/06/11/media-firestorm-swirls-around-rachel-dolezal-the-local-naacp-president |title=Media firestorm swirls around Rachel Dolezal, the local NAACP president |last1=Walters |first1=Daniel |last2=Thomas |first2=Jake |date=June 11, 2015 |website=Inlander |access-date=May 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Priscilla Dass-Brailsford stated: "Because of a familiarity with black culture, she [may] regard herself as '[[transracial (identity)|transracial]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/experts-debunk-transracial-explain-rachel-dolezal-case/story?id=31802804|title=Why Some Experts Debunk 'Transracial' to Explain Rachel Dolezal Case|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Halford Fairchild]] said "Rachel Doležal is black because she identifies as black.  Her identity was authentic, as far as I could tell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/13/rachel-dolezal-african-american-naacp-spokane|title=Rachel Dolezal identifying as African American is highly unusual, experts say |first=Amanda |last=Holpuch |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Ann Morning also defended Doležal, saying: "We're getting more and more used to the idea that people's racial affiliation and identity and sense of belonging can change, or can vary, with different circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/06/12/nyu-professor-naacp-rachel-dolezal/|title=Some People Can Be Trans-Racial, Prof. Says Of NAACP Controversy « CBS New York|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist Krissah Thompson described her behavior as "[[white guilt]] played to its end". Thompson discussed the issue with psychologist [[Derald Wing Sue]], an expert on racial identity, who suggested that Doležal had become so fascinated by racism and racial justice issues that she "over-identified" with black people.&lt;ref name="Krissah Thompson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Krissah|date=14 June 2015|title=Rachel Dolezal: What the rights activist's story says about being white in modern America|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rachel-dolezal-what-the-rights-activists-story-says-about-being-white-in-modern-america-10318082.html|website=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender studies scholar Samantha Allen said, "Rachel Doležal seems determined to appropriate not just blackness but the rhetoric of transgender identity as well" and called the analogy "spurious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/16/dolezal-s-damaging-transracial-game.html|title=Dolezal's Damaging ‘Transracial' Game|work=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Washington Post'' journalist [[Jonathan Capehart]] suggested, "[[blackface]] remains highly racist, no matter how down with the cause a white person is."&lt;ref name=Capehart-13-6-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Capehart|first1=Jonathan|title=The damage Rachel Dolezal has done|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/06/12/the-damage-rachel-dolezal-has-done/|accessdate=June 13, 2015|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=June 12, 2015|quote=Blackface remains highly racist, no matter how down with the cause a white person is.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her adopted brother Ezra Doležal also compared his sister's behavior to blackface and said "she's basically creating more racism".&lt;ref name="Moyer-13-6-2015" /&gt;

On June 16, 2015, [[Touré (journalist)|Touré Neblett]], a commentator for [[MSNBC]], said on the TV program ''[[The Cycle (TV program)|The Cycle]]'': "When I did my book about blackness, I talked to a hundred folks, academics, all sorts of people and the one thing that binds black people is the experience of racism. There's not a cultural thing that binds all of us but the experience of racism. From systemic, stereotypical microaggressions, whatever it is, and, no, she has not experienced anti-black racism and with the Howard suit, she sues Howard because she doesn't get a job because she's a white woman, you see that she wants to have it both ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Neblett |first=Touré |date=June 16, 2015 |title=Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html |newspaper=[[MSNBC]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |accessdate=June 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introducing the category of "cisracial" has been suggested by former MSNBC commentator [[Melissa Harris-Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Melissa Harris-Perry: Can Someone Be Cis-Black or Trans-Black?|url = http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/melissa-harris-perry-can-someone-be-cis-black-or-trans-black|website = CNS News|accessdate = November 26, 2015|date = June 15, 2015|publisher = Melanie Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term cisgender was introduced by [[Volkmar Sigusch]]: ''Transsexueller Wunsch und zissexuelle Abwehr.'' In: ''Psyche – Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse.'' Heft 49, 1995. S. 811–837.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Bow, an expert on racial relations, criticized Doležal for "taking the place of faculty of color by allowing her colleagues to assume that she's black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/06/15/academics-weigh-curious-case-rachel-dolezal|title=Academics weigh in on the curious case of Rachel Dolezal – InsideHigherEd|work=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition calling for Doležal to resign her position in the NAACP was launched by Kitara McClure, the former multicultural director at Spokane Community College and a member of the NAACP. McClure said "you cannot lead without honesty", and that "for the local and the national NAACP to say they stand behind her is appalling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jun/14/spokane-officials-investigating-rachel-dolezals/|title=Spokane officials investigating Rachel Dolezal's behavior on ombudsman panel – Spokesman.com – June 14, 2015|work=Spokesman.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case made international news.  German ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' referred to Doležal reverting to a classical passing scheme, as in [[passing novel]] examples like ''[[The Human Stain]]'' (2000), and mentioned [[Norman Mailer]]'s 1957 essay "[[The White Negro]]" and historical cases like [[Grey Owl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Rachel Dolezal: "Falsche Schwarze" fasziniert die USA|url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/panorama/der-fall-rachel-dolezal-die-weisse-die-schwarz-sein-wollte-1.2519758|newspaper = sueddeutsche.de|access-date = November 26, 2015|issn = 0174-4917|language = de|first = Jannis|last = Brühl|date = June 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review of Allyson Hobbs' ''A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life'' tried to put the case in a wider and historical perspective on passing as well''.''&lt;ref&gt;Romano, R.

==== Response by Doležal ====

Dolezal issued a statement on June 15, 2015, in which she said she believes that "challenging the construct of race is at the core of evolving human consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2015/06/15/naacp-meeting-rachel-dolezal/|title=Rachel Dolezal Resigns As NAACP Leader Amid Controversy |publisher=CBS Seattle|website=Seattle.CBSlocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day Dolezal told ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' host [[Matt Lauer]] she was first described as "[[transracial (identity)|transracial]]" and "biracial" in articles about her human rights work, and chose not to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rachel-dolezal-breaks-her-silence-i-identify-black|title=Rachel Dolezal: Yes, I am black|date=June 16, 2015|first1=Benjamin |last1=Landy |first2= Joy Y. |last2=Wang|work=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, she defended against allegations of having put on blackface by claiming the way she presented herself was "not some freak, ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', mockery blackface performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.today.com/news/rachel-dolezal-speaks-today-show-matt-lauer-after-naacp-resignation-t26371 |title=Rachel Dolezal breaks her silence on TODAY: 'I identify as black' |last1=Kim |first1=Eun Kyung |date=June 16, 2015 |website=Today News |access-date=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolezal later clarified that she has never claimed to be "transracial", a term associated mainly with [[transracial adoption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/17/rachel-dolezal-draws-ire-of-transracial-adoptees/|title=Rachel Dolezal draws ire of transracial adoptees|first=Justin Wm. |last=Moyer|date=June 17, 2015|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of discrimination and hate crimes===
====Lawsuit against Howard University====

In 2002, Doležal unsuccessfully sued [[Howard University]] for discrimination based on "race, pregnancy, family responsibilities and gender, as well as retaliation".

In July 2010, Doležal resigned from Human Rights Education Institute in Kootenai County, and stated to [[KREM (TV)|KREM 2 News]] that "she had been the target of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.11alive.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/06/11/spokane-naacp-president-questions/71101474/|title='Black' NAACP leader outed as white woman|date=June 11, 2015|work=11Alive|publisher=KREM|location=Spokane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Doležal stated on September 29, 2009, to [[KXLY-TV|KXLY]] that a noose had been left on her porch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kxly.com/news/Human-Rights-Advocate-Finds-Noose-On-Porch/719734|title=Human Rights Advocate Finds Noose On Porch|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015|publisher=[[KXLY-TV|KXLY]]|quote=A local human rights advocate says she's become a target of racism after she recently woke up to find a noose on her front porch.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kxly33512308"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/questions-raised-about-naacp-hate-mail-report/33512308|title=Questions raised about NAACP hate mail report|last=Humphrey|first=Jeff|date=June 10, 2015|publisher=[[KXLY-TV|KXLY]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.11alive.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/06/11/spokane-naacp-president-questions/71101474/|title='Black' NAACP leader outed as white woman|author=|date=June 12, 2015|newspaper=[[WXIA-TV|11Alive]]|accessdate=June 12, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2015/dgreenfield/naacp-leader-exposed-as-white-after-faking-hate-crime/|title=NAACP Leader Exposed as White After Faking Hate Crime|last=Greenfield|first=Daniel|date=June 12, 2015|newspaper=[[FrontPage Magazine]]|accessdate=June 12, 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/Dolezal-disappointed-hate-crime-reports-didn-t-lead-to-arrests/33516438|title=Dolezal disappointed hate crime reports didn't lead to arrests|author=|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 12, 2015|publisher=[[KXLY-TV|KXLY]]|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doležal's biography on Eastern Washington University's website states that while living in Idaho "at least eight documented hate crimes targeted (Rachel) Dolezal and her children".&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/06/12/rachel-dolezal-jackson-naacp-belhaven/71129550/|title=Woman accused of lying about race has Miss. ties|last=Royals|first=Kate|work=[[The Clarion-Ledger]]|quote=Rachel has reportedly made several reports of harassment and other crimes to police in Idaho and Washington, including that she received a hate mail package at her NAACP post office box and a swastika was placed on the door of the Human Rights Education Institute, where she previously worked, the newspaper reported.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doležal's mother said she was contacted by the media in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where Rachel lived for seven years. "Law enforcement is conducting an investigation of claims Rachel has made about hate crime threats and in that process of the investigation, the question of 'What is your true ethnicity?' came up, and we were contacted and agreed to speak to the press," Ruthanne said. "It is a sad situation, but the truth is best for everyone."&lt;ref name="CL" /&gt; The subsequent police investigation did not support Doležal's allegation.&lt;ref name="krem-2015" /&gt; Detectives said the envelope that contained the alleged threats had no postage stamps, barcodes or any other indication of having been handled by the postal service.&lt;ref name="kxly33512308" /&gt; The postal inspector said "the only way this letter could have ended up in this P.O. box would be if it was placed there by someone with a key to that box or a USPS employee."&lt;ref name="kxly33512308" /&gt;

Kurt Neumaier, a former member of the oversight board of the Human Rights Education Institute, said he had suspicions about Doležal and that he was concerned that the decision to hire her was done without proper vetting and checking into claims about her background. He said he was suspicious of several incidents Doležal alleged, including her alleged discovery of a swastika on the door of the Human Rights Education Institute when the security camera was "mysteriously turned off."&lt;ref name="spokesman1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jun/12/naacp-presidents-claims-about-background-disputed/|title=Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal’s claims about background disputed|last1=|first1=|date=June 12, 2015|publisher=''Spokesman''|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neumaier concludes that in every incident Doležal has alleged, "she was the sole witness to events that, when put under scrutiny, don't hold up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/rachel_dolezal_claims_to_be_the_target_of_hate_crimes_the_former_naacp_official.2.html|title=Rachel Dolezal claims to be the target of hate crimes: The former NAACP official’s most disturbing statements are about her victimization|work=Slate Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; English journalist [[Dominic Lawson]] has ranked Doležal as "the most spectacular example of the growing phenomenon of people posing as victims", which he says is a "consequence of a culture which portrays victimhood as a form of moral superiority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3123995/DOMINIC-LAWSON-truth-black-white-today-victimhood-s-seen-morally-superior.html|title=The truth in black and white: today, victimhood's seen as morally superior|last1=Lawson|first1=Dominic|date=June 14, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|publisher=''Daily Mail''|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published memoir==
In April 2016, Doležal announced on the ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' that she was writing a book on her racial identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2016/04/12/you-won-t-believe-why-rachel-dolezal-is-writing-a-book.html|title=You Won't Believe Why Rachel Dolezal Is Writing a Book|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/04/12/rachel-dolezal-book-today-show/|title=Rachel Dolezal announces new book on racial identity|date=April 12, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; This memoir, called ''[[In Full Color (memoir)|In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World]]'', was released by [[BenBella Books]] in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-dolezal-book-cover-20161031-story.html|title=What do you think of Rachel Dolezal's book cover?|first=Michael|last=Schaub|work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doležal said 30 publishing houses turned her down before she found a smaller publishing company willing to print it.&lt;ref name=grovel/&gt; In the book, Doležal compares her own experiences to [[slavery]].&lt;ref name="Fonrouge"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fonrouge |first=Gabrielle |url=https://nypost.com/2017/03/23/rachel-dolezal-explores-her-blackness-in-bizarre-memoir/ |title=Rachel Dolezal explores her ‘blackness’ in bizarre memoir |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2017-03-23 |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentary ==
''[[The Rachel Divide]]'' is a documentary chronicling the 2015 racial controversy surrounding Doležal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0115269/|title=Laura Brownson|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by Laura Brownson and distributed by Netflix. It first aired on April 28, 2018.

The documentary explores what led up to Doležal's fall from grace, the circumstances surrounding it, and the aftermath of the scandal and follows her life with her two children. In the course of the film, she talks of how she is forced to stay at home due to her negative public persona.

The documentary received mixed reviews. [[Vogue Magazine|''Vogue'']] gave the filmmaker credit for "balanced treatment of her deeply problematic subject matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/rachel-dolezal-netflix-documentary-the-rachel-divide-laura-brownson|title=How Do You Solve a Problem Like Rachel Dolezal?|work=Vogue|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The New Yorker]]'' noted the film's portrait of family dynamics. "Eventually, Brownson locates the real story: a primitive power game between mother and child, one that forecasts calamity. And it is in this mode that ''The Rachel Divide'' becomes a disturbing and enthralling drama of the American family, the pain of its truths and its fictions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-rachel-divide-review-a-disturbing-portrait-of-dolezals-racial-fraudulence|title=“The Rachel Divide” Review: A Disturbing Portrait of Dolezal’s Racial Fraudulence|last=Félix|first=Doreen St|date=2018-04-26|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welfare fraud charges===
In May 2018, Doležal was charged with perjury, felony [[theft]] and [[welfare fraud]] by the [[Washington State Department of Social and Health Services]].  The charges were filed after it was revealed she had received $8,847 in food and childcare assistance between August 2015 and December 2017 during a time period when she had been receiving tens of thousands of dollars in unreported income after claiming with the state that her income was less than $500 per month.  State investigators discovered that after her book was published, around $83,924 had been deposited into her bank account in monthly installments between August 2015 and September 2017.  According to the Spokane County prosecutors office, Doležal could receive a sentence of up to 15 years in prison if found guilty and could be ordered to pay full monetary restitution for the assistance she received.&lt;ref name="khq1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sacbee1" /&gt;{{dl|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name="USATodayfraud"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/05/25/rachel-dolezal-who-posed-black-woman-accused-welfare-fraud/643773002/ |title=Rachel Dolezal, former NAACP leader who posed as a black woman, accused of welfare fraud |last=May |first=Ashley |date=2018-05-25 |website=usatoday.com |access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon fraud"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/05/25/rachel-dolezal-faces-up-to-15-years-in-prison-if-convicted-of-felony-charges-for-welfare-fraud/ |title=Rachel Dolezal faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of felony charges for welfare fraud Dolezal, who changed her name to Nkechi Diallo, is accused of being overpaid a total of $8,847 from social services |last=Leah |first=Rachel |date=2018-05-25 |access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolezal has pleaded not guilty to the charges.&lt;ref name="USAToday booking"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/07/03/rachel-dolezal-booked-and-released-jail-welfare-charges/754042002/ |title=Rachel Dolezal booked and released from jail for welfare charges |last=Spokane, Wash |first=KREM-TV,  |date=2018-07-03 |website=usatoday.com |access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the '''Sadie Hawkins Dance''' is a usually informal [[Dance party|dance]] sponsored by a [[high school]], [[middle school]] or [[college]], in which female students invite male students.&lt;ref name=About.com&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Casey|title=The History of Sadie Hawkins Dances|url=http://prom.about.com/od/introtopromsformaldance/p/sadiehistory.htm|accessdate=27 January 2015|agency=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrary to the custom of male students typically inviting female students to school dances such as [[prom]] in the spring and [[Homecoming (tradition)|homecoming]] in the fall.

{{POV check|section|date=November 2018}}

== History ==
The Sadie Hawkins dance is named after the ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' [[comic strip]] character Sadie Hawkins, created by [[cartoonist]] [[Al Capp]].&lt;ref name=About.com /&gt; In the strip, [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] fell on a given day in November (Capp never specified an exact date). The unmarried women of Dogpatch got to chase the bachelors and "marry up" with the ones that they caught.&lt;ref name=About.com /&gt; The event was introduced in a daily strip which ran on November 15, 1937. Unlike traditional dances, where the men chase the women, this empowers {{tone inline|date=November 2018}} women to chase after what they want and not just wait for it to walk their way.

In the U.S. and Canada, this concept was popularized by establishing dance events to which the woman invited a man of her choosing, instead of demurely {{tone inline|date =November 2018}} waiting for a man to ask her. The first known such event was held on November 9, 1938.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}|Within a year, hundreds of similar events followed suit. By 1952, the event was reportedly celebrated at 40,000 known venues.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It became a woman-empowering rite {{tone inline|date=November 2018}} at high school and college campuses, and the tradition continues in some regional American cultures.

== Similar dance events ==
Similar dances, sometimes called [[Spinster]]s' Balls, have been organized for adults. The custom of holding Spinsters' Balls has spread outside the U.S., and exists in countries such as Australia. If held during the winter months, the Sadie Hawkins dance may be called the Snow Ball or some other wintry name. In a variation on pure Sadie Hawkins custom, a particular song may be designated a snowball dance by the [[DJ]] or master of ceremonies.

In that case, also known as "speed dancing" (because of its similarities to [[speed dating]]), the DJ picks two people to start dancing, usually to a slow dance. Periodically the DJ will shout, "snowball," signaling that the dancers must find new partners, thus increasing the number of partners on the floor. Half of the people asking new dancers to come to the floor will be girls asking boys, Sadie Hawkins-style. By the end of the song, most of the people at the dance are on the dance floor. The "snowball dance" is typically used to get the dancing started, as school dances can be notoriously slow to start. In some areas, people chosen to dance cannot refuse, thereby ensuring people get onto the dance floor, and thus the "snowball" gains momentum and grows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2676">{{Economic Waves}}
In the [[economics]] of [[demography]], the term '''spending wave''' refers to the economic effect of departure of children from the home. When a society experiences a high level of such family change then an economic decline follows from reduced spending overall.

==Example==
For example, in U.S. contemporary economics,  [[Harry Dent]], a [[University of South Carolina]] and [[Harvard Business School]] graduate and Fortune 100 consultant, has popularized the [[baby-boomer]] ''spending wave'' theory.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeremy J. (21 June 2002). Stocks for the Long Run : The Definitive Guide to Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies, 3rd, New York: McGraw-Hill, 388. {{ISBN|978-0-07-137048-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dent,&lt;ref&gt;Harry S. Dent Jr., The Next Great Bubble Boom: How to Profit from the Greatest Boom in History, 2004, Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0-7432-2299-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stock-market decline of 2008 was a result of [[baby boomer]]s aging past their peak spending years. This prediction was based on the observation that [[consumer spending]] peaks near age 50. In 2002 Dan Arnold echoed this theory in his book ''[[The Great Bust Ahead]],'' with the big spenders being 45- to 54-year-olds, and their numbers peaking in 2011–2012.

Other authors, such as Schieber and Shoven,&lt;ref&gt;Schieber, Sylvester J. and Shoven, John B., "The Consequences of Population Aging on Private Pension Fund Saving and Asset Markets" . Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=226964&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the gradual peaking of the social security trust fund in the United States will occur around the 2007–2009 time period.

Some experts&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/ousivMolt/idUSN3131412220080131 Economy faces bigger bust without Boomers, Reuters, 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; expect the worst consumer recession, since 1980, to occur when aging boomers start retiring, adding to rising unemployment, [[United States housing market correction|decline in house values]], and declining stock prices. However other experts have suggested that [[Immigration to the United States|immigration to the US]] and the rise of emerging economies will offset the baby boomer [[demographic]] impact.  Still other experts have postulated that, due to the 2008 major stock market decline and home equity crash, many baby boomers will have lost so much equity that they will retire at a later age than was previously planned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9337">'''Taste Festivals''' is a company which runs a series of [[food festival]]s around the world. As of 2012, these have taken place in fifteen cities. The events typically have the prefix "Taste of", although the company joined forces with [[celebrity chef]] [[Jamie Oliver]] to organise The Big Feastival for the first time in 2011. The events are typically attended by restaurants who operate mini-kitchens, these include [[Michelin star]]red restaurants.

==Description==
The events run by Taste Festivals feature mini-kitchens from different restaurants, along with live demonstrations from chefs. The events have their own currency called "crowns" which are used to purchase food from the restaurant's kitchens.&lt;ref name=loves&gt;{{cite news|title=Caterer loves...

==History==
Taste Festivals launched in 2004 with the first Taste of London, which took place at [[Somerset House]].&lt;ref name=esquire&gt;{{cite news|title=The To Do List: Taste of London|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/2012/06/the-festival-taste-of-london/|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Esquire}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London event was moved to [[Regent's Park]] in 2005, where it has remained since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AVA strawberries target top-end market|url=http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Business-Support/AVA-strawberries-target-top-end-market|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Morning Advertiser|date=7 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bestshow2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Ford|first=Richard|title=Best show gong for Taste of London|url=http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/people/best-show-gong-for-taste-of-london/227997.article|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=The Grocer|date=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was named Best Consumer Show at the 2012 Exhibition News Awards.&lt;ref name=bestshow2012/&gt; A second London based event runs later in the year, entitled Taste of Christmas. It runs on similar principles to the main Taste of London event, although it is instead hosted at the [[ExCeL Centre]].As of 2016, Taste of Christmas is held at Tobacco Docks, London.&lt;ref name=christmas&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Richard|title=London Chefs Set for Christmas -- With Chocolate: Richard Vines|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aDq4zB_eaUqc|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taste of Edinburgh was first run in 2007, initially at [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]], but after two years moved to [[Inverleith Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taste of Edinburgh food festival forced to find a new home|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/taste-of-edinburgh-food-festival-forced-to-find-a-new-home-1-756235|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Scotsman|date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the festival was called off at late notice following high levels of rainfall in the days prior to the event making the site unsafe for the expected number of visitors.&lt;ref name=calledoff&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Jim|title=Taste of Edinburgh festival called off after flooded site deemed unsafe|url=http://local.stv.tv/edinburgh/109818-taste-of-edinburgh-festival-called-off-after-flooded-site-deemed-unsafe/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=STV|date=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the plans were to continue with the event despite the weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piper|first=Laura|title=Brolly up and wellies on for a Taste-tastic time|url=http://local.stv.tv/edinburgh/going-out/articles/109545-taste-tastic-line-up-promises-foodie-fun-with-extra-flavour/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=STV|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, there have been Taste festivals held in fifteen cities around the world, the exhibitors at the 2012 Taste of London held a combined 11 Michelin stars.&lt;ref name=esquire /&gt;

The events were expanded to Africa in 2006 with Taste of Joburg,&lt;ref name=joburg&gt;{{cite news|last=Mkwanazi|first=Sibusiso|title=Tasting Joburg|url=http://www.citizen.co.za/citizen/content/en/citizen/lifestyle-features?oid=226067&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=146826&amp;Tasting-Joburg|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=The Citizen|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded in 2008 to add a second South African event with Taste of Cape Town,&lt;ref name=cape&gt;{{cite news|title=Taste of Cape Town|url=http://food.iafrica.com/news/food_news/2303841.htm|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=iafrica.com|date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Taste festivals were acquired by [[IMG (company)|IMG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://img.com/news/news/2013/february/img-acquires-taste-festivals-from-brand-events.aspx IMG ACQUIRES TASTE FESTIVALS FROM BRAND EVENTS]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Big Feastival===
Taste Festivals began running the [[Jamie Oliver]] backed Big Feastival in 2011, a combination event featuring both restaurants and musical artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Luker|first=Sara|title=Food festival featuring Jamie Oliver and Alex James hires House PR|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1139207/food-festival-featuring-jamie-oliver-alex-james-hires-house-pr/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=PR Week|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial plan was to host the event in [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]] during 2012 to coincide with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], however due to branding restrictions this plan was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ridley|first=Louise|title=Exclusive: Jamie Oliver Olympic Feastival plans scrapped|url=http://www.eventmagazine.co.uk/news/1128967/Exclusive-Jamie-Oliver-Olympic-Feastival-plans-scrapped/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Event|date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event instead was arranged to take place at the farm of musician [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] in Oxfordshire, who had previously hosted a similar festival in 2011 which resulted in the event's organisers going out of business due to the losses involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alex James and Jamie Oliver to host music and food festival|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-17728055|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tell Magazine''''' is a weekly magazine published in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellng.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=72&amp;Itemid=128&amp;limitstart=1|title=About Us - The Company|work=Tell Magazine|accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[BBC News]] described it as "one of Nigeria's most respected business magazines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6445125.stm|title=Firms struggle in crumbling Nigeria |author= |date=19 March 2007 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
''Tell'' magazine published its first edition on 15 April 1991. All five of the founding editors had worked at ''[[Newswatch (Nigeria)|Newswatch]]'', where they learned to create in-depth, investigative feature stories. They left that magazine due to low pay and disagreements with senior management, hoping that the new magazine would be more fulfilling. Although the magazine's founders had high ambitions, they were not initially hostile to the government. However, they were determined to be free of government or political influence.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

==Babangida era==
The magazine questioned whether General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] was sincere in saying he would hand over to a civilian government. 
The 2 May 1993 edition with headline "Transition: 21 Traps against handover" was seized, and had to be reprinted in tabloid format. Two more major seizures occurred before Babangida was forced from power in August 1993.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;
In all, 500,000 copies were seized in the last four months of Babangida's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=Africa World Press |year=1997|ISBN=0-86543-551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tell's circulation rose to as many as 100,000 copies each week in the build-up to the June 1993 presidential election and in the subsequent confusion.
Facing harassment from security forces, the magazine began printing underground in July 1993.
On 15 August 1993 police raided the offices and arrested editor-in-chief [[Nosa Igiebor (journalist)|Nosa Igiebor]] and editors Kola Ilori, Onome Osifo-Whiskey and  Ayodele Akinkuoto. holding them for 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abacha era==
Conditions became more difficult after General [[Sani Abacha]] took power in November 1993.
On 2 January 1994 armed policemen and security officers seized 50,000 copies of the magazine at the printer's premises. The issue was titled "The Return of Tyranny - Abacha bares his fangs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The editors resorted to guerrilla tactics to survive, forming cells and frequently moving, with the magazine printed covertly in different locations. They relied on help from civilians, who supported the magazine by providing office space, buying copies and helping in many other ways.&lt;ref name=Olukotun2004/&gt;

After the newspaper published a story that revealed that Abacha was suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, police and military raided Igiebor's house while he was away. His wife was maltreated when she said she did not know where he was. A soldier pointed a gun at his four-year-old daughter, threatening to shoot if Igiebor was not produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=The Futility of the Land Use |year=2002

Igiebor was jailed for six months from late 1995 to 1996, and later fled abroad to escape the threat of assassination.

[[File:WW2 Marine after Eniwetok assault.jpg|thumb|upright|An exhausted [[U.S. Marine]] exhibits the thousand-yard stare after two days of constant fighting at the [[Battle of Eniwetok]], February 1944.]]

The '''thousand-yard stare''' or '''two-thousand-yard stare''' is a phrase often used to describe the blank, unfocused gaze of [[soldier]]s who have become emotionally [[dissociation (psychology)|detached]] from the horrors around them. It is also sometimes used more generally to describe the look of dissociation among victims of other types of trauma.

==Origin==
The phrase was popularized after [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] published the painting ''Marines Call It That 2,000 Yard Stare'' by [[World War II]] artist and correspondent [[Thomas C. Lea, III|Tom Lea]],&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' magazine, 6/11/1945, p. 65.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=_EkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=%22tom%20lea%22&amp;as_pt=MAGAZINES&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=%22tom%20lea%22&amp;f=false link]&lt;/ref&gt; although the painting was not referred to with that title in the 1945 magazine article. The painting, a 1944 portrait of a nameless [[US Marine Corps|Marine]] at the [[Battle of Peleliu]], is now held by the [[United States Army Center of Military History]] in [[Fort Lesley J. McNair]], Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, James, and Tom Lea (illustration), (1975). -  [http://www.milhist.net/global/2000yard.html "Two-Thousand-Yard Stare"]. - ''WW II''. - (c/o Military History Network). - Grosset and Dunlap. - pp.113,116. - {{ISBN|0-448-11896-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the real-life Marine who was his subject, Lea said:

{{quote|He left the States 31 months ago. He was wounded in his first campaign. He has had [[tropical disease]]s. He half-sleeps at night and gouges [[Jap]]s out of holes all day.

When recounting his arrival in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam in 1965]], then-Corporal Joe Houle (director of the Marine Corps Museum of the Carolinas in 2002) said he saw no emotion in the eyes of his new squad: "The look in their eyes was like the life was sucked out of them," later learning that the term for their condition was ''the 1,000-yard stare''. "After I lost my first friend, I felt it was best to be detached," he explained.&lt;ref name=Houle&gt;{{cite news |title=Retired Sgt. Maj.
