The '''Bafour''' or '''Bafur''' are a group of people inhabiting [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. Their origins lie in various [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Bafour"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aZzrVgu2CwQC&amp;pg=PA952&amp;dq=Bafours+were+black+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K5qJT6XNBMmS0QWz7IDRCQ&amp;ved=0CGIQuwUwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mwalimu, Charles, ''The Golden Book: Philosophy of Law for Africa Creating the National State''], p 952&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources say this is a loose term to encompass the pre-[[Sanhaja]] peoples, who were "part [[Berber people|Berber]], part [[Negroid|Negro]], and part [[Semitic people|Semite]]."&lt;ref name="idaw"/&gt; Others say they occupied these territories in the 15th century and, before the end of the 17th century, were assimilated by various groups, including the [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Berber people|Berber]] and [[Fula people|Fula]].

==History==
The Bafour may have been a settled people at the time of the [[Neolithic Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pazzanita|first=Anthony G|title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|edition=3rd revised|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5596-0|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their oral tradition, they lived in the Western Sahara and gradually migrated southward.  Charles Mwalimu describes them as "African black Agriculturalists...subsequently replaced by the Berber". Anthony Pazzanita refers to them as "a pastoral, pre-Berber people who migrated to the area during Neolithic times", possibly ancestors of the [[Imraguen people|Imraguen]].&lt;ref name="Bafour"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vYLuOGyDBjsC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=the+Bafours+extinction&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MJ-JT7qKLMqi0QWW1ZS4CQ&amp;ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jensen, Erik, ''Western Sahara: Anatomy Of A Stalemate'', pp&amp;nbsp;20–21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Twentieth-century historians have suggested that they may have been inhabitants of this territory in western Africa before the Islamic period. French art historian Jean Laude wrote, "In the pre-Islamic period (before the ninth century), according to oral tradition, Mauritania was occupied by the Bafur, a population of mixed origin from whom the eastern [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]], the central [[Gangara]], and the western [[Serer people|Serer]] are derived."&lt;ref name="Black Africa"&gt;Laude, Jean, ''The Arts of Black Africa'', University of California Press, 1973 (translated by : Jean Decock), p 50, {{ISBN|0-520-02358-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MhEG5BmGMXoC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Serer++Adrar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DWR9T-OGNser8AOL3KzNDQ&amp;ved=0CEwQuwUwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian James L.A. Webb writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"During the more humid period from c. 1450 or 1500 to c. 1600. the lands of the central and northern Gibla came to be settled once again, this time apparently by Bafur villagers. Bafur place-names and desert traditions about the Bafur survive, but little else. The ethnic identity of the Bafur apparently was transformed in the period before the late seventeenth century and absorbed into the ethnic categories of [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Berber people|Berber]], and [[Fula people|Fula]],&lt;ref&gt;In {{lang-fr|Peul}}; in {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus remains somewhat mysterious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=James L.A.|title=Desert Frontier: Ecological and Economic Change Along the Western Sahel, 1600–1850|year=1994|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-14334-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YiEn0j5HBEC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Bafour{{!}}Bafur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3XwgLHXn8U&amp;sig=FkPIyOqmJpzuLZzrxv8czbXJcpo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RuNAUNncKqa_0QWen4HgAw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Bafour%7cBafur&amp;f=false|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;They are at times referred to as the descendants of local pre-Berber peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pazzanita|first=Anthony G|title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|edition=3rd revised|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5596-0|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, James Stuart &amp; Shadle, Robert, ''Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism'', Greenwood Publishing Group (1991), p 399, {{ISBN|0-313-26257-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Webb's study of oral traditions, from 1600 to 1850, in the pre-colonial period, there was a well-established commercial route between communities of the Senegambia reaching north to the Western Sahara and Mauritania. Over four centuries before that, Arabs mixed with Bafur and Berber Masufa in [[Wadan]], in present-day [[Western Sahara]]. A group known as Idaw al-Hajj ("sons of pilgrims" in Hassaniya) gradually settled in trading areas of northwestern Senegal, from where they dominated the gum arabic trade, as well as shipment of grain from the Wolof region to the Bidan (white North Africans), and a slave trade of Wolof people to the Maghreb for horses for their military campaigns. As is common among trading peoples, over time intermarriage had taken place between the Idaw al-Hajj and Wolof peoples, and the northerners gradually became assimilated into the sub-Saharan African community, including the use of Wolof as their language.&lt;ref name="idaw"&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/cea_0008-0055_1995_num_35_138_1456?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard&amp; James L.A.

The '''Privy Council''' or '''Secret Council''' ({{lang-nl|Geheime Raad}}, {{lang-fr|Conseil Privé}}) in [[Brussels]] was one of the three "collateral councils" (along with the Council of Finance and Council of State) that together formed the highest government institutions of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. State, ''Historical Dictionary of Brussels'' (2015), p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly charged with legal and administrative questions.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Martyn, "How 'Sovereign' were the Southern Netherlands under the Archdukes?", in ''The Twelve Years Truce (1609): Peace, Truce, War and Law in the Low Countries at the Turn of the 17th Century'', edited by Randall Lesaffer (Leiden and Boston, 2014), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Council was founded on 1 October 1531 by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/repertoriumambtsdragersambtenaren1428-1861/app/instellingen/101/ Geheime Raad (1531-1578)], [[Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands]]. Accessed 3 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He prescribed a president, eight councillors, and a secretary.

[[Philip V of Spain]] abolished the council in 1702, but it was later restored by the archduchess-governess [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen]] and finally abolished by the [[Brabant Revolution]].

The '''Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro''' ({{lang-sr|Уставна повеља Србије и Црне Горе}}, ''Ustavna povelja Srbije i Crne Gore'') came into force on 4 February 2003, creating a confederacy between [[Republic of Serbia (1990–2006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992–2006)|Montenegro]] under one government, the [[FR Yugoslavia]] amending the earlier [[1992 Yugoslav Constitution|Federal Constitution]].

'''Cần Thơ Base Camp''' (also known as '''Cần Thơ Army Airfield''') is a former U.S. Army, [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF), [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] (RVNAF) and current [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) base west of [[Cần Thơ]] in the [[Mekong Delta]] in southern [[Vietnam]].
 
==History==
Cần Thơ airfield was originally established during the French colonial period and was later used by the Japanese during World War II.&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Michael|title=Where we were in Vietnam|publisher=Hellgate Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1555716257|pages=5–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USAF/RVNAF use===
In June 1962 Detachment 3, 6220th Air Base Squadron was established at Cần Thơ.&lt;ref name=Futrell&gt;{{cite book|last=Futrell|first=Robert|title=The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia: The Advisory Years to 1965|publisher=Office of Air Force History|year=1981|url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100525-052.pdf|isbn=9789998843523|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 1963 a Detachment of the [[33d Operations Group#Vietnam War|33rd Tactical Group]] was established at Cần Thơ.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|272}}

In May 1963 Detachment 7, [[8th Aerial Port Squadron]] was established at Cần Thơ.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|167}} On 8 July 1963 a Detachment of the [[33d Operations Group#Vietnam War|33rd Tactical Group]] was established at Cần Thơ replacing Detachment 3, 6220th Air Base Squadron.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;

The RVNAF maintained a detachment from its 122nd Liaison Squadron equipped with 5 [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog#Military Service|O-1 Bird Dogs]].&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|215}}

In mid-1963 [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] (MACV) proposed the construction of a {{convert|6,000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway near Cần Thơ to replace the existing {{convert|3,000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway at [[Sóc Trăng Airfield]] which was unsuitable for night and wet weather operations with a projected US$ 4.5 million construction cost and a 2 year construction period.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|177}} 

On the night of 16 July 1963 a [[Viet Cong]] (VC) mortar attack on Cần Thơ Airfield wounded 17 ARVN and US [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] troops.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|179}} 

In July 1963 the [[19th Weapons Squadron#Vietnam War|19th Tactical Air Support Squadron]] was activated at [[Bien Hoa Air Base]], becoming operational on 15 September, it maintained a detachment of 6 O-1s at Cần Thơ.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|182}}

In January 1964 given the need for heavier aircraft to be available for quick reaction air support in the Mekong Delta, [[United States Pacific Command#The Vietnam War|CINCPAC]] approved the construction of a new airfield at Cần Thơ for a cost of US$2.5 million to be ready within one year.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;{{rp|184}}

Construction of the new [[Binh Thuy Air Base]], 7km northwest of Cần Thơ Airfield began in February 1964.&lt;ref name=Kelley/&gt;{{rp|5-57}}&lt;ref name=Tregaskis&gt;{{cite book|last=Tregaskis|first=Richard|title=Southeast Asia:Building the Bases, The History of Construction in Southeast Asia|publisher=U.S. Navy Seabee Museum|year=1975|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/museums/Seabee/Online%20Reading%20Room/Manuals%20and%20Publications/Publications/Southeast%20Asia%2C%20Building%20The%20Bases%2C%20A%20History%20Of%20Const.pdf|isbn=9781461097235|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1964, Detachment 3, [[619th Tactical Control Squadron]] was organized at the base. In the same month the RVNAF 74th Tactical Wing was established.&lt;ref name=Futrell/&gt;

===1967-72===
The base was originally established by the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref name=Kelley/&gt;

*Detachment C, 1st Military Intelligence Battalion 
*69th Engineer Battalion 

The US Air Force [[619th Tactical Control Squadron]] Detachment 3 provided air traffic control until June 1972.

===1972-5===
Cần Thơ was a base for the [[9th Division (South Vietnam)|ARVN 9th Division]] until April 1975.

==Current use==
The base remains in use by the PAVN as the headquarters of the [[9th Military Region (Vietnam People's Army)|9th Military Region]]. The airfield is no longer used but still clearly visible on satellite images.

The '''DM-39''' is a German [[anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]], cylindrical-shaped and plastic-made  blast mine intended for emplacement under an [[anti-tank mine]]. It is pressure initiated and has a clockwork delayed arming mechanism, making it suitable for its anti-lift role. A secondary [[fuze]] well is located on the lower side of the mine, allowing for use of a secondary anti-disturbance fuze. The mine measures 100 by 40&amp;nbsp;mm with a 300-gram [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]/[[RDX]] explosive charge, with three variants of the same dimensions, the DM-39A1, the DM-68 and the DM-68A1.

The DM-39A1 is the metal-case version of the DM-68, a plastic-case training mine with a smoke charge device instead of an explosive one.

'''DiCo''', an acronym for '''''Di'''ritti e doveri delle persone stabilmente '''co'''nviventi'' (Rights and Duties for Stably Cohabiting People), refers to a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] presented to the [[Italian Senate|Senate]] of [[Italian Parliament]] on 8 February 2007 by the [[Prodi II Cabinet]], concerning a number of rights for [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]] cohabiting couples. The proposal falls short of the [[civil unions]] introduced in several other European countries in recent years.

The main goal of the DiCo bill was to give cohabiting partners, irrespective of their sexual orientation, inheritance and alimony rights (after nine and three years of living together, respectively). It would also allow one partner to make decisions on funeral arrangements and organ donation when the other dies. According to the law proposal, partners would have to go to the registry office to declare their ''de facto'' union, but no ceremony akin to marriage would be celebrated. In fact, the partners do not even need to register the union at the same time.

The text of the bill has been mainly composed by the legal staffs of two ministers of Prodi's cabinet, [[Barbara Pollastrini]], Minister for Equal Opportunities and (at that time) member of the [[Democrats of the Left]] party (now member of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]), and [[Rosy Bindi]], Minister for Family and former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], at that time member of the [[Democracy is Freedom – Daisy|Daisy]], (now member of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]), too.

The examination of the law was stopped during the same cabinet.

The '''yellow-headed dwarf gecko''' or '''dwarf yellow-headed gecko''' (''Lygodactylus luteopicturatus'') is a small species of dwarf gecko found in the rocky areas of southern [[Kenya]], Somalia (maybe as an introduced species), eastern [[Tanzania]], and [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref name=rdb&gt;[http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Lygodactylus&amp;species=luteopicturatus ''Lygodactylus luteopicturatus''], The Reptile Database&lt;/ref&gt; It can grow up to {{convert|90|mm|in}}, but on average attains a length of {{convert|80|mm|in}} with a snout-vent (body) length of {{convert|39|mm|in}}. The tail length can be equal to the length of the body from snout to the anus (SVL or Snout-Vent Length).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbzspeciesconservation.org/grant-files/reports/report-1553.pdf Geckos], [[Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''peseta''' (''peseta guineana'') was the [[currency]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]] from 1969 to 1975. It replaced the [[Spanish peseta]] at par shortly after gaining independence from Spain the prior year and was later replaced, again at par, by the [[Equatorial Guinean ekwele|ekwele]].

==Coins==
Four denominations of coins were issued, all dated 1969. These were an aluminum-bronze 1 peseta and copper nickel 5, 25 and 50 pesetas. The coins were the same size as the corresponding Spanish peseta coins and were minted by [[Spain|Madrid]]. The designs are simple and straight forward with the largest denomination depicting the first national president.

==Banknotes==
Three denominations of banknotes were issued dated 12 DE OCTUBRE DE 1969. These were 100, 500 and 1000 pesetas. In 1975, notes denominated in ekuele replaced the peseta guineana at par. In 1979, the portrait of [[Francisco Macías Nguema]] was removed from the currency of Equatorial Guinea after his overthrow on 3 August 1979, and subsequent execution on 29 September following a guilty verdict for crimes including genocide, mass murder, embezzlement of public funds, violations of human rights, and treason. The traditional coat of arms was also restored. Concurrent with the release of these new notes, the name of the currency was also changed from ekuele (plural ekuele) to ekwele (plural bipkwele). Equatorial Guinea entered the Franc Zone on 2 January 1985. The ekwele was replaced by the Central African franc (written Franco on these notes) at a rate of 1 franc = 4 bipkwele. In the late 1980s, Equatorial Guinea joined the Central African States, which issued its notes thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Linzmayer | first1 = Owen | title = The Banknote Book | chapter = Equatorial Guinea | publisher = www.BanknoteNews.com | year = 2012 | location = San Francisco, CA | url = http://www.banknotebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evpaty Kolovrat''' ({{lang-rus|Евпатий Коловрат|Yevpatiy Kolovrat|jɪfˈpatʲɪj kəlɐˈvrat}}, c.1200 – 1238) is a Russian [[bogatyr]] described in ''[[The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan]]''. According to the tale he died while fighting the vastly superior army of the Mongol ruler [[Batu Khan]], trying to avenge the [[Siege of Ryazan|destruction of Ryazan]] a few weeks earlier.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; 

==Life ==
Kolovrat was visiting [[Chernigov]] during the [[Siege of Ryazan]], which occurred between 16 and 21 December 1237. Learning about the tragedy he rushed back home only to find the city destroyed and most its inhabitants killed. He gathered 1700 people from his soldiers and the survivors of the siege and went after Batu Khan with a sole purpose of avenging the carnage. Kolovrat's forces suddenly attacked the rear guard of Batu Khan's army and annihilated it in a fierce battle. Perplexed,  Batu Khan sent a much larger force led by his relative Khostovrul. Khostovrul promised to capture Kolovrat alive, and for this purpose challenged Kolovrat for a duel. A man of extraordinary strength, Kolovrat split his opponent in half with his sword and proceeded to kill the surrounding Mongols, splitting many of them down to the saddle. The remaining Khostovrul's soldiers retreated and killed Kolovrat from a distance using stone launchers. In a sign of respect to Kolovrat's bravery, Batu Khan returned his body to his soldiers and let them return home.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

==Legacy==
The bravery and strength of Kolovrat were praised in the Russian literature, art and media by 
*[[Nikolay Yazykov]] in "Evpaty" (1824)
*[[Lev Mei]] in the "Song about boyar Evpaty Kolovrat" (1859)&lt;ref name=mei/&gt;
*[[Sergei Yesenin]] in [[:ru:s:Сказание_о_Евпатии_Коловрате_(Есенин)|''The Tale of Evpaty Kolovrat'']]  (1912)
*[[Vasily Yan]] in Chapter 3 "Evpaty the Fierce" of the book ''Batu'' (1942)
*[[Furious (2017 film)|Furious]] (Kolovrat) film of Ivan Shuvkhovetsky (2017)
The tale of Kolovrat is depicted in the 1985 Soviet short animated film [[:ru:Сказ о Евпатии Коловрате|''The Tale of Evpaty Kolovrat'']] and is being produced as a full-length movie.&lt;ref name=film/&gt;

The '''Flag of Split''' is the [[Vexillology|vexillologic]] symbol of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. The flag is blue, with a shade gradient from darker to lighter from bottom to top, with the white emblem of the city in the lower half, consisting of six words "SPLIT" forming the silhouette of [[Diocletian's Palace]] and the [[Saint Domnius Cathedral]] belfry topped with a cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.split.hr/Default.aspx?sec=751|title=Grad Split|website=www.split.hr|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current version of the flag replaced an older design, which consisted of a silver outline of the northern walls of Diocletian's Palace, with the belfry of Saint Domnius Cathedral (similar to the city's [[Coat of arms of Split|coat of arms]]), set upon a blue field.

The traditional colours of Split are white and blue.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Fljótsdæla saga''' ({{Audio|Is-Fljótsdæla saga.oga|listen}}) is one of the [[Icelandic sagas]]. It is probably the last one written, perhaps from about 1500, probably by an author in the East Fjords, and is a sequel to [[Hrafnkels saga]].

The story revolves around the lives and times of the residents of the [[Fljótsdalur]] region in [[Iceland]], including Helgi Ásbjarnarson and Helgi and Grímr, sons of Droplaug, a pair of brothers who have their own saga, [[Droplaugarsona saga]].

==Translations==
The saga was translated into English by John Porter in 1997:

''The Saga of the People of Fljotsdal''. Translated by John Porter. In: Viðar Hreinsson (General Editor): ''The complete sagas of Icelanders'' including 49 tales. Reykjavík: Leifur Eiríksson Publishing, 1997. Vol. IV. pp.&amp;nbsp;379–433. {{ISBN|9979-9293-4-0}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5626">A '''Forward Policy''' is a set of [[foreign policy]] doctrines applicable to territorial and border disputes, in which emphasis is placed on securing control of disputed areas by invasion and annexation, or by the creation of compliant [[buffer state]]s.{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=5–6}}

The term has been employed as a [[sobriquet]] in two periods of history relating to the [[Central Asia]]n border disputes, in [[The Great Game]] and in [[events leading to the Sino-Indian War]] in 1962.

The term has been used more generally to describe the promulgation of policies in specific areas for tactical reasons, such as by British women's [[anti-suffragism]] supporters in the 1908-14 period, who set out a raft of progressive policy proposals affecting women but excluding [[suffrage]] under the label of Forward Policy.&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bush |first=Julia |date=2002 |title=British women's anti-suffragism and the forward policy, 1908-14 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612020200200330 |journal=[[Women's History Review]] |publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=431–454 |doi=10.1080/0961202020020033 |access-date=6 June 2016|doi-broken-date=2018-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Game==
The Great Game was a long period of dispute between the British and Russian empires from circa 1813 to 1907, reflecting British concerns about the security of its Indian empire as the Russian empire expended southwards; and played out in competitions for strategic control of Afghanistan, Persia, the Central Asian Khanates/Emirates and the British trade-route to India.{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|page=2}}

In The Great Game, the Forward Policy or Forward School was identified with arguments for the annexation of, or the control of foreign policy of, states and territories on the Indian border. The policy came with a number of costs: of armies deployed to secure territory, or subsidies to client states; as well as opportunity costs such as the increased risk of revolt in other parts of India should troops be moved to the frontier.

The Forward Policy stood in contrast with the 'Masterful Inactivity' or 'Backward' school of policy, which saw the geography of the subcontinent, especially the Himalayas, as sufficient protection against Russian encroachment,{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|page=6}} and which was - all things being equal - less risky and of lower cost.{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=285–286}}

Support for and dominancy of the two policies varied across time and place, with changes of government and circumstance. In Britain, [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] are identified with the Backward school, [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] with the Forward.{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=358–359, 398}}

Amongst India hands [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Lord Wellesley]], an early [[Governor-General of India]], supported the policy,{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=133–134}} as did his acolyte [[John Malcolm]] and less exalted staff such as [[William Moorcroft (explorer)|William Moorcroft]]{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|page=88}} [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Rawlinson]] was a strong advocate of the Forward Policy, notably in this ‘’England and Russia in the East’’ (1875) .{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|page=318}} [[Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe]], a member of the Supreme Council of India and later [[List of Governors-General of India#Governor-Generals of Bengal.2C 1833.E2.80.931858|Governor General of Bengal]], favoured the opportunity for consolidation offered by Masterful Inactivity.{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=133–134}} Contention between the two played out at local as well as national levels:{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=360–361}} Sandeman’s Forward Policy in [[Balochistan]] was at a complete variance with his colleague’s approaches in neighbouring frontier areas.{{sfn|Bruce|1900|pages=42–45}}

The [[Anglo-Russian Entente|Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]] settled [[Russia–United Kingdom relations|British-Russian relations]] by defining borders and spheres of influence sufficiently to enable Britain to bring its Forward Policy to an end.{{sfn|Hopkirk|2006|pages=510–521}}

== Sino-Indian War==
In the lead-up to the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]], India operated what was known as the [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War#Forward policy|Forward Policy]]&lt;ref name="Noorani3"&gt;India's Forward Policy, Review author[s]: A. G. Noorani, The China Quarterly © 1970 School of Oriental and African Studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Gregory Clark, "Remembering a War - The 1962 India-China Conflict", Rediff, [http://www.gregoryclark.net/redif.html] [http://in.rediff.com/news/2002/oct/24chin.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.in/news/181_284247,001300370003.htm Hindustan Times]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to border areas between [[Ladakh]] and [[Bhutan]] (the Aksai Chin) which were disputed with China. Notably, the Indians built army outposts behind Chinese border posts with a view to preventing supplies to the Chinese and forcing their withdrawal from disputed territory.

The '''Korea Maritime Institute''' ('''KMI''') is a think tank and research center developing [[South Korea]]n policies on marine affairs and fisheries, operated by the South Korean government through the ''Office of Government Policy Coordination''.  KMI was established under its current name in 1997, though expanded from a research center created in 1984 specializing in shipping economics.&lt;ref name=brochure&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.kmi.re.kr/download/kmi200811(eng).pdf |title=Korea Maritime Institute brochure |year=2008 |publisher=Korea Maritime Institute |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

KMI is organized into five research divisions as of 2011:
*Marine &amp; Coastal Policy Research Department
*Shipping, Port &amp; Logistics Research Department
*Fisheries Policy Research Department
*Marine Territory and Industry Research Department
*Fisheries Outlook Center

and has two overseas centers:
*Shanghai Research Center
*Korea-US Marine Policy Joint Research Center, at the [[University of Rhode Island]]

KMI is headquartered in [[Mapo-gu]], [[Seoul]],&lt;ref name=brochure /&gt; having a staff of about 180.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/03/180_32256.html |title=Institute Offers Strategic Vision for Korean Maritime Industry |date=6 October 2008 |publisher=Korea Times |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lesser Caucasus''', also called '''Caucasus Minor''' is second of the two main [[mountain range]]s of [[Caucasus mountains]], of length about {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The western portion of the Lesser Caucasus overlaps and converges with the high [[plateau]] of [[Eastern Anatolia]], in the far northeast of [[Turkey]].

It runs parallel to the [[Greater Caucasus]], at a distance averaging about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} south from [[Likhi Range]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) and limits the [[Armenian Highland]] from the North and North-East.

It is connected to the Greater Caucasus by the Likhi Range (Georgia) and separated from it by the [[Kolkhida Lowland]] (Georgia) in the West and [[Kura-Aras Lowland]] (Azerbaijan) (by [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]]) in the East.

The highest peak is [[Aragats]], {{convert|4090|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt;

The borders between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Turkey]], [[Armenia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] run through the range, although its crest does not usually define the border.

== Component ranges ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
The Lesser Caucasus mountain system does not have a single continuous mountain range.  It consists of four main parts:

# Aran-kuh (mountains of [[Talysh Mountains|Talysh]] and [[Arasbaran|Karadag]]) which runs from [[Caspian sea]] to the [[Araxes river]] in [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]].
# Caucasus Minor, mountains located from [[Meghri]] (the border of [[Armenia]] with [[Iran]]) to the plateau of Ashotsk,[[Javakheti|Javakhetia]] and [[:es:Príncipes de Lori-Somkhetia|Somkhetia]] (the border of [[Armenia]] with [[Georgia (country)|Georgia)]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;most of which in Antiquity and Medieval was called ''[[Syunik (historic province)|Siunia Caucasiana (]]Geography of [[Ravenna]]'', V-th century, [[Western Roman empire]]).
# [[Adjara]]-[[Trialeti]] basin ranges, (also called [[Meskheti|Moskhis]] mountains), in south-western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], passing from [[Javakheti|Javahetia]] to the border of [[Adjara|Adjaria]] with [[Turkey]]
# The mountains of [[Lazistan]] and [[Pontica]] in [[Turkey]], also called the [[Çoruh River|Tchorokh]] mountains.

== Naming controversy ==        

The range was historically called [[Anticaucasus]] or Anti-Caucasus [[Greek language|(Greek]]: Αντι-Καύκασος, [[Russian language|Russian]]: Антикавка́з, Анти-Кавка́з).

Created in 2000 to increase the transparency of political debate by providing an insight into the work of the Norwegian legislature, the [[Storting]], it broadcast live parliamentary debates and other proceedings via [[digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] and [[internet radio|on-line]] as well as using a part of the [[frequency modulation|FM network]] around the larger cities. The transmissions via DAB ceased in 2007, and the service was later withdrawn in its entirety.

British explorer Captain [[James Cook]] was the first European to sight New Caledonia, on 4 September 1774, during his second voyage.&lt;ref name="ped"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieom.fr/IMG/pdf/ra2010_nouvelle-caledonie.pdf |title=Rapport annuel 2010 |publisher=IEOM Nouvelle-Calédonie |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it "New [[Caledonia]]", as the northeast of the island reminded him of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; The west coast of Grande Terre was approached by the [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse|Comte de Lapérouse]] in 1788, shortly before his disappearance, and the Loyalty Islands were first visited between 1793 and 1796 when Mare, Lifou, Tiga, and Ouvea were mapped by [[William Raven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FUwDzM94jGUC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA15|title=Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands|last=Quanchi|first=Max|last2=Robson|first2=John|date=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810865280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English whaler encountered the island named then Britania, and today known as Maré (Loyalty Is.), in November 1793.&lt;ref name="maritimeheritage.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/ports/newCaledonia.html|title=New Caledonia and International Seaport History. The Maritime Heritage Project.|last=|first=|date=|website=Maritimeheritage.org|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1796 until 1840, only a few sporadic contacts with the archipelago were recorded. About fifty American whalers (identified by Robert Langsom from their log books) have been recorded in the region (Grande Terre, Loyalty Is., Walpole and Hunter) between 1793 and 1887.&lt;ref name="maritimeheritage.org"/&gt; Contacts became more frequent after 1840, because of the interest in [[sandalwood]].&lt;ref name="pres-hist"/&gt;

As trade in sandalwood declined, it was replaced by a new business enterprise, "[[blackbirding]]", a euphemism for taking Melanesian or Western Pacific Islanders from New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, [[Vanuatu|New Hebrides]], New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands into indentured or forced labour in the sugar cane plantations in [[Fiji]] and [[Queensland]] by various methods of trickery and deception.&lt;ref name="kanaka"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/bitstream/handle/2042/14373/HERMES_2002_32-33_191.pdf?sequence=1 |title=De Kanaka à Kanak: l'appropriation d'un terme générique au profit de la revendication identitaire |author=Frédéric Angleviel |publisher=Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackbirding was practiced by both French and British-Australian traders, but in New Caledonia's case, the trade in the early decades of the twentieth century involved relocating children from the [[Loyalty Islands]] to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture. New Caledonia's primary experience with blackbirding revolved around a trade from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture, mines, as well as guards over convicts and in some public works.  The historian Dorothy Shineberg's milestone study, The People Trade, discusses this 'migration'. In the early years of the trade, coercion was used to lure Melanesian islanders onto ships. In later years indenture systems were developed; however, when it came to the French slave trade, which took place between its Melanesian colonies of the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, very few regulations were implemented. This represented a departure from the British experience, since increased regulations were developed to mitigate the abuses of blackbirding and 'recruitment' strategies on the coastlines.

The first missionaries from the [[London Missionary Society]] and the [[Marist Brothers]] arrived in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="abcau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/ra/pacific/places/country/new_caledonia.htm |title=Charting the Pacific – Places |website=Abc.net.au |date=1998-10-13 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1849, the crew of the American ship ''Cutter'' was killed and eaten by the Pouma clan.&lt;ref name="logan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leanne Logan|author2=Geert Cole|title=New Caledonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lly95WF8n-cC&amp;pg=PA15|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-86450-202-2|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cannibalism]] was widespread throughout New Caledonia.&lt;ref name="Knauft1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M.

=== French dependency ===
On 24 September 1853, under orders from Emperor [[Napoleon III]], Admiral [[Auguste Febvrier Despointes|Febvrier Despointes]] took formal possession of New Caledonia.

The ''Bulletin de la Société générale des prisons'' for 1888 indicates that 10,428 convicts, including 2,329 freed ones, were on the island as of 1 May 1888, by far the largest number of convicts detained in French overseas penitentiaries.&lt;ref&gt;As compared to 4,053 convicts, including 1,176 freed ones, in French Guiana at the same date.

In 1864 [[nickel]] was discovered{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} on the banks of the [[Diahot River]]; with the establishment of the [[Société Le Nickel]] in 1876, mining began in earnest.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; To work the mines the French imported labourers from neighbouring islands and from the New Hebrides, and later from [[Japan]], the [[Dutch East Indies]], and [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref name="gb-1"/&gt; The French government also attempted to encourage European immigration, without much success.&lt;ref name="gb-1"/&gt;

The indigenous population or Kanak people were excluded{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} from the French economy and from mining work, and ultimately confined to reservations.&lt;ref name="gb-1"/&gt; This sparked a violent reaction in 1878, when High Chief Atal of [[La Foa]] managed to unite many of the central tribes and launched a guerrilla war that killed 200 Frenchmen and 1,000 Kanaks.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; A second guerrilla war took place in 1917, with Catholic missionaries like [[Maurice Leenhardt]] functioning as witnesses to the events of this war. Leenhardt would pen a number of ethnographic works on the Kanak of New Caledonia. Noel of Tiamou led the 1917 rebellion, which resulted in a number of orphaned children, one of whom was taken into the care of Protestant missionary Alphonse Rouel. This child, Wenceslas Thi, would become the father of [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Muckle&lt;/ref&gt; (1936–1989).

Europeans brought new diseases such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], which caused the deaths of many natives.&lt;ref name="logan"/&gt; The Kanak population declined from around 60,000 in 1878 to 27,100 in 1921, and their numbers did not increase again until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt;

In June 1940, after the [[fall of France]], the [[General councils (France)|''Conseil General'']] of New Caledonia voted unanimously to support the [[Free French]] government, and in September the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy]] governor was forced to leave for Indochina.&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; In March 1942, with the assistance of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/30/chapters/06.pdf |title= Hasluck: Clearing A Way To Total War |format= PDF |accessdate= 6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the territory became an important [[Allies of World War II | Allied]] base,&lt;ref name="gb-2"/&gt; and the main South Pacific Fleet base of the [[United States Navy]] in the South Pacific moved to Noumea in 1942–1943.&lt;ref name="Rottman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author= Gordon L.

American troops numbered as many as 50,000, the equivalent of the contemporary population.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt;

=== French overseas territory ===
In 1946, New Caledonia became an overseas territory.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; By 1953, [[French citizenship]] had been granted to all New Caledonians, regardless of ethnicity.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"/&gt;

The European and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] populations gradually increased in the years leading to the nickel boom of 1969–1972, and the indigenous [[Kanak people|Kanak]] Melanesians became a minority, though they were still the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref name="ncbrit"&gt;{{Britannica|411221|New Caledonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1976 and 1988, conflicts between French government actions and the Kanak independence movement saw periods of serious violence and disorder.&lt;ref name="ped" /&gt; In 1983, a statute of "enlarged autonomy" for the territory proposed a five-year transition period and a referendum in 1989. In March 1984, the Kanak resistance, Front Indépendantiste, seized farms and the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]] (FLNKS) formed a provisional government. In January 1985, the French Socialist government offered sovereignty to the Kanaks and legal protection for European settlers. The plan faltered as violence escalated. The government declared a state of emergency; however, regional elections went ahead, and the FLNKS won control of three out of four provinces. The centre-right government elected in France in March 1986 began eroding the arrangements established under the Socialists, redistributing lands mostly without consideration of native land claims, resulting in over two-thirds going to Europeans and less than a third to the Kanaks. By the end of 1987, roadblocks, gun battles and the destruction of property culminated in the [[Ouvéa cave hostage taking]], a dramatic hostage crisis on the eve of the presidential elections in France. Pro-independence militants on [[Ouvéa]] killed four gendarmes and took 27 hostage. The military response resulted in nineteen Kanak deaths and another three deaths in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/land-and-independence-new-caledonia|title=Land and Independence in New Caledonia|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]], signed on 26 June 1988, ensured a decade of stability. The [[Nouméa Accord]] signed 5 May 1998, set the groundwork for a 20-year transition that gradually transfers competences to the local government.&lt;ref name="ped" /&gt;

Following the timeline set by the Nouméa Accord that stated a vote must take place by the end of 2018, the groundwork was laid for a [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 2018|referendum on full independence from France]] at a meeting chaired by the French Prime Minister [[Édouard Philippe]] on 2 November 2017, to be held by November 2018. Voter list eligibility had been a subject of a long dispute, but the details have since been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2017/11/03/referendum-d-autodetermination-en-nouvelle-caledonie-un-accord-politique-trouve_5209433_823448.html|title=Nouvelle-Calédonie : ce que contient l'" accord politique " sur le référendum d'autodétermination|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=17 July 2018|date=2017-11-03|last1=Roger|first1=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2018, the government announced an [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 2018|independence referendum]] that was held and failed on 4 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/new-caledonia-sets-date-independence-referendum-france|title=New Caledonia sets date for independence referendum|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5444523/new-caledonia-france-referendum/|title=New Caledonia Votes to Remain Part of France|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of New Caledonia}}
[[File:Flag of New Caledonia Congress.gif|thumb|Logo of the Territorial Congress]]

New Caledonia is a [[sui generis collectivity|territory]] [[Sui generis#Politics and society|''sui generis'']] to which France has gradually transferred certain powers.&lt;ref name="jc"/&gt; As such its   citizens have [[French nationality law|French nationality]] and vote for the [[president of France]]. They have the right to vote in elections to the [[European Parliament]]. It is governed by a 54-member [[Congress of New Caledonia|Territorial Congress]], a legislative body composed of members of three provincial assemblies.&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; The French State is represented in the territory by a [[Colonial and Departmental Heads of New Caledonia|High Commissioner]].&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; At a national level, New Caledonia is represented in the [[French Parliament]] by two deputies and two senators.&lt;ref name="anom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/Simplifiez-vous-l-Etat/Elections/Les-differentes-elections/Les-differentes-elections|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111063921/http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/Simplifiez-vous-l-Etat/Elections/Les-differentes-elections/Les-differentes-elections|archivedate=2011-11-11 |title=Les différentes élections |language=French |website=Nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[French presidential election, 2012|2012 French presidential election]], the [[voter turnout]] in New Caledonia was 61.19%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2012/000/988/index.html| title=Resultats de l'election presidentielle – Nouvelle Caledonie| first=[[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]| last=[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] |language=French |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 25 years, the party system in New Caledonia was dominated by the anti-independence [[The Rally–UMP]].&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; This dominance ended with the emergence of a new party, [[Avenir Ensemble]], also opposed to independence, but considered more open to dialogue with the Kanak movement,&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt; which is part of the [[Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front]], a coalition of several pro-independence groups.&lt;ref name="undcol"/&gt;

=== Customary authority ===
The Kanak society has several layers of customary authority, from the 4,000–5,000 family-based clans to the eight customary areas (''aires coutumières'') that make up the territory.&lt;ref name="anaya2"&gt;[http://unsr.jamesanaya.org/docs/countries/2011-newcaledonia-a-hrc-18-35-add6_en.pdf The situation of Kanak people in New Caledonia, France. – Country Reports – UNSR James Anaya], page 8&lt;/ref&gt; Clans are led by clan chiefs and constitute 341 tribes, each headed by a tribal chief. The tribes are further grouped into 57 customary chiefdoms (''chefferies''), each headed by a head chief, and forming the administrative subdivisions of the customary areas.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt;

The Customary Senate is the assembly of the various traditional councils of the Kanaks, and has jurisdiction over the law proposals concerning the Kanak identity.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; The Customary Senate is composed of 16 members appointed by each traditional council, with two representatives per each customary area.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; In its advisory role, the Customary Senate must be consulted on law proposals "concerning the Kanak identity" as defined in the Nouméa Accord.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; It also has a deliberative role on law proposals that would affect identity, the civil customary statute, and the land system.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"/&gt; A new president is appointed each year in August or September, and the presidency rotates between the eight customary areas.&lt;ref name="cs-fra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/La-Nouvelle-Caledonie/Les-Elus/Senat-coutumier |title=Sénat coutumier |language=French |website=Nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr |accessdate=2013-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030174915/http://www.nouvelle-caledonie.gouv.fr/site/La-Nouvelle-Caledonie/Les-Elus/Senat-coutumier |archivedate=30 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanak people have recourse to customary authorities regarding civil matters such as marriage, adoption, inheritance, and some land issues.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt; The French administration typically respects decisions made in the customary system.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt; However, their jurisdiction is sharply limited in penal matters, as some matters relating to the customary justice system, including the use of [[Judicial corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], are seen as clashing with the human rights obligations of France.&lt;ref name="anaya2"/&gt;

=== Military ===
The Armed Forces of New Caledonia ({{lang-fr|Forces armées de Nouvelle-Calédonie}}) '''FANC''', include about 2,000 soldiers, mainly deployed in [[Koumac]], [[Nandaï, New Caledonia|Nandaï]], [[La Tontouta International Airport|Tontouta]], [[Plum, New Caledonia|Plum]], and [[Nouméa]].&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt; The land forces consist of a regiment of the [[Troupes de marine]], the Régiment d'infanterie de marine du Pacifique. The naval forces include two [[P400-class patrol vessel]]s, a [[BATRAL-class landing ship|BATRAL]], and a patrol boat of the [[Maritime Gendarmerie]].&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt; The air force is made up of three [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA|Casa]] transport aircraft, four [[Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma|Puma]] helicopters and a [[Eurocopter Fennec|Fennec]] helicopter, based in Tontouta.&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt; In addition, 760 [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmes]] are deployed on the archipelago.&lt;ref name="fanc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/forces-prepositionnees/nouvelle-caledonie/dossier/les-forces-armees-de-nouvelle-caledonie |title=Les Forces armées de Nouvelle-Calédonie |language=French |website=Defense.gouv.fr |date=2012-12-20 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status ===
Since 1986, the [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] has included New Caledonia on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/decolonization/nonselfgov.shtml#1 Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories (1945–1999)] United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; An [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 1987|independence referendum]] was held the following year, but independence was rejected by a large majority.

Under the [[Nouméa Accord]], signed in 1998 following a period of secessionist unrest in the 1980s and approved in [[New Caledonian Nouméa Accord referendum, 1998|a referendum]], New Caledonia held a second [[New Caledonian independence referendum, 2018|referendum on independence]] on 4 November 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/19/new-caledonia-sets-date-independence-referendum-france|title=New Caledonia sets date for independence referendum|website=The Guardian|access-date=20 March 2018 |date=19 March 2018 |last=Willsher |first=Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/201787812/paris-meeting-to-prepare-new-caledonia-independence-vote|title=Paris meeting to prepare New Caledonia independence vote|website=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2016-03-08|date=2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 56.9% of voters chose to remain with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/04/new-caledonia-votes-non-to-independence-from-france|title=New Caledonia votes 'non' to independence from France|last=Reuters|date=2018-11-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official name of the territory, ''Nouvelle-Calédonie'', could be changed in the near future due to the accord, which states that "a name, a flag, an anthem, a motto, and the design of banknotes will have to be sought by all parties together, to express the Kanak identity and the future shared by all parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gouv.nc/static/pages/outils/telechargement/accordsNoumea.pdf| title=Les accords de Nouméa|author=Government of New Caledonia| accessdate=11 August 2008|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080405032022/http://www.gouv.nc/static/pages/outils/telechargement/accordsNoumea.pdf |archivedate = 5 April 2008 |language=French |authorlink=Government of New Caledonia}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, however, there has been no consensus on a new name for the territory, although ''Kanak Republic'' is popular among 40% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nouvellecaledonie.rfo.fr/article424.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627221108/http://nouvellecaledonie.rfo.fr/article424.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=27 June 2008| title=Société : La Nouvelle-Calédonie choisit un hymne et une devise| author=RFO| accessdate=11 August 2008| authorlink=Réseau France Outre-mer| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Caledonia has increasingly adopted its own symbols, choosing an anthem, a motto, and a new design for its banknotes.&lt;ref name="monde1"/&gt; In July 2010, New Caledonia adopted the Kanak flag, alongside the existing [[French tricolor]], as [[Flag of New Caledonia|dual official flags of the territory]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first=Bonnie|last=Malkin|title=New Caledonia adopts second flag in compromise over French rule |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/newcaledonia/7900494/New-Caledonia-adopts-second-flag-in-compromise-over-French-rule.html|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010|quote=New Caledonian Congress overwhelmingly voted to adopt the emblem of the indigenous movement, which features red, blue and green stripes with a yellow sun and black totem, as the nation's second official flag}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption made New Caledonia one of the few countries or territories in the world with two official national flags.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The decision to use two flags has been a constant battleground between the two sides and led the coalition government to collapse in February 2011.&lt;ref name="fr24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110826-france-sarkozy-urges-dialogue-over-violence-new-caledonia-airfare-protests |title=Sarkozy calls for dialogue over New Caledonia violence |publisher=France 24 |date=2011-08-26 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archipelago is divided into three provinces:
* [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]] (''province Sud''). Provincial capital: [[Nouméa]]. Area 9,407&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Population: 183,007 inhabitants (2009).

== Geography ==
[[File:New Caledonia - S199828000484.jpg|thumb|left|New Caledonia from space]]
{{Main|Geography of New Caledonia}}
New Caledonia is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a fragment of the ancient [[Gondwana]] super-continent. It is speculated that New Caledonia separated from Australia roughly 66 million years ago, subsequently drifting in a north-easterly direction, reaching its present position about 50 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer &amp; Giribet 2007: 355&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]], with a hot and humid season from November to March with temperatures between 27&amp;nbsp;°C and 30&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt; and a cooler, dry season from June to August with temperatures between 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 23&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt; linked by two short interstices.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; The tropical climate is strongly moderated by the oceanic influence and the [[trade winds]] that attenuate humidity, which can be close to 80%.&lt;ref name="geo-jc"/&gt;  The average annual temperature is 23&amp;nbsp;°C, with historical extremes of 2.3&amp;nbsp;°C and 39.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt;

The rainfall records show that precipitation differs greatly within the island. The {{convert|3000|mm}} of rainfall recorded in [[Galarino]] are three times the average of the west coast. There are also dry periods, because of the effects of [[El Niño]].&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; Between December and April, [[tropical depressions]] and [[cyclones]] can cause winds to exceed a speed of {{convert|100|kph}}, with gusts of {{convert|250|kph}} and very abundant rainfall.&lt;ref name="ped"/&gt; The last cyclone affecting New Caledonia was [[2016-17 South Pacific cyclone season#Severe Tropical Cyclone Cook|Cyclone Cook]], in January 2017.

A 2015 documentary by [[Al Jazeera English]] asserted that up to 10%{{dubious|date=September 2015}} of New Caledonia's population is descended from around 2,000 [[Arabs|Arab]]-[[Imazighen|Berber]] people deported from [[French Algeria]] in the late 19th century to [[Penal colony|prisons on the island]] in reprisal for the [[Mokrani Revolt]] in 1871. After serving their sentences, they were released and given land to own and cultivate as part of colonisation efforts on the island. As the overwhelming majority of the [[Algerians of the Pacific|Algerians imprisoned on New Caledonia]] were men, the community was continued through intermarriage with women of other ethnic groups, mainly French women from nearby women's prisons. Despite facing both assimilation into the Euro-French population and discrimination for their ethnic background, descendants of the deportees have succeeded in preserving a common identity as Algerians, including maintaining certain cultural practices (such as Arabic names) and in some cases [[Islam]]ic religion. Some travel to Algeria as a rite of passage, though obtaining Algerian citizenship is often a difficult process. The largest population of Algerian-Caledonians lives in the commune of [[Bourail]] (particularly in the [[:fr:Nessadiou|Nessadiou]] district, where there is an Islamic cultural centre and [[:fr:Cimetière des Arabes de Nessadiou|cemetery]]), with smaller communities in [[Nouméa]], [[Conné]], [[Blambut]], and [[Surianté]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/aljazeeraworld/2015/09/exile-caledonia-150914145540415.html|title=Exile In New Caledonia|last1=Mame|first1=Abdelkader|first2=Abdelaziz|last2=Abid|date=14 September 2015|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=17 September 2015}} [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qsr-FjZhEM video]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Education in New Caledonia is based on the [[Education in France|French curriculum]] and delivered by both French teachers and French–trained teachers. Under the terms of the 1998 [[Nouméa Accord]], primary education is the responsibility of the three provinces. As of 2010, secondary education was in the process of being transferred to the provinces.&lt;ref name="CSC Australia 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging Pacific Leaders Dialogue 2010 New Caledonia Report|url=http://www.cscaustralia.com/ep10/reports/Study%20Tour%20Report,%20New%20Caledonia%20April%20'10.pdf|publisher=Commonwealth Study Conferences Australia|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of schools are located in [[Nouméa]] but some are found in the islands and the north of New Caledonia. When students reach high school age, most are sent to Nouméa to continue their secondary education. Education is compulsory from the age of six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is education like in New Caledonia?|url=https://newcaledoniatoday.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/what-is-education-like-in-new-caledonia/|website=New Caledonia Today|accessdate=1 March 2018|date=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=March 2018}}

New Caledonia's main tertiary education institution is the [[University of New Caledonia]] (''Université de la Nouvelle-Calédonie''), which was founded in 1993 and comes under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation]]. It is based in Nouméa and offers a range of vocational, Bachelor, MA, and PhD programmes and courses. The University of New Caledonia consists of three academic departments, one institute of technology, one PhD school, and one teacher's college. As of 2013, the University has approximately 3,000 students, 107 academics, and 95 administrative and library staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation UNC en Anglais 2012|url=http://unc.nc/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/presentation-UNC-english-1.pdf|publisher=[[University of New Caledonia]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSC Australia 2010" /&gt; Many New Caledonian students also pursue scholarships to study in metropolitan France.

=== Nickel sector ===
{{main|Nickel mining in New Caledonia}}

[[File:Creek South New Caledonia.JPG|thumb|A creek in southern New Caledonia. Red colors reveal the richness of the ground in [[iron oxide]]s and nickel.]]

New Caledonian soils contain about 25% of the world's [[nickel]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/1446693/Nickel-gleams-again-in-New-Caledonia.html "Nickel gleams again in New Caledonia"], ''Metal Bulletin'', 3 December 2001 – though other articles in Wikipedia say 10% or 16%&lt;/ref&gt; The [[late-2000s recession]] has gravely affected the nickel industry, as the sector faced a significant drop in nickel prices (−31.0% year-on-year in 2009) for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref name="comptes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isee.nc/compteco/telechargement/4pagecerom2011.pdf |title=Les comptes économiques rapides de Nouvelle-Calédonie |publisher=ISEE.nc |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall in prices has led a number of producers to reduce or stop altogether their activity, resulting in a reduction of the global supply of nickel by 6% compared to 2008.&lt;ref name="comptes"/&gt;

This context, combined with bad weather, has forced the operators in the sector to revise downwards their production target.&lt;ref name="comptes"/&gt; Thus, the activity of mineral extraction has declined by 8% in volume year on year.{{when|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="comptes" /&gt; The share of the nickel sector as a percentage of GDP fell from 8% in 2008 to 5% in 2009.&lt;ref name="comptes" /&gt; A trend reversal and a recovery in demand have been recorded early in the second half of 2009, allowing a 2.0% increase in the local metal production.&lt;ref name="comptes"/&gt;

Historically, nickel was transported by wire ropeway to ships waiting offshore.

''[[Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes]]''&lt;ref&gt;The name is a pun, and can be read in English as "The Caledonian News" or "Women of New Caledonia"&lt;/ref&gt; is the only daily newspaper in the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1403/S00173/pff-stands-in-solidarity-with-les-nouvelles-caledoniennes.htm PFF stands in solidarity with Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes stands in solidarity with Les Nouvelles Calédoniennes], [[Scoop (website)|Scoop]], 11 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivmed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gitesnouvellecaledonie.nc/nouvelle-caledonie/vivre-en-nouvelle-caledonie |title=Vivre en Nouvelle-Calédonie |publisher=Gîtes Nouvelle Calédonie |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monthly publication, ''Le Chien bleu'', parodies the news from New Caledonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lechienbleu.nc/|title=Le Chien bleu : Journal satirique de Nouvelle-Calédonie.

There are five radio stations: the public service broadcaster [[Outre-Mer 1ère|RFO radio Nouvelle-Calédonie]], [[Océane FM]] (the collectivity's newest station), the youth-oriented station [[NRJ]], [[Radio Djiido]] (established by [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou]]), and [[Radio Rythmes Bleus]].&lt;ref name="vivmed"/&gt; The last two stations are primarily targeted to the various [[Kanak]] groups who are indigenous to New Caledonia ("Djiido" is a term from the [[Fwâi language]], spoken in [[Hienghène]] in the [[North Province, New Caledonia|North Province]], denoting a metal spike used to secure straw thatching to the roof of a traditional Kanak house).

The largest sporting event to be held in New Caledonia is a round of the [[FIA Asia Pacific Rally Championship]] (APRC).

The [[New Caledonia national football team|New Caledonia football team]] began playing in 1950, and was admitted into [[FIFA]], the international association of football leagues, in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=92706.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718153916/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=92706.html|archivedate=2007-07-18 |title=New Caledonia joins the world football community |website=FIFA.com |date=24 May 2004 |accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining FIFA, New Caledonia held observer status with the [[Oceania Football Confederation]], and became an official member of the OFC with its FIFA membership. They have won the [[South Pacific Games]] five times, most recently in 2007, and have placed third on two occasions in the [[OFC Nations Cup]]. [[Christian Karembeu]] is a prominent New Caledonian former footballer. The under-17 team qualified for the FIFA under 17 World Cup in 2017.

[[Horse racing]] is also very popular in New Caledonia, as are women's [[cricket]] matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/new-caledonia/noumea/activities/cricket/women-s-cricket |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rugby league]] team participated in the [[Pacific Cup]] in 2004.

New Caledonia also has a national synchronised swimming team, which tours abroad.

The "Tour Cycliste de Nouvelle-Calédonie" is a multi-day cycling stage race that is held usually in October. The race is organised by the Comite Cycliste New Caledonia. The race attracts riders from Australia, New Zealand, France, Reunion, Europe and Tahiti. Australian Brendan Washington has finished last three times in the race between 2005–2009, and is known in New Caledonia as "The [[Lanterne rouge|Lanterne Rouge]]".

The New Caledonia [[Handball]] team won the [[Oceania Handball Nations Cup]] in 2008 held in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]. They beat [[Australia national handball team|Australia]] in the final.

=== Cuisine ===
Due to low levels of domestic horticulture, fresh tropical fruits feature less highly in New Caledonian cuisine than in other Pacific nations, instead relying on rice, fish and root vegetables such as taro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newcaledoniatoday.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/what-do-people-eat-in-new-caledonia/ | website=Newcaledoniatoday.wordpress.com |title=What Do People Eat in New Caledonia? |accessdate=16 February 2014| date=2013-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this is frequently prepared is in a buried-oven-style feast, known as ''[[Bougna]]''. Wrapped in banana leaves, the fish, taro, banana and other seafood are buried with hot rocks to cook, then dug up and eaten.

The '''papal election of 1261''' (26 May – 29 August) took place after the death of [[Pope Alexander IV]] on 25 May and chose [[Pope Urban IV]] as his successor. Since Pope Alexander had been resident in Viterbo since the first week of May 1261, the meeting of the cardinals to elect his successor took place in the Episcopal Palace at Viterbo, which was next to the Cathedral of S. Lorenzo.&lt;ref&gt;Cristofori, pp.217-275, and, for the tomb of Alexander IV, pp. 277-285.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual date of the beginning of the  Electoral Meeting (there were, as yet, no Conclaves) is unknown.  If the canon of Pope Boniface III (A.D. 607) were still in effect (and there is no reason to think that it was not), then the Election could not begin until the third day after the Pope's burial.&lt;ref&gt;''Liber Pontificalis'' ('Doings of the Popes'), in ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' Scriptorum Vol. 5 (Hannover: Impensiis Bibliopolae Aulici Hanniani, 1844), p. 164 (ed. T. Mommsen)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Alexander IV had unwisely continued to pursue the policy of hostility against the [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty which had been begun by [[Pope Gregory IX]].  In 1261 the claimant was [[Conradin]], King of Sicily since 1254, but he had been supplanted by his uncle and guardian, [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred]].  This was not to the liking of Pope Alexander, who claimed the overlordship of south Italy and Sicily and the guardianship over young Conradin.  Immediately on his accession Alexander excommunicated Manfred. Manfred had himself crowned King of Sicily at Palermo on August 10, 1258.

==Cardinals, 1261==

Pope Alexander IV (1254-1261), sensitive to charges of nepotism made against his predecessor, Innocent IV (Fieschi), had appointed no cardinals at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Annales Sancti Justinae Patavini'' in G. Pertz (Editor), ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' Scriptorum  Volume XIX, p. 181):  ''Iste toto tempore sui regiminis nullum constituit cardinalem; nam cum quidam de cardinalibus edificare Syon in sanguinibus affectaret, quidam vero vellent viros ydoneos promovere, ipse licet haberet plenitudinem potestatis, timore tamen scandali neutram partem voluit exaudire''.  [http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1261.html Sede Vacante of 1261 (Dr. J. P. Adams).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Two cardinals besides Alexander himself had died since the last Election in 1254 (Aegidius (Gil Torres) and Guilelmo Fieschi); otherwise the electors were the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">'''Pjesma Mediterana''' (trans. ''Song of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]''), formerly ''Music Festival Budva'') was a pop music festival held every summer in [[Budva]], [[Montenegro]] until 2011. 

The festival began in 1992. There have been various sponsors of the festival, including: [[Komuna Belgrade|Komuna]], [[Music Star Production]] and the [[Budva|Municipality of Budva]]. Since 2008, the municipality of Budva, HTP Budvanska Rivijera (a tourist company in Budva) and Copyright Ltd. have run the organisation. The executive producer from 2008 is Copyright Ltd. In 2011, the festival was cancelled reportedly due to financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mondo.rs/s206330/Zabava/Zabava/Muzika/Otkazan_festival_Pjesma_Mediterana.html Otkazan festival "Pjesma Mediterana"];MTS Mondo, 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Festival==
Budva's summer music festival is the only open air music festival on the Balkans with a live band. The festival lasts three days. Day 1 and day 2 are the semi-finals and day 3 is the final day. It is usually held in June.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8515">In [[linguistics]], '''pre-stopping''', also known as '''pre-occlusion''' or '''pre-plosion''', is a phonological process involving the historical or allophonic insertion of a very short [[stop consonant]] before a [[sonorant consonant|sonorant]], such as a short {{IPA|[d]}} before a [[nasal occlusive|nasal]] {{IPA|[n]}} or a [[lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[l]}}. The resulting sounds ({{IPA|[ᵈn, ᵈl]}}) are called '''pre-stopped consonants''', or sometimes '''pre-ploded''' or (in Celtic linguistics) '''pre-occluded''' consonants, although technically {{IPA|[n]}} may be considered an [[stop consonant|occlusive/stop]] without the pre-occlusion.

A pre-stopped consonant behaves [[phonology|phonologically]] as a single consonant. That is, like [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s and [[trilled affricate]]s, the reasons for considering these sequences to be single consonants lies primarily in their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonetically they are similar or equivalent to stops with a [[nasal release|nasal]] or [[lateral release (phonetics)|lateral]] release.

==Terminology==
There are three terms for this phenomenon. The most common by far is ''prestopped/prestopping''.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ELL2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In descriptions of the languages of Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific, ''preploded/preplosion'' is common,&lt;ref&gt;Adelaar &amp; Himmelmann (2005) ''The Austronesian languages of Asia and Madagascar&lt;/ref&gt; though ''prestopped'' is also used.&lt;ref&gt;Botma (2004) ''Phonological Aspects of Nasality''&lt;/ref&gt; In accounts of Celtic languages, ''preoccluded/preocclusion'' is used almost exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;Ball &amp; Fife (2002) ''The Celtic Languages''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pre-occluded" is also used in Laver (1994) ''Principles of Phonetics''&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, nasals are already occlusives, and are often considered stops; however, some prefer to restrict the term 'stop' for consonants in which there is complete cessation of airflow, so 'prenasalized stop' and 'prestopped nasal' are not tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{SOWL|102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European languages==

In [[Manx language|Manx]], pre-occlusion occurs in stressed monosyllabic words (i.e. words one syllable long), and is also found in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] on certain stressed syllables. The inserted stop is homorganic with the sonorant, which means it has the same [[place of articulation]]. Long vowels are often shortened before pre-occluded sounds. In transcription, pre-occluding consonants in final position are typically written with a superscripted letter in Manx&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Nicholas. 1994. "An Mhanainnis", in ''Stair na Gaeilge: in ómós do Pádraig Ó Fiannachta''. Maigh Nuad: Roinn na Sean-Ghaeilge, Colásite Phádraig. §X.4.10. {{ISBN|0-901519-90-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Nicholas. 2006. "Pre-occlusion in Cornish", in ''Writing on Revived Cornish''. Cathair na Mart: Evertype. {{ISBN|978-1-904808-08-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples in Manx include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broderick |first=George |title=A Handbook of Late Spoken Manx |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFtiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pgis=1 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |publisher=Niemeyer |location=Tübingen |year=1984–86 |isbn=3-484-42903-8 |id=(vol.&amp;nbsp;1). {{ISBN|3-484-42904-6}} (vol.&amp;nbsp;2)., {{ISBN|3-484-42905-4}} (vol.&amp;nbsp;3)|pages=3:28–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broderick |first=George |pages=228–85 [236] |chapter=Manx |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnCqZ5p60VoC&amp;pg=PA228 |editor=M.&amp;nbsp;J. Ball and J. Fife (eds.) |title=The Celtic Languages |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1993 |isbn=0-415-01035-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/m/}} → {{IPA|[ᵇm]}}: {{lang|gv|trome}} {{IPA|/t̪roːm/}} → {{IPA|[t̪roᵇm]}} "heavy"
* {{IPA|/l/}} → {{IPA|[ᵈl]}}: {{lang|gv|shooyll}} {{IPA|/ʃuːl/}} → {{IPA|[ʃuːᵈl]}} "walking"
* {{IPA|/n/}} → {{IPA|[ᵈn]}}: {{lang|gv|kione}} {{IPA|/kʲoːn/}} → {{IPA|[kʲoᵈn]}} "head"
* {{IPA|/nʲ/}} → {{IPA|[ᵈnʲ]}}: {{lang|gv|ein}} {{IPA|/eːnʲ/}} → {{IPA|[eːᵈnʲ]}} "birds"
* {{IPA|/ŋ/}} → {{IPA|[ᶢŋ]}}: {{lang|gv|lhong}} {{IPA|/luŋ/}} → {{IPA|[luᶢŋ]}} "ship"

In Cornish, pre-occlusion mostly affects the reflexes of older geminate/fortis {{IPA|/m/}}, intrinsically geminated in Old Cornish, and {{IPA|/nn/}} (or /N/ depending on preferred notation). It also arises in a few cases where the combination {{IPA|/n+j/}} was apparently re-interpreted as {{IPA|/nnʲ/}}.

Examples in [[Cornish language|Cornish]]:
* {{IPA|/m#/}} → {{IPA|[ᵇm]}}: {{lang|kw|mabm}} {{IPA|[mæᵇm]}} "mother"
* {{IPA|/VmV/}} → {{IPA|[bm]}}: {{lang|kw|hebma}} {{IPA|[ˈhɛbmɐ]}} "this"
* {{IPA|/nn#/}} → {{IPA|[ᵈn]}}: {{lang|kw|pedn}} {{IPA|[pɛᵈn]}} "head"
* {{IPA|/VnnV/}} → {{IPA|[dn]}}: {{lang|kw|pednow}} {{IPA|[ˈpɛdnɔ(ʊ)]}} "heads"

In [[Faroese language|Faroese]], pre-occlusion also occurs, as in ''kallar'' {{IPA|[ˈkatlaɹ]}} 'you call, he calls', ''seinna'' {{IPA|[ˈsaiːtna]}} 'latter'. A similar feature occurs in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], as in ''galli'' {{IPA|[ˈkatlɪ]}} ('error'); ''sæll'' {{IPA|[ˈsaitl̥]}}, ''seinna'' {{IPA|[ˈseitna]}}; ''Spánn'' {{IPA|[ˈspautn̥]}}.

==In Australian languages==
Pre-stopped nasals and laterals are found in some [[Indigenous Australian languages|Australian Aboriginal languages]], such as [[Kuyani language|Kuyani]] (Adnyamathanha), [[Arabana language|Arabana]], [[Wangkangurru language|Wangkangurru]], [[Diyari language|Diyari]], [[Aranda language|Aranda]] (nasals only), and [[Martuthunira language|Martuthunira]] (laterals only).&lt;ref&gt;Mielke 2008:135&lt;/ref&gt; Adnyamathanha, for example, has the pre-stopped nasals {{IPA|[bm, ɟɲ, d̪n̪, dn, ɖɳ&amp;thinsp;]}} and the pre-stopped laterals {{IPA|[&amp;thinsp;ɟʎ, d̪l̪, dl, ɖɭ&amp;thinsp;]}}, though these are all in allophonic variation with the simple nasals and laterals {{IPA|[m, ɲ, n̪, n, ɳ&amp;thinsp;, ʎ, l̪, l, ɭ&amp;thinsp;]}}.

==In Mon–Khmer languages==
Pre-stopped nasals are also found in several branches of [[Austroasiatic]], especially in the [[North Aslian languages]] and [[Shompen language|Shompen]], where historical word-final nasals, *m *n *ŋ, have become pre-stopped, or even full voiced stops {{IPA|[b d ɡ]}}.

==In Austronesian languages==
[[Hiw language|Hiw]] of Vanuatu is the only [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language that has been reported to have a pre-stopped [[velar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|/ᶢʟ/}}.&lt;ref name="Francois"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its phonological behavior clearly defines it as a prestopped [[lateral approximant|lateral]], rather than as a [[Lateral release (phonetics)|laterally released stop]].&lt;ref name="Francois"/&gt;

[[Nemi language|Nemi]] of New Caledonia has consonants that have been described as ''[[Nasal release|postnasalized]]'' stops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ozanne-Rivierre|1995|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but could possibly be described as prestopped nasals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2010|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Independent''''' is a newspaper published in [[Nigeria]]. It is based in [[Lagos]].
Independent Newspapers Limited was incorporated on 17 July 2001 and started operations in October 2001. 
The company publishes the flagship ''Independent'' newspaper, and the ''Saturday Independent'' and ''Sunday Independent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The ''Independent'' is a successor to the ''Diet'' newspaper established in 1997 by [[James Ibori]], a close friend of the military ruler General [[Sani Abacha]]. By 1999 most of the ''Diet'' staff had left since they had not been paid for some months. Ibori, who had been elected governor of [[Delta State]] in April 1999, relaunched the paper in a more colorful and attractive format, but without success. In 2001 the ''Daily Independent'', largely owned by the same publisher, took the place of ''Diet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In June 2006 Rotimi Durojaiye, an ''Independent'' reporter, was arrested and charged with sedition after writing a report questioning the cost and airworthiness of [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s new presidential jet. The charges were dropped later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In October 2009 the Nigerian Union of Journalists forced a closure of the newspaper. Reasons given were that the paper's management had refused to pay four months’ salary arrears and had sacked 21 workers for no just reason. Owner James Ibori intervened, promising to pay the arrears and re-hire the workers, and the strike was called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The former managing editor, Ted Iwere, left the paper because of these problems. In January 2010 James Akpadem, the new managing editor, said that Ibori was actively involved in efforts to restructure the paper, which was struggling with debt and unpaid salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2010 the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (EFCC) asked that Ibori attend the Abuja headquarters of the Commission on 17 April 2010 "for interview". The ''Daily Independent'' published an editorial that indignantly defended Ibori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Ibori was arrested in May 2010 in [[Dubai]], in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. He lost an appeal against a ruling that he should be extradited to Britain.&lt;ref name=Channels20110416/&gt;
By April 2011 the EFCC had Inori on its "most wanted" list, saying "The suspect is wanted in connection with a N9.2 billion case of Criminal Conspiracy,Theft and Misappriopriation of Public funds belonging to Delta State of Nigeria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Fall of the Imam''''' is a novel by Egyptian writer [[Nawal El Saadawi]] published in [[Arabic]] in 1987. The English translation by the author's husband [[Sherif Hetata]] was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?cs=frb&amp;ct=frb&amp;frbg=404080231&amp;fctN=facet_frbrgroupid&amp;fctV=404080231&amp;doc=BLL01015117477&amp;lastPag=&amp;lastPagIndx=1&amp;rfnGrp=frbr&amp;frbrSrt=rank&amp;dscnt=1&amp;scp.scps=scope:(BLCONTENT)&amp;frbg=&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1438004927519&amp;srt=rank&amp;ct=search&amp;mode=Basic&amp;vl(488279563UI0)=any&amp;dum=true&amp;tb=t&amp;indx=1&amp;vl(freeText0)=the+fall+of+the+imam&amp;fn=search&amp;vid=BLVU1|title=Explore the British Library|website=Catalogue.bl.uk|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Plot summary ==
Set in an unnamed Arabic country, the two main characters are The Imam, the hypocritical leader of the country, full of hatred and spite towards anybody born more fortunate than him, and a beautiful illegitimate orphan, Bint Allah (Daughter of God). The story centres around two extremely grisly events. First, the stoning and mutilation of a woman, performed more to terrorize his opponents and silence his critics than to conform to God’s will, leaves the reader in no doubt as to the brutality of the ruling power. The second event is the assassination of the Imam himself, and the turmoil this brings to the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/2119/the-fall-of-the-imam-by-nawal-el-saadawi|title=The Fall of the Imam by Nawal El Saadawi|website=Newhumanist.org.uk|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegrambooks.com/archives/the_fall_of_the_imam/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915075308/http://www.telegrambooks.com/archives/the_fall_of_the_imam/ |archivedate=2015-09-15 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''USA-135''', also known as '''GPS IIA-19''', '''GPS II-28''' and '''GPS SVN-38''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the last of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-135 was launched at 00:30:00 UTC on 6 November 1997, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D249, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-135 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 1997, USA-135 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|19912|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20449|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.9 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts the PRN 08 signal, and operates in slot 3 of plane A of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;!--note, this reference incorrectly identifies the satellite as USA-134--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}.
