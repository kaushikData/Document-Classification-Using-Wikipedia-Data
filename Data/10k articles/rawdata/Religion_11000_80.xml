==Partnership with Raise Their Voice==
ABW partnered with Raise Their Voice throughout the [[2012 tour of She Has a Name|2012 tour]] of [[Andrew Kooman]]'s ''[[She Has a Name]]''; while the play toured across [[Canada]] to raise awareness about [[human trafficking]], ABW raised money to help women and children who had been [[Human trafficking in Thailand|trafficked in Thailand]] as part of [[Prostitution in Thailand|the country's prostitution industry]].&lt;ref name=Zielinski/&gt; Specifically, the money raised went to Home of New Beginnings, a [[safe house]] established in [[Bangkok]] in 2006, where former human trafficking victims can receive [[life skills-based education]] and spiritual healing, thereby allowing them to attain a healthy and financially stable lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Zielinski/&gt; At the time of the 2012 tour of the play, Home of New Beginnings had 17 residents, the oldest being 33 and the youngest being 11.&lt;ref name=Zielinski/&gt; From their fundraising initiative with Raise Their Voice, ABW hoped to raise $12000 to pay an outstanding property bill, $18000 to buy two [[auto rickshaw]]s, $9000 to finance a training building, $9000 to buy [[vocational education]] equipment, and $5000 to finance a gift shop in which the residents sell products they have made, such as [[Baking|baked goods]].&lt;ref name=Zielinski/&gt; All five members of Raise Their Voice had previous connections with ABW, and the plan to have the two organizations working in conjunction had been developing since 2011.&lt;ref name=Zielinski/&gt; The [[Programme (booklet)|program]] passed out at each performance recommended ABW to audiences as a good organization to support, as well as listing the websites of several other [[nonprofit organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=[[Red Deer Advocate]]|author=Lana Michelin|date=May 15, 2012|title=Playwright tells story of human trafficking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abhirami Anthadhi''' ({{lang-ta|அபிராமி அந்தாதி}}, Apirāmi antāti) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] collection of poems sung on goddess [[Parvati|Abhirami]] resided in [[Amritaghateswarar-Abirami Temple,Thirukkadaiyur|Thirukkadaiyur Amirtaghatesvarar Sivan Temple]], situated in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. This poetry was composed by [[Abirami Pattar|Abhirami Bhattar]] lived in 18th century CE, a contemporary to [[Serfoji I]] of [[Tanjore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Abirami Anthadhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y750cWcGdAoC|publisher=Bharathi Puthakalayam|id=GGKEY:U14F6GRRXST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Saktism}}
"Andhaathi"({{lang-ta|அந்தாதி}}, Antāti) is a classification of [[Tamil poetry]] in which last word of a previous verse comes as the first word of next verse. Thus this kind of poem gots its name, Antam (அந்தம்,the end) + āti (ஆதி, the beginning) = Antāti. Since this anthadhi was sung on goddess Abhirami residing in [[Thirukkadaiyur|Thirukkadavur]], [[Tamil Nadu]], it is known as '''Abhirami Anthadhi'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://truthdive.com/2014/03/09/abirami-anthathi-the-beauty-of-accompanying-abirami.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although Tamil literature consists of hundreds of Anthadhi songs, Abhirami Anthadi is praised as one of the prominent Anthadhi songs of Tamil literature.&lt;ref name="SkodaNielsen2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Uwe Skoda|author2=Kenneth Bo Nielsen|author3=Marianne Qvortrup Fibiger|title=Navigating Social Exclusion and Inclusion in Contemporary India and Beyond: Structures, Agents, Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IeiVd2FK_AC&amp;pg=PA67|date=1 June 2013|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-322-1|pages=55–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthadhi==
{{Main|Abirami Pattar}}
It is said that the author of this song, Abhirami Bhattar, was an ardent devotee of goddess [[Shakti]]. Once when king [[Serfoji I]] visited the Thirukkadavur temple on the day of the new moon and asked him what day it is, he mistakenly said that it was a full moon day. This made the king angry and sentenced Bhattar to death. Legend says that he sung this anthadhi until the goddess appeared in front of him and threw her earring towards the sky, which lit the sky bright like the full moon. Tamil [[Saktism|Shaktas]] believe that recitation of Abhirami Anthadhi on the full moon and new moon days will result in impossible boons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.raaga.com/channels/tamil/moviedetail.asp?mid=td01110&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stanzas ==
There are a hundred stanzas plus a ''காப்பு'' (Kāppu, protection) verse for lord [[Ganesha]] and a final ''பயன்'' (Payaṉ, outcome), thus a total of 102 stanzas that are included in Abhirami Anthadhi. The author praises Abhirami as his own mother, regrets his mistakes, speaks of the divine play of mother and father [[Sivan]], and her simplicity &amp; mercy. It is believed that recitation of each stanza will result in the specific achievement of the devotees. Here is one of the famous stanzas of Abhirami Anthadhi:

{{cquote|''" மணியே, மணியின் ஒளியே, ஒளிரும் மணி புனைந்த &lt;br/&gt;
அணியே, அணியும் அணிக்கு அழகே, அணுகாதவர்க்குப் &lt;br/&gt;
பிணியே, பிணிக்கு மருந்தே, அமரர் பெரு விருந்தே.&lt;br/&gt;
பணியேன், ஒருவரை நின் பத்ம பாதம் பணிந்தபின்னே."'' - செய்யுள் 24}}

{{cquote|''" Maṇiyē, maṇiyiṉ oḷiyē, oḷirum maṇi puṉainta &lt;br/&gt;
aṇiyē, aṇiyum aṇikku aḻakē, aṇukātavarkkup &lt;br/&gt;
piṇiyē, piṇikku maruntē, amarar peru viruntē.- &lt;br/&gt;
Paṇiyēṉ, oruvarai niṉ patma pātam paṇintapiṉṉē."''  -  stanza 24}}

Pearl like you are, You who are the reddish aura of the pearl!&lt;br/&gt;
You are like the pearl studded chain who adds beauty to the chain,&lt;br/&gt;
You are pain to those who do not fall at your feet while the panacea for pains of those who fall at your feet, the nectar of Gods,&lt;br/&gt;
After worshipping at thine lotus feet, Will I bow before any other, Now and now after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appusami.com/HTML/htmlv101/main/abirami_anthathi%20english.asp Abhirami Anthadhi English Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The beauty of Abhirami Anthathi:''' &lt;br/&gt;
''காப்பு'' starts as ″'''தா'''ர் அமர் கொன்றையும்...″ and ''பயன்'' ends as ″... தீங்கு இல்லை'''யே'''″ ('''தாயே''')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5627">{{short description|Ancient Roman mythological figure}}
'''Acca Larentia''' or '''Acca Larentina''' was a mythical woman, later goddess, in [[Roman mythology]] whose festival, the [[Larentalia]], was celebrated on December 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofgo00jord|title=Encyclopedia of gods : over 2,500 deities of the world|last=Jordan|first=Michael|date=1993|publisher=New York : Facts on File|others=Internet Archive|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foster mother==
In one mythological tradition (that of [[Licinius Macer]], et al.), she was the wife of the shepherd [[Faustulus]], and therefore the adoptive mother of [[Romulus and Remus]], whom she is said to have saved after they were thrown into the [[Tiber]] on the orders of [[Amulius]].  She had twelve sons, and on the death of one of them Romulus took his place, and with the remaining eleven founded the college of the Arval brothers ([[Fratres Arvales]]).&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Massurius Sabinus]] in [[Aulus Gellius]] (I. c.)&lt;/ref&gt;  She is therefore identified with the [[Dea Dia]] of that collegium. The [[flamen]] [[Quirinalis]] acted in the role of [[Romulus]] (deified as [[Quirinus]]) to perform funerary rites for his foster mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Licinius Macer|Macer]], apud Macrob. I.e.; [[Ovid]] Fast. iii. 55, &amp;c. ; Plin. PI. N. xviii. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefactor of Rome==
Another tradition holds that Larentia was a beautiful girl of notorious reputation, roughly the same age as [[Romulus and Remus]], during the reign of [[Ancus Marcius]] in the 7th&amp;nbsp;century BCE. She was awarded to [[Hercules]] as a prize in a game of dice by the guardian of his temple, and locked in it with his other prize, a feast. When the god no longer had need of her, he advised her to marry the first man she met as she stepped out that morning, who turned out to be a wealthy Etruscan named Carutius (or [[Tarutius|Tarrutius]], according to [[Plutarch]]). Larentia later inherited all his property and bequeathed it to the Roman people.

Ancus, in gratitude for this, allowed her to be buried in the [[Velabrum]], and instituted an annual festival, the [[Larentalia]], at which sacrifices were offered to the [[Lares (Roman deities)|Lares]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare Varro, ''De lingua Latina'' V. p.&amp;nbsp;85, ed. Bip.&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch explicitly states that this Laurentia was a different person from the Laurentia who was married to Faustulus, although other writers, such as [[Licinius Macer]], relate their stories as belonging to the same individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius|Macrobius]] ''[[Saturnalia (Macrobius)|Saturnalia]]'' I. 10; [[Plutarch]], Romulus, 4, 5, Quaest. Rom. 35; Aulus Genius vi. 7; [[Valerius Antias]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornblower |first=Simon |title=Acca Larentia |encyclopedia=[[The Oxford Classical Dictionary]] |page=3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitute==
Yet another tradition holds that Larentia was neither the wife of Faustulus nor the consort of Hercules, but a prostitute called "lupa" by the shepherds (literally "she-wolf", but colloquially "courtesan"), and who left the fortune she amassed through sex work to the Roman people.&lt;ref&gt;Valer. Ant. ap. Gell. I. c,; Livy, i. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to Lares==
Whatever may be thought of the contradictory accounts of Acca Laurentia, it seems clear that she was of [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] origin, and connected with the worship of the [[Lares]], from which her name may or may not be derived.  This relation is also apparent in the number of her sons, which corresponds to that of the twelve country Lares.&lt;ref&gt;Macrob. Sat. I. c.; compare M'uller, Etrusleer, ii. p. 103, &amp;c.; Hartung, Die Religion der Romer^ ii. p. 144, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Schmitz  | first = Leonhard  | author-link = Leonhard Schmitz  | contribution = Acca Larentia  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 6  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0015.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T.P. Wiseman]] explores the connections among Acca Larentia, Lara, and [[Larunda]] in his books ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' and ''The Myths of Rome''.

==Functions==
Like [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], [[Terra (mythology)|Tellus]], [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] and others, Acca Laurentia symbolized the fertility of the earth, in particular the city lands and their crops.  Acca Larentia is also identified with [[Larentina]], [[Mana Genita]], and [[Muta (deity)|Muta]].

==In modern literature==
Acca is a character in [[David Drake]]'s story "To Bring the Light",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Drake |author-link=David Drake |article=To Bring the Light |year=1996 |publisher=[[Baen Books|Baen]] |edition=double |title=Lest Darkness Fall and To Bring the Light}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Drake |author-link=David Drake |article=To Bring the Light |year=2011 |edition=anthology |title=[[Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reconstruction of Rome's beginnings around 751&amp;nbsp;BCE. She is depicted as a sympathetic village woman in the small shepherd community on [[Palatine Hill]] from which Rome would begin.

The '''''Alba Bible''''' is a 1430 [[illuminated manuscript]] translation of the [[Old Testament]] made directly from [[Hebrew]] into [[Mediaeval Castilian]]. The translation was carried out under the direction of Moses Arragel, [[rabbi]] of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] community of [[Maqueda]] in the [[Spain|Spanish]] province of [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]], at the behest of Don Luis de Guzmán, Grand Master of the military-religious [[Order of Calatrava]].&lt;ref&gt;Finn Business Services Pty.

==History==
[[File:The-zeal-of-phinehas-15th-c.jpg|thumb|The Zeal of [[Phinehas]]]]
During the 15th century, many people within Spanish society held hostile views toward Jews. In the aftermath of a series of anti-Semitic riots centered in Madrid,&lt;ref name="classic"&gt;University of Wisconsin (2001). ''[http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg003.htm The Bible.

Retrieved October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Don Luis de Guzmán believed that he could help heal the rift and build a bridge of understanding between Christians and Jews by commissioning a Castilian translation of the Old Testament from the original [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], accompanied by commentary from Jewish scholars interpreting the text of their holy book.&lt;ref&gt;Old Manuscripts &amp; Incunabula (2006). ''[http://www.omifacsimiles.com/cats/facs.html Facsimile Editions London: The Alba Bible]''. Retrieved October 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 1422, Don Luis de Guzmán initiated his project by sending a letter to rabbi Moses Arragel inviting him to compose ''"vna biblia en rromançe, glosada e ystoriada."''  It is not known what convinced rabbi Arragel to accept as he initially demurred in an extensive reply letter to Guzmán. Nevertheless, eight years later the bible was completed.&lt;ref&gt;''A Blurred Encounter in Moses Arragel's Epistle on the Alba Bible''. Wallace S.

From 1492, the year in which the [[Alhambra Decree]] issued mandating the expulsion of all Jews from Spain, until 1622, when it resurfaced in the Palace of Liria owned by the [[House of Alba]], the whereabouts of the Alba Bible were unknown. In 1922 an illustrated facsimile edition of 300 copies was published by the scholar Antonio Paz y Meliá.  In 1992, to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the expulsion, Mauricio Hatchwell Toledano, President of the Fundacion Amigos de Sefarad published 500 copies in an exact [[facsimile]] edition, one of which was given to [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], the reigning [[List of Spanish monarchs|King of Spain]].&lt;ref name="facsimile"&gt;Facsimile Editions Limited (2006).

Today the original Alba Bible is preserved by the [[House of Alba]], and is on exhibition in the [[Liria Palace|Palace of Liria]], in [[Madrid]]. The original Bible has been valued at 2.5 million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref name="noticias"/&gt; Copies of the 500 limited edition [[facsimile]] copies reproduced in 1992 sell for upwards of US$44,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/ab Facsimile Editions Limited, London]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Allahdad''' was an 1839 violent riot and forced conversion against the Jews of [[Mashhad]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],  [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]]. After [[anusim|forced conversion]] of the Mashhadi Jews to [[Islam]], many practiced [[Crypto-Judaism]]. The incident was important in the aspect that an entire community was forced to convert, and it was one of the first times European Jewry intervened on behalf of Iranian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Between Foreigners and Shiis, Daniel Tsadik, page 35,  Stanford University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was first described in [[Joseph Wolff]]'s 1845 travelogue "Narrative of a mission to Bokhara", in which he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On Monday, the 11th of March, I arrived at Askerea, two miles distant from Meshed. I had sent on before the King's [[:wiktionary: mehmandar|mehmoondar]], and the gholam of the British embassy. The first who came to meet me was Mullah Mehdee (Meshiakh), the Jew with whom I had lodged twelve years ago, and who treated me most hospitably when in distress and misery and poverty, previous to the arrival of [[Abbas Mirza]] at Meshed, from [[Nishapur|Nishapoor]].

All the Jews of Meshed, a hundred and fifty families, were compelled seven years ago, to turn Mussulmans. The occasion was as follows: A poor woman had a sore hand; a Mussulman physician advised her to kill a dog and put her hand in the blood of it; she did so; when suddenly the whole population rose, and said that they had done it in derision of their Prophet. Thirty-five Jews were killed in a few minutes; the rest, struck with terror, became Muhammedans ; and fanatic and covetous Muhammedans shouted, "Light of Muhammed has fallen upon them!" They are now more zealous Jews in secret than ever; but call themselves, like the Jews in Spain, Anusim, "the compelled ones!" Their children cannot suppress their feelings when their parents call them by their Muhammedan names! But Mullah Mehdee and Mullah Moshe believe in Christ, and Mullah Mehdee asked me to baptize him. He has been of the greatest use to the English in [[Herut|Heraut]] and [[Kandahar|Candahar]], as his testimonials from [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Rawlinson]] and others amply testify.&lt;ref&gt;''Narrative of a mission to Bokhara, in the years 1843-1845, to ascertain the fate of Colonel Stoddart and Captain Conolly'', '''[https://archive.org/stream/narrativeamissi00unkngoog#page/n155/mode/1up page 147]''', London, J.W. Parker, 1845.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another narrative of the same event this incident happened during the Shia holy month on Muharram. The Shias were marching in the streets in memory of Hussein ibn Ali when the Jewish woman was throwing away the dog she killed for medical reasons. She was accused of deliberately offending the shi'is.&lt;ref&gt;Between Foreigners and Shi'is, Daniel Tsadik, Stanford University Press, 2007, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Still another narrative reports that the dog was only a pretext and the conflict was because of earlier confrontations between a Sayyid (descendent of Muhammad) and the Jews who did not want to pay him for the Husainia he built near the Jewish commercial shops. &lt;ref&gt;Between Foreigners and Shi'is, Daniel Tsadik, Stanford University Press, 2007, page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In any case the recommendation by a Muslim physician seems unlikely as both Islamic and Jewish laws would consider dog's blood to be impure. 

Mashhad's ruler{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} had ordered his men to enter [[Jew]]ish homes and mobs attacked the Jewish community, burning down the synagogue, looting homes, abducting girls, and killing between 30 and 40 people. With knives held to their throats, the Jewish patriarchs were forced to vocally proclaim their "allegiance" to Islam as it was agreed upon by the leaders of the community that in order to save the remaining 2,400 Jews, everyone must convert. Most converted and stayed in Mashhad, taking on Muslim names, while some left for other Iranian Jewish communities and to Afghanistan. That day became known as the ''Allahdad'' ("God’s Justice").&lt;ref name="Hadassah"&gt;{{cite web
  | date = Spring 2003
  | title = Mashhadi Jews in New-York
  | url = http://dangoor.com/issue76/articles/76014.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event might also be understood in larger Jewish-Persian relations. Many Jews of Mashhad, including the chief of the local Jewish community, Mullah Mahdi Aqajan, served as British agents. This fact in addition to recent withdrawal of Iran from Herat in 1838 under British pressure, created an increasingly hostile atmosphere towards the Jews in Mashhad. &lt;ref&gt;Between Foreigners and Shiis, Daniel Tsadik, page 35,  Stanford University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Few years after the incident with the intervention of [[Moses Montefiore]] the head of British Jewry at the time, Jews were allowed by [[Muhammad Shah]]'s decree to return to Judaism. However most Jews fearing the anger of the local population decided to live outwardly as Muslims and living as [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]]. &lt;ref&gt;Between Foreigners and Shiis, Daniel Tsadik, page 36,  Stanford University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
On the outside, they acted as Muslims: their clothes, names, and lifestyles resembled those of their Iranian neighbors. At home, however, they secretly taught their children to read [[Hebrew]], lit candles, and observed [[Shabbat]].&lt;ref name="Patai"&gt;{{cite book

Some Mashhadi Jews did not feel safe in Mashhad anymore and decided to move to other cities in the area such as [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand|Samarqand]]. A large group moved to [[Herat]] in present-day [[Afghanistan]], where the majority of the Muslims were [[Sunni]] and more tolerant of the Jews than the Shiites.&lt;ref&gt;The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times, Reeva S. Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer, Columbia University Press, Aug 13, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a century passed before Mashad's Jews started practicing their faith openly with the coming of the more liberal [[Pahlavi dynasty]] (1925–1979). After World War II, most of them settled in [[Tehran]], [[Israel]], or [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/CafeOleh/AskTheExpert/Article.aspx?id=72872 "The double lives of Mashhadi Jews"], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', August 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with 4,000 moving to the [[United States]], where many ran successful jewelry and carpet businesses. The commercial district in [[Great Neck]], [[New York (state)|New York]], has been reshaped to serve the needs of Mashhadis and other [[Iranian Jews]]. Many businesses there cater to Iranian customs and taste. 

Worldwide there are 20,000 Mashhadis, of which about 10,000 live in Israel. Of the Mashhadis in the United States, many of them live in Great Neck, New York.

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Amulon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|j|uː|l|ɒ|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ăm´yū-län»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] that lived in the 2nd century BC.  He was one of the wicked priests of the ill-fated [[King Noah]].  Upon [[King Noah]]'s death and the invasion of the [[Lamanites]] into the [[land of Nephi]], Amulon and a group of priests (later dubbed [[Amulonites]]) fled into the wilderness where they kidnapped 24 Lamanite women to be their new wives. The Amulonites were later found by the [[Lamanite]] army in a place which they had named Amulon (after their leader).  After persuading the Lamanites to spare their lives, the people joined the Lamanites in returning to the land of Nephi, only to stumble upon the group settled at Helam, led by [[Alma the Elder]] (who was also once a priest of King Noah). Amulon was then placed as a puppet ruler by the [[Lamanites]] over the people at Helam.

'''Archana''' is a special, personal, abbreviated [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] done by temple priests in which the name, [[Hindu astrology|birth star]] and family lineage of a devotee are recited to invoke individual guidance and [[blessing]]s. Archana also refers to chanting the names of the Deity, which is a central part of every puja. The [[Sanskrit]] meaning is "honouring, praising."

Archana is also a common Indian female name. It means adoring or dedicated.

''Buddhi'' ({{lang-sa|बुद्धि}}) is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit root ''Budh'' (बुध् ), which literally means "to wake, be awake, observe, heed, attend, learn, become aware of, to know, be conscious again".&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|author2=Ernst Leumann|author3=Carl Cappeller|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3105-6|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears extensively in [[Rigveda]] and other Vedic literature.&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt; ''Buddhi'' means, states Monier Williams, the power to "form, retain concepts; intelligence, reason, intellect, mind", the intellectual faculty and the ability to "discern, judge, comprehend, understand" something.&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha2013p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jadunath Sinha |title=Indian Psychology Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmBGAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-34605-7 |pages=120–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhi is a feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun derived from ''*budh'', to be [[awake]], to [[understanding|understand]], to [[know]]. The same root is the basis for the more familiar masculine form ''[[Buddha]]'' and the [[abstract noun]] ''[[bodhi]]''.

Buddhi contrasts from ''manas'' (मनस्) which means "mind", and ''[[ahamkara]]'' (अहंंकाऱ) which means "ego, I-sense in egotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|author2=Ernst Leumann|author3=Carl Cappeller|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3105-6|pages=124, 783-784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha2013p120"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianwhicherp18&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Whicher|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3815-2|pages=18, 71, 77, 92–95, 219, 231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In [[Samkhya]] and [[yoga|yogic philosophy]] both the mind and the ego are forms in the realm of nature (''[[prakriti]]'') that have emerged into materiality as a function of the three ''[[gunas]]'' (ग़ुण) through a misapprehension of ''[[purusha]]'' (पुरूष) (the consciousness-essence of the ''[[jiva]]tman''). Discriminative in nature (बुद्धि निश्चयात्मिका चित्त-वृत्ति), ''buddhi'' is that which is able to discern truth (''[[satya]]'') from falsehood and thereby to make wisdom possible.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

'''David ben Abraham ha-Laban''' ('''דוד בן אברהם הלבן''') was a French religious philosopher and [[kabalist]] who lived after 1200. His grandfather, Judah, was rabbi of [[Coucy-le-Château]]. 

David was the author of ''Masoret ha-Berit'' (The Bond of the Covenant), on the existence, the unity, and the attributes of God, and also on creation and its purpose (Paris MSS. Nos. 800, 871). The fact that the work exists in several manuscript copies shows that it was much read.

'''Emma Goldman''' ({{OldStyleDateNY|June 27|June 15}}, 1869{{spaced ndash}}May 14, 1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] political activist and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century.

Born in Kovno, [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885.&lt;ref name=UIC&gt;University of Illinois at Chicago [http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/EGoldmanb.html Biography of Emma Goldman] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911140147/http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/EGoldmanb.html |date=September 11, 2013 }}. UIC Library Emma Goldman Collection. Retrieved on December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Attracted to anarchism after the [[Haymarket affair]], Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands.&lt;ref name = UIC/&gt; She and anarchist writer [[Alexander Berkman]], her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier [[Henry Clay Frick]] as an act of [[propaganda of the deed]]. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892 and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about [[birth control]]. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''.

In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to "induce persons not to register" for the [[conscription in the United States|newly instated draft]]. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with 248 others—and deported to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]]. Initially supportive of that country's [[October Revolution]] that brought the [[Bolsheviks]] to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]; she denounced the [[Soviet Union]] for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923, and published a book about her experiences, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''. While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called ''[[Living My Life]]''. It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], Goldman traveled to Spain to support the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|anarchist revolution]] there. She died in [[Toronto]], Canada, on May 14, 1940, aged 70.

During her life, Goldman was lionized as a [[freethought|freethinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[prison abolition movement|prisons]], [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and [[homosexuality]]. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.

== Biography ==

=== Family ===
Emma Goldman was born into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family in Kovno in the Russian Empire, which is now known as [[Kaunas]] in [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman's mother Taube Bienowitch had been married before to a man with whom she had two daughters—Helena in 1860 and Lena in 1862. When her first husband died of [[tuberculosis]], Taube was devastated. Goldman later wrote: "Whatever love she had had died with the young man to whom she had been married at the age of fifteen."&lt;ref name="EGLiv447"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taube's second [[arranged marriage|marriage was arranged]] by her family and, as Goldman puts it, "mismated from the first".&lt;ref name="EGLiv447"/&gt; Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube's inheritance in a business that quickly failed. The ensuing hardship, combined with the emotional distance of husband and wife, made the household a tense place for the children. When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would be one more sign of failure.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma.&lt;ref&gt;The order of birth is unclear; Wexler (in ''Intimate'', p. 13) notes that although Goldman writes as being her mother's fourth child, her brother Louis (who died at the age of six) was probably born after her.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emma Goldman was born on June 27, 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father used violence to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.&lt;ref name="EGLiv447"/&gt;

Goldman's relationships with her elder half-sisters, Helena and Lena, were a study in contrasts. Helena, the oldest, provided the comfort the children lacked from their mother; she filled Goldman's childhood with "whatever joy it had".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Lena, however, was distant and uncharitable.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The three sisters were joined by brothers Louis (who died at the age of six), Herman (born in 1872), and Moishe (born in 1879).&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adolescence ===
[[File:Emma Goldman's family.jpg|thumb|right|Emma Goldman's family in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1882. From left to right: Emma, standing; Helena, seated, with Morris on her lap; Taube; Herman; Abraham.]]
When Emma was a young girl, the Goldman family moved to the village of [[Papilė]], where her father ran an inn. While her sisters worked, she became friends with a servant named Petrushka, who excited her "first erotic sensations".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in Papilė she witnessed a peasant being whipped with a [[knout]] in the street. This event traumatized her and contributed to her lifelong distaste for violent authority.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of seven, Goldman moved with her family to the Prussian city of [[Königsberg]] (then part of the German Empire), and she was enrolled in a ''[[Realschule]]''. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and she was unable to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to the Russian capital of [[Saint Petersburg]], where her father opened one unsuccessful store after another. Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs, including one in a [[corset]] shop.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager Goldman begged her father to allow her to return to school, but instead he threw her French book into the fire and shouted: "Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to know is how to prepare [[gefilte fish]], cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty of children."&lt;ref name="EGLiv12"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman pursued an independent education [[autodidact|on her own]], however, and soon began to study the political turmoil around her, particularly the [[Nihilist movement|Nihilists]] responsible for assassinating [[Alexander II of Russia]]. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]]'s novel, ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera. She adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing [[cooperative]]. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source of inspiration throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father, meanwhile, continued to insist on a domestic future for her, and he tried to arrange for her to be married at the age of fifteen. They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a "loose" woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone.&lt;ref name="JC16"&gt;Chalberg, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men. One persistent suitor took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman described as "violent contact";&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; two biographers call it rape.&lt;ref name="JC16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''Love'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; She was stunned by the experience, overcome by "shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful."&lt;ref name="EGLiv23"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman felt that the encounter forever soured her interactions with men.&lt;ref name="EGLiv23"/&gt;

=== Rochester, New York ===
[[File:Emma goldman 1886.jpg|thumb|upright|Emma Goldman in 1886]]
In 1885, her sister Helena made plans to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer to pay for the trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman threatened to throw herself into the [[Neva River]] if she could not go. Their father finally agreed. On December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's [[Castle Garden]], the entry for immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

They settled upstate, living in the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising [[antisemitism]] of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a [[seamstress]], sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

At her new job, Goldman met a fellow worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared her love for books, dancing, and traveling, as well as her frustration with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''Love'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the aftermath of executions related to the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]] in Chicago and the [[anti-authoritarian]] political philosophy of [[anarchism]].

Less than a year after the wedding, the couple were divorced; Kershner begged Goldman to return and threatened to poison himself if she did not. They reunited, but after three months she left once again. Her parents considered her behavior "loose" and refused to allow Goldman into their home.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carrying her sewing machine in one hand and a bag with five dollars in the other, she left Rochester and headed southeast to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most and Berkman ===
[[File:Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman.jpg|thumb|Goldman enjoyed a decades-long relationship with her lover [[Alexander Berkman]]. Photo c. 1917–1919.]]

On her first day in the city, Goldman met two men who greatly changed her life. At Sachs's Café, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to [[Alexander Berkman]], an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear [[Johann Most]], editor of a radical publication called ''[[Freiheit (1879)|Freiheit]]'' and an advocate of "[[propaganda of the deed]]"—the use of violence to instigate change.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; She was impressed by his fiery oration, and Most took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking. He encouraged her vigorously, telling her that she was "to take my place when I am gone."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of her first public talks in support of "the Cause" was in Rochester. After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage. She later wrote, suddenly:&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|something strange happened. In a flash I saw it—every incident of my three years in Rochester: the Garson factory, its drudgery and humiliation, the failure of my marriage, the Chicago crime...I began to speak. Words I had never heard myself utter before came pouring forth, faster and faster. They came with passionate intensity...The audience had vanished, the hall itself had disappeared; I was conscious only of my own words, of my ecstatic song.}}

Excited by the experience, Goldman refined her public persona during subsequent engagements. Quickly, however, she found herself arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], she felt as though she had become "a parrot repeating Most's views"&lt;ref name="Goldman-Living-52"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and resolved to express herself on the stage. When she returned to New York, Most became furious and told her: "Who is not with me is against me!"&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; She left ''Freiheit'' and joined another publication, ''[[Die Autonomie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Goldman had begun a friendship with Berkman, whom she affectionately called Sasha. Before long they became lovers and moved into a communal apartment with his cousin [[Modest Stein|Modest "Fedya" Stein]] and Goldman's friend, Helen Minkin, on [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although their relationship had numerous difficulties, Goldman and Berkman would share a close bond for decades, united by their anarchist principles and commitment to personal equality.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Goodman’s ice cream shop (photographed in 2017).jpg|thumb|right|Site of the ice cream shop in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] operated by Goldman, Berkman and Stein, photographed in 2017]]
In 1892, Goldman joined with Berkman and Stein in opening an ice cream shop in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].  After a few months of operating the shop, however, Goldman and Berkman were diverted by becoming involved in the [[Homestead Strike]] in western Pennsylvania near [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = People &amp; Events: Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919) | publisher = [[PBS]] | date = March 11, 2004 | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_frick.html | accessdate = July 10, 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150712130323/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldman/peopleevents/p_frick.html | archivedate = July 12, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Southwick | first = Albert B. | title = Emma Goldman pays a visit | newspaper = [[Telegram &amp; Gazette]] | location = [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] | date = June 26, 2014 | url = http://www.telegram.com/article/20140626/COLUMN21/306269974/0 | accessdate = July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homestead plot ===
{{further|Homestead Strike}}
Berkman and Goldman came together through the [[Homestead Strike]]. In June 1892, a steel plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] owned by [[Andrew Carnegie]] became the focus of national attention when talks between the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was [[Henry Clay Frick]], a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. [[Strikebreaker]]s were brought in and the company hired [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton guards]] to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry Clay Frick.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman and Berkman believed that a retaliatory assassination of [[Carnegie Steel Company]] manager [[Henry Clay Frick]] (''pictured'') would "strike terror into the soul of his class" and "bring the teachings of Anarchism before the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

When a majority of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would be in charge of "the deed"; she of the associated propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes.

Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novel ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), she mused: "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?"&lt;ref name="EGLiv91"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Once on the street, Goldman caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have "the knack," and told her to quit the business. She was "too astounded for speech".&lt;ref name="EGLiv91"/&gt; She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, Berkman gained access to Frick's office while carrying a concealed handgun; he shot Frick three times, and stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers—far from joining in his ''attentat''—beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 42–43; Falk, ''Love'', p. 25; Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Berkman was convicted of attempted murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alexander Berkman, the Anarchist, to Be Deported; Case of Emma Goldman Now Up for Decision|work=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1919|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/26/archives/alexander-berkman-the-anarchist-to-be-deported-case-of-emma-goldman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to 22 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman suffered during his long absence.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced Goldman was involved in the plot, police raided her apartment. Although they found no evidence, they pressured her landlord into evicting her. Worse, the ''attentat'' had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman's action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it on her knee, and hurled the pieces at him.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: "At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Inciting to riot" ===
When the [[Panic of 1893]] struck in the following year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year's end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=538 "Panic of 1893"]. [http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/index.php Ohio History Central]. Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Retrieved on December 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and "hunger demonstrations" sometimes gave way to riots. Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated men and women in New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to "take everything&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;by force".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; But Goldman later recounted this message: "Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread."&lt;ref name="EGLiv123"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Goldman surrounded by crowd.jpg|thumb|Goldman (shown here in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], New York in 1916) urged unemployed workers to take [[direct action]] rather than depend on charity or government aid.]]

A week later Goldman was arrested in [[Philadelphia]] and returned to New York City for trial, charged with "inciting to riot".&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; During the train ride, Jacobs offered to drop the charges against her if she would inform on other radicals in the area. She responded by throwing a glass of ice water in his face.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;  As she awaited trial, Goldman was visited by [[Nellie Bly]], a reporter for the ''[[New York World]].'' She spent two hours talking to Goldman, and wrote a positive article about the woman she described as a "modern [[Joan of Arc]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nellie Bly]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20150415182809/http://sunsite3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Samples/bly.html "Nelly Bly Again: She Interviews Emma Goldman and Other Anarchists"], ''[[New York World]]'', September 17, 1893.&lt;!--The reporter's name was spelled Nellie Bly, but the article's title spelled it "Nelly" Bly.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this positive publicity, the jury was persuaded by Jacobs' testimony and frightened by Goldman's politics. The assistant District Attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, as well as her atheism; the judge spoke of her as "a dangerous woman".&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to one year in the [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]] Penitentiary. Once inside she suffered an attack of [[rheumatism]] and was sent to the infirmary; there she befriended a visiting doctor and began studying medicine. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]; poet [[Walt Whitman]], and philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people greeted her at the [[Bowery Theatre|Thalia Theater]] in New York City. She soon became swamped with requests for interviews and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make money, Goldman decided to pursue the medical work she had studied in prison. However, her preferred fields of specialization—[[midwifery]] and [[massage]]—were not available to nursing students in the US. She sailed to Europe, lecturing in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. She met with renowned anarchists such as [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Louise Michel]], and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. In [[Vienna]], she received two diplomas for midwifery and put them immediately to use back in the US.

Alternating between lectures and midwifery, Goldman conducted the first cross-country tour by an anarchist speaker. In November 1899 she returned to Europe to speak, where she met the Czech anarchist [[Hippolyte Havel]] in London. They went together to France and helped organize the 1900 International Anarchist Congress on the outskirts of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 84–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward Havel immigrated to the United States, traveling with her to Chicago. They shared a residence there with friends of Goldman.

=== McKinley assassination ===
{{further|Assassination of William McKinley}}
[[File:First photograph of Leon F. Czolgosz, the assassin of President William McKinley, in jail.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leon Czolgosz]] insisted that Goldman had not guided his plan to assassinate US President [[William McKinley]], but she was arrested and held for two weeks.]]
On September 6, 1901, [[Leon Czolgosz]], an unemployed factory worker and registered Republican with a history of mental illness, shot US President [[William McKinley]] twice during a public speaking event in [[Buffalo, New York]]. McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to a residence in Chicago she shared with Hippolyte Havel, who had come to the US; as well as with Mary and [[Abe Isaak]], an anarchist couple and their family.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newspaper article blaming Emma Goldman for inspiring Czolgosz to assassinate McKinley.jpg|thumb|upright|Propaganda published in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', September 8, 1901, blaming Emma Goldman for inspiring Leon Czolgosz to assassinate President William McKinley.]]
Earlier, Czolgosz had tried but failed to become friends with Goldman and her companions. During a talk in Cleveland, Czolgosz had approached Goldman and asked her advice on which books he should read. In July 1901, he had appeared at the Isaak house, asking a series of unusual questions. They assumed he was an infiltrator, like a number of police agents sent to spy on radical groups. They had remained distant from him, and Abe Isaak sent a notice to associates warning of "another spy".&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Czolgosz repeatedly denied Goldman's involvement, the police held her in close custody, subjecting her to what she called the "[[Third degree (interrogation)|third degree]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; She explained her housemates' distrust of Czolgosz, and the police finally recognized that she had not had any significant contact with the attacker. No evidence was found linking Goldman to the attack, and she was released after two weeks of detention. Before McKinley died, Goldman offered to provide nursing care, referring to him as "merely a human being".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Czolgosz, despite considerable evidence of [[mental illness]], was convicted of murder and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her detention and after her release, Goldman steadfastly refused to condemn Czolgosz's actions, standing virtually alone in doing so. Friends and supporters—including Berkman—urged her to quit his cause. But Goldman defended Czolgosz as a "supersensitive being"&lt;ref name="Cha78"&gt;Chalberg, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and chastised other anarchists for abandoning him.&lt;ref name="Cha78"/&gt; She was vilified in the press as the "high priestess of anarchy",&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''The American Years'', p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; while many newspapers declared the anarchist movement responsible for the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 106–112.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of these events, [[socialism]] gained support over anarchism among US radicals. McKinley's successor, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], declared his intent to crack down "not only against anarchists, but against all active and passive sympathizers with anarchists".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Mother Earth'' and Berkman's release ===
[[File:Emma Goldman 1901 mugshot (single portrait).png|thumb|left|upright|Mug shot taken in 1901 when Goldman was implicated in the assassination of President McKinley.]]
{{main|Mother Earth (magazine)}}
After Czolgosz was executed, Goldman withdrew from the world. Scorned by her fellow anarchists, vilified by the press, and separated from her love, Berkman, she retreated into anonymity and nursing. "It was bitter and hard to face life anew," she wrote later.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the name E. G. Smith, she left public life and took on a series of private nursing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the US Congress passed the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]] (1903), however, a new wave of activism rose to oppose it, and Goldman was pulled back into the movement. A coalition of people and organizations across the [[left-wing politics|left]] end of the political spectrum opposed the law on grounds that it violated [[freedom of speech]], and she had the nation's ear once again.

After an English anarchist named [[John Turner (anarchist)|John Turner]] was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Goldman joined forces with the [[Free Speech League]] to champion his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''Making Speech Free'', p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt; The league enlisted the aid of noted attorneys [[Clarence Darrow]] and [[Edgar Lee Masters]], who took Turner's case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]]. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 84–87.&lt;/ref&gt; She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. "I never felt so weighed down," she wrote to Berkman. "I fear I am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mother Earth 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldman's ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' magazine became a home to radical activists and literary free thinkers around the US.]]

In 1906, Goldman decided to start a publication, "a place of expression for the young idealists in arts and letters".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' was staffed by a cadre of radical activists, including Hippolyte Havel, [[Max Baginski]], and [[Leonard Abbott]]. In addition to publishing original works by its editors and anarchists around the world, ''Mother Earth'' reprinted selections from a variety of writers. These included the French philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]], German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and British writer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Goldman wrote frequently about anarchism, politics, labor issues, atheism, sexuality, and feminism, and was the first editor of the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18 of the same year, Alexander Berkman was released from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform and found herself "seized by terror and pity"&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home in silence. For weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside. An abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver with the intent of killing himself.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to New York, however, and learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of [[freedom of assembly]], he declared, "My resurrection has come!"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Goldman, ''Living'', p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; and set about securing their release.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkman took the helm of ''Mother Earth'' in 1907, while Goldman toured the country to raise funds to keep it operating. Editing the magazine was a revitalizing experience for Berkman. But his relationship with Goldman faltered, and he had an affair with a 15-year-old anarchist named [[Becky Edelsohn]]. Goldman was pained by his rejection of her, but considered it a consequence of his prison experience.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year she served as a delegate from the US to the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]]. Anarchists and [[syndicalism|syndicalists]] from around the world gathered to sort out the tension between the two ideologies, but no decisive agreement was reached. Goldman returned to the US and continued speaking to large audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reitman, essays, and birth control ===
For the next ten years, Goldman traveled around the country nonstop, delivering lectures and agitating for anarchism. The coalitions formed in opposition to the Anarchist Exclusion Act had given her an appreciation for reaching out to those of other political positions. When the [[United States Department of Justice|US Justice Department]] sent spies to observe, they reported the meetings as "packed".&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Writers, journalists, artists, judges, and workers from across the spectrum spoke of her "magnetic power", her "convincing presence", her "force, eloquence, and fire".&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Goldman as sketched by Marguerite Martyn, 1908.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman in 1908, sketched by [[Marguerite Martyn]]]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman joined [[Margaret Sanger]] in crusading for women's access to [[birth control]]; both women were arrested for violating the [[Comstock Law]].]]

In the spring of 1908, Goldman met and fell in love with [[Ben Reitman]], the so-called "Hobo doctor." Having grown up in Chicago's Tenderloin District, Reitman spent several years as a drifter before earning a medical degree from the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine|College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago]]. As a doctor, he treated people suffering from poverty and illness, particularly [[venereal disease]]s. He and Goldman began an affair. They shared a commitment to [[free love]] and Reitman took a variety of lovers, but Goldman did not. She tried to reconcile her feelings of jealousy with a belief in freedom of the heart, but found it difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 140–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Goldman began feeling frustrated with lecture audiences. She yearned to "reach the few who really want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused".&lt;ref name="EGAn49"&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; She collected a series of speeches and items she had written for ''Mother Earth'' and published a book titled ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]].'' Covering a wide variety of topics, Goldman tried to represent "the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years".&lt;ref name="EGAn49"/&gt; In addition to a comprehensive look at anarchism and its criticisms, the book includes essays on patriotism, [[women's suffrage]], marriage, and prisons.

When [[Margaret Sanger]], an advocate of access to [[contraception]], coined the term "birth control" and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine ''The Woman Rebel,'' she received aggressive support from Goldman. The latter had already been active in efforts to increase birth control access for several years. In 1916, Goldman was arrested for giving lessons in public on how to use contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;Alice S. Rossi. ''The Feminist Papers: From Adams to de Beauvoir.'' Lebanon, New Hampshire: Northeastern University Press, 1988, p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger, too, was arrested under the [[Comstock Law]], which prohibited the dissemination of "obscene, lewd, or lascivious articles",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; which authorities defined as including information relating to birth control.

Although they later split from Sanger over charges of insufficient support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger's pamphlet ''Family Limitation'' (along with a similar essay of Reitman's). In 1915 Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour, in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation's attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested on February 11, 1916, as she was about to give another public lecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/feb11.html |title=Today in History: February 11 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman was charged with violating the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, Goldman spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an "opportunity" to reconnect with those rejected by society.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', pp. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War I ===
Although US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] was re-elected in 1916 under the slogan "He kept us out of the war", at the start of his second term, he announced that [[Germany]]'s continued deployment of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] was sufficient cause for the US to enter [[World War I|the Great War]]. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the [[Selective Service Act of 1917]], which required all males aged 21–30 to register for military [[conscription]]. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in [[militarism|militarist]] aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in ''Mother Earth'' her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose US involvement in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 186–187; Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldman on a streetcar in 1917, perhaps during a strike or demonstration.]]

To this end, she and Berkman organized the [[No conscription league|No Conscription League]] of New York, which proclaimed: "We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, antimilitarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments."&lt;ref&gt;Berkman, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The group became a vanguard for anti-draft activism, and chapters began to appear in other cities. When police began raiding the group's public events to find young men who had not registered for the draft, however, Goldman and others focused their efforts on distributing pamphlets and other writings.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the nation's patriotic fervor, many elements of the political left refused to support the League's efforts. The Women's Peace Party, for example, ceased its opposition to the war once the US entered it. The [[Socialist Party of America]] took an official stance against US involvement, but supported Wilson in most of his activities.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 1917, Goldman and Berkman were arrested during a raid of their offices, in which authorities seized  "a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda".&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Emma Goldman and A. Berkman Behind the Bars|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1917/06/16/archives/emma-goldman-and-a-berkman-behind-the-bars-anarchist-headquarters.html|date=June 16, 1917|accessdate=December 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Goldman asked to change into a more appropriate outfit, and emerged in a gown of "royal purple".&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were charged with conspiracy to "induce persons not to register"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; under the newly enacted [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Trials of Emma Goldman, Anarchist|first=Francis H.|last=Shaw|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=26|issue=3|pages=444–445|date=July 1964|quote=Prosecuted under the Espionage Act of 1917 for obstructing the draft, Emma Goldman... |doi=10.1017/S0034670500005210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were held on US$25,000 bail each. Defending herself and Berkman during their trial, Goldman invoked the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], asking how the government could claim to fight for democracy abroad while suppressing free speech at home:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outraged, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged? Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Trial and Speeches of Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman in the United States District Court, in the City of New York, July 1917'' (New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association, 1917)&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury found Goldman and Berkman guilty. Judge [[Julius Marshuetz Mayer]] imposed the maximum sentence: two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine each, and the possibility of [[deportation]] after their release from prison. As she was transported to [[Missouri State Penitentiary]], Goldman wrote to a friend: "Two years imprisonment for having made an uncompromising stand for one's ideal. Why that is a small price."&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 235–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

In prison, she was assigned to work as a seamstress, under the eye of a "miserable gutter-snipe of a 21-year-old boy paid to get results".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; She met the socialist [[Kate Richards O'Hare]], who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy— O'Hare believed in voting to achieve state power—the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman also met and became friends with [[Gabriella Segata Antolini]], an anarchist and follower of [[Luigi Galleani]]. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities, and was sent to prison for 14 months. Working together to make life better for the other inmates, the three women became known as "The Trinity". Goldman was released on September 27, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 253–263.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deportation ===
[[File:Emma Goldman's deportation photo, 1919.jpg|thumb|Emma Goldman's deportation photo, 1919|upright]]
Goldman and Berkman were released from prison during the United States' [[First Red Scare|Red Scare of 1919–20]], when public anxiety about wartime pro-German activities had expanded into a pervasive fear of Bolshevism and the prospect of an imminent radical revolution. It was a time of social unrest due to union organizing strikes and actions by activist immigrants. [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]] and [[J. Edgar Hoover]], head of the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice's]] General Intelligence Division (now the FBI), were intent on using the [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]] and its [[Immigration Act of 1918#Definition of anarchist|1918 expansion]] to deport any non-citizens they could identify as advocates of anarchy or revolution. "Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman," Hoover wrote while they were in prison, "are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and return to the community will result in undue harm."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

At her deportation hearing on October 27, Goldman refused to answer questions about her beliefs, on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: "Today so-called [[Alien (law)|aliens]] are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deportation Defied by Emma Goldman|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/10/28/archives/deportation-defied-by-emma-goldman-anarchist-leader-refuses-to.html|date=October 28, 1919|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Freeland Post|Louis Post]] at the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband Kershner's American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well.

[[File:Emma Goldman gives eulogy at Peter Kropotkin's funeral.jpg|thumb|right|Here, Emma Goldman delivers a eulogy at [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s funeral procession. Immediately in front of Goldman stands her lifelong comrade [[Alexander Berkman]]. Kropotkin's funeral was the occasion of the last great demonstration of anarchists in Moscow—tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to pay their respects.]]
Goldman initially viewed the Bolshevik revolution in a positive light. She wrote in ''Mother Earth'' that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented "the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she neared Europe, however, she expressed fears about what was to come. She was worried about the ongoing [[Russian Civil War]] and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. "I could never in my life work within the confines of the State," she wrote to her niece, "Bolshevist or otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dissillusioncover.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goldman's experiences in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] led to her 1923 book, ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]''.]]
She quickly discovered that her fears were justified. Days after returning to [[Petrograd]] (Saint Petersburg), she was shocked to hear a party official refer to free speech as a "bourgeois superstition".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As she and Berkman traveled around the country, they found repression, mismanagement, and corruption&lt;ref name="livingmylife"&gt;Goldman, Emma. ''Living My Life''. 1931. New York: [[Dover Publications]] Inc., 1970. {{ISBN|0-486-22543-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; instead of the equality and worker empowerment they had dreamed of. Those who questioned the government were demonized as [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]],&lt;ref name="livingmylife"/&gt; and workers labored under severe conditions.&lt;ref name="livingmylife"/&gt; They met with [[Vladimir Lenin]], who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. He told them: "There can be no free speech in a revolutionary period."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Berkman was more willing to forgive the government's actions in the name of "historical necessity", but he eventually joined Goldman in opposing the Soviet state's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1921, strikes erupted in Petrograd when workers took to the streets demanding better food rations and more [[Trade union|union]] autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; The unrest spread to the port town of [[Kronstadt]], where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the [[Kronstadt rebellion]], approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. "More and more", she wrote, "we have come to the conclusion that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave."&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1921, they left the country and went to the Latvian capital city of [[Riga]]. The US commissioner in that city wired officials in Washington DC, who began requesting information from other governments about the couple's activities. After a short trip to [[Stockholm]], they moved to [[Berlin]] for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s newspaper, the ''[[New York World]].'' These were later collected and published in book form as ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'' (1923) and ''[[My Further Disillusionment in Russia]]'' (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, albeit in vain.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 56–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England, Canada, and France ===
Goldman found it difficult to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist [[Rebecca West]] arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], novelist [[H. G. Wells]], and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sacvan.jpg|thumb|The 1927 executions of Italian anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] (right) and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] were troubling for Goldman, then living alone in Canada.]]

In 1925, the spectre of deportation loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named [[James Colton]] offered to marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, ''Love'', pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: "I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to come back here from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were "awful," and she never finished her second book on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman traveled to Canada in 1927, just in time to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the US. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in [[Boston]]; memories of the [[Haymarket affair]] overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. "Then," she wrote, "I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chalberg, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, she began writing her autobiography, with the support of a group of American admirers, including journalist [[H. L. Mencken]], poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], novelist [[Theodore Dreiser]] and art collector [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who raised $4,000 for her.&lt;ref&gt;Mary V. Dearborn, ''Mistress of Modernism: The Life of Peggy Guggenheim'', Houghton Mifflin, 2004, pp.61–62&lt;/ref&gt; She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of [[Saint-Tropez]] and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman intended the book, ''[[Living My Life]],'' as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]], however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due in large part to the [[Great Depression]], sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US.&lt;ref&gt;Chalberg, pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'' all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Goldman received permission to lecture in the United States under the condition that she speak only about drama and her autobiography—but not current political events. She returned to New York on February 2, 1934 to generally positive press coverage—except from Communist publications. Soon she was surrounded by admirers and friends, besieged with invitations to talks and interviews. Her visa expired in May, and she went to [[Toronto]] in order to file another request to visit the US. However, this second attempt was denied. She stayed in Canada, writing articles for US publications.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 158–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February and March 1936, Berkman underwent a pair of [[prostate gland]] operations. Recuperating in [[Nice]] and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in [[Saint-Tropez]] in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call in the middle of the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose [[paralysis]]. He died later that evening.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Emma Goldman in Exile'', pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 298–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish Civil War ===
In July 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] started after an attempted ''coup d'état'' by parts of the [[Spanish Army]] against the government of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. At the same time, the [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]], fighting against the [[National faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist forces]], started [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|an anarchist revolution]]. Goldman was invited to [[Barcelona]] and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, "the crushing weight that was pressing down on my heart since Sasha's death left me as by magic".&lt;ref&gt;Drinnon, ''Rebel'', pp. 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; She was welcomed by the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI) organizations, and for the first time in her life lived in a [[Revolutionary Catalonia|community run by and for anarchists]], according to true anarchist principles. "In all my life", she wrote later, "I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; After touring a series of [[collectives]] in the province of [[Huesca (province)|Huesca]], she told a group of workers: "Your revolution will destroy forever [the notion] that anarchism stands for chaos."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Drinnon, ''Rebel'', p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; She began editing the weekly ''CNT-FAI Information Bulletin'' and responded to English-language mail.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CNT FAI flag.png|thumb|left|Goldman edited the English-language ''Bulletin'' of the [[Anarcho-syndicalist]] organizations [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI) during the [[Spanish Civil War]].]]

Goldman began to worry about the future of Spain's anarchism when the CNT-FAI joined a coalition government in 1937—against the core anarchist principle of abstaining from state structures—and, more distressingly, made repeated concessions to Communist forces in the name of uniting against fascism. She wrote that cooperating with Communists in Spain was "a denial of our comrades in Stalin's concentration camps".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, meanwhile, refused to send weapons to anarchist forces, and disinformation campaigns were being waged against the anarchists across Europe and the US. Her faith in the movement unshaken, Goldman returned to London as an official representative of the CNT-FAI.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delivering lectures and giving interviews, Goldman enthusiastically supported the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. She wrote regularly for ''[[Freedom (newspaper)|Spain and the World]]'', a biweekly newspaper focusing on the civil war. In May 1937, however, Communist-led forces [[Barcelona May Days|attacked anarchist strongholds]] and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] at face value. British journalist [[George Orwell]], present for the crackdown, wrote: "[T]he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;beat everything I have ever seen for lying."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman returned to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared to her like people "in a burning house". Worse, anarchists and other radicals around the world refused to support their cause.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she returned to London. Frustrated by England's repressive atmosphere—which she called "more fascist than the fascists"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;—she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten, however. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT-FAI, Mariano Vázquez, sent a message to her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as "our spiritual mother". She called it "the most beautiful tribute I have ever received".&lt;ref&gt;Both quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final years ===
[[File:Emma-Goldman-Grave-Forest-Home-Cemetery-Il.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone of Emma Goldman, Forest Home Cemetery, Forest Park, IL|Goldman's grave in Illinois' [[German Waldheim Cemetery|Forest Home Cemetery]], near those of the anarchists executed for the [[Haymarket affair]]. The dates on the stone are incorrect.]]

As the events preceding [[World War II]] began to unfold in Europe, Goldman reiterated her opposition to wars waged by governments. "[M]uch as I loathe [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]", she wrote to a friend, "I would not support a war against them and for the democracies which, in the last analysis, are only Fascist in disguise."&lt;ref name="WexEx236"&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; She felt that Britain and France had missed their opportunity to oppose fascism, and that the coming war would only result in "a new form of madness in the world".&lt;ref name="WexEx236"/&gt;

=== Death ===
On Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman suffered a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed on her right side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak. As one friend described it: "Just to think that here was Emma, the greatest orator in America, unable to utter one word."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; For three months she improved slightly, receiving visitors and on one occasion gesturing to her address book to signal that a friend might find friendly contacts during a trip to [[Mexico]]. She suffered another stroke on May 8, however, and on May 14 she died in [[Toronto]], aged 70.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emma Goldman, Anarchist, Dead.

The US [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] allowed her body to be brought back to the United States.

== Philosophy ==
Goldman spoke and wrote extensively on a wide variety of issues. While she rejected [[orthodoxy]] and fundamentalist thinking, she was an important contributor to several fields of modern political philosophy. She was influenced by many diverse thinkers and writers, including [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]], and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Another philosopher who influenced Goldman was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In her autobiography, she wrote: "Nietzsche was not a social theorist, but a poet, a rebel, and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were [[Aristocracy (government)|aristocrats]]."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarchism ===
Anarchism was central to Goldman's view of the world and she is today considered one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism. First drawn to it during the persecution of anarchists after the 1886 [[Haymarket affair]], she wrote and spoke regularly on behalf of anarchism. In the title essay of her book ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]'', she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldman's anarchism was intensely personal. She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. "I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct," she once wrote. "I care if his spirit of today is correct."&lt;ref name="WexInt92"&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. "It seems to me that ''these'' are the new forms of life," she wrote, "and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them."&lt;ref name="WexInt92"/&gt;

At the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans. While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor. In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Tactical uses of violence ====
Goldman, in her political youth, held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. Goldman at the time believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated [[propaganda of the deed]]—''attentat'', or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner [[Alexander Berkman]]'s attempt to kill industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]], and even begged him to allow her to participate.&lt;ref name="EGLiv88"&gt;Goldman, ''Living'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that Frick's actions during the [[Homestead strike]] were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. "Yes," she wrote later in her autobiography, "the end in this case justified the means."&lt;ref name="EGLiv88"/&gt; While she never gave explicit approval of [[Leon Czolgosz]]'s assassination of US President [[William McKinley]], she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in "The Psychology of Political Violence": "the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means. In the afterword to ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'', she wrote: "There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another.... The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose...."  In the same chapter, however, Goldman affirmed that "Revolution is indeed a violent process," and noted that violence was the "tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals..."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Disillusionment'', pp. 260–264.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first US edition of ''My Disillusionment in Russia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute. I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that "an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130928015428/http://ucblibrary3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Writings/Russia/preface1.html "Preface to First Volume of American Edition" for ''My Disillusionment in Russia''] (Emma Goldman Papers Project, University of California-Berkeley).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capitalism and labor ===
Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes," she wrote in ''Anarchism and Other Essays'', "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade."&lt;ref name="EGAnar54"&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that [[criticism of capitalism|capitalism dehumanized workers]], "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron."&lt;ref name="EGAnar54"/&gt;

Originally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row. In her autobiography, she wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week.... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Goldman-Living-52" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldman realized that smaller efforts for improvement such as higher wages and shorter hours could be part of a social revolution.

=== The state – militarism, prison, voting, speech ===
Goldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and "direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code".&lt;ref name="WexInt91"&gt;Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; She disagreed with the movement for [[women's suffrage]], which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay "Woman Suffrage", she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: "As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!"&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men, but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just. "To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman was also a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the treatment of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay "Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure", she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] and [[Oscar Wilde]] on prisons, and wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldman was a committed [[war resister]], believing that wars were fought by the state on behalf of capitalists.  She was particularly opposed to the [[conscription|draft]], viewing it as one of the worst of the state's forms of coercion, and was one of the founders of the [[No-Conscription League]]—for which she was ultimately arrested (1917), imprisoned and deported (1919).

Goldman was routinely surveilled, arrested, and imprisoned for her speech and organizing activities in support of [[workers]] and various strikes, access to [[birth control]], and in [[opposition to World War I]].  As a result, she became active in the early 20th century free speech movement, seeing freedom of expression as a fundamental necessity for achieving social change.&lt;ref name="Goldman-Living"&gt;See generally ''Living My Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone-2004"&gt;See Geoffrey R. Stone, ''Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime, From the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism'' (2004), pp. 139–152 (discussing persecution of Goldman and other anti-war activists, and the passage of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falk-Volume2"&gt;Falk, ''Making Speech Free''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rabban-1997"&gt;David M. Rabban, ''Free Speech In Its Forgotten Years'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Her outspoken championship of her ideals, in the face of persistent arrests, inspired [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], one of the founders of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].&lt;ref name="Finan-2007"&gt;Christopher M. Finan, ''From the Palmer Raids to the Patriot Act: A History of the Fight for Free Speech in America'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goldman's and Reitman's experiences in the [[San Diego free speech fight]] (1912) were notorious examples of state and capitalist repression of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]'s campaign of [[free speech fights]].

=== Feminism and sexuality ===
[[File:EmmaGoldmanQuote2000.JPG|thumb|[[Anarcha-feminist]]s at an anti-globalization protest quote Emma Goldman.]]
Although she was hostile to the suffragist goals of [[first-wave feminism]], Goldman advocated passionately for the rights of women, and is today heralded as a founder of [[anarcha-feminism]], which challenges [[patriarchy]] as a hierarchy to be resisted alongside state power and class divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897, she wrote: "I demand the independence of woman, her right to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases, or as many as she pleases. I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wexler, ''Intimate'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

A nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women concerning [[Birth control|contraception]]. Like many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of [[free love]], and a strong critic of marriage. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of [[Religious fanaticism|Puritanism]] and capitalism. She wrote: "We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, ''Anarchism'', p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See generally Haaland; Goldman, "The Traffic in Women"; Goldman, "On Love".&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman was also an outspoken critic of [[homophobia|prejudice against homosexuals]]. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz|first=Jonathan Ned|title=Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.|year=1992|location=New York City|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=376–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; As German sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] wrote, "she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public."&lt;ref name="hirschfeld"&gt;Goldman, Emma (1923). "Offener Brief an den Herausgeber der Jahrbücher über Louise Michel" with a preface by Magnus Hirschfeld. ''Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen''. '''23''': 70. Translated from German by James Steakley. Goldman's original letter in English is not known to be extant.&lt;/ref&gt; In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld, "It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life."&lt;ref name="hirschfeld"/&gt;

=== Atheism ===
A committed [[atheist]], Goldman viewed religion as another instrument of control and domination. Her essay "The Philosophy of Atheism" quoted Bakunin at length on the subject and added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in gods and devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment.... The philosophy of Atheism expresses the expansion and growth of the human mind. The philosophy of [[theism]], if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Goldman|first= Emma|date=February 1916|title= The Philosophy of Atheism|journal= Mother Earth|volume= |issue= |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Philosophy_of_Atheism|accessdate= December 7, 2007|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In essays like "The Hypocrisy of Puritanism" and a speech entitled "The Failure of Christianity", Goldman made more than a few enemies among religious communities by attacking their moralistic attitudes and efforts to control human behavior. She blamed Christianity for "the perpetuation of a slave society", arguing that it dictated individuals' actions on Earth and offered poor people a false promise of a plentiful future in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, [http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/goldman413.htm "The Failure of Christianity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512084543/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/goldman413.htm |date=May 12, 2008 }}. ''Mother Earth'', April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also critical of [[Zionism]], which she saw as another failed experiment in state control.&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Goldman was well known during her life, described as—among other things—"the most dangerous woman in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Avrich

Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist, but did not regard her as a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for instance, [[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 396–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emma Goldman.jpg|thumb|upright|Goldman's image, often accompanying a popular paraphrase of her ideas—"If I can't dance, I don't want to be in your revolution"—has been reproduced on countless walls, garments, stickers, and posters as an icon of freedom.]]

In 1970, [[Dover Press]] reissued Goldman's biography, ''Living My Life'', and in 1972, feminist writer [[Alix Kates Shulman]] issued a collection of Goldman's writing and speeches, ''Red Emma Speaks''. These works brought Goldman's life and writings to a larger audience, and she was in particular lionized by the [[Second-wave feminism|women's movement]] of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from ''Living My Life'' about "the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things", recounting that she had been admonished "that it did not behoove an agitator to dance".&lt;ref name="wexler1" /&gt; The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of Goldman's most famous quotations, even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: "If I can't dance I don't want to be in your revolution."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alix Kates Shulman|Shulman, Alix Kates]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20051217133141/http://sunsite3.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Features/dances_shulman.html Dances with Feminists]". ''Women's Review of Books'', Vol. IX, #3. December 1991. Retrieved on February 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this saying have appeared on thousands of T-shirts, buttons, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, hats, and other items.&lt;ref name="wexler1"&gt;Wexler, ''Exile'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's movement of the 1970s that "rediscovered" Goldman was accompanied by a resurgent anarchist movement, beginning in the late 1960s, which also reinvigorated scholarly attention to earlier anarchists. The growth of [[feminism]] also initiated some reevaluation of Goldman's philosophical work, with scholars pointing out the significance of Goldman's contributions to anarchist thought in her time. Goldman's belief in the value of [[aesthetics]], for example, can be seen in the later influences of [[anarchism and the arts]]. Similarly, Goldman is now given credit for significantly influencing and broadening the scope of activism on issues of sexual liberty, reproductive rights, and freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldman has been depicted in numerous works of fiction over the years, including [[Warren Beatty]]'s 1981 film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'', in which she was portrayed by [[Maureen Stapleton]], who won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her performance. Goldman has also been a character in two Broadway musicals, ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' and ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]''.  Plays depicting Goldman's life include [[Howard Zinn]]'s play, ''[[Emma (play)|Emma]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Goldman has been honored by a number of organizations named in her memory.  The Emma Goldman Clinic, a women's health center located in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], selected Goldman as a namesake "in recognition of her challenging spirit."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.emmagoldman.com/about/about.htm About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108084728/http://www.emmagoldman.com/about/about.htm |date=2008-01-08 }}". The Emma Goldman Clinic. 2007. Retrieved on December 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red Emma's Bookstore Coffeehouse]], an [[infoshop]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] adopted her name out of their belief "in the ideas and ideals that she fought for her entire life: free speech, sexual and racial equality and independence, the right to organize in our jobs and in our own lives, ideas and ideals that we continue to fight for, even today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Paul Gailiunas and his late wife [[Helen Hill]] co-wrote the anarchist song "Emma Goldman", which was performed and released by the band Piggy: The Calypso Orchestra of the Maritimes in 1999.&lt;ref name=divergences&gt;{{cite web |url=http://divergences.be/spip.php?article425&amp;lang=fr|title=Remembering Helen Hill: A New Orleans community comes together after the murder of a friend and activist|author=John Clark|date=May 14, 2007|publisher=Divergences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was later performed by Gailiunas' new band The Troublemakers and released on their 2004 album ''Here Come The Troublemakers''.&lt;ref name=divergences /&gt;

UK punk band [[Martha (band)|Martha]]'s song "Goldman's Detective Agency" reimagines Goldman as a private detective investigating police and political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David [https://news.avclub.com/martha-goes-undercover-in-the-video-for-goldman-s-dete-1798246878 "Martha goes undercover in the video for “Goldman’s Detective Agency”"] ''[[The A.V.

{{Islam by country}}
The [[Pew Research Center]] estimates that [[Ecuador]] has a [[Muslim]] population of about 2000, representing 0.011 % out of total population of  16,965,000 inhabitants. The first Muslim settlers in [[Ecuador]] were primarily [[Arabs]] who emigrated from the Middle East during World War I and thereafter from former territories of the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]]. They settled mostly in [[Quito]], [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] and [[Guayaquil]] with smaller communities in [[Manabí (province)|Manabí]], [[Los Ríos (province)|Los Ríos]], and [[Esmeraldas (province)|Esmeraldas]] provinces. [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine Christians]] and Muslims created a secular ethnic organisation called ''Lecla'' in the 1940s and [[The Arab Club]] in the 1980s.  By the mid 1990s, naturalized citizens and native Muslims of Arab extraction were using a private apartment located in Avenue Los Shyris and Eloy Alfaro as a communal prayer venue, especially on Fridays. At a later day the Egyptian Embassy provided another private apartment for the same purposes. The [[Centro Islámico del Ecuador]], founded on October 15, 1994,  was the first Muslim religious organization recognized by the government. However, it was not the first organization to open its doors in this city. A mosque under the name [[Khaled ibn al-Walid]] was founded in the year 1991; it conducted its religious rituals in a private apartment.  Religious activities as well as social, cultural and educational activities are conducted according to [[Sunni]] Islam. 
The Khaled ibn al Walid mosque nowadays is run by Sheikh Mohamed Mamdouh, and had opened it doors for all Muslims domiciled in Quito.

In Guayaquil, the [[Centro Islamico Al Hijra]] was established in 2004 by Juan Saud from Ecuador, Ali Said from [[Pakistan]], and [[Mazhar Farooq]] from [[India]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4516">Virtually all Omanis are Muslims, of whom three quarters follow the [[Ibadi]] School of [[Abd-Allah ibn Ibadh]].&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mu.html |title=Oman|publisher=CIA – The World Factbook|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only remaining expression of [[Khawarij|Kharijism]], which was created as a result of one of the first schisms within the religion.&lt;ref name=kcom&gt;{{cite web|last=Common|first=Richard K.|title=Barriers To Developing ‘Leadership' In The Sultanate Of Oman|url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss2/3_Common_pp215-229_jm.pdf|publisher=International Journal of Leadership Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Oman (124).jpg|thumbnail|Omanis in their traditional dress]]

==History==
Islam spread to Oman early. The Ibadite denomination established itself in the region after fleeing from [[Basra]] in modern-day [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=diana27&gt;Diana Darke, Oman: The Bradt Travel Guide, pg. 27. Guilford: Brandt Travel Guides, 2010.. {{ISBN|9781841623320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hawley]], ''Oman'', pg. 199. Jubilee edition. [[Kensington]]: [[Stacey International]], 1995. {{ISBN|0905743636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians and Jews have historically been able to practice their own religions openly in Oman. The society is tolerant, though social hierarchies do exist. In Ibadi communities, the traditional Arab coffee is served to Muslims first, with Christians being served after the poor Muslims;  in Sunni communities, Christian guests may actually be served even before the respected Muslim leaders and clerics.&lt;ref name=diana27/&gt;

==Denominations==
{{main|Muslim denominations}}

===Ibadism===
Many people{{who|date=August 2014}} believe that Ibadism is an outgrowth of the [[Kharijites]] movement, a variant form of Islam practiced by descendants of a sect that seceded from the principal Muslim body after the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632. Ibadies, however, deny this notion considering themselves an outgrowth [led by?] the follower ''([[Tabi‘un|tabe'e]])'' [[Jābir ibn Zayd]]. Ibadies reject [[Primogeniture|primogeniture succession]] of the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]], the tribe of Muhammad, and assert that leadership of Islam should be designated by an imam elected by the community from candidates who possess spiritual and personal qualities. Ibadhi leadership is vested in an imam, who is regarded as the sole legitimate leader and combines religious and political authority. The imam is elected by a council of prominent laymen or ''shaykhs''.  Adherence to Ibadism accounts in part for Oman's historical isolation.  Ibadis were not inclined to integrate with their neighbours, as the majority of Sunni Muslims regard Ibadism as a heretical form of Islam.

The austere, puritanical nature of Ibadism has affected the practice of Islam in the country. Omani mosques are very simple, with almost no decoration except around the windows and often lack the [[minaret]]s common in other Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=diana27/&gt;&lt;ref name=haw201&gt;Donald Hawley, ''Oman'', page 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Moroccan explorer [[Ibn Battuta]] described the cleanliness of Omani mosques, despite the fact that the entire community would congregate to eat inside, each person bringing their own food.&lt;ref name=haw201/&gt; The denomination frowns upon singing and dancing.&lt;ref name=diana27/&gt;&lt;ref name=haw201/&gt; Sharia law is strictly enforced in public and private, and Oman's adherence to conservative Ibadism led to its historical isolation from the rest of the Middle East.&lt;ref name=haw201/&gt;

The highest religious authority in Oman is the [[Grand Mufti]], at present [[Ahmed bin Hamad al-Khalili]].

===Sunnism===
In the 1800s, the [[Jalan Bani Bu Ali|Banu Bu Ali tribe of Jalan]] converted to [[Wahhabism]], an austere form of Sunnism.  They sporadically fought Ibadi communities but otherwise did not affect the overall religious demographics of Oman.&lt;ref name=haw201/&gt;

===Shi'ism===
The [[Shi'a]] live along [[Al Batinah, Yemen|Al Batinah]] and [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] coasts. There are at least seven Twelver Shia mosques in [[Muscat]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muscatshia.com/mosques.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Israeli''''' ({{lang-he|ישראלי}}, {{transl|he|jisra'eli}}) was an [[Israel]]i daily Hebrew language newspaper distributed for free in railway stations, [[:Category:Bus stations in Israel|bus terminals]], and [[Delek]] gas stations. Based on the concept of the ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' [[free daily newspaper]]s, it was geared toward a young, [[urban culture|urban]], and mobile clientele. 

The newspaper, first published in January 2006, was co-owned by [[Sheldon Adelson]] and Hirsch Media (owned by [[Shlomo Ben Tzvi]]) and published by Israeli News Ltd.  Its headquarters were located on Menahem Begin Road in [[Tel Aviv]].  Its original budget was planned to be US $35 million over three to four years.  

It was long suspected that the paper was losing money, but as the number of pages increased from the originally-planned sixteen to twenty-four, and often even more (up to 40), the publishers insisted that the newspaper's expanding size was a sign of strong demand from advertisers.  ''Israeli'' aimed to become the second-largest paper in Israel, behind ''[[Yediot Aharonot]]'', and claimed to print 200,000 issues each day in two daily editions, morning and evening. Criticism of this claim led the publishers to consider numbering each copy under supervision of an [[accounting]] firm. 

In September 2006, it was reported in the Hebrew media that the newspaper would be offering a web portal based on news and blogs which would have some crossover to the print edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/serve/globes/docview.asp?QUID=1051,U12810&amp;ID=760141&amp;did=1000130455 Globes.co.il]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Adelson withdrew from the partnership because of differences of opinion and instead pursued competing options, making an unsuccessful bid to buy controlling interest in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]''. When this failed, he proceeded with parallel plans to publish a [[free daily newspaper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=American Billionaire Launching Free Israeli Daily |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/129798 |work=Israelnationalnews.com |publisher=Arutz Sheva |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2008-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the paper was disbanded.

There are about 500 Jain families in [[Hong Kong]],{{Sfn|Tsung|2017|p=179}} who immigrated to Hong Kong later than most other Indian groups. They originate mostly from the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]] and other parts of North India. Their community grew rapidly during the 1980s. The Jains are most prominent in the [[diamond trading]] business. In 1996, members of the community founded a Jain temple, Shree Hong Kong Jain Sangh, in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]].

When the community was small, the Jains did not build separate religious institutions but allied themselves with the Hindus and participated in building ecumenical Hindu temples, with space set aside for their own images within them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=hong+kong+500+jain&amp;btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=When+the+community+was+small%2C+the+Jains+did+not+build+separate+religious+institutions+but+allied+themselves+with+the+Hindus+and+participated+in+building+ecumenical+Hindu+temples%2C+with+space+set+aside+for+their+own+images+within+them&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=b805e95cb0de89a2 The encyclopedia of the Indian diaspora]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish feminism''' is a movement that seeks to make the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of Jewish women equal to that of Jewish men in Judaism. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major branches of the Jewish religion.

In its modern form, the Jewish feminist movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], the main grievances of early Jewish feminists were women's exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', women's exemption from [[Positive time-bound mitzvot|positive time-bound]] ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' (mitzvot meaning the 613 commandments given in the Torah at Mount Sinai and the seven rabbinic commandments instituted later, for a total of 620), and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]] in Jewish religious courts.&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;Plaskow, Judith. "Jewish Feminist Thought" in Frank, Daniel H. &amp; Leaman, Oliver. ''History of Jewish Philosophy'', Routledge, first published 1997; this edition 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Paula Hyman]], two articles published in the 1970s were trailblazers in analyzing the status of Jewish women using feminism: "The Unfreedom of Jewish Women", published in 1970 in the ''Jewish Spectator'' by its editor, [[Trude Weiss-Rosmarin]], and an article by [[Rachel Adler]], then an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]] and currently a professor at the Reform seminary [[Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion]], called "[http://jwa.org/sites/jwa.org/files/mediaobjects/the_jew_who_wasnt_there_adler.jpg  The Jew Who Wasn't There: Halacha and the Jewish Woman]", published in 1971 in ''Davka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hyman-paula-e |title=Paula E.

== Jewish feminist theology ==

Various versions of [[feminist theology]] exist within the Jewish community.

Some of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterization of God, and/or more feminist language in general, within the [[siddur]] (Jewish prayerbook) and service.

In 1946, the new Silverman siddur of Conservative Judaism changed the traditional words of thanking God for "not making me a woman", instead using words thanking God for "making me a free person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Debra |url=http://www.stljewishlight.com/opinion/commentaries/article_c8986454-85df-11e8-b2ce-bb83d5ec9e06.html |title=Conservative movement is closing its gender gap, but there is still work to be done - St. Louis Jewish Light: Commentaries - Conservative movement is closing its gender gap, but there is still work to be done: Commentaries |publisher=Stljewishlight.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Rita Gross]] published the article "Female God Language in a Jewish Context" (Davka Magazine 17), which Jewish scholar and feminist [[Judith Plaskow]] considers "probably the first article to deal theoretically with the issue of female God-language in a Jewish context".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/beliefs/Issues/Gender_and_Feminism/Feminist_Thought/Theology.shtml |title=Jewish Feminist Theology: A Survey |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/torah/cardoza/ssin.htm |title=Standing at Sinai |publisher=Dhushara.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Gross was Jewish herself at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJs-aLqCiF8C&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=rita+gross+jew&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j1I9T8y6Loy_0QGp4qHpBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6wEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=rita%20gross%20jew&amp;f=false |title=Jewish Mysticism and Kabbalah: New Insights and Scholarship - Frederick Greenspahn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Rabbi]] [[Rebecca Alpert]] (''Reform Judaism'', Winter 1991) comments:
{{quote|The experience of praying with ''Siddur Nashim'' [the first Sabbath prayer book to refer to God using female pronouns and imagery]  ... transformed my relationship with God. For the first time, I understood what it meant to be made in God's image. To think of God as a woman like myself, to see Her as both powerful and nurturing, to see Her imaged with a woman's body, with womb, with breasts – this was an experience of ultimate significance. Was this the relationship that men have had with God for all these millennia? How wonderful to gain access to those feelings and perceptions.}} ''Siddur Nashim'' was self-published in 1976 by Naomi Janowitz and [[Margaret Wenig]].

In 1990 Rabbi [[Margaret Wenig]] wrote the sermon, "God Is a Woman and She Is Growing Older," which as of 2011 has been published ten times (three times in German) and preached by rabbis from Australia to California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623080230/http://huc.edu/faculty/faculty/MargaretWenig.shtml |date=23 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Paula Reimers]] ("Feminism, Judaism, and God the Mother", ''Conservative Judaism'' '''46''' (1993)) comments:
{{quote|Those who want to use God/She language want to affirm womanhood and the feminine aspect of the deity. They do this by emphasizing that which most clearly distinguishes the female experience from the male. A male or female deity can create through speech or through action, but the metaphor for creation which is uniquely feminine is birth. Once God is called female, then, the metaphor of birth and the identification of the deity with nature and its processes become inevitable}}

Ahuva Zache affirms that using both masculine and feminine language for God can be a positive thing, but reminds her Reform Jewish readership that God is beyond gender (''Is God male, female, both or neither? How should we phrase our prayers in response to God's gender?'', in the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]'s iTorah, [https://archive.is/20120715190459/http://urj.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=11422]):

{{quote|Feminine imagery of God does not in any way threaten Judaism. On the contrary, it enhances the Jewish understanding of God, which should not be limited to masculine metaphors. All language that humans use to describe God is only a metaphor. Using masculine and feminine metaphors for God is one way to remind ourselves that gendered descriptions of God are just metaphors. God is beyond gender.}}

These views are highly controversial even within liberal Jewish movements.&lt;ref&gt;"This genderless God also represents a profound betrayal of the Torah narrative."  Matthew Berke, "God and Gender in Judaism", in Copyright (c) 1996 ''First Things'' 64 (June/July 1996): 33–38&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] and many [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jews]]
hold that it is wrong to use English female pronouns for God, viewing such usage as an intrusion of modern feminist ideology into Jewish tradition.{&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mirsky|first1=Yehudah|title=Feminine Images of God|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/feminine-images-of-god|website=jwa.org|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;} Liberal prayerbooks tend increasingly to also avoid male-specific words and pronouns, seeking that all references to God in translations be made in gender-neutral language. For example, the [[Liberal Judaism (UK)|UK Liberal movement]]'s ''Siddur Lev Chadash'' (1995) does so, as does the [[Reform Judaism (UK)|UK Reform Movement]]'s ''Forms of Prayer'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thejc.com/articles/the-slimline-siddur-a-touch-bob-dylan|title=The slimline siddur with a touch of Bob Dylan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bwpjc.org/slc.htm Siddur Lev Chadash&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705015023/http://www.bwpjc.org/slc.htm |date= 5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mishkan T'filah]], the American Reform Jewish prayer book released in 2007, references to God as "He" have been removed, and whenever Jewish patriarchs are named (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), so also are the matriarchs (Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/us/03prayerbook.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein | title=In New Prayer Book, Signs of Broad Change | date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the Reform Jewish [[High Holy Days]] prayer book [[Mishkan HaNefesh]] was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah.&lt;ref name="jweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/74278/gates-of-repentance-replacement-advances-reform-trends/ |title='Gates of Repentance' replacement advances Reform trends &amp;#124; j. the Jewish news weekly of Northern California |publisher=Jweekly.com |date=2015-03-26 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a version of the High Holy Days prayer [[Avinu Malkeinu]] that refers to God as both "Loving Father" and "Compassionate Mother."&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt; Other notable changes are replacing a line from the Reform movement's earlier prayerbook, "Gates of Repentance," that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line "rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]", and adding a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering "mibeit", Hebrew for "from the house of", in addition to the traditional "son of" or "daughter of".&lt;ref name="jweekly1"/&gt;

In 2003 ''The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust'', the first full-length feminist theology of the Holocaust, written by Melissa Raphael, was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415236657|title=The Female Face of God in Auschwitz: A Jewish Feminist Theology of the Holocaust (Religion and Gender): Melissa Raphael: 9780415236652: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Plaskow]]'s ''Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective'' (1991), and [[Rachel Adler]]'s ''Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics'' (1999) are the only two full-length Jewish feminist works to focus entirely on theology in general (rather than specific aspects such as Holocaust theology).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/feminist-theology|title=Feminist Theology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Standing Again at Sinai: Judaism from a Feminist Perspective'' (1991) is the first book of Jewish feminist theology ever written.

There is a growing subfield in the study of gender and Judaism, which sees the binaries of male and female as crucial constructs in Jewish thought.&lt;ref&gt;Kosman, Miriam, Circle, Arrow, Spiral, Exploring Gender in Judaism, Menucha Publishers, 2014. ^&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven F. Friedell, "The ‘Different Voice’ in Jewish Law: Some Parallels to a Feminist Jurisprudence," Indiana Law Journal, October 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neusner, Jacob, 'Androgynous Judaism: Masculine and Feminine in the Dual Torah,' Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1993.  ^&lt;/ref&gt;

While the male/female dialectic first makes its appearance in the story of creation, the Talmud insists that the idea of male and female extends way beyond sex roles: "Everything that God created, He created as male and female...."(Baba Batra 74b)

This dialectic takes on even greater theological significance in light of the Biblical book, Song of Songs, which has been traditionally interpreted as a metaphor for the relationship between God and the Nation of Israel, where the Nation of Israel is cast as feminine towards God, who is represented in the story by the male lover.

Other examples of topics in which the male/female dynamic is used metaphorically include: the relationship between Shabbat and the days of the week[8], the relationship between the Oral and Written Law, the relationship between This World and the Next, the interplay between the legal and extra-legal aspects of Talmud (Halacha and Aggada)[9], and the Jewish calendar, which makes use of both the sun (traditionally symbolic of the male force) and the moon (traditionally symbolic of the female force).&lt;ref&gt;Heshelis, Devorah, The Moon's Lost Light, Targum Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender polarity is robustly maintained in both the Bible and in the Oral Law, (Deuteronomy, 22:5, even forbids cross-dressing) and upholding this polarity is seen as critical in achieving synthesis between the masculine and feminine.

This exploration of gender-constructs in primary sources reveals surprising valuation of the feminine prototype in Kabbala-based sources which invites inquiry into the social, ethical, ecological, moral and philosophical ramifications of a feminine perspective within Jewish thought&lt;ref&gt;.

== Orthodox Judaism==

===Haredi positions on feminism===

The leaders of [[Haredi Judaism]] regularly pronounce all forms of feminism as "Reform", as non-Jewish, or as a threat to Jewish tradition. An article in Cross-currents criticizing advancing women's leadership writes that: "The entirety of traditional Jewish religious life, including its age-old ritual norms and societal norms, even if they lack formal codification, reflects Torah values, be they halachic or hashkafic; every aspect of our multi-millenia traditional religious communal modality is embedded in or predicated upon halachic or hashkafic axioms. These axioms may not be apparent to the uninitiated, yet failure to perceive them does not grant license to negate, dismiss or reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordimer|first=Avrohom|title=Ordaining Women and the Role of Mesorah|url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2013/06/03/what-about-mesorah-do-you-not-understand/#ixzz2uVOmqFmJ|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Cross-currents|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The haredi claim is that feminism is changing Torah.

Haredi Judaism also espouses strict essentialist differences between men and women, rooted in ideas about God's will and creation. The haredi worldview espouses the idea of womanhood as expressed in King Solomon's poem "A Woman of Valor," which praises a woman for maintaining the home, care for the family, and food-preparation, practices which the poem admire in women as part of their wisdom, courage, creativity, dedication, selflessness, and perhaps business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/ci/w/48955426.html |title=Feminism &amp; Judaism |last=Heller |first=Rebbetzin Tziporah |authorlink=Tziporah Heller|publisher=aish.com |date=8 January 2000 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important thrust of haredi education for girls and young women is to educate, train and encourage them to become wives and mothers within large families devoted to the strictest [[Torah Judaism]] way of life. While most haredi women receive schooling in [[Beis Yaakov]] schools designed for them exclusively, the curriculum of these schools does not teach [[Talmud]] and neither encourages nor teaches its female students to study the same subjects as young haredi men in the haredi [[yeshiva]]s. In some haredi communities, the education of girls in secular subjects (such as mathematics) is superior to that of boys.  This is partly because of the greater time devoted to sacred subjects in the case of boys, and partly because many haredi women work in paid jobs to enable their husbands to engage in full-time Torah study or to bring in a second income.

There is currently no movement within haredi Judaism to train women as [[rabbi]]s, and there is no visible movement to advance women's Talmudic knowledge.  
In the fall of 2015, the [[Agudath Israel of America]], which is part of haredi Judaism, denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring [[Yeshivat Maharat]], [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], [[Open Orthodoxy]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamodia.com/2015/11/03/moetzes-open-orthodoxy-not-a-form-of-torah-judaism/|title=Moetzes: 'Open Orthodoxy' Not a Form of Torah Judaism|work=Hamodia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Breach-in-US-Orthodox-Judaism-grows-as-haredi-body-rejects-Open-Orthodoxy-institutions-431929|title=Breach in US Orthodox Judaism grows as haredi body rejects 'Open Orthodoxy' institutions|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/323887/agudath-rabbis-declare-war-on-open-orthodoxy/|title=Avi Weiss Defends 'Open Orthodoxy' as Agudah Rabbis Declare War|author=Josh Nathan-Kazis|date=3 November 2015|work=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, most haredi women are exposed to modern ideas and secular education, unlike most haredi men. Prof. Tamar El-or explored changes in women's lives and the impact of mixed educational cultures on women's empowerment in her seminal book, ''Educated and Ignorant'' about the education of women in the Gur Hassidic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Or|first=Tamar|title=Educated and Ignorant: Ultraorthodox Jewish Women and their World .:|year=1994|publisher=Lynne Rienner Pub.|location=Boulder, CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2016 it was learned that the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] sect issued a decree warning that university education for women was "dangerous". Written in Yiddish, the decree warned:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ultra-orthodox-rabbis-ban-women-from-going-to-university-in-case-they-get-dangerous-secular-a7204171.html|title=Ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect bans women from going to university|date=2016-08-22|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''It has lately become the new trend that girls and married women are pursuing degrees in special education. Some attend classes and others online. And so we'd like to let their parents know that it is against the Torah.''

''We will be very strict about this. No girls attending our school are allowed to study and get a degree. It is dangerous. Girls who will not abide will be forced to leave our school. Also, we will not give any jobs or teaching position in the school to girls who've been to college or have a degree.''

''We have to keep our school safe and we can't allow any secular influences in our holy environment. It is against the base upon which our Mosed was built."''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are some signs of a feminist movement beginning to sprout in the haredi world, especially in Israel. During the 2013 Israeli elections, Esti Shushan led a feminist drive to force haredi political parties to allow women to run on their lists (the parties currently forbid women from running). The campaign, called on haredi women to refuse to vote for parties that exclude women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffay|first=Nathan|title=Israeli elections: Charedi women refuse to vote|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/israel-news/97420/israeli-elections-charedi-women-refuse-vote|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the 2013 municipal elections in Israel, three haredi women took an unprecedented step and ran for their local municipalities—Shira Gergi in Safed, Ruth Colian in Petach Tikva, and Racheli Ibenboim in Jerusalem. Gergi is the only one who was elected, becoming the first haredi woman to sit on a municipal council, and becoming the first woman on the Safed council in twenty years.

One of the most interesting voices of haredi feminism is that of [[Adina Bar-Shalom]], daughter of the late Israeli Sephardic Chief Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]]. Bar Shalom established the Haredi College of Jerusalem, regularly speaks out about the importance of women's education and work, and in 2013 established a women's-only political party in the haredi town of Elad. In addition, in early 2014 she considered a bid to become the president of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Haaretz|title=Next goal of Shas leader's daughter: Israeli presidency Adina Bar Shalom, oldest daughter of Ovadia Yosef and founder of ultra-Orthodox college in Jerusalem, said to be angling for Shimon Peres' job.|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.569976|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=22 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Bar-Shalom wrote that the haredi feminist revolution is already here. "The train has left the station," she wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bar-Shalom|first=Adina|title=Haredi feminism is already here|url=http://www.jewfem.com/index.php?option=com_easyblog&amp;view=entry&amp;id=419&amp;Itemid=233|publisher=Translated by Elana Maryles Sztokman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another emerging haredi voice is that of Esty Reider-Indorsky. She "came out" in March 2014 as a popular haredi columnist who had been writing under a man's name—"Ari Solomon"—and has a large following under her pseudonym. In an article in YNet, Reider-Indorsky claimed that there is a strong feminist movement brewing in the haredi community, and asked non-haredi women to stay out of their own internal revolution. "Don't patronize us," she writes to non-haredi feminists. "Don't make revolutions for us, or try to clean out our backyard. We are doing it in our own way and we are doing it better: There is an abundance of haredi women lawyers and women in start-up.... There are haredi women who choose an academic career, and there are haredi women leading change in every area imaginable... The change will happen. it's already happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rieder-Indosrky|first=Esty|title=Dear Israeli women, don't patronize us|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4496840,00.html|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=YNet (Hebrew)|date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
These are signs of the beginnings of feminist movement in the haredi community in Israel.

===Non-haredi Orthodox Jewish feminism===

Orthodox Jewish feminism, unlike its Reform/Reconstructionist counterparts, seeks to change the position of women from within [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (''halakha'').

Orthodox feminism works within the halakhic system and works with rabbis and rabbinical institutions to create more inclusive practices within Orthodox communal life and leadership. Orthodox feminism tends to focus on issues, such as the problems of [[agunah]], fostering women's education, leadership, and ritual participation, women's leadership and making synagogue more women-friendly. Unlike other denominations, Orthodox feminists retain the partition in synagogue and do not count women in a minyan. The all-women's prayer group—Women's Tefilla Group, is an Orthodox practice that began in the 1970s and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=JOFA|title=JOFA [Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]|url=http://www.jofa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New educational programs have enabled Modern Orthodox women to study Talmud and other rabbinic literature, at levels intended to be comparable to a yeshivah or kollel for men, including [[Drisha Institute]] (founded in 1979), [[Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies]], and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and the Study of Torah|ISBN=9780881256901|page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Blu Greenberg]] founded the [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] (JOFA) to advocate for women's increased participation and leadership in Modern Orthodox Jewish life and to create a community for women and men dedicated to such change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jofa.org Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]. Jofa.org (14 April 2011). Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; JOFA has focused on issues including: agunah, bat mitzvah, women's scholarship, women's prayer, ritual, women's synagogue leadership, and women's religious leadership.

Also in 1997, Gail Billig became the first female president of a major Orthodox synagogue, at Congregation Ahavath Torah in Englewood, N.J.&lt;ref name="womensenews.org"&gt;Klein, Abigail. (2007-07-13) [http://womensenews.org/story/religion/070713/leaders-lift-spirit-in-orthodox-womens-section Leaders Lift Spirit in Orthodox Women's Section]. Women's eNews. Retrieved on 18 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the first [[partnership minyan]]s were established—Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem, and Darkhei Noam in New York City. These are Orthodox communities that maximize women's participation in the prayer to the full extent possible within halakha. Although critics of partnership minyan argue that these are not "Orthodox", the communities themselves vehemently insist that they are Orthodox. The fact that the synagogues have partitions and do not count women as part of the minyan (and thus do not allow women to lead any parts of services that require a quorum) demonstrate the loyalty to Orthodox practice. Dr. Elana Sztokman, former Executive Director of JOFA, wrote extensively about this phenomenon in her book The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish Men in an Egalitarian World, and examined this dynamic in which the partnership minyan considers itself Orthodox but is often rejected as Orthodox by other members of the community. Today there are over 35 partnership minyans around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sztokman|first=Elana|title=The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish Men in an Egalitarian World|year=2011|publisher=Brandeis University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major historical event of Orthodox feminism occurred in 2009, when Rabba [[Sara Hurwitz]] became the first publicly ordained Orthodox woman rabbi. [[Avi Weiss]] then launched a training school for Orthodox women in rabbinic positions, [[Yeshivat Maharat]] (acronym for "Morah hilkhatit rabbanit toranit"—a rabbinic, halakhic Torah teacher.) Rabbi Weiss had originally announced that graduates would be called "rabba", but when the Rabbinical Council of America threatened to oust him, he recanted and created the term ''[[maharat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sara Hurwitz Adopts the Title of Maharat|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/jan/27/2010/sara-hurwitz|newspaper=Jewish Women's Archives|date=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first cohort of [[maharat]]s graduated in June 2013: Maharats Ruth Balinsky-Friedman, [[Rachel Kohl Finegold]] and [[Abby Brown Scheier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reimer-Torn|first=Susan|title=Maharats March Into Jewish World  First-ever ordination at Orthodox women's seminary seen as 'sea change,' but steep hurdles persist.|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national-news/maharats-march-jewish-world|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=The Jewish Week|date=2013-06-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624092654/http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national-news/maharats-march-jewish-world|archivedate=24 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the [[Yeshivat Maharat]].&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yeshivatmaharat.org/class-of-2015/|title=Class of 2015|work=Yeshivat Maharat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained as Rabbi by the [[Yeshivat Maharat]], making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis|title=Why Orthodox Judaism needs female rabbis|author=Rabbi Lila Kagedan|date=25 November 2015|work=The Canadian Jewish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 Tamar Frankiel became the president of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion (California)|Academy for Jewish Religion]] in California, making her the first Orthodox woman to lead an American rabbinical school.&lt;ref name="ajrca.org"&gt;[http://ajrca.org/faculty/dr-tamar-frankiel/ Dr. Tamar Frankiel | Academy for Jewish Religion, California&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228055346/http://ajrca.org/faculty/dr-tamar-frankiel/ |date=28 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewishjournal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/orthodox_woman_a_first|title=Orthodox woman, a first - Los Angeles|work=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school itself is transdenominational, not Orthodox.&lt;ref name="jewishjournal.com"/&gt;

In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a [[halacha|halachic]] ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the [[Kaddish]] prayer in memory of their deceased parents.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt;

Also in 2013, the first class of female [[halacha|halachic]] advisers trained to practice in the US graduated; they graduated from the North American branch of [[Nishmat]]'s yoetzet halacha program in a ceremony at Congregation Sheartith Israel, Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/landmark-us-program-graduates-first-female-halachic-advisers/|title=Landmark US program graduates first female halachic advisers|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this event was met with only faint enthusiasm among Orthodox feminists for several reasons. One is that Nishmat consistently distances itself from feminism, as its founder Chana Henkin often pronounces that she is not a feminist and that the women who graduate from Nishmat do not adjudicate halakha but always ask male rabbis. Another reason is that against the backdrop of the graduation of women from Yeshivat Maharat, in which women are full leaders with complete authority to adjudicate and function as communal rabbis this event does not necessarily represent the greatest advancement for Orthodox women and is arguably a step backward. That is, women counseling women only on "women's issues" without any real halakhic authority of their own keeps women in a somewhat more official version of traditional gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graetz|first=Naomi|title=Women and Religion in Israel|year=2003|publisher=Brandeis University Press|location=in Melanie Rich and Kalpana Misra, Jewish feminism in Israel|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the first women were elected as national officers of the [[Orthodox Union]]; specifically, three female national vice presidents and two female associate vice presidents were elected.&lt;ref name="jstandard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jstandard.com/content/item/o.u._acts_to_increase_funding_for_schools_and_votes_first_women_to_national/32193|title=O.U. acts to increase funding for schools and votes first women to national posts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained by [[Yeshivat Maharat]] and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as "Rabbi".&lt;ref name="auto11"&gt;''Canadian Jewish News'' [http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/why-orthodox-judaism-needs-female-rabbis Why Orthodoxy Needs Female Rabbis], 25 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Rabbi Kagedan completed a residency at [[Shira Hadasha]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macroscope.com.au|website=Macroscope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the fall of 2015, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], representing over a thousand Orthodox rabbis across the United States, formally adopted a policy prohibiting the ordination or hiring of women rabbis by synagogues that operate within the boundaries of their figurative jurisdiction, regardless of title.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;''Times of Israel'' [http://www.timesofisrael.com/first-yeshivat-maharat-female-rabbi-hired-by-orthodox-synagogue/ First Yeshivat Maharat Female Rabbi Hired by Orthodox Synagogue], 3 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a ruling which allows women to give instruction on Jewish law and to issue [[halacha|halachic]] decisions.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Beit-Hillel-says-women-can-give-rulings-in-Jewish-law-387019|title=Beit Hillel says women can give rulings in Jewish law|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beit Hillel claimed that this ruling was the first time women issuing halachic rulings was formally affirmed in a written [[responsa]] of Jewish law.&lt;ref name="jpost.com1"/&gt;

Also in 2015, Jennie Rosenfeld became the first female Orthodox spiritual advisor in Israel (specifically, she became the spiritual advisor, also called manhiga ruchanit, for the community of [[Efrat]].)&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/1/26/with-female-spiritual-advisor-efrat-spotlights-womens-empowerment-in-israel#.VMZhzS7lw4I=|title=With female spiritual advisor, Efrat spotlights women's empowerment in Israel|work=JNS.org|access-date=26 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207204326/http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/1/26/with-female-spiritual-advisor-efrat-spotlights-womens-empowerment-in-israel#.VMZhzS7lw4I=|archive-date=7 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called "B'Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In 2016 it was announced that [[Ephraim Mirvis]] created the job of ma'ayan by which women would be advisers on Jewish law in the area of family purity and as adult educators in Orthodox synagogues.&lt;ref name="thejc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/153491/chief-rabbi-mirvis-launches-new-qualification-female-educators|title=Chief Rabbi Mirvis launches new qualification for female educators|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a part-time training course for 18 months, which is the first such course in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="thejc.com"/&gt;

In 2017, the [[Orthodox Union]] adopted a policy banning women from serving as clergy, from holding titles such as "rabbi", or from doing common clergy functions even without a title, in its congregations in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/2017/02/03/orthodox-union-bars-women-from-serving-as-clergy-in-its-synagogues/ |title=Orthodox Union bars women from serving as clergy in its synagogues – J |publisher=Jweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in [[halacha|Jewish religious law]], clergy, schools, groups, and rituals ==

In 1845, rabbis attending the Frankfort Synod of the emerging [[Reform Judaism]] declared women count in a [[minyan]], a formalization of a customary Reform practice dating back to 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uf.sjc.vic.edu.au/religious-traditions-depth-studies/07/39 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821083705/http://uf.sjc.vic.edu.au/religious-traditions-depth-studies/07/39/ |archivedate=21 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Fanny Neuda wrote the first Jewish prayer book known to have been written by a woman for women, called ''Hours of Devotion''; it was translated into English and published in the United States 12 years later.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/09/04/news-opinion/world/czech-author-of-first-womens-prayer-book-commemorated |title=Czech author of first women's prayer book commemorated &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a plaque honoring her was unveiled in [[Loštice]], where she lived while her husband was a rabbi there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In 1884, [[Julie Rosewald]] became America's first female cantor (though she was born in Germany); she served San Francisco's Temple Emanu-El, although she was not ordained.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/blog/Julie-Rosewald|title=Julie Rosewald: America's first woman cantor|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/short_takes/forgotten_woman_cantor_julie_rosewald_now_getting_her_due|title=The Forgotten Woman Cantor: Julie Rosewald Now Getting Her Due - The Jewish Week|work=The Jewish Week|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as a cantor there until 1893.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judith Kaplan Eisenstein|Judith Kaplan]] recited the preliminary blessing, read a portion of that week's Torah portion in Hebrew and English, and then intoned the closing blessing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Kaplan, who at that time claimed to be an Orthodox rabbi, joined [[Conservative Judaism]] and then became the founder of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], and influenced Jews from all branches of non-Orthodox Judaism through his position at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

Also in 1922, [[Martha Neumark]] and her father attended the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] Conference, where she succeeded in convincing the CCAR to ordain women rabbis.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/archive/jsp/perInfo.jsp?personID=1017 |title=Personal Information for Martha Montor |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCAR declared in a responsa in 1922, "...woman cannot justly be denied the privilege of ordination," having voted 56 to 11 in favor of that statement.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bd_AICOMwccC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=martha+neumark&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=W4uAT--pHube0QG57eyMCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD4Q6wEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=martha%20neumark&amp;f=false |title=Religions of the United States in Practice - Colleen McDannell - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2001-10-29 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the board of the college still refused to consider women for ordination, voting (as Neumark recalled) six laymen to two rabbis against it.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Neumark thus earned a qualification as a religious school principal instead of ordination, though she had spent 7 and a half years in rabbinical school.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

Also in 1972, a group of ten New York Jewish feminists calling themselves ''Ezrat Nashim'' (the [[Mechitza|women's section in a synagogue]], but also "women's help"), took the issue of equality for women to the 1972 convention of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] movement's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], presenting a document on 14 March that they named the "[https://books.google.com/books?id=vVETCrICwO8C&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22jewish+women+call+for+a+change%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=euiXT8TILIL30gHN2onxBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6wEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jewish%20women%20call%20for%20a%20change%22&amp;f=false Call for Change]."  The rabbis received the document in their convention packets, but ''Ezrat Nashim'' presented it during a meeting with the rabbis' wives. The Call for Change demanded that women be accepted as witnesses before Jewish law, be considered as bound to perform all [[Mitzvah|mitzvot]], be allowed full participation in religious observances, have equal rights in marriage and be allowed to initiate divorce, be counted in the [[minyan]], and be permitted to assume positions of leadership in the synagogue and within the general Jewish community. [[Paula Hyman]], who was a member of ''Ezrat Nashim'', wrote that: "We recognized that the subordinate status of women was linked to their exemption from positive time-bound ''mitzvot'' (commandments), and we therefore accepted increased obligation as the corollary of equality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA039.htm Paula Hyman], ''Jewish Women and the Feminist Revolution'', Jewish Women's Archive.

In 1973, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism voted to count men and women equally as members of a [[minyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1973/09/11/archive/women-equal-with-men-in-minyan|title=Women Equal with Men in Minyan|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism adapted a [[responsum]] by Rabbi David Fine, [https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf ''Women and the Minyan''], which provides an official religious-law foundation for counting women in a minyan and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127133632/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(194&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This responsum holds that although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have, as a collective whole, voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others.  The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning.  By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the ''halakhic'' tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners.

In 2005, the [[Kohenet Institute]] was founded by Rabbi Jill Hammer and Holly Shere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/thisweek/aug/14/2006/kohenet-hebrew-priestess-institute|title=Kohenet: the Hebrew Priestess Institute, launches its first training institute in Accord, NY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kohenet Institute]], based at the [[Isabella Freedman Jewish Retreat Center]] in Connecticut, offers a two-year course of study to women who are then ordained as Jewish priestesses.&lt;ref name="kohenet.org"&gt;[http://www.kohenet.org/institute/ Kohenet: Hebrew Priestess Institute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020201418/http://www.kohenet.org/institute/ |date=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/68940/jewish-american-priestess-kohenet-institute-ordains-women-for-a-new-jewish-/|title=Jewish American Priestess: Kohenet Institute ordains women for a new Jewish world|author=emma silvers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Kohenet" is a feminine variation on "kohan," meaning priest.&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt; The Kohenet Institute's training involves earth-based spiritual practices that they believe harken back to pre–rabbinic Judaism; a time when, according to Kohenet's founders, women took on many more (and much more powerful) spiritual leadership roles than are commonly taken by women today.&lt;ref name="jweekly.com"/&gt; A Jewish priestess may, according to Kohenet, act as a rabbi, but the two roles are not the same.&lt;ref name="kohenet.org"/&gt;

In 2006, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism adopted three [[responsum|responsa]] on the subject of [[niddah]], which reaffirmed an obligation of Conservative women to abstain from sexual relations during and following [[menstruation]] and to immerse in a [[mikvah]] prior to resumption, while liberalizing observance requirements including shortening the length of the [[niddah]] period, lifting restrictions on non-sexual contact during niddah, and reducing the circumstances under which spotting and similar conditions would mandate abstinence.&lt;ref name="RabbiIntro"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Mikveh_Introduction.doc Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, Mikveh and the Sanctity of Family Relations, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320161101/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Mikveh_Introduction.doc |date=20 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiGrossman"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Grossman-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Susan Grossman, MIKVEH AND THE SANCTITY OF BEING CREATED HUMAN, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407061730/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Grossman-Niddah.pdf |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiReisner"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Reisner-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Avram Reisner, OBSERVING NIDDAH IN OUR DAY: AN INQUIRY ON THE STATUS OF PURITY AND THE PROHIBITION OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH A MENSTRUANT, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407061721/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Reisner-Niddah.pdf |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiBerkowitz"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Berkowitz-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Miriam Berkowitz, RESHAPING THE LAWS OF FAMILY PURITY FOR THE MODERN WORLD, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, 6 December 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320161047/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Berkowitz-Niddah.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the first women were elected as national officers of the [[Orthodox Union]]; specifically, three female national vice presidents and two female associate vice presidents were elected.&lt;ref name="jstandard.com"/&gt;

In June 2015, [[Lila Kagedan]] was ordained by [[Yeshivat Maharat]] and in keeping with newer policies, was given the freedom to choose her own title, and she chose to be addressed as "Rabbi".&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt; However, in the fall of 2015, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], representing over a thousand Orthodox rabbis across the United States, formally adopted a policy prohibiting the ordination or hiring of women rabbis by synagogues that operate within the boundaries of their figurative jurisdiction, regardless of title.&lt;ref name="auto12"/&gt; Similarly, in the fall of 2015, the [[Agudath Israel of America]] denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring [[Yeshivat Maharat]], [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], [[Open Orthodoxy]], and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;

In 2016, after four years of deliberation, the Reform seminary [[HUC-JIR]] decided to give women a choice of wording on their ordination certificates, including the option to have the same wording as men.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2016/05/31/life-religion/why-a-small-word-change-is-a-big-deal-for-reform-women-rabbis Why a small word change is a big deal for Reform women rabbis] JTA, 31 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Up until then, male candidates' certificates identified them by the Reform movement's traditional "morenu harav," or "our teacher the rabbi," while female candidates' certificates only used the term "rav u'morah," or "rabbi and teacher." Rabbi Mary Zamore, executive director of the Reform movement's [[Women's Rabbinic Network]], explained that the HUC was uncomfortable with giving women the same title as men. In 2012 she wrote to Rabbi [[David Ellenson]], HUC's then president, requesting that he address the discrepancy, which she said was "smacking of gender inequality."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

=== Women as ''sofrot'' (scribes) ===
A Sofer, Sopher, Sofer SeTaM, or Sofer ST"M (Heb: "scribe", סופר סת״ם) is a Jewish scribe who can transcribe Torah scrolls, tefillin and mezuzot, and other religious writings.  (ST"M, סת״ם, is an abbreviation for Sefer Torahs, Tefillin, and Mezuzot. The plural of sofer is "soferim", סופרים.) Forming the basis for the discussion of women becoming soferim, [[Talmud|Talmud Gittin]] 45b states: "Sifrei Torah, tefillin and mezuzot written by a heretic, a star-worshipper, a slave, a woman, a minor, a [[Cuthean]], or an [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostate Jew]], are unfit for ritual use."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geniza.net/ritual/women.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019133505/http://www.geniza.net/ritual/women.shtml |date=19 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulings on [[Mezuzah]] and [[Tefillin]] are virtually undisputed among those who hold to the [[Talmud|Talmudic Law]]. While [[Arba'ah Turim]] does not include women in its list of those ineligible to write Sifrei Torah, some see this as proof that women are permitted to write a Torah scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Tur, [[Wikisource:Shulchan Aruch/Orach Chaim/271|Orah Hayyim 271]].&lt;/ref&gt; However today, virtually all Orthodox (both Modern and Ultra) authorities contest the idea that a woman is permitted to write a [[Sefer Torah]]. Yet women are permitted to inscribe [[Ketubah|Ketubot]] (marriage contracts), STaM not intended for ritual use, and other writings of [[Sofrut]] beyond simple STaM.

== Women in Humanistic Judaism ==
[[Humanistic Judaism]] is a movement in [[Judaism]] that offers a nontheistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people and encourages humanistic and secular Jews to celebrate their Jewish identity by participating in Jewish holidays and life cycle events (such as weddings and bar and bat mitzvah) with inspirational ceremonies that draw upon but go beyond traditional literature. Humanistic Judaism ordains both men and women as rabbis, and its first rabbi was a woman, [[Tamara Kolton]], who was ordained in 1999.&lt;ref name="shj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shj.org/shjbios.htm |title=Society for Humanistic Judaism - Rabbis and Leadership |publisher=Shj.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928164758/http://www.shj.org/shjbios.htm |archivedate=28 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first cantor was also a woman, [[Hazzan Deborah Davis|Deborah Davis]], ordained in 2001; however, Humanistic Judaism has since stopped ordaining cantors.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; The [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]] issued a statement in 1996 stating in part, "we affirm that a woman has the moral right and should have the continuing legal right to decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with her own ethical standards. Because a decision to terminate a pregnancy carries serious, irreversible consequences, it is one to be made with great care and with keen awareness of the complex psychological, emotional, and ethical implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shj.org/Choice.htm Society for Humanistic Judaism - Reproductive Choice Abortion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040305165842/http://www.shj.org/Choice.htm |date= 5 March 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also issued a statement in 2011 condemning the then-recent passage of the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act" by the U.S. House of Representatives, which they called "a direct attack on a woman's right to choose".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shj.org/NewsAbortionFunding.html Society for Humanistic Judaism Condemns Limit on Choice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709054548/http://www.shj.org/NewsAbortionFunding.html |date=9 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 they issued a resolution opposing conscience clauses that allow religious-affiliated institutions to be exempt from generally applicable requirements mandating reproductive healthcare services to individuals or employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shj.org/ConscienceClauses.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725135714/http://www.shj.org/ConscienceClauses.html |date=25 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 they issued a resolution stating in part, "Therefore, be it resolved that: The Society for Humanistic Judaism wholeheartedly supports the observance of [[Women's Equality Day]] on August 26 to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing women to vote; The Society condemns gender discrimination in all its forms, including restriction of rights, limited access to education, violence, and subjugation; and The Society commits itself to maintain vigilance and speak out in the fight to bring gender equality to our generation and to the generations that follow."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shj.org/WomensEqualityDay.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928161629/http://www.shj.org/WomensEqualityDay.html |date=28 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 [[David Ben-Gurion]] agreed that the authority in matters of marriage and divorce would be invested in the hands of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and an agreement was signed stating that (among other matters), known as the "status quo letter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/civil-marriage-israel-jews-secular-orthodox-rabbinical-court.html|title=Israel's Rabbis Keep Lock On Jewish Marriage - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121152127/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/10/civil-marriage-israel-jews-secular-orthodox-rabbinical-court.html|archive-date=21 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 the [[Knesset]] enacted the Rabbinical Courts Jurisdiction (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 5713 – 1953.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02840.html Bet Din and Judges&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Section 1 of the Law states, "Matters of marriage and divorce of Jews in Israel, being citizens or residents of the State, shall be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the rabbinical courts."&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; The substantive provision of section 2 of this Law further states: "Marriages and divorces of Jews shall be performed in Israel in accordance with Jewish religious law" (din torah).&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"/&gt; However, a Muslim woman in Israel may petition for and receive a divorce through the Sharia courts without her husband's consent under certain conditions, and a marriage contract may provide for other circumstances in which she may obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A Muslim man in Israel may divorce his wife without her consent and without petitioning the court.&lt;ref name="hr2010"&gt;2010 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories.

In 2006, Israel's Supreme Court ruled that women should be allowed to deliver eulogies and that the burial societies, or chevra kadisha, should not impose gender segregation in the cemetery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/religion/article/israeli_chief_rabbinical_council_oks_eulogies_by_women_20120612|title=Israeli Chief Rabbinical Council OKs eulogies by women - Religion|work=Jewish Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling was in response to an incident in [[Petach Tikvah]] in which a woman was stopped from eulogizing her father.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, the court's ruling was not backed up by the Religious Services Ministry until 2012, when Israel's Chief Rabbinical Council ruled that women can deliver eulogies at funerals, but that it is up to the community rabbi to decide on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

In 2010, Israel passed the Civil Union Law, allowing a couple to marry civilly in Israel if they are both registered as officially not belonging to any religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/israel/Contemporary_Life/Society_and_Religious_Issues/Freedom_of_Religion/civil_marriage_in_israel.shtml|title=Civil Marriage in Israel|work=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2010, the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] outlawed public gender segregation in Jerusalem's [[Mea Shearim]] neighborhood in response to a petition submitted after extremist Haredi men physically and verbally assaulted women for walking on a designated men's only road. However, in January 2011, a ruling of the [[Israeli High Court of Justice]] allowed the continuation of the gender segregation in public buses on a strictly voluntary basis for a one-year experimental period.&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=Jerusalem Post |title=Court scraps 'mehadrin' buses |date=6 January 2011 |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?ID=202456&amp;R=R1 |accessdate=2011-03-08 | first=Dan |last=Izenberg |first2=Jonah |last2=Mandel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Israeli Orthodox rabbinical organization Beit Hillel issued a [[halacha|halachic]] ruling which allows women, for the first time, to say the [[Kaddish]] prayer in memory of their deceased parents.&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4396702,00.html|title=Halachic ruling: Women may say Kaddish|work=ynet|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, the minimum marriage age in Israel became 18 for females and males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/knesset-raise-minimum-marriage-age-from-17-to-18/|title=Israel raises minimum marriage age from 17 to 18|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, the [[Religious Judges Law]] in Israel was amended to say that at least four women must be included in the religious judges' nomination committee, including a female advocate in the religious courts, and that the total number of committee members shall be eleven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=9919 Israel Hayom | In a first, women to sit on rabbinic judges selection panel&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, Israel's [[Chief Rabbinate]] promised to remove the obstacles preventing women from working as supervisors in the state [[kosher]] certification system, and [[Emunah]] announced the first supervisor certification course for women in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.561459|title=Rabbinate Opens Kashrut Supervision to Women - National - Haaretz|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, the Minister of Religious Affairs and Chief Rabbis issued statements telling ritual bath attendants only to inspect women who want inspection, putting an end to forced inspections of women at mikvehs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/174499#.UqT7w-Jo2kw|title=End to Forced Inspections for Women at Mikveh|work=Arutz Sheva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, after [[Women of the Wall]], led by [[Anat Hoffman]], had engaged in [[civil disobedience]] to exercise freedom of religion, a judge ruled that a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls at the [[Western Wall]] had been misinterpreted and that [[Women of the Wall]] prayer gatherings at the [[Western Wall]] should not be deemed illegal.&lt;ref name=civildisobedience&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/world/middleeast/israeli-law-curbing-womens-prayer-up-for-review.html |title=Israel to Review Curbs on Women's Prayer at Western Wall |first=Jodi |last=Rudoren |work=The New York Times |date=25 December 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 Women of the Wall smuggled in a Torah scroll to the Western Wall women's section and held their first Torah reading by a woman at the site, which was part of the [[bat mitzvah]] of Sasha Lutt. However, [[Shmuel Rabinowitz]], the rabbi of the Western Wall, issued a statement saying in part, "In future, efforts will be made to ensure that this does not happen again, and the introduction of Torah scrolls will be banned for everyone - men and women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shalomlife.com/news/26571/for-the-first-time-ever-women-of-the-wall-hold-torah-reading-at-the-kotel/#?1#?1#WebrootPlugIn#?1#?1#PhreshPhish#?1#?1#agtpwd |title=For the First Time Ever, Women of the Wall Hold Torah Reading at the Kotel |work=Shalom Life |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027004440/http://www.shalomlife.com/news/26571/for-the-first-time-ever-women-of-the-wall-hold-torah-reading-at-the-kotel/ |archivedate=27 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 some of the Women of the Wall became the first women to light menorahs at the Western Wall. Specifically, they lit 28 menorahs in the women's section of the Wall. [[Sarah Silverman]] was among those who attended the lighting of the menorahs. However, this event came after the rabbi in charge of the Western Wall had refused a request from Women of the Wall to place a menorah in the women's section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/18/sarah-silverman-western-wall-hanukkah_n_6351040.html|title=Comedian Sarah Silverman Supports Women Of The Wall At Hanukkah Menorah Lighting|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the first Israeli political party dedicated to ultra-Orthodox women was unveiled, called "B'Zhutan: Haredi Women Making Change."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-election-2015/.premium-1.637916|title=Israel's first ever ultra-Orthodox women's party makes bold debut|date=20 January 2015|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, [[Tzohar (organization)|Tzohar]] (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the [[Israeli Bar Association]], introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]''; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.&lt;ref name="Jta.org"/&gt;

In 2016 it was announced that the [[Supreme Court of Israel|High Court of Justice]] had given the Justice Ministry 30 days to formulate new regulations to allow women to compete equally with men for the position of director of rabbinical courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.696233|title=Israel High Court Rules to Let Women Compete With Men for Rabbinical Court Role|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, in a groundbreaking ruling, the Tel Aviv Rabbinical Court ordered a man jailed for thirty days for helping his son refuse to give his daughter-in-law a divorce for eleven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.708903|title=In Historic Ruling, Israeli Rabbinical Court Jails Father for Abetting Son's Refusal of Divorce|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2016, Karmit Feintuch became the first woman to be hired as a communal leader at an Orthodox synagogue in Israel ([[Ramban Synagogue]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julie Wiener |url=http://forward.com/sisterhood/348239/orthodox-synagogue-hires-female-spiritual-leader-in-first-for-israel/ |title=Orthodox Synagogue Hires Female Spiritual Leader in First for Israel - Sisterhood – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Israeli High Court ruled that if the government of Israel could not find "good cause" to prohibit women reading from the Torah in prayer services at the Western Wall within 30 days, women could do so; they also ruled that the Israeli government could no longer argue that the Robinson's Arch area of the plaza is "access to the Western Wall."&lt;ref name="timesofisrael1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shimoni |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-sweeping-decision-high-court-rules-for-womens-western-wall-prayer/ |title=In landmark decision, High Court rules for women's Western Wall prayer |publisher=The Times of Israel |date= |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agunah ==

[[Agunah]] ({{lang-he|עגונה}}, plural: agunot (עגונות); literally 'anchored or chained') is a [[halakha|halachic]] term for a [[Jewish]] woman who is "chained" to her [[marriage]]. The classic case of this is a man who has left on a journey and has not returned, or has gone into battle and is [[missing in action|MIA]]. It also refers to a woman whose husband refuses, or is unable, to grant her an official Jewish bill of [[divorce]], known as a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]''. The problem of get-refusal became more widespread when Jews lived in countries where civil divorce was available, separate from religious divorce.  Outside Israel, an ''agunah'' could obtain a civil divorce and remarry via [[civil marriage]], as non-Israeli legal systems generally do not recognize the ''agunah'' status, but an ''agunah'' would not typically pursue a second marriage, since her first marriage is still valid according to halakha, therefore any other sexual relationships would constitute [[adultery]] from her first husband. Furthermore, according to halakha, any children born by an agunah are considered [[mamzer]]im (bastards).

The earliest prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal was developed and accepted by the Rabbinical Council of Morocco on 16 December 1953.&lt;ref&gt;"Sefer Hatakanot", Vol. 1, The Institute for Moroccan Jewish Tradition, Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; The prenuptial agreement gained further approbation in 1981 from Rabbi Shalom Messas, chief rabbi of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;"Sefer Tevuot Shemesh", Jerusalem 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Following Rabbi Messas' involvement, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] actively pursued this issue.&lt;ref&gt;"The RCA Commission: Solving the Problem of Gittin", Hamevaser, Vol. 22 No. 2, 27 October 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The latest in a series of RCA resolutions—"that since there is a significant agunah problem in America and throughout the Jewish world, no rabbi should officiate at a wedding where a proper prenuptial agreement on get has not been executed"—was passed on 18 May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100772|title=Rabbinical Council of America (RCA)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF), an international organization of (as of 2012) 150 Modern Orthodox rabbis, passed a resolution saying that, "IRF Rabbis may not officiate at a wedding unless the couple has signed a halachic prenuptial agreement. IRF Rabbis are further encouraged to participate ritually only in weddings in which the couple has signed a halachic prenuptial agreement. Ritual participation includes but is not limited to reading the [[ketubah]], serving as a witness, and making one of the [[sheva berachot]]." This makes the IRF the only Orthodox rabbinical organization in the world to require its members to use a halachic pre-nuptial agreement in any wedding at which they officiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalrabbinicfellowship.org/news/international-rabbinic-fellowship-takes-historic-step-prevent-future-agunot|title=International Rabbinic Fellowship Takes Historic Step to Prevent Future Agunot|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, some Conservative rabbis have used the [[Lieberman clause]], named for Talmudic scholar and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS) professor [[Saul Lieberman]], in the ''[[ketuba]]'', requiring that a get be granted if a civil divorce is ever issued.  Most Orthodox rabbis have rejected the Lieberman clause, although leaders of the Conservative movement claim that the original intent was to find a solution that could be used by Orthodox and Conservative rabbis alike, and that leaders of Orthodox Judaism's [[Rabbinical Council of America]], and respected Orthodox rabbis, including [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], supposedly recognized the clause as valid. Later, because some civil courts viewed the enforcement of a religious document as a violation of the [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] principle of the [[separation of church and state]],  Conservative rabbis began to require couples to sign a separate letter, stating that the clause had been explained to them as part of pre-marital counseling, and that both parties understood and agreed to its conditions, recognizing that this letter would constitute a separate civil document, enforceable in a civilian court. However, many Conservative rabbis, including some on the movement's own [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|law committee]], had growing misgivings about the clause for religious reasons.

In 1968, by a unanimous vote of the law committee, it was decided that the Joint Bet Din of the Conservative movement could annul marriages as a last resort, based on the Talmudic principle of ''hafka'at kiddushin.'' According to Rabbi Mayer Rabinowitz, the Chairman of the Joint Bet Din of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Movement]], just the threat of this action was sometimes enough to compel the former husband to grant a get.

In 1990 Agunah Day was established by ICAR - The International Coalition for Agunah Rights - to raise public awareness of the plight of the Agunah and galvanize action to solve the problem. It is observed on the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]] date of the [[Fast of Esther]].

In 1995 the Israeli parliament gave the rabbinical court expanded legal power to sanction men who refuse to give their wives a ''get'' by suspending their driver's licenses, seizing their bank accounts, preventing travel abroad and even imprisoning those who do not comply with an order to grant a divorce; however, women's groups say the 1995 law is not very effective because the court uses sanctions in less than 2% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/middleeast/la-fg-israel-divorce-problems-20130726,0,4730957.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Edmund | last=Sanders | title=Israel divorce law traps women in marriages that died long ago | date=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Justice Menachem HaCohen of the [[Jerusalem]] Family Court offered new hope to ''agunot'' when he ruled that a man refusing his wife a ''get'' must pay her NIS 425,000 in punitive damages, because "[R]efusal to grant a ''get'' constitutes a severe infringement on her ability to lead a reasonable, normal life, and can be considered emotional abuse lasting several years." He noted that "[T]his is not another sanction against someone refusing to give a ''get'', intended to speed up the process of granting a ''get'', and this court is not involving itself in any future arrangements for the granting of a ''get'', but rather, it is a direct response to the consequences that stem from not granting a ''get'', and the right of the woman to receive punitive damages." This ruling stemmed from the Public Litigation Project initiated by the advocacy organization [[Center for Women's Justice Israel|Center for Women's Justice]] as one of a number of successful lawsuits filed in Israeli civil courts claiming financial damages against recalcitrant husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weiss|first=Susan|title=The Tort of Get Refusal: Why Tort and Why Not?|journal=Conversations|series=Orthodoxy: Family &amp; Gender Issues|issue=5|url=http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/tort-get-refusal-why-tort-and-why-not|accessdate=19 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110703092706/http://www.jewishideas.org/articles/tort-get-refusal-why-tort-and-why-not| archivedate= 3 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the Rabbinate of [[Uruguay]] instituted the requirement for all Jewish couples that marry under its auspices to sign a Rabbinic Pre-nuptial Agreement. The agreement states that in the case of the couple divorcing civilly, the husband is obligated to immediately deliver to his wife a ''get''. The initiative was launched by [[Sara Winkowski]], a director of the Kehila, the Comunidad Israelita del Uruguay (Jewish Community of Uruguay), who is also a Vice President of the World Jewish Congress and longtime activist for the rights of women within Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vosizneias.com/153024/2014/01/23/montevideo-uruguay-chief-rabbi-institutes-rabbinic-pre-nuptial-agreement/|title=Montevideo - Uruguay Chief Rabbi Institutes Rabbinic Pre-Nuptial Agreement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Tzohar (organization)|Tzohar]] (a religious Zionist rabbinic organization in Israel), along with the [[Israel Bar Association]], introduced a prenuptial agreement meant to help ensure divorcing wives will receive a ''get''; under the agreement the husband commits to paying a high sum of money daily to his spouse in the event of a separation.&lt;ref name="Jta.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2015/03/03/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/new-prenup-aims-to-prevent-agunot |title=Israeli rabbinic, legal groups partner for prenup in bid to prevent agunot &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the [[Knesset]] passed a law, slated to remain in effect for three years, allowing Israel’s rabbinical courts to handle certain cases of Jewish women wishing to divorce their Jewish husbands, even if neither the wife nor the husband is an Israeli citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-gives-rabbinical-courts-unprecedented-control-over-diaspora-jew-1.6216340 |title=Israel gives rabbinical courts unprecedented jurisdiction over Diaspora Jews - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaissar Saady al-Juboory''' is a soldier in the [[Iraqi Army]] under investigation in an incident where he shot five and killed two of his [[U.S. military]] colleagues during a routine military patrol in [[Mosul]]. The [[Association of Muslim Scholars]], a [[Sunni Muslim]] group which currently forms part of the [[Iraqi parliament]]'s opposition, have released reports that al-Juboory shot his U.S. colleagues in response to civilian abuse. The report claims that his American counterparts were pulling the hair of women and physically assaulting one pregnant woman. Regarding the incident, one army officer speaking on condition of anonymity described Kaissar's act as heroic. "Those Americans learned their lesson once more." he stated.

Al-Juboory was apprehended after the incident and is currently in prison awaiting trial in an Iraqi court on charges of homicide and treason. The families of the American soldiers are being kept informed of the status of the investigation and the trial by the U.S. Army.

The two U.S. soldiers killed were Capt. Rowdy Inman and Sgt. Benjamin Portell.

Al-Juboory was recently convicted in the deaths of Capt. Inman and Sgt. Portell, in a trial heavily attended by Americans.  He was sentenced to life in prison.

'''Kyunglung''', sometimes also spelled as '''Khyunglung''', '''Qulong''' or '''Qulongcun''', is a village in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]]. Kyunglung Ngüka ({{Bo|t=ཁྱུང་ལུང་དངུལ་མཁར།|w=khyung lung dngul mkha}}, {{zh|s=曲龙村}}) "Silver Palace of [[Garuda]] Valley", located southwest of [[Mount Kailash]] ({{bo|w=gangs ti se}}), identified with palaces found in the upper [[Sutlej]] Valley, was the capital city of the ancient kingdom of [[Zhangzhung]]. Many Tibetologists and theorists suggest that Kyunglung was perhaps what the Zhangzhung people called [[Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Allen (writer)|Allen, Charles]]. (1999). ''The Search for Shangri-La: A Journey into Tibetan History''. Abacus Edition, London. (2000), pp. 266-267; 273-274. {{ISBN|0-349-11142-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Zhangzhung ruins==

Khyunglung is an amazing complex of caves set in the hills on the north bank of the [[Sutlej River]] about 30&amp;nbsp;km west of the hotsprings and [[gompa]] of [[Tirthapuri]] and the nearby coal mining town of [[Moincer]]/Montser in the modern Chinese prefecture of Ali/[[Ngari]] in the [[Tibet]] Autonomous Region (see Gyurme Dorje, Tibet 3rd ed.). There are further ancient ruins on the hilltops above the [[Bon]] monastery of Gurugem/Gurugyam which are only 6&amp;nbsp;km from Tirthapuri. There is very little published about these sites and virtually no archaeological investigations have been carried out.

The caves of Khyunglung are generally small (about 4 square metres)  and have a small raised fireplace at the far end. However, almost without exception, they have no chimney and the blackened ceilings make it clear that the smoke exited the cave through the only entrance, making them thick with smoke when the fire was in use. Many of the cave are filled with ancient artifacts dating back to the time of the [[Zhangzhung]]. These artifacts include small stones inscribed with ancient Tibetan script, stone statues of [[Bon]] deities, and various vases and pots. There is also no obvious recess for a bed or other storage. It seems that these fires were used for sacrificial offerings and some are still in use today as the scattering of bones, feathers etc. make clear.

There are no visible springs on site, no water channels or wells and it is therefore probable that water from the river was used. However the caves are downstream of a large sulfurous hotspring and the water in the Sutlej at this point is barely potable (John Snelling, The Sacred Mountain). In addition the immediate vicinity of the caves show no signs of agriculture - there are no terraces for fields and the grazing land is very poor. All in all this seems a very strange site for a permanently occupied city.

It has been suggested that Kyunglung was never a ''city'' as such, but more of a "convention centre for Bonpo magicians" and that the caves were used for ceremonial purposes during times when the clans gathered.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Michael. (2003) ''Tibet (Bradt Travel Guide)''. Second edition. (2006), p. 227. {{ISBN|978-1-84162-164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible camping grounds for the main retinue would be around the modern village of Khyunglung a few kilometres upstream where the valley is somewhat broader or the area between Gurugem and Tirthapuri which is still heavily used by yak and sheep herding nomads today. The ruins above Gurugem appear to be a more likely site for permanent habitation but much more study would be needed to establish this.

==The modern village==

The modern village of Kyunglung lies just upstream from its ancient namesake. It is a tiny community of small households, and the people live and depend heavily on yaks for agriculture and transport. The village itself is very old, and the villagers maintain a way of life that has changed very little in the last hundred years or more. The villagers at Kyunglung follow the ancient religion of [[Bon]], the same religion as their Zhangzhung ancestors.

B. Tauris|location=London|isbn=1-84511-062-5|page=92.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and specifically, Zoroastrian priests). It was a technical term, meaning [[magi|magus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|article=Majūs|editor=[[Steingass, Francis Joseph]]|encyclopedia=A Comprehensive Persian-English dictionary, including the Arabic words and phrases to be met with in Persian literature|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; K.

In the 1980s, ''majus'' was part of Iraqi propaganda vocabulary of the [[Iran–Iraq War]] to refer to Iranians in general. "By referring to the Iranians in these documents as ''majus'', the security apparatus [implied] that the Iranians [were] not sincere Muslims, but rather covertly practice their pre-Islamic beliefs. Thus, in their eyes, Iraq’s war took on the dimensions of not only a struggle for Arab nationalism, but also a campaign in the name of Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=The Mindset of Iraq’s Security Apparatus|author=Al-Marashi, Ibrahim|date=2000|page=5|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02684520412331306900#preview|
publisher=Cambridge University: Centre of International Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''majus'' is distinct from Arabic ''[[kafir]]'' "unbeliever". Persian ''gabr'' is no longer synonymous with ''majus''.&lt;ref name="Gabr" /&gt; Subsequent usage by [[takfiri]]s against [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] has meant that some people view the term as [[Shiaphobic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rumi|first1=Raza|title=The Prospects for Reform in Islam|journal=Current Trends in Islamist Ideology|date=May 2015|volume=18|page=85-103|url=https://www.hudson.org/research/11172-the-prospects-for-reform-in-islam|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mama Tata''' or '''Mama Chi''' (Mother Father) is a [[Christian]] [[syncretism|syncretistic]] religion found in parts of [[Panama]]. It is a mixture of [[Catholicism]] and [[animism]] that has become popular among the [[Guaymí]] people. It began in the second half of the twentieth century, after prophetess Little Mama had a vision of [[Jesus]] riding up to her on a motorcycle.

==Beliefs==
Members of Mama Tata believe that [[God]] has abolished the Church and is now relating exclusively with the Guaymí through Little Mama who had a vision of Mary (Big Mama) and Jesus. Adherents believe that only Guaymí followers of this religion will go to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbmedia.org/Prayer/Panama_Guaymi.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' Mamluk dynasty of Iraq''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|مماليك العراق}} ''{{transl|ar|Mamālīk al-ʻIrāq}}'') was a dynasty which ruled over [[history of Iraq|Iraq]] in the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq, Tareq Y. Ismael, I. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Military History of Modern Egypt: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Ramadan War, Andrew James McGregor, p57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]],  [[Mamluks]] were  freed slaves  who converted to [[Islam]], were trained in a special school, and then assigned to military and administrative duties.  Such Mamluks presided over  [[Ottoman Iraq]]  from 1704 to 1831.

The Mamluk ruling elite, composed principally of [[Georgian people|Georgian]] officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hathaway|first1=Jane|last2=Barbir|first2=Karl|title=The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule: 1516-1800|year=2008|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|page=96|isbn=9780582418998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hathaway|first=Jane|title=The Military Household in Ottoman Egypt|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|date=February 1995|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39–52|doi=10.1017/s0020743800061572}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded in asserting autonomy from their  Ottoman overlords, and restored order and some degree of economic prosperity in the region. 
The Ottomans overthrew the Mamluk regime in 1831 and gradually imposed their direct rule over Iraq, which would last until [[World War I]], although the  Mamluks continued to be a dominant socio-political force in Iraq, as most of the administrative personnel of note in [[Baghdad]] were drawn from former Mamluk households, or comprised a cross-section of the notable class in Mamluk times.&lt;ref name=HMF/&gt;

==Background==
The early 18th century was a time of important changes both in [[Constantinople]] and in [[Baghdad]]. The reign of [[Ahmed III|Sultan Ahmed III]] (1703–30) was marked by relative political stability in the capital and by extensive reforms—some of them influenced by European models—implemented during the [[Tulip period|Tulip Period]] by [[Grand Vizier]] [[Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha|İbrahim Pasha]].

As in the previous two centuries, Iraq continued to be a battleground between the rival [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Empire]]. The region also suffered from frequent inter-clan struggles.&lt;ref name="Litvak"&gt;Litvak, Meir (2002), ''Shi'i Scholars of Nineteenth-Century Iraq: The 'Ulama' of Najaf and Karbala'', pp. 16-17.

===Hasan Pasha (1704–1723)===
In Baghdad, [[Hasan Pasha (Mamluk)|Hasan Pasha]] ({{lang-ka|ჰასან ფაშა}}), the Ottoman governor of [[Georgian people|Georgian]] origin sent from Constantinople, and his son [[Ahmad Pasha of Baghdad|Ahmad Pasha]] (1723–47) established a Georgian Mamluk household, through which they exercised authority and administered the province.

===Ahmad Pasha (1723–1747)===
Hasan's son and successor, [[Ahmad Pasha of Baghdad|Ahmad]] ({{lang-ka|აჰმედ ფაშა}}), continued to recruit the Mamluks and promoted them to key administrative and military positions. Both Hasan and Ahmad rendered a valuable service to the [[Ottoman Porte]] by curbing the unruly tribes and securing a steady inflow of taxes to the treasury in Constantinople as well as by defending Iraq against yet another military threat from the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] of Iran.

By the time Ahmad Pasha died in 1747, his Mamluks had been organized into a powerful, self-perpetuating elite corps of some 2,000 men ("Georgian Guard"). On Ahmad's death, the sultan attempted to prevent these Mamluks from assuming power and sent an outsider as his [[wali]] in Baghdad. However, Ahmad’s son-in-law Sulayman Abu Layla, already in charge of [[Basra]], marched on Baghdad in the head of his Georgian guard and ousted the Ottoman administrator, thereby inaugurating 84 years of the Mamluk rule in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Kissling"&gt;Kissling, H.J. (1969), ''The Last Great Muslim Empires'', pp. 82-85. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-02104-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulayman Abu Layla Pasha (1749–1762)===
By 1750, [[Sulayman Abu Layla Pasha|Sulayman Abu Layla]] ({{lang-ka|სულეიმან აბუ ლაილი}}) had established himself as an undisputed master at Baghdad and had been recognized by the Porte as the first Mamluk Pasha of Iraq. The newly established regime embarked on a campaign to gain more autonomy from the Ottoman government and to curb the resistance of the [[Iraqi Arabs|Arab]] and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribes. They managed to counter [[Al-Muntafiq]] threats in the south and brought Basra under their control. They encouraged [[Europe]]an trade and allowed the [[British East India Company]] to establish an agency in Basra in 1763.

===Omar Pasha (1762–1776)===
The successes of Mamluk regime, however, still depended on their ability to cooperate with their Ottoman suzerains and religious elite within Iraq. The Porte sometimes employed force to depose the recalcitrant pashas of Baghdad, but the Mamluks were able to retain their hold of the pashalik, and even enlarged their domains. They failed, however, to secure a regular system of succession and the gradual formation of rival Mamluk households resulted in factionalism and frequent power struggles. Another major menace to the Mamluk rule came from Iran whose resurgent ruler, [[Karim Khan]], invaded Iraq and installed his brother Sadiq Khan in Basra in 1776 after a protracted and stubborn resistance offered by the Mamluk general Sulayman Aga. The Porte hastened to exploit the crisis and replaced [[Omar Pasha of Baghdad|Omar Pasha]] ({{lang-ka|ომარ ფაშა}}) with a non-Mamluk, who proved incapable of keeping order.&lt;ref name="Kissling"/&gt;

===Sulayman Pasha the Great (1780–1802)===
[[File:Mamluke.jpg|thumb|250px|An Ottoman Mamluk cavalryman, as drawn by [[Carle Vernet]] in 1810.]]
In 1779, [[Sulayman Pasha the Great|Sulayman the Great]] ({{lang-ka|სულეიმან ბუიუქი}}) returned from his exile in [[Shiraz]] and acquired the governorship of [[Baghdad Eyalet|Baghdad]], [[Basra Eyalet|Basrah]], and [[Shahrizor Eyalet|Shahrizor]] in 1780.&lt;ref name="EB-1"&gt;"Iraq". (2007). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved October 15, 2007, from [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-22896 Encyclopædia Britannica Online].&lt;/ref&gt; This Sulayman Pasha is known as ''Büyük'' ("the Great" in Turkish), and his rule (1780-1802) was efficient at first, but weakened as he grew older. He imported large numbers of Georgians to strengthen his clan, asserted his supremacy over the factionalized Mamluk households and restricted the influence of [[Janissaries]]. He fostered economy and continued to encourage commerce and diplomacy with Europe, which received a major boost in 1798 when Sulayman gave permission for a permanent British agent to be appointed in Baghdad.&lt;ref name="EB-2"&gt;"Iraq". (2007). In ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved October 15, 2007, from [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-22897 Encyclopædia Britannica Online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, his struggle against the Arab tribes in Northern Iraq was less despite the fact that he brutally crushed the revolters.&lt;ref name="EB-1"/&gt;

The [[Kurds in Iraq|Kurdish Iraqi]] city of [[Sulaymaniyah]] was founded during the time of  Sulayman Pasha  and is named after him.

===Ali Pasha (1802–1807)===
Sulayman Pasha the Great was succeeded after a power struggle in 1802 by Ali Pasha ({{lang-ka|ალი ფაშა}}), who repelled the Wahhabi raids against [[Najaf]] and [[Hillah]] in 1803 and 1806 but failed to challenge their domination of the [[Syrian Desert|desert]].

===Sulayman Pasha the Little (1807–1813)===
After Ali’s assassination in 1807, his nephew [[Sulayman Pasha the Little]] took over the government. Inclined to curtail provincial autonomies, Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (1808–39) made his first attempt to oust the Mamluks from Baghdad in 1810. Ottoman troops deposed and killed Sulayman, but again failed to maintain control of the country. After yet another bitter internecine feud in 1816, Sulayman’s energetic son-in-law [[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad|Dawud Pasha]] ousted his rival [[Said Pasha of Baghdad|Said Pasha]] ({{lang-ka|საიდ ფაშა}}; 1813–16) and took control of Baghdad. The Ottoman government reluctantly recognized his authority.&lt;ref name="Kissling"/&gt;

===Dawud Pasha (1816–1831)===
{{Main article|Dawud Pasha of Baghdad}}
[[Dawud Pasha of Baghdad|Dawud Pasha]] ({{lang-ka|დაუდ ფაშა}}) was the last of the Mamluk rulers of Iraq. Dawud Pasha initiated important modernization programs that included clearing canals, establishing industries, reforming the army with the help of European instructors, and founding a printing press. He maintained elaborate pomp and circumstance at his court. Besides the usual troubles with the Arab tribes and internal dissensions with [[sheikh]]s, he was involved in more serious fighting with the Kurds and the conflict with Iran over the influence in the Kurdish principality of [[Baban]]. The conflict culminated in the Iranian invasion of Iraq and the occupation of [[Sulaymaniyah]] in 1818. Later, Dawud Pasha capitalized on the destruction of Janissaries at Constantinople in 1826, and eliminated the Janissaries as an independent local force.&lt;ref name="Kissling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EB-2"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the existence of the autonomous regime in Iraq, a long-time source of anxiety at Constantinople, became even more threatening to the Porte when [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] of [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]] began to claim [[Ottoman Syria]]. In 1830, the Sultan decreed Dawud Pasha’s dismissal, but the emissary carrying the order was arrested at Baghdad and executed. In 1831, the Ottoman army under [[Ali Rıza Pasha (governor of Baghdad)|Ali Ridha Pasha]] marched from [[Aleppo]] into Iraq. Devastated by floods and an epidemic of [[bubonic plague]], Baghdad capitulated after a ten-week-long blockade which caused mass-famine. Dawud Pasha, facing opposition from local clergymen within Iraq, surrendered to the Ottomans and was treated with favor. His life ended in 1851, while he was custodian of the shrine at [[Medina]].&lt;ref name="Kissling"/&gt; The arrival of the Sultan’s new governor in Baghdad in 1831 signaled the beginning of a direct Ottoman rule in Iraq.&lt;ref name="EB-2"/&gt;

The new Ottoman governor, Ali Ridha Pasha, was forced to come to terms with the still-pervasive Mamluk presence in Baghdad even after the last Mamluk pasha had been deposed.&lt;ref name=HMF&gt;{{cite book|last=Fattah|first=Hala Mundhir|title=The Politics of Regional Trade in Iraq, Arabia, and the Gulf: 1745-1900|year=1997|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|isbn=9781438402376|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later married the daughter of former Mamluk governor [[Sulayman Pasha the Little]] (1807–1813).&lt;ref name=HMF/&gt;

[[file:Монгуш Борахович Кенин-Лопсан.jpg|thumb|Mongush Kenin-Lopsan, 2010]]
'''Mongush Borakhovitch Kenin-Lopsan''' (in Russian Монгуш Борахович Кенин-Лопсан, scientific transliteration Monguš Borakhovič Kenin-Lopsan) born April 10, 1925 at Chash-Tal, [[Tuva]], Chöön-Khemtchik district out of family of Bora-Khöö. Kenin-Lopsan is a writer, poet, historian, archaeologist and famous [[shamanism]] researcher living in [[Kyzyl]],&lt;ref name="Balzer1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Balzer|first=Marjorie M.|title=Culture incarnate: native anthropology from Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6iqnD-NX5EC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=1 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=9781563245350|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of Tuva, Russian Federation.

His grandparents/parents were [[nomads]], cattle breeders, herders, blacksmiths as well as storytellers and shamans. Kenin-Lopsan was educated at ground school in [[Chadan (town)|Chadan]], later on colleges in Kyzyl. He studied philology at [[Saint Petersburg University|Leningrad (today St. Petersburg) University]] and received a Master's degree in 'Eastern Sciences'. Being  back in Tuva he served as a teacher of Tuvinian as well as of Russian language and literature and as an editor for a publishing company in Tuva.

Among his first books was ''The Big Way'' (1956) as well as other novels like ''The Currents of the  Big River'' (1965), ''Dance of Capricorn'' and ''The Yurt of the Horse Herder''. He won several Russian and Tuvan prizes. His whole life he collected stories from his kinsmen, storytellers, shamans, workers, herders and poets. For his research on shamanism he was persecuted during [[Sovjet]] times; his grandmother shamaness Kuular Khandyshap died after being imprisoned in a [[Gulag]] for 15 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6383">'''Nanua Bairagi''', (~17th–18th century) also known as '''Nanua Bhagat''' and '''Jamala Singh''',  was a renowned mystic, humanitarian and Sikh warrior of Punjab.&lt;ref name = "Nanua hymn"&gt;''Nanua Bhagat is a renowned ascetic and mystic and a Punjabi poet of the classical school'', Rose-garden of the Punjab: English renderings from Punjabi folk poetry, p. 106 ,Gurbachan Singh Talib, Compiled by Kamal Krishan Mukerji, Published by Punjabi University, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He belonged to [[Saini]] community of Punjab.&lt;ref name = "Jamala Singh Nanua"/&gt;{{dubious|reason=sources such as this - caste histories etc written by caste members - are unreliable|date=January 2017}}

==Nanua as a humanitarian and spiritual mentor of Bhai Kanhaiya==
Nanua was also the spiritual mentor of [[Bhai Kanhaiya]],&lt;ref&gt;'' "Bhai Kanhaiya would have hardly stepped in his teens that he, fortuitously, came across saint Nanua, an eminent gnostic and a heavenly-minded man. His company and precepts had lasting effect on his delicate mind."''  Bhai Kanhaiya, Beacon-light of Humanitarian Service &amp; the Apostle of Peace, Chapter 6- A Contact with Bhakt Nanua, p. 19, Bhagata Singha Hīrā, Published by Sewa Jyoti Publications, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' "Bhai Kanhaiya passed his early days in his company. He listened to his sermons with keen interest, enjoyed his charming communions with eagerness and moulded his character accordingly. His devotion to Nanua advanced every day. As a true devotee he adopted his every advice."''  Bhai Kanhaiya, Beacon-light of Humanitarian Service &amp; the Apostle of Peace, Chapter 6- A Contact with Bhakt Nanua, p. 22, Bhagata Singha Hīrā, Published by Sewa Jyoti Publications, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn started "Seva Panthi" mission .

==Nanua as a poet-mystic==
As a Darbari Kavi, or court poet, of Sikh gurus,  his poetry left an imprint on the poetry style of  Bulhe Shah. One of his famous hymns is given as follows:&lt;ref name = "Nanua hymn"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am Naught, O Lord, Thou art All! &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen all cloth, each shred,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To find all textures the self-same cotton.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rama's light of love falls over all:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fear not then dreadful Kala.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rama runs through every nerve,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;And ''Sohang, Sohang'' cry the pores!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am naught, O Lord, Thou art All!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Sohang'' is apabransha of Upnishadic ''[[Soham (Sanskrit)]]'' which means "I am He". This is also termed as [[mahavakya]] in [[Upnishad]]s and represents final union or gnosis of soul with ''Brahman'', or the [[over-soul]].&lt;ref name = "Nanua hymn"/&gt;

It is thus clear that Nanua's poetry synthesized both Vedantic and Sufi monisms into distinctly Sikh devotional practice, informed by direct discipleship and service of Sikh masters.  Which speaks volumes about his stature as a poet and his place among the preeminent Sikh mystics whose place in Sikhism is second only to ten Sikh Gurus.

==Nanua as a close associate of Sikh gurus==
Bhagat Nanua was a reputed [[Saini]] of the 17th century and [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] is said to have had a great regard for him.&lt;ref&gt;''"The close intimates of the Guru took their courage to ask him," Reverend Satguru! You always appreciate Nanua in all respects and seem to be much pleased with him. Then why don't you appoint him a missionary (Masand) in any of your domains or absorb him in your administrative staff? The Guru's simple reply was ,"You don't know his worth, he is above all these posts."'' Bhai Kanhaiya, Beacon-light of Humanitarian Service &amp; the Apostle of Peace, Chapter 6- A Contact with Bhakt Nanua, p. 20, Bhagata Singha Hīrā, Published by Sewa Jyoti Publications, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his life he rendered his valuable services to Sikh Guru. He enjoyed the privilege of having close relationships with 8th, 9th &amp; 10th Sikh Gurus.&lt;ref&gt;''"He became a close associate of the Guru and often the Guru invited him for a game of dice. Both Guru and Nanua had mutual liking for each other. They met daily for a game and then departed. The Guru appreciated him in all respects but remarked nothing more but bravo O 'Nanua' bravo, he applauded"'' Bhai Kanhaiya, Beacon-light of Humanitarian Service &amp; the Apostle of Peace, Chapter 6- A Contact with Bhakt Nanua, p. 19, Bhagata Singha Hīrā, Published by Sewa Jyoti Publications, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of 8th Guru's death in Delhi, he arranged the cremation &amp; later carried Guru ji's bone urn to Kiratpur Sahib.  From there, along with Guru's family members he reached Baba Bakala as indicated by the 8th guru. After the cremation ceremony of 9th guru, he remained in the company of his master on various teaching missions. At the time of the last voyage of Guru Tegh Bahadur ji to Delhi, he accompanied the convoy. After the martyrdom of the Guru &amp; Sikhs, he arranged their cremation. He along with Bhai Jaita and Bhai Uda had found and carried Guru Tegh Bahadur's severed head to Anandpur Sahib.&lt;ref name = "Jamala Singh Nanua"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Panjab Past and Present, p. 118,  By Punjabi University Dept. of Punjab Historical Studies, Published by Dept. of Punjab Historical Studies, Punjabi University., 1975, Original from the University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanua as a baptized Sikh, warrior and martyr==
As a baptised Sikh of 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, he was named '''Jamala Singh Nanuan'''. As a great warrior, his service was equal to his contemporaries, [[Bhai Bachittar Singh]] [[Minhas]], Bhai Jaita and Bhai [[Sangat Singh Minhas]], [[Mai Bhago]].

He sacrificed his life in the [[Battle of Chamkaur]] Sahib. His son, Darbar Singh laid down his life in the battle of Agampur and another son Gharbara Singh was killed in the battle of [[Muktsar]]. His great grandson Kavi Jai Singh Saini had the privilege of being 'Darbari Kavi' at the court of Maharaja Karam Singh of Patiala.&lt;ref name = "Jamala Singh Nanua"&gt;Saini jagata utapati ate wikasa / Surajita Singha Nanua, Patiala : Manajota Prakashana,

'''Powwow''', also called '''''brauche''''' or '''''braucherei''''' in [[Deitsch]], is a vernacular system of North American [[traditional medicine]] and folk magic originating in the  culture of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. Blending aspects of folk religion with healing charms, "powwowing" includes a wide range of healing rituals used primarily for treating ailments in humans and livestock, as well as securing physical and spiritual protection, and good luck in everyday affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://glencairnmuseum.org/newsletter/2017/3/2/powwowing-in-pennsylvania|title=Powwowing in Pennsylvania: Healing Rituals of the Dutch Country|last=Donmoyer|first=Patrick|date=2017|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeIV/Powwow.htm|title=Powwowing: A Persistent American Esoteric Tradition|last=Kriebel|first=David|date=2002|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the word "powwow" is Native American, these ritual traditions are of European origin and were brought to colonial Pennsylvania in the transatlantic migrations of German-speaking people from Central Europe in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. A practitioner is sometimes referred to as a "powwower" or ''braucher'', but terminology varies by region. The folk traditions continues in the present day in both rural and urban settings, and has spread across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aYBcX3a1F0wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hohman &amp; Romanus: Origins and Diffusion of the Pennsylvania German Powwow Manual|last=Yoder|first=Don|date=1976|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and practices==
Early colonial Pennsylvania was a melting pot of various European religious influences, as William Penn's promise of religious tolerance opened the doors for many Christian sects: the [[Anabaptists]], [[Quakers]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Evangelical and Reformed Church|German Reformed]], [[Catholicism|Catholics]], and all manner of religious mystics and free-thinkers. It is from this blending that the Pennsylvania German powwow tradition was born.&lt;ref&gt;http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=1-9-5&amp;chapter=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of the Pennsylvania Dutch were [[Protestantism|Protestant]], their folk religious culture was deeply rooted in practices of the pre-Reformation era, such as the veneration of the saints, the use of folk adaptations of liturgical blessings for everyday purposes, and the use of sacred objects and inscriptions for healing and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9dsZGAFwSwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Saint's Legend in the Pennsylvania German Folk-Culture|last=Yoder|first=Don|date=1971|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were brought to North America, and formed the basis of both oral and literary ritual traditions in Pennsylvania.  

The majority of the early ritual traditions of the Pennsylvania Dutch were rooted in German language, but the term "Powwow" became widely used by speakers of English by the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://glencairnmuseum.org/newsletter/2017/3/2/powwowing-in-pennsylvania|title=Powwowing in Pennsylvania: Healing Rituals of the Dutch Country|last=Donmoyer|first=Patrick|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Powwaw" (in one of its early spellings) was appropriated from the Algonquian language by 17th century missionaries in New England, where it originally described a healer, derived from a verb implying trance, or dreaming for divination or healing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=powwow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Powwow: Online Etymological Dictionary|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests that the term was applied to the Pennsylvania Dutch out of a perceived similarity in ritual healing, consistent with its borrowed meaning in English for "conjuration performed for the cure of diseases and other purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Dictionary of the English Language.|last=Webster|first=Noah|publisher=George &amp; Charles Meriam|year=1861|isbn=|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, at the turn of the 20th century, the term "powwow" became associated with the title of the English edition of a celebrated manual of ritual procedures, entitled ''[[Pow-Wows; or, Long Lost Friend]]'', written by [[John George Hohman]] and first published in [[German (language)|German]] as ''Der Lange Verborgene Freund'' (literally "The Long Hidden Friend") in Reading, Pennsylvania in 1820.  

The tradition is also called ''braucherei,'' or simply ''brauche,'' in [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]; an adept is referred to as a "powwower" or ''braucher'', though not all practitioners use the same terminology. The verb ''brauche'' means "to use, to employ, to make use of, to need," while ''braucherei'' implies a collection of traditional ways, related to "''breiche'' - of customs, traditions, rituals, ceremonies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Comprehensive Pennsylvania German Dictionary. Vols 1-12.|last=Beam|first=Richard|publisher=Center for Pennsylvania German Studies|year=2004–2006|isbn=|location=Millersville, Pennsylvania|pages=2(145–146), 4(17–18).}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Powwow literature ==
The [[Bible]] is considered the most important book of the powwow, and no practitioner would work without his Bible on hand.  In addition, several popular [[grimoire]]s are also utilized, primarily the ''Romanus-Buchlein''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esotericarchives.com/moses/romanus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Egyptian Secrets of [[Albertus Magnus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esotericarchives.com/moses/egyptian.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Important to some practitioners was the work ''The [[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'', a magical text attributed to [[Moses]] and claimed as an esoteric sequel to the Biblical Five Books of Moses, or [[Pentateuch]]. Various versions of the work can be traced to 18th and 19th century German sources, while an English translation was published in New York in 1880 by the German antiquarian, [[Johann Scheible]]. However, the majority of practitioners were superstitiously fearful of this work and believed it invoked all manner of evil and devilry, as explained in ''The Red Church'' by author and ''braucher'' Christopher Bilardi.&lt;ref&gt;http://esotericbookreview.wordpress.com/2010/10/01/the-red-church-by-bilardi/&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from ''The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses'', which many powwowers find as justification for the Christian practice of powwowing, reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One thing must not be omitted, in conclusion, and that is, we must first become Christians before we can perform cures by Christian methods.  Very few are really Christians who call themselves such; they are only Christians in name and appearance.  The art of healing, according to scriptural principles, deserves special mention in this place, in more than one respect, not only because something truly magical takes place therein, but because scriptural healing is often regarded as the only true one.  The principles of this art of healing have been fully established according to certain declarations and doctrines of the Bible.{{cn|date=September 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origins of a majority of the charms and spells utilized by the powwow are generally agreed upon to be remnants of Medieval Catholic charms against illness and witchery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/533169| jstor = 533169| title = The Long Hidden Friend| journal = The Journal of American Folklore| volume = 17| issue = 65| pages = 89| year = 1904| last1 = Brown | first1 = C. F. | last2 = Hohman | first2 = J. G. | last3 = Hohman | first3 = J. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/jms/jms10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It is primarily understood by practitioners of the Powwow tradition that Powwow is an Americanized version of English [[Cunning folk in Britain|Cunning Craft]]:

{{quote|The Pow-Wow practitioner is more closely allied with theology than medicine and feels he is a mediator between the patient and God. Among the Pennsylvania Germans, the 'plain folk', such as the [[Amish]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|Dunkers]], and the [[Mennonites]], as well as among the Lutheran and German Reformed church members - Pow-Wow and the Pow-Wow doctor has a significant following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkshistory.org/articles/pow-wow.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120132032/http://www.berkshistory.org/articles/pow-wow.html |archivedate=2011-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another characteristic practice of powwow magic is the [[Himmelsbrief]] or "heaven's letter".  Significantly, the ''Long Lost Friend'' assures its owner that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever carries this book with him, is safe from all his enemies, visible or invisible; and whoever has this book with him cannot die without the holy corpse of Jesus Christ, nor drowned in any water, nor burn up in any fire, nor can any unjust sentence be passed upon him.  So help me.{{cn|date=September 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quotations==

===A Sure Means to Staunch Blood===
{{unsourced section|date=September 2017}}

It is helpful, though the person is far absent, if the one who uses this means for him, pronounces his name aright.

Jesus Christ, Precious blood!
Which soothes the pains and stops the blood.
Help thee (name) God the Father,
God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.  Amen

===Cure For The Headache===

:Tame thou flesh and bone, like Christ in Paradise; and you who will assist thee, this I tell thee (''name'') for your repentance sake.  + + +  This you must say three times, each time lasting for three minutes, and your headache will soon cease.  But if your headache is caused by strong drink, or otherwise will not leave you soon, then you must repeat these words every minute.  This, however, is not necessary in regard to headache.

===To Remove Bruises and Pains===

:Bruise, thou shalt not heat
:Bruise, thou shalt not sweat;
:Bruise, thou shalt not run,
:No more than Virgin Mary shall bring forth another son. + + +

===To Pull the Heat from Burns===
:Two angels came down from the north;
:one named Fire, the other Frost;
:Frost said to Fire go away, go away;
:in the name of Jesus go away.


== In popular culture ==
The tradition of [[hex sign]]s painted on [[Pennsylvania]] [[barn (building)|barn]]s in some areas is believed by some to relate to this tradition; the paintings consisted of geometric star patterns thought to have [[Amulet|talisman]]ic properties, though many hex signs are made simply for decoration.  Many scholars disagree with this claim, however, and generally the hex signs are believed to be the natural progression of German [[Fraktur (folk art)|fraktur art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://libwww.freelibrary.org/fraktur/guide.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1988 film, ''[[Apprentice to Murder]]'', stars [[Donald Sutherland]] as "powwow" doctor John Reese, and [[Chad Lowe]] as his young apprentice Billy Kelly. Reese practices the folk magic rituals in a small Pennsylvania town whose residents believe they have fallen under a curse. The film makes use of ''Pow Wows or the Long Lost Friend'' cited above.

{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
The term '''Prince of the Church''' is today used nearly exclusively for [[Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinals]]. However, the term is historically more important as a generic term for clergymen whose offices hold the secular rank and privilege of a [[prince]] (in the widest sense) or are considered its equivalent. In the case of cardinals, they are always treated in protocol of Catholic countries as equivalents of royal princes.

Informally, other members of the higher echelons of the Church are in recent times also occasionally called "Princes of the Church", in which case this title can sometimes be intended more or less ironically by the speaker.

By analogy with secular [[prince]]s, in the broad sense of the ruler of any principality regardless of the style, it made perfect sense in a [[feudal]] class society to regard the highest members of the [[clergy]], mainly [[prelate]]s, as a privileged class ('estate') similar to the [[nobility]], ranking just below or even above it in the social order; often high clerical ranks, such as [[bishop]]s, were given high protocollary precedence amongst the nobility, and seats in the highest assemblies, including courts of justice and legislatures, such as [[Lord Bishop]]s in the English (later British) [[House of Lords]] (where a fixed set of senior Anglican bishops and archbishops retain and use their rights to sit) and [[Prince primate]]s in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

In Europe, as it became common for younger sons of dynastic houses to seek careers in the church hierarchy, especially when they were expected to be excluded from the succession, members of royal families and the [[aristocracy]] began to occupy many of the highest prelatures; examples include [[Henry Benedict Stuart|Henry, Cardinal-Duke of York]], the second grandson of [[James II of England]], and [[Henry, King of Portugal|Henry, Cardinal-King of Portugal]], the fifth son of [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. Even popes openly created [[Nepotism|Cardinal nephew]]s from their own family. However, these are individual cases; the term Prince of the church applies rather to the following institutionalized cases.

== Papal electors and other Cardinals ==
Every cardinal of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is still called a ''Prince of the Church'' because{{clarify|date=January 2017}} their [[College of Cardinals]] elects a new [[Pope]] (de facto from their number) during a period ''[[sede vacante]]'' in a special session called a [[Papal conclave|conclave]], where an age-limit applies. The Cardinals thus are an ecclesiastical equivalent to the [[prince-elector]]s of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], the other major elective monarchy in European history. The title carries no sovereign authority.

== Clerics as European territorial princes ==
{{main|Prince-Bishop}}
Especially in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a large number of [[Prince-bishop]]s, [[Prince-archbishop]]s and superiors of the regular clergy (mainly [[Prince-abbot]]s, but also -abbesses, [[Prince-Provost]]s and Grand masters) obtained for their seats, concurrent with the ecclesiastical office, one or more secular feudal estates of various status and importance (from tiny mere lordships to fairly great principalities such as duchies), that would otherwise be hereditary and often had been; in other cases territories were carved out especially by a higher authority, such as the empire, notably for an (arch)diocese or monastery, under such names as ''Stift'' (German; in the case of a diocese rather ''Hochstift'', for an archdiocese rather ''Erzstift'') or ''Sticht'' (Dutch), both meaning foundation, e.g. to set up a close relative as its first prelate; occasionally a normal secular style principality was created but immediately awarded to a prelate, such as the [[duchy of Westphalia]] for the Archbishop and Prince-elector of Cologne.

Many of them were at some point formally granted the rank of ''[[Reichsfürst]]'', literally "Prince of the Empire", in itself entitling them to representation in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] (Imperial Diet). For example, the [[bishop of Liège]] was a ''Fürst'' on account of several secular principalities merged into the bishopric (including the countships of [[county of Loon|Loon/Looz]] and [[county of Horn|Ho(o)rn]], [[marquisate of Franchimont]] and [[duchy of Bouillon]]) ruling a vast area, the prince-bishopric, but much smaller than his ecclesiastic diocese, the [[Bishopric of Liège]] in feudal times this territory was the only part of the [[Low Countries]] not counted among the "[[Seventeen Provinces]]" but seen as an integral part of [[Germany]].
However the principalities of some of the highest prelates were not known as prince-(arch)bishopric, which they effectively were, but rather by a term corresponding to a more prestigious ecclesiastical or temporal rank: the three German archbishoprics of Prince-electors (Cologne, Mainz and Trier) were styled ''Kurfürstentum'' 'Electorate', the patriarchate (an archbishopric) of Aquileia just that, the (Arch)Bishop of Rome's Italian principalities the [[Papal State]](s); on the other hand the papal principality in France, the [[Countship of Venaissin]], where the papacy had resided in 'Babylonian exile' in [[Avignon]], but which remained a papal state, separate from the Italian states, even after Avignon had been raised to archbishopric, was simply known by its temporal status, no reference to the highest of all princes of the church.

An ''exclusively religious'' category of Princes were the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]]s, by somewhat different styles, of those [[military order (monastic society)|military order]]s that had been granted statehood over a territory to defend it against the infidels and/or in recognition of the order's military merit in crusading and conquests, notably against the (mainly [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] and [[Baltic people|Baltic]]) peoples in the north and east&amp;mdash;notably the [[Teutonic Knights]]' ''Ordensstaat'' became the major power in the Baltic region, for example, absorbing its counterparts&amp;mdash; and against the [[Muslim]] [[Moors]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. While the Grand masters and their fighting [[knight]]s were usually professed nobles, the orders included clergy and were as a whole recognized as a truly "militant" form of devotion with papal recognition just as a normal monastic order.

By the twentieth century, only the [[Bishop of Rome]] (the [[Pope]], as Sovereign [[Monarch]] of [[Vatican City]], formerly of the [[Papal States]], a major power on the [[Italian peninsula]] until 1870) and the [[Bishop of Urgell]] (as [[Co-Prince of Andorra|Co-Prince]] of [[Andorra]]) were still reigning, territorial "princes of the church". For all other clergymen prince-like worldly power is now considered as conflicting with the prescriptions of the church.

== Non-Christian counterparts ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

For analogous positions in non–Catholic, and especially non-Christian contexts, the term ''Prince of the Faith'' is used.

In [[Hindu]] regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the priestly [[caste]] of [[Brahmin|Brahmans]] ranks higher than the noble caste of [[Kshatriya]]s. As a result, princes of the faith can be considered the ''de jure'' superiors to princes of the blood. However, the two groups often competed with one another for ''de facto'' sovereignty, and some historic figures in [[Indian history]] have held both sacred and secular titles. As real power usually lay with the secular rulers, many Brahmins sought social promotion by serving them, e.g. as spiritual advisers at court, and even with (non-Hindu) occupying colonial powers, often in administrative positions where their intellectual qualities could be harnessed.

'''''Psilocybe guilartensis''''' is a [[psilocybin mushroom]] which has [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds.  It is common in [[Puerto Rico]].

First reported in the literature in 1997,&lt;ref name = "Guzman and colleagues1997"&gt;Guzmán G, Tapia F, Nieves-Rivera ÁM, Betancourt C. (1997). Two new bluing species of ''Psilocybe'' from Puerto Rico. ''Mycotaxon'' '''63'''(1): 377-382.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gastón Guzmán]] placed ''P. guilartensis'' in ''Psilocybe'' section Brunneocystidiatae due to its blue staining reaction, small thick-walled subrhomboid spores, and pigmented [[cystidia]].&lt;ref name = "Guzman2003"&gt;Guzmán G, Tapia F, Ramírez-Guillén F, Baroni TJ, Lodge DJ, Cantrell SA, Nieves-Rivera ÁM.

'''Saraswati''' ({{lang-sa|सरस्वती}}, {{IAST| Sarasvatī}}) is the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Devi|goddess]] of knowledge, music, art, wisdom, and learning.&lt;ref name=dkingsley/&gt; She is a part of the trinity (''[[Tridevi]]'') of Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and [[Parvati]].

The earliest known mention of Saraswati as a goddess is in the [[Rigveda]]. She has remained significant as a goddess from the [[Vedic period]] through modern times of Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt; Some Hindus celebrate the festival of [[Vasant Panchami]] (the fifth day of spring, and also known as Saraswati Puja and Saraswati Jayanti in so many parts of India) in her honour,&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/state_uts.php?id=79 Vasant Panchami Saraswati Puja] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923070714/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/state_uts.php?id=79 |date=23 September 2014 }}, Know India – Odisha Fairs and Festivals&lt;/ref&gt; and mark the day by helping young children learn how to write alphabets on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblies.org.uk/pri/1612/the-festival-of-vasant-panchami-a-new-beginning The festival of Vasant Panchami: A new beginning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004145450/http://www.assemblies.org.uk/pri/1612/the-festival-of-vasant-panchami-a-new-beginning |date=4 October 2015 }}, Alan Barker, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; The Goddess is also revered by believers of the [[Jain]] religion of west and central [[India]],&lt;ref name=BMA&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=55|url=http://artsbma.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980514044647/http://www.artsbma.org/|archivedate=14 May 1998|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects.&lt;ref name=tdonaldson&gt;Thomas Donaldson (2001), Iconography of the Buddhist Sculpture of Orissa, {{ISBN|978-8170174066}}, pages 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Sarasvati, is a Sanskrit fusion word of ''saras'' (सरस्) meaning "pooling water", but also sometimes translated as "speech"; and ''vati'' (वती) meaning "she who possesses" (also found in the name of [[Parvati]], "She who has wings"). Originally associated with the river or rivers known as Saraswati, this combination therefore means "she who has ponds, lakes, and pooling water" or occasionally "she who possesses speech". It is also a Sanskrit composite word of ''surasa-vati'' (सुरस-वति) which means "one with plenty of water".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=surasa&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU सुरस] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204112824/http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=surasa&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU |date=4 December 2014 }} Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jmuir&gt;John Muir, {{Google books|ymLZAAAAMAAJ|Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India – Their Religions and Institutions|348}}, Volume 5, pp. 337–347 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt;

The word Saraswati appears both as a reference to a river and as a significant deity in the [[Rigveda]]. In initial passages, the word refers to the [[Sarasvati River]] and is mentioned as one among several northwestern Indian rivers such as the [[Drishadvati]]. Saraswati, then, connotes a river deity. In Book 2, the Rigveda describes Saraswati as the best of mothers, of rivers, of goddesses.&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
अम्बितमे नदीतमे देवितमे '''सरस्वति''' |&lt;br&gt;– Rigveda 2.41.16&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv02041.htm Rigveda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134650/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv02041.htm |date=24 September 2015 }}, Book 2, Hymn 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Best of mothers, best of rivers, best of goddesses, Sarasvatī.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saraswati is celebrated as a feminine deity with healing and purifying powers of abundant, flowing waters in Book 10 of the Rigveda, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
अपो अस्मान मातरः शुन्धयन्तु घर्तेन नो घर्तप्वः पुनन्तु |&lt;br&gt;
विश्वं हि रिप्रं परवहन्ति देविरुदिदाभ्यः शुचिरापूत एमि ||&lt;br&gt;– Rigveda 10.17&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv10017.htm Rigveda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508075500/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv10017.htm |date=8 May 2015 }}, Book 10, Hymn 17&lt;/ref&gt;

May the waters, the mothers, cleanse us,&lt;br&gt;
may they who purify with butter, purify us with butter,&lt;br&gt;
for these goddesses bear away defilement,&lt;br&gt;
I come up out of them pure and cleansed.&lt;br&gt;–Translated by John Muir
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Vedic literature, Saraswati acquires the same significance for early Indians (states [[John Muir (indologist)|John Muir]]) as that accredited to the river [[Ganges]] by their modern descendants. In hymns of Book 10 of Rigveda, she is already declared to be the "possessor of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Colbrooke, [https://archive.org/stream/essaysonreligio01colegoog#page/n28/mode/2up Sacred writings of the Hindus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310162311/https://archive.org/stream/essaysonreligio01colegoog |date=10 March 2016 }}, Williams &amp; Norgate, London, page 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Her importance grows in Vedas composed after Rigveda and in Brahmanas, and the word evolves in its meaning from "waters that purify", to "that which purifies", to "''vach'' (speech) that purifies", to "knowledge that purifies", and ultimately into a spiritual concept of a goddess that embodies knowledge, arts, music, melody, muse, language, rhetoric, eloquence, creative work and anything whose flow purifies the essence and self of a person.&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt;&lt;ref name=emoor&gt;Edward Moor, {{Google books|Ce2oxAVsZWgC|The Hindu Pantheon|page=125}}, pages 125–127&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Upanishad]]s and [[Dharma]] Sastras, Saraswati is invoked to remind the reader to meditate on virtue, virtuous emoluments, the meaning and the very essence of one's activity, one's action.

Saraswati is known by many names in ancient Hindu literature. Some examples of synonyms for Saraswati include [[Brahmani]] (power of Brahma), Brahmi (goddess of sciences),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm Sarasvati, The Goddess of Learning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427203916/http://www.stephen-knapp.com/sarasvati_goddess_of_learning.htm |date=27 April 2009 }} Stephen Knapp&lt;/ref&gt; Bharadi (goddess of history), Vani and Vachi (both referring to the flow of music/song, melodious speech, eloquent speaking respectively), Varnesvari (goddess of letters), Kavijihvagravasini (one who dwells on the tongue of poets).&lt;ref name=dkingsley&gt;Kinsley, David (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06339-2}}, pages 55–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebalf&gt;Edward Balf, {{Google books|iU0OAAAAQAAJ|The Encyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia}}, page 534&lt;/ref&gt; Goddess Saraswati is also known as Vidyadatri (Goddess who provides knowledge), Veenavadini (Goddess who plays veena, the musical instrument held by Goddess Saraswati), Pustakdharini (Goddess carrying book with herself), Veenapani (Goddess carrying veena in her hands), Hansavahini (Goddess who sits on swan) and Vagdevi (Goddess of speech).

In Hindu tradition, Sarasvati has retained her significance as a goddess from the Vedic age up to the present day.&lt;ref name=davidk&gt;Kinsley, David (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-06339-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shanti Parva]] of the Hindu epic [[Mahabharata]], Saraswati is called the mother of the Vedas, and later as the celestial creative symphony who appeared when Brahma created the universe.&lt;ref name=jmuir/&gt; In Book 2 of Taittiriya [[Brahmana]], she is called the mother of eloquent speech and melodious music. Saraswati is the active energy and power of Brahma.&lt;ref name=ebalf/&gt; She is also mentioned in many minor Sanskrit publications such as [[Sarada Tilaka]] of 8th century AD as follows,&lt;ref name=ar272&gt;{{Google books|IChFAAAAcAAJ|Asiatic Researches}}, – History and Antiquities, the Arts, Sciences and Literature of Asia, Volume 3, London, pages 272–273&lt;/ref&gt;

radiance on the implements of writing, and books produced by her favour.&lt;br&gt; – On Saraswati, Sarada Tilaka&lt;ref name=ar272/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Saraswati became a prominent deity in Buddhist iconography – the consort of [[Manjushri]] in 1st millennium AD. In some instances such as in the ''Sadhanamala'' of Buddhist pantheon, she has been symbolically represented similar to regional Hindu iconography, but unlike the more well known depictions of Saraswati.&lt;ref name=tdonaldson/&gt;

The goddess Saraswati is often depicted as a beautiful woman dressed in pure white, often seated on a white [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]], which symbolizes light, knowledge and truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvatī, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge: From the Manuscript-carrying Vīṇā-player to the Weapon-wielding Defender of the Dharma|page=1|publisher=BRILL|author=Catherine Ludvík|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She not only embodies knowledge but also the experience of the highest reality. Her iconography is typically in white themes from dress to flowers to swan – the colour symbolizing Sattwa Guna or purity, discrimination for true knowledge, insight and wisdom.&lt;ref name=dkingsley/&gt;&lt;ref name=jholm&gt;Jean Holm and John Bowke (1998), Picturing God, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1855671010}}, pages 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Her dhyana mantra describes her to be as white as the moon, clad in a white dress, bedecked in white ornaments, radiating with beauty, holding a book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hafsite.org/resources/hinduism-101-2/Saraswati-Symbolism|title=Hinduism 101 Saraswati Symbolism|website=Hindu American Foundation (HAF)|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016005521/https://www.hafsite.org/resources/hinduism-101-2/Saraswati-Symbolism|archivedate=16 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a pen in her hands. The book and the pen represent knowledge{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

She is generally shown to have four arms, but sometimes just two. When shown with four hands, those hands symbolically mirror her husband Brahma's four heads, representing ''manas'' (mind, sense), ''buddhi'' (intellect, reasoning), ''citta'' (imagination, creativity) and ''ahamkāra'' (self consciousness, ego).&lt;ref name=gpollock&gt;Griselda Pollock and Victoria Turvey-Sauron (2008), The Sacred and the Feminine: Imagination and Sexual Difference, {{ISBN|978-1845115203}}, pages 144–147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Sanskrit to English Translation of the four words: [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html Monier Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820092052/http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html |date=20 August 2016 }} University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Brahma represents the abstract, while she represents action and reality.

The four hands hold items with symbolic meaning — a ''pustaka'' (book or script), a ''mālā'' (rosary, garland), a water pot and a musical instrument (vīnā).&lt;ref name=dkingsley/&gt; The book she holds symbolizes the [[Vedas]] representing the universal, divine, eternal, and true knowledge as well as all forms of learning. A [[Hindu prayer beads|mālā]] of crystals, representing the power of meditation, inner reflection and spirituality. A pot of water represents the purifying power to separate right from wrong, the clean from the unclean, and essence from the inessential. In some texts, the pot of water is symbolism for [[soma (drink)|soma]] – the drink that liberates and leads to knowledge.&lt;ref name=dkingsley/&gt; The most famous feature on Saraswati is a musical instrument called a [[Saraswati veena|veena]], represents all creative arts and sciences,&lt;ref name=gpollock/&gt; and her holding it symbolizes expressing knowledge that creates harmony.&lt;ref name=dkingsley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some texts refer to her as "goddess of harmony"; for example, John Wilkes, {{Google books|3BnL4ahP4DEC|Encyclopaedia Londinensis}}, Volume 22, page 669&lt;/ref&gt; Saraswati is also associated with ''anurāga'', the love for and rhythm of music, which represents all emotions and feelings expressed in speech or music.

A hamsa or [[swan]] is often located next to her feet. In [[Hindu mythology]], the hamsa is a sacred bird, which if offered a mixture of milk and water, is said to be able to drink the milk alone. It thus symbolizes the ability to discriminate between good and evil, essence from outward show and the eternal from the evanescent.&lt;ref name=gpollock/&gt; Due to her association with the swan, Saraswati is also referred to as Hamsavāhini, which means "she who has a hamsa as her vehicle". The swan is also a symbolism for spiritual perfection, transcendence and moksha.&lt;ref name=jholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frithjof Schuon (2007), Spiritual Perspectives and Human Facts, {{ISBN|978-1933316420}}, page 281&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a ''citramekhala'' (also called ''mayura'', [[peacock]]) is shown beside the goddess. The peacock symbolizes colorful splendor, celebration of dance, and – as the devourer of snakes – the alchemical ability to transmute the serpent poison of self into the radiant plumage of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Hope B. Werness (2007), Continuum Encyclopedia of Animal Symbolism in World Art, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-0826419132}}, pages 319–320&lt;/ref&gt;

She is usually depicted near a flowing river or other body of water, which depiction may constitute a reference to her early history as a river goddess.

In some regions of India, such as [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]], [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]], as well as east Nepal, Saraswati is part of the [[Devi Mahatmya]] mythology, in the trinity (''[[Tridevi]]'') of [[Mahakali]], [[Mahalakshmi]] and [[Saraswati#Maha Saraswati|Mahasaraswati]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, {{ISBN|978-0823931804}}, page 408&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diana L. Eck|Diana Eck]] (2013), India: A Sacred Geography, Random House, {{ISBN|978-0385531924}}, pages 265–279&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of many different Hindu legends that attempt to explain how the Hindu trinity of gods (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) and [[Tridevi|goddesses]] (Saraswati, Lakshmi and Parvati) came into being. Various [[Purana]] texts offer alternate legends for Maha Saraswati.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mackenzie Brown (1990), The Triumph of the Goddess, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791403648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maha Saraswati is depicted as eight-armed and is often portrayed holding a Veena whilst sitting on a white lotus flower.

Her [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyāna]] [[shloka]] given at the beginning of the fifth chapter of Devi Mahatmya is:
:Wielding in her lotus-hands the bell, trident, ploughshare, conch, pestle, discus, bow, and arrow, her lustre is like that of a moon shining in the autumn sky. She is born from the body of [[Gowri]] and is the sustaining base of the three worlds. That Mahasaraswati I worship here who destroyed Sumbha and other asuras.&lt;ref&gt;Glory of the Divine Mother (Devi Mahatmyam) by S.Sankaranarayanan. Prabha Publishers, Chennai. India.({{ISBN|81-87936-00-2}}) Page. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahasaraswati is also part of another legend, the ''Navshaktis'' (not to be confused with ''Navdurgas''), or nine forms of Shakti, namely Brahmi, Vaishnavi, Maheshwari, Kaumari, Varahi, Narsimhi, Aindri, Shivdooti and Chamunda, revered as powerful and dangerous goddesses in eastern India. They have special significance on ''[[Navaratri]]'' in these regions. All of these are seen ultimately as aspects of a single great Hindu goddess, with Maha Saraswati as one of those nine.&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z, Vol. 2, {{ISBN|978-0823931804}}, page 467&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mahavidya Nila Saraswati ===
In Tibet and parts of India, Nilasaraswati is a form of [[Mahavidya]] [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]]. Nila Saraswati is a different deity from traditional Saraswati, yet subsumes her knowledge and creative energy in tantric literature. Nila Sarasvati is the ''ugra'' (angry, violent, destructive) manifestation in one school of Hinduism, while the more common Saraswati is the ''saumya'' (calm, compassionate, productive) manifestation found in most others. In tantric literature of the former, Nilasaraswati has a 100 names. There are separate dhyana shlokas and [[mantras]] for her worship in [[Tantrasara]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kinsley, Tāntric Visions of the Divine Feminine, University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-06339-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Festivals ===
{{Main|Saraswati Puja}}
One of the most famous festivals associated with Goddess Saraswati is the Hindu festival of Vasant Panchami. Celebrated on the 5th day in the Hindu calendar month of [[Magha (month)]], it is also known as [[Saraswati Puja]] and Saraswati Jayanti in India.

====Saraswati Puja in East and Northeast India====
In [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]], Goddess Saraswati is worshipped on Vasant Panchami, a Hindu festival celebrated every year on the 5th day in the Hindu calendar month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] (about February). Hindus celebrate this festival in temples, homes and educational institutes alike.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Christian (2005). Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. Vol.2.

Pg. 94. {{ISBN|9780595837489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saraswati Puja in North, Weste and Central India====
In [[Bihar]] and [[Jharkhand]], [[Vasant Panchami]] is commonly known as [[Saraswati Puja]]. On this day, Goddess Saraswati is worshipped in schools, colleges, educational institutes as well as in institutes associated with music and dance. Cultural programmes are also organised in schools and institutes on this day. People especially students worship Goddess Saraswati also in pandals (a tent made up of colourful cloths, decorated with lights and other decorative items). In these states, on the occasion of Saraswati Puja, Goddess Saraswati is worshipped in the form of idol, made up of soil. On Saraswati Puja, the idol is worshipped by people and [[prasad]] is distributed among the devotees after [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]. Prasad mainly consists of [[boondi]] (motichoor), pieces of carrot, peas and Indian plum (ber). On the next day or any day depending on religious condition, the idol is immersed in a pond (known as Murti Visarjan or Pratima Visarjan)  after performing a Havana (immolation), with full joy and fun, playing with [[abir]] and [[gulal]]. After Pratima Visarjan, members involved in the organisation of puja ceremony eat [[khichdi]] together.

It consists of placing the books for puja on the Ashtami day. It may be in one's own house, in the local nursery school run by traditional teachers, or in the local temple. The books will be taken out for reading, after worship, only on the morning of the third day (Vijaya Dashami). It is called Puja Eduppu (Taking [from] Puja). Children are happy, since they are not expected to study on these days. On the Vijaya Dashami day, Kerala and Tamil Nadu celebrates the Ezhuthiniruthu or Initiation of Writing for the little children before they are admitted to nursery schools. This is also called Vidyarambham.

On Saraswati day, people make offerings in the form of flowers in temples and to sacred texts. The day after Saraswati day, is ''Banyu Pinaruh'', a day of cleansing. On this day, Hindus of Bali go to the sea, sacred waterfalls or river spots, offer prayers to Saraswati, and then rinse themselves in that water in the morning. Then they prepare a feast, such as the traditional ''bebek betutu'' and ''nasi kuning'', that they share.&lt;ref&gt;Vivienne Kruger, Balinese Food: The Traditional Cuisine &amp; Food Culture of Bali, {{ISBN|978-0804844505}}, page 152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon Warren Cheney''' (June 29, 1886 – October 10, 1980) was an [[United States|American]] author and [[art critic]], born at [[Berkeley, California]], the son of [[Lemuel Warren Cheney]] (1858–1921), California lawyer and writer, and [[May L. Cheney]] (1862–1942), Appointment Secretary at [[University of California, Berkeley]] for over forty years.&lt;ref name=planet&gt;''The Berkeley Daily Planet'' (October 29, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; At first he worked in his father's real estate  business, later moving to Detroit where he founded the ''[[Theatre Arts Magazine]]'' in 1916 and edited it until 1921. Cheney was one of the most significant pro-modernist theatre and art critics of the early twentieth century. He helped introduce European modernist practices in theatre to the United States. His ''Theatre Arts Magazine'' promoted American little theatre activity, advocated for [[New Stagecraft]] design, and nurtured new American playwrights.

==Early years==
Cheney grew up in Berkeley, California, in what he called "an atmosphere of literary ambition and activity". His father, Warren Cheney, was an author of poetry and fiction, and served as editor of the popular California magazine, ''[[Overland Monthly]]'', and his mother, May L. Cheney, organized a teacher placement office at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and was the founder of the National Association of Appointment Secretaries (NAAS) now known as the [[American College Personnel Association]]. The younger Cheney had a passion for the art of bookmaking and, while studying [[architecture]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], founded a quarterly journal for designers and collectors of bookplates—his first foray into the field of magazine publishing. He graduated in 1908 with a bachelor's degree in architecture. During his studies, Cheney also developed a love for theatre, inspired largely by performances of Greek drama he had attended at Berkeley’s outdoor [[Hearst Greek Theatre]]. In the years immediately following his graduation, Cheney married Maud Maurice Turner and found intermittent work as an art and theatre critic.

In 1913, Cheney began studying drama at [[Harvard University]]. While there he attended the Boston installation of New York City's legendary [[Armory Show]], an experience of modern art which fostered Cheney's growing fascination with new art and theatre. He began to write on the subject of modernism, and his first book, ''The New Movement in the Theatre'', was published in 1914. It was around this time that Cheney decided to create a new journal focused on progressive ideas in the theatre.

==Later years==
Cheney served as the main editor and writer for ''Theatre Arts Magazine'' from 1916-1921. Upon the October 1921 publication of the last issue of Volume V, Cheney removed himself from the editorial staff. He continued to contribute occasional articles for some years but was never again on the staff.

Cheney later remarked that he left in order to pursue professional theatre practice. He joined the [[Actor's Theatre]] in New York briefly, but there is no record of Cheney’s actual participation in any professional work with the group.

After Cheney ceased editorship of ''Theatre Arts Magazine'' in 1921, he began writing more about modern art. His multiple editions of ''A Primer on Modern Art'' helped frame the discussion of modernist painting and sculpture until the 1950s.

In 1945, he departed from his usual vocation with his book, ''Men Who Have Walked with God'', tracing mysticism through history, concentrating on eleven men from [[Lao-Tse]] and the [[Buddha]] to [[Jacob Boehme]] and [[William Blake]].

He lived for many years in [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]], then returned to his home town of Berkeley in 1976.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3331">'''Theodore Bar Konai''' ({{lang-syr|ܬܐܕܘܪܘܣ ܒܪ ܟܘܢܝ}}) was a distinguished Assyrian exegete and apologist of the [[Church of the East]] who seems to have flourished at the end of the eighth century.  His most famous work was a book of ''Scholia'' on the Old and New Testaments.

== Life and works ==
Bar Konai appears to have lived during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780–823), [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]], though some scholars have placed him a century later. [[Assemani]] identified him with a bishop named Theodore, the nephew of the patriarch [[Yohannan IV]] (900–5), who was appointed to the diocese of Lashom in [[Beth Garmaï (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Garmaï]] in 893, and his dating was followed by Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Assemani, ''BO'', ii. 440 and iii. 1, 198, Wright, ''Syriac Literature'', 222&lt;/ref&gt;  Chabot and Baum and Winkler, however, both place him at the end of the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Syriac Language and Literature''; Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;  

Theodore was the author of a book of ''[[Scholia]]'' (''Kṯāḇā d-ʾeskoliyon'') on both the Old and New Testaments (edited between 1908 and 1912 by the celebrated scholar [[Addai Scher]]), believed to have been written circa 792.  The ''Scholia'' offer an apologetic presentation in nine chapters, similar to a catechism, of East Syrian Christianity, and contain a valuable overview, in a tenth and eleventh chapter, of heretical doctrines and non-Christian religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]] and [[Islam]], with which Theodore sharply disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore was also the author of an ecclesiastical history, a treatise against [[Monophysitism]], a treatise against the [[Arianism]], a colloquy between a pagan and a Christian, and a treatise on heresies.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Syriac Language and Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Church History'' contains some interesting details of the lives of the Patriarchs of the Church of the East.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatlink|Or see [[Three body (disambiguation)|Three body]].}}
According to '''Sarira Traya''', the '''Doctrine of the Three bodies''' in [[Hinduism]], the human being is composed of three '''sariras''' or "bodies" emanating from Brahman by avidya, "ignorance" or "nescience". They are often equated with the five [[kosha]]s (sheaths), which cover the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]. The ''Three Bodies Doctrine'' is an essential doctrine in Indian philosophy and religion, especially [[Yoga]], [[Advaita Vedanta]] and [[Tantra]].

==The Three Bodies==

===Karana sarira - causal body===
{{Main|Causal body}}

''Karana sarira'' or the causal body is merely the cause{{sfn|Sharma|2006|p=193}} or seed of the subtle body and the gross body. It has no other function than being the seed of the subtle and the gross body.{{sfn|Bahder|Bahder|2013}} It is ''nirvikalpa [[Rūpa|rupam]]'', "undifferentiated form".{{sfn|Bahder|Bahder|2013}} It originates with ''avidya'', "ignorance" or "nescience" of the real identity of the atman, instead giving birth to the notion of ''[[jiva]]''.

[[Swami Sivananda]] characterizes the causal body as "The beginningless ignorance that is indescribable".&lt;ref group=web name="BV" /&gt; [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]], the guru of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], also describes the causal body as characterized by "emptiness", "ignorance", and "darkness".{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}} In the search for the "I am", this is a state where there is nothing to hold on to anymore.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|name="kenosis"|Compare [[kenosis]] and Juan de la Cross' ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]''.}}

[[Ramanuja]] concludes that it is at this stage that consummation of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] with the [[Paramatman]] is reached and the search for the highest [[Purusa]], i.e., of [[Ishvara]], ends.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=155–168}}

According to other philosophical schools, the causal body is not the ''atman'', because it also has a beginning and an end and is subject to modification.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Tattva Bodha of Adi Shankara Part 2|author=Dr. S. 
Yegnasubramanian|url=http://svbf.org/journal/vol3no4/bodha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], not seeking a personal god, goes beyond ''Anandamaya Kosha'' in search of the transcendent [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=155–168}}

The Indian tradition identifies it with the ''[[Anandamaya kosha]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="BV"&gt;[http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=774 Divine life Society, ''Bases of Vedanta'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the deep sleep state, where ''buddhi'' becomes dormant and all concepts of time fail, although there are differences between these three descriptions.

The causal body is considered as the most complex of the three bodies. It contains the impressions of experience, which results from past experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregory P.|first1=Fields|title=Religious Therapeutics: Body and Health in Yoga, Āyurveda, and Tantra|date=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvQhuyGpB3wC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=three+bodies+in+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mY-OU8vmBJOMuASVp4LICA&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=three%20bodies%20in%20vedanta&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suksma sarira - subtle body===
{{Main|Subtle body}}

''Suksma sarira'' or the subtle body is the body of the mind and the vital energies, which keep the physical body alive. Together with the causal body it is the transmigrating soul or [[jiva]], separating from the gross body upon death.

The subtle body is composed of the five subtle elements, the elements before they have undergone [[panchikarana]],&lt;ref group=web name="SKA"&gt;[http://www.yogaforums.com/forums/f37/an-overview-of-vedanta-part-1-a-10833.html Shri Kalam Ashram, ''An Overview of Vedanta'']&lt;/ref&gt; and contains:
* ''sravanadipanchakam'' - the five organs of perception: eyes, ears, skin, tongue and nose&lt;ref group=web name="SKA" /&gt;{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|Shri Kalam Ashram: "[T]he organs of perception and action have been defined as residing in the Subtle body. These organs are not to be confused with the physical entities of the Ear, Eye etc which are part of the physical body. In Vedanta, it is the “Indriyas” –which are responsible for the function. The Indriyas are the “senses”. Thus while the physical organ “eye” is part of the Gross Body, when we talk about the “eye”, we are referring to the sense of sight which resides in the Subtle body.&lt;ref group=web name="SKA" /&gt;}}
* ''vagadipanchakam'' - the five organs of action: speech, hands, legs, anus and genitals&lt;ref group=web name="SKA" /&gt;{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}
* ''[[prana]]panchakam'' - the five-fold vital breath: Prana (respiration), Apana (evacuation of waste from the body),  Vyana (blood circulation), Udana (actions like sneezing, crying, vomiting etc.), Samana (digestion)&lt;ref group=web name="SKA" /&gt;{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}} 
* [[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]&lt;ref group=web name="SKA" /&gt;{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Manas-vijnana]]}}
* [[Buddhi]], the Intellect, discriminating wisdom&lt;ref group=web name="SKA" /&gt;{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Prajna (Vedic)|prajna]]}}

Other Indian traditions see the subtle body as an eighth-fold aggregate, placing together the mind-aspects and adding avidhya, kamah and karma:
* ''buddhyadicatustayam'' (''[[buddhi]]'', ''[[Mind|manas]]'', ''ahamkrti'', ''[[citta]]''), 
* ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'' (''[[adhyasa]]'', super-imposition), 
* ''[[kama]]h'' (desire), 
* ''[[karma]]'' (action of the nature of ''[[dharma]]'' and ''[[adharma]]'').

In [[samkhya]], which does not acknowledge a causal body, it is also known as the ''linga-sarira''.{{sfn|Feuerstein|1978|p=200}} It puts one in the mind of the ''atman'', it reminds one of the ''atman'', the controller. It is the beginningless limitation of the ''atman'', it has no beginning like the ''Sthula sarira''.

The "dream state" is a distinct state of the subtle body, where the ''buddhi'' shines itself owing to memory of deeds done in the waking state. It is the indispensable operative cause of all the activities of the individual self.

===Sthula sarira - gross body===

''Sthula sarira'' or the gross body is the material physical mortal body that eats, breathes and moves (acts). It is composed of many diverse components, produced by one’s ''karmas'' (actions) in past life out of the elements which have undergone ''[[panchikarana]]'' i.e. combining of the five primordial subtle elements.

It is the instrument of [[Jiva]]’s experience, which, attached to the body and dominated by ''[[Ahamkara]]'',{{refn|group=note|Ego, I-ness or the ''[[Antakarana]]'' in which the ''[[Citta]]'' or the ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' is reflected}} uses the body’s external and internal organs of sense and action. The Jiva, identifying itself with the body, in its waking state enjoys gross objects. On its body rests man’s contact with the external world.

The ''Sthula sarira''’s main features are ''Sambhava'' (birth), ''Jara'' (old age or ageing) and ''Maranam'' (death), and the "Waking State". The ''Sthula sarira'' is the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]].

===Three bodies and five sheaths===
{{Main|Kosha}}

The [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] describes five [[kosha]]s, which are also often equated with the three bodies. The three bodies are often equated with the five koshas (sheaths), which cover the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]:
# ''Sthula sarira'', the Gross body, also called the ''Annamaya Kosha''&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt;
# ''Suksma sarir''', the [[Subtle body]], composed of:
## ''[[Prana]]maya Kosha'' (Vital breath or [[Energy]]), 
## ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manomaya]] Kosha'' ([[Mind]]),
## ''[[Vijñāna|Vijnanamaya]] Kosha'' ([[Intellect]])&lt;ref name="FD" /&gt; 
# ''Karana sarira'', the [[Causal body]], the ''[[Anandamaya kosha|Anandamaya Kosha]]'' ([[Happiness|Bliss]])&lt;ref name="FD"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fourth Dimension|author=J.Jagadeesan|publisher=Sai Towers Publishing|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3uGtLLz2A4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Sthula+sarira#v=onepage&amp;q=Sthula%20sarira&amp;f=false|isbn=9788178990927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four states of consciousness and turiya===
The [[Mandukya Upanishad]] describes four states of consciousness, namely waking consciousness, dream, and deep sleep, and [[turiya]], the base-consciousness. Waking consciousness, dream, and deep sleep are equated with the three bodies, while turiya is a fourth state, which is equated with atman and purusha.

====Turiya====
{{Main|Turiya}}
{{See also|Purusha|Tathagatagarbha|Sunyata}}

[[Turiya]], pure consciousness, is the fourth state. It is the background that underlies and transcends the three common states of consciousness.&lt;ref name=rm&gt;[http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/tw/tw617.html  {{cite book|author=Ramana Maharshi|title=States of Consciousness}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref name=sc1&gt;[http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/yoga/summits_of_god-life {{cite book|author=Sri Chinmoy|title=Summits of God-Life}}]&lt;/ref&gt; In this consciousness both absolute and relative, [[Saguna Brahman]] and [[Nirguna Brahman]], are transcended.{{sfn|Sarma|1996|p=137}} It is the true state of experience of the infinite (''ananta'') and non-different (''advaita/abheda''), free from the dualistic experience which results from the attempts to conceptualise ( ''vipalka'') reality.{{sfn|King|1995|p=300 note 140}} It is the state in which [[ajativada]], non-origination, is apprehended.{{sfn|King|1995|p=300 note 140}}

====Four bodies====
[[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]], the guru of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], discerns four bodies, by including turiya or the "Great-Causal Body"{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|p=32}}  as a fourth body. Here resides the knowledge of "I am" that cannot be described,{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|p=33}} the state before Ignorance and Knowledge, or [[Turiya]] state{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|p=32}}

====Integral Theory====
The three bodies are a critical component of  [[Ken Wilber]]'s Integral Theory.

===Ten bodies of Kundalini Yoga===
Kundalini Yoga as taught by [[Yogi Bhajan]] describes ten spiritual bodies: the physical body, three mental bodies and six energy bodies.  There is an 11th embodiment of Parallel Unisonness, which represents the divine sound current and is characterized by a pure state of non-dual consciousness.{{sfn|Bhajan|2003|p=201-203}}
#First Body (Soul Body) - the spark of the infinite at the core
#Second Body (Negative Mind) - the protective and defensive aspect of mind
#Third Body (Positive Mind) - energetic and hopeful projection of mind
#Fourth Body (Neutral Mind) - intuitive, integrates information from the negative and positive minds
#Fifth Body (Physical Body) - the human vehicle on Earth
#Sixth Body (Arcline) - extends from ear to ear, across the hairline and brow.  Commonly known as a halo.  Woman have a second arcline across the chest.  The arcline contains energy imprints of memories.
#Seventh Body (Aura) - an electromagnetic field that surrounds the body; the container of a person's life force.
#Eighth Body (Pranic Body) - connected with the breath, brings the life force and energy in and out of your system.
#Ninth Body (Subtle Body) - gives the subtle perceptual ability to sense the infinite within the physical and material plane.
#Tenth Body (Radiant Body) - gives spiritual royalty and radiance.

==Application in Indian philosophy==

===Yoga physiology===
The three bodies are an essential part of the Yoga physiology. Yoga aims at controlling the vital energies of the bodies, thereby attaining [[siddhi]]s (magical powers) and [[moksha]].

===Atma vijnana===
According to the Advaita Vedanta tradition, knowledge of the "self" or [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]] can be gained by [[self-inquiry]], investigating the three bodies, and disidentifying from them. It is a method which is well-known from [[Ramana Maharshi]], but also from  [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]] and his teacher [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]].

By subsequently identifying with the three lower bodies, investigating them, and discarding identification with them when it has become clear that they are not the "I", the sense of "I am" beyond knowledge and Ignorance becomes clearly established.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|34-58}}

In this investigation the three bodies are recognized as not being [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrashekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=xxi|url= http://www.bhavans.info/store/bookdetail.asp?bid=364&amp;bauth=Sri+Sankara+Bhagavatpadacarya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theosophy===
The later Theosophists speak of seven bodies or levels of existence that include ''Sthula sarira'' and ''[[Linga sarira]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Popular Encyclopedia of Apologetics|author=Ed Hudson|publisher=Harvest House Publishers|page=471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yipXIHcteRsC&amp;pg=PA471&amp;dq=Sthula+sarira#v=onepage&amp;q=Sthula%20sarira&amp;f=false|isbn=9780736936354|date=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dia Virgen del Valle.jpg|thumb|Holiday celebrated in the Virgin of the Valley day ([[El Valle, Nueva Esparta|El Valle]], [[Nueva Esparta]], Venezuela).]]
'''The Virgin of the Valley''' (Spanish:'''Virgen del Valle''' or '''Nuestra Señora del Valle''') is a [[Roman Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated in Margarita Island, [[Venezuela]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezuelatuya.com/religion/virgendelvalle.htm|title=La Virgen del Valle|website=venezuelatuya.com|accessdate=8 June 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catamarca, [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reinadelcielo.org/nuestra-senora-del-valle-de-catamarca/|title=Nuestra Señora del Valle de Catamarca|website=reinadelcielo.org|accessdate=8 June 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Venezuela, the Virgin is the Patroness of Eastern Venezuela, and her feast day is held on 8 September in her sanctuary in Margarita Valley near [[Porlamar]]. 

[[Pope Leo XIII]] granted a [[Canonical coronation]] towards the Argentinian image on 12 April 1891 while [[Pope Pius X]] crowned the Venezuelan image on 8 September 1911.

The Spanish conquerors brought the image of the Virgin Mary to  [[Nueva Cádiz]] city in Cubagua Island. After a huge hurricane hit this island in 1542, the image was moved to [[El Valle del Espíritu Santo]] in Margarita Island whereby the virgin was rename as '''Virgin of the Valley.'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/regiones/Virgen-Valle-anos-mirada-mar_0_479352064.html|title=Virgen del Valle: 103 años con la mirada hacia el mar|website=www.el-nacional.com|access-date=2016-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908223321/http://www.el-nacional.com/regiones/Virgen-Valle-anos-mirada-mar_0_479352064.html|archive-date=2014-09-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miracles'''

Her holy mantle didn't abandon Margarita people. In 1541, the island was suffering a very hard drought then the people decided to bring the Virgin in a procession. According to people believing, when they were in Asunción city a very heavy rain took place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;gallery mode="traditional"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== In Argentina ==
; Catamarca
The center of the City of Catamarca boasts the imposing cathedral of Our Lady of the Valley, Patron Saint of the city. Throughout the year, thousands of faithful believers from all parts of the country flock to see the image of the virgin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.welcomeargentina.com/catamarca/virgin-of-the-valley.html|title=Virgin of the Valley (Virgen del Valle)|website=Welcome Argentina|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spectacular temple of Our Lady of the Valley is the most important in the Province of Catamarca. It was designed by architect and town planner Luis Caravatti and constructed between 1859 and 1875 with a strong Neo-classical style. At that time, Vicario Seguro worked very hard to build this cathedral. In fact, he persuaded Justo Jose de Urquiza to make a donation of a sum of money for its construction. Certainly, many pilgrims also collaborated on the same purpose. The temple is so superb that not only does it attract the pilgrims but also the visitors to Catamarca, who cannot miss this architectural jewel. Its facade has a big entrance hall which extends towards the sidewalk and two side towers almost forty meters high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Virgen del Valle 01.jpg|thumb|[[Catedral Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Valle|Cathedral Our Lady of the Valley]] (Catamarca, Argentina).]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4030">"'''Æcerbot'''" ([[Old English]] "Field-Remedy") is an [[Anglo-Saxon metrical charm]] recorded in the 11th century, intended to remedy fields that yielded poorly.&lt;ref name=GRISGBY43&gt;Grigsby (2005:96f, 246).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The charm consists of a partially [[Christianization|Christianized]] [[prayer]] and a day-long ritual that began at night with four sods taken from the field, to the root-mats of which a [[poultice]] was applied in the form of yeast, honey, oil and milk mixed with parts of all the good herbs that grew, save [[buckwheat]] and woody plants. In Christian times the sods were taken to mass and returned to the field before nightfall, each with a small cross planted in it. This was the extent to which the ritual was Christianized. Once more in the field, the healer faced the east, where the sun would rise, turning three times clockwise and calling upon the "holy guardian of the heavenly kingdom" to "fill the earth", that the crops would grow. A plough was then anointed with a "[[Hallow|hallowed]]" mix of oil, paste, [[frankincense]], salt and [[fennel]], of which the imported frankincense lent a Christian element; a chant was then sung, beginning ''Erce, erce, erce eorþan modor'', [[Earth Mother|mother of earth]]".&lt;ref name=GORDON90&gt;Gordon (1962:88-90).&lt;/ref&gt; The field was then ploughed with a chant hailing "Erce, eorthan modor."

The significance of ''erce'' has been the subject of scholarly commentary and speculation. Grimm connected Old High German ''erchan'' "genuine, true".&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]'' (1935), trans. Stallybrass  (1888), chapter 13: [http://www.northvegr.org/secondary%20sources/mythology/grimms%20teutonic%20mythology/01301.html Goddesses]
"Can there lie disguised in ''erce'' a proper name ''Erce'' gen. ''Ercan'', connected with the OHG. adj. ''ërchan'', ''simplex, genuinus, germanus''? it would surely be more correct to write ''Eorce''? ought it to suggest the lady ''Erche, Herkja, Herche, Helche'' renowned in our heroic legend?"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathleen Herbert]] observes that in the first mention of the [[Angles|Angli]],  [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', remarks that "the noteworthy characteristic of the English, to foreign eyes, was that they were goddess-worshippers; they looked on the earth as their mother." Herbert links Tacitus' mention of the Angli to the later English "Æcerbot". Herbert comments that while "Æcerbot" is referred to as a charm, it is in fact a "full-scale ritual" that would take an entire day to perform, plus additional time for collecting and preparing the materials necessary.&lt;ref name=HERBERT13&gt;Herbert (2007:13).&lt;/ref&gt;
