'''''21 Jump Street''''' is a 2012 American [[buddy cop]] [[Action film|action]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]], written by [[Michael Bacall]], and starring [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Channing Tatum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Coll |date=December 21, 2009 |url=http://www.fusedfilm.com/2009/12/21-jump-street-film-gets-phil-lord-and-chris-miller-to-direct/ | title=''21 Jump Street'' Gets Phil Lord and Chris Miller to direct |publisher=Fused Film |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218215845/http://www.fusedfilm.com/2009/12/21-jump-street-film-gets-phil-lord-and-chris-miller-to-direct/ |archivedate=February 18, 2012  |accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation of &lt;!--Please do not change. A film based on a TV series is never referred to as a "loose sequel" even if it takes place within the same continuity after the series has ended.--&gt; the [[21 Jump Street|1987&amp;ndash;91 television series of the same name]] by [[Stephen J. Cannell]] and [[Patrick Hasburgh]], the film follows two police officers who are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.

The film was released theatrically on March 16, 2012 by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]],&lt;ref name="mgm" /&gt; and grossed $201 million against a budget of $54.7 million. A sequel, titled ''[[22 Jump Street]]'', was released on June 13, 2014. Two further films, ''[[Jump Street (franchise)#Future|MIB 23]]'' (a crossover with the [[Men in Black (franchise)|''Men in Black'' franchise]]) and a female-led spin-off, are currently in development.

==Plot==
In 2005, scholarly student Morton Schmidt ([[Jonah Hill]]) and popular underachieving jock Greg Jenko ([[Channing Tatum]]) miss their school prom; Schmidt being rejected by the girl he asked to be his date and Jenko being barred from attending because of his grades. Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo ([[DeRay Davis]]), the leader of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|one-percenter]] motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' rights]].

The duo is reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson ([[Ice Cube]]) assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly ([[Brie Larson]]), and he and Jenko meet the school's main dealer, popular student Eric ([[Dave Franco]]). The two take HFS in front of him to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drug's effects, the duo discovers that Schmidt's intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenko's lax attitude is frowned upon.

Eric takes a liking to Schmidt, who develops a romantic interest in Molly. Jenko becomes friends with the students in his [[AP Chemistry]] class and finds himself becoming more interested in geeky hobbies and academic pursuits. Schmidt and Jenko throw a party at Schmidt's parents' house, where they are living during the course of their assignment, and invite Eric. During the party, a fight breaks out between Schmidt, Jenko, and some party crashers. Schmidt wins the fight, solidifying his social status and gaining Eric's trust. Jenko's friends hack Eric's phone to enable them to listen in on his conversations.

At a party at Eric's house, using the phone hack, Jenko and his friends overhear information about an upcoming meeting between Eric and his supplier, but also catch Schmidt making disparaging comments about Jenko. The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS – the motorcycle gang from the park – and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play. They are expelled from school and are removed from the Jump Street program.

Eric, stressed and terrified, recruits Schmidt and Jenko as security for a deal taking place at the school prom. While dressing for the prom, Schmidt and Jenko rekindle their friendship. At the prom, they discover that the supplier is the physical education teacher, Mr. Walters ([[Rob Riggle]]), who created the drug accidentally and started selling it to the students to supplement his teacher's salary. Having caught Eric smoking marijuana, he was able to persuade him into being his dealer.

The motorcycle gang arrives for the deal but Molly interrupts them and starts arguing with Schmidt. As a result, the gang leader recognizes Schmidt and Jenko, and orders his men to kill them. Two of the gang members reveal themselves as undercover [[DEA]] agents Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall ([[Johnny Depp]] and [[Peter DeLuise]]), and former members of the [[21 Jump Street]] program. In the ensuing gunfight, Hanson and Penhall are fatally wounded. Mr. Walters and Eric escape with the money and Molly as a hostage; the gang, Schmidt, and Jenko follow close behind. Jenko creates a homemade bomb and uses it to kill the gang. Mr. Walters shoots at Schmidt but Jenko takes the bullet to his arm, sparing Schmidt's life. In response, Schmidt shoots Mr. Walters, unintentionally severing his penis. As they arrest Mr. Walters and Eric (in addition to successfully reading the Miranda rights), Schmidt and Jenko reconcile their relationship and Schmidt and Molly share a kiss.

Both officers are congratulated and reinstated in Jump Street as Dickson gives them a new assignment: [[22 Jump Street|infiltrating a college]].

==Production==
In May 2008, [[Sony Pictures]] confirmed that a [[film adaptation]] of the series was under development. [[Jonah Hill]] rewrote an existing script by screenwriter Joe Gazzam and executive produced the film, as well as starred in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/05/21-jump-street.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514220832/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/05/21-jump-street.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 14, 2008 |title=Jonah Hill in negotiations to develop '21 Jump Street' movie |last=Sperling |first=Nicole |date=May 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly|hollywoodinsider.ew.com]] |accessdate=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill has said he wanted horror director [[Rob Zombie]] to direct the picture. In May 2009, Hill described the film adaptation as being an "R-rated, insane, ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]''-meets-[[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]-type movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fusedfilm.com/2009/05/jonah-hill-talks-21-jump-street-remake-movie/ |title=Jonah Hill Talks 21 Jump Street Remake Movie |last1=Coll |first1=Kevin |date=May 28, 2009 |publisher=Fused Film |access-date=December 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218215831/http://www.fusedfilm.com/2009/05/jonah-hill-talks-21-jump-street-remake-movie/ |archive-date=February 18, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 21, 2009, it was announced that Sony was in talks with ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' directing duo, [[Phil Lord and Christopher Miller]], to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusedfilm.com/2009/12/21-jump-street-film-gets-phil-lord-and-chris-miller-to-direct/ |title=21 Jump Street Film Gets Phil Lord and Chris Miller To Direct |last=Coll |first=Kevin |date=December 21, 2009 |publisher=Fused Film |accessdate=December 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218215845/http://www.fusedfilm.com/2009/12/21-jump-street-film-gets-phil-lord-and-chris-miller-to-direct/ |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film follows the same [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] as the TV series; Lord said, "So, all of those events of the original happened.

===Filming===
The film was shot in and around the city of [[Metairie, Louisiana]] (suburb of New Orleans) in 2011, although the filmmakers took elaborate steps to disguise the location as a generic city named "Metropolitan City". They replaced distinctive street signs with signs using a [[Helvetica]] typeface, digitally removed billboards from local businesses (except the recognizable local [[New Orleans Regional Transit Authority|RTA]] signs toward the end of the film as well as a Zatarain's billboard ad), and avoided filming locations with iconic New Orleans imagery. Despite this, signature landmarks such as the [[Crescent City Connection]] and distinctive [[French Quarter]]–area street are still partially visible.&lt;ref name="tp120318"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Scott |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |location=[[New Orleans, LA]] |title=A city undercover: New Orleans keeps a low profile in '21 Jump Street' |url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2012/03/a_city_undercover_new_orleans.html |date=March 18, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main school used as the stand-in for the fictional Sagan High School was [[Riverdale High School (Jefferson Parish, Louisiana)|Riverdale High School]], located in [[Jefferson, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Cindy |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/121/1218751p1.html |title=IGN Visits 21 Jump Street - IGN |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naked baby pictures of Hill's character used in the film were actual pictures of Hill as a child.&lt;ref name="contactmusic"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]|location=[[New York City, NY]]|title=Video - Jonah Hill: 'The Naked Baby Pictures In Jump Street Are Mine' - 21 Jump Street Press Conference Part 1|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/celebrity-videos/jonah-hill-the-naked-baby-pictures-in-jump-street-are-mine_11589|date=April 3, 2012|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The score for the film was composed by [[Mark Mothersbaugh]]. In September 2014, it was released by La-La Land Records on a double disc album, limited to 2,000 copies. The second disc of the album also contains the score from the film's sequel, ''[[22 Jump Street]]'', composed by Mothersbaugh as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Mothersbaugh's Scores for '21 Jump Street' and '22 Jump Street' Released|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/09/23/mark-mothersbaughs-scores-for-21-jump-street-and-22-jump-street-released/|publisher=FilmMusicReporter.com|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modernized cover of the original television's theme song by [[Rye Rye]] (who had a small part in the film) and [[Esthero]] was released as a single in the [[iTunes Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iTunes – Music – 21 Jump Street – Main Theme (From the Motion Picture "21 Jump Street") – Single|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/21-jump-street-main-theme/id509594047|publisher=[[iTunes]]|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|22 Jump Street}}
On March 17, 2012, Sony Pictures announced that it was pursuing a sequel to the film, signing a deal that would see Hill and Bacall return to write a [[Film treatment|script treatment]] that would be again developed by Bacall. Hill and Tatum returned to star in the film. They were executive producers as well, alongside producer [[Neal H.

'''Acid-free paper''' is [[paper]] that if infused in water yields a neutral or [[basic (chemistry)|basic]] [[pH]] (7 or slightly greater). It can be made from any [[cellulose fiber]] as long as the active acid pulp is eliminated during processing. It is also [[lignin]]- and [[sulfur]]-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914045052/http://www.history.pcusa.org/cong/acidpaper.html|title=Untitled Document|date=14 September 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid-free paper addresses the problem of [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserving documents]] and [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|artwork]] for long periods.

== Overview ==
Paper made from wood-based pulp that has not had its [[lignin]] removed turns yellow, becomes brittle, and deteriorates over time.&lt;ref&gt;Teygeler, R. (2004). Preserving paper: Recent advances. In J. Feather. (Ed.),'' Managing preservation for libraries and archives: Current practice and future development.''  90. Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|0-7546-0705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; When exposed to light and/or heat, the molecules in the acidic paper will break down even faster.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, B.R. (2002). [http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/arnold/astm-aging-research/index.html ASTM's Paper Aging Research Program]. Retrieved November 4, 2007, [https://web.archive.org/web/20011223104404/http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byauth/arnold/astm-aging-research/ archive 2001-12-23]/&lt;/ref&gt; Acidic [[wood-pulp paper]] became commonplace in the late 19th century, and in the 1930s [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] (a chemist and librarian) published a report about the deterioration of acidic paper in the libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Cedzova, M. et al. (2006). Patents for Paper Deacidification. ''Restaurator: International Journal for the Preservation of Library and Archival Material,'' 27, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; For fear of the gradual disintegration of written materials, measures have since been taken to improve the quality of paper.

During production, acid-free paper may be treated with a mild base (usually calcium or magnesium [[bicarbonate]]) to neutralize the natural [[acid]]s occurring in [[wood pulp]], and it may also be [[buffer (chemistry)|buffered]] to prevent the formation of additional acids (as may develop from the application of [[sizing]]).

The bicarbonate is added in excess, to supply the paper with an [[alkaline]] reserve to provide protection from further attack by acids remaining in the paper or supplied by the environment (e.g. atmospheric [[sulfur dioxide]]).&lt;ref name=niso1992 /&gt; The bicarbonate during drying loses [[carbon dioxide]] and water and is converted to [[calcium carbonate]] or [[magnesium carbonate]].  In order for paper to last at least 100 years it must have an alkaline reserve of 2% or more.&lt;ref&gt;Teygeler, R. (2004). Preserving paper: Recent advances. In J. Feather. (Ed.), ''Managing preservation for libraries and archives: Current practice and future development.'' 89. Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|0-7546-0705-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, much of the commercially produced paper is acid-free,&lt;ref&gt;Dahlo, R. (2000). The Rationale of permanent Paper. In W. Manning &amp; V. Kremp (Eds.), ''IFLA Publications 91: A Reader in preservation and conservation.'' 59. Munchen: K. G. Saur. {{ISBN|3-598-21817-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but this is largely the result of a shift from kaolin clay to precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) as the main filler material in the pulp: PCC reacts with acids, and therefore requires the pulp to be chemically neutral or alkaline. The [[sizing]] additives mixed into the pulp and/or applied to the surface of the paper must also be acid-free.

Alkaline paper has a life expectancy of over 1,000 years for the best paper and 500 years for average grades.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D 3290-00, "Standard Specification for Bond and Ledger Papers for Permanent Records", section 3.2.3.2 and Appendix X1&lt;/ref&gt; The making of alkaline paper has several other advantages in addition to the preservation benefits afforded to the publications and documents printed on it. Because there are fewer corrosive chemicals used in making alkaline paper, the process is much easier on the machinery, reducing downtime and maintenance, and extending the machinery's useful life. The process is also significantly more environmentally friendly. Waste water and byproducts of the papermaking process can be recycled; energy can be saved in the drying and refining process; and alkaline paper can be more easily recycled.&lt;ref&gt;Lundeen, G.W. (1983) Preservation of paper based materials: Present and future research and
developments in the paper industry. In K.L. Henderson and W.T. Henderson (eds) ''Conserving and preserving library materials (Papers presented at the Allerton Park Institute November 15–18, 1981)'': 73-88. Retrieved from http://hdl.handle.net/2142/459

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the advances in paper making and the identification of and concern around the brittle book problem, it took decades before the adoption of [[ANSI]] [[NISO]] Standard Z39.48-1984 - ''Permanence of Paper for Publications and Documents in Libraries'' in 1984. This voluntary standard covered pH value, tear resistance, alkaline reserve, and lignin thresholds for paper to last thousands of years and was developed to encourage the use of acid-free paper in library materials.&lt;ref name=niso1992&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39-48-1992R2002.pdf|title=ANSI NISO Standard Z39.48-1992R2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the initial standard was a result of the work of the Council on Library Resources, which effectively lobbied ANSI to adopt the guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Ward Brown, J. (May 1985). The Once and Future Book: The Preservation Crisis. Wilson Library Bulletin, 59, 591-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Standards Committee II of [[NISO]] was established to expand Z39.48-1984 to develop standards for [[coated paper]], and was again called upon in 1988 to review and revise the standards for uncoated paper.

There are various standards for "acid-free" paper, with differing requirements. In some quarters, slightly-acidic paper having a pH between 6 and 7 is often also considered "acid-free".{{elucidate|date=May 2012}} Acid-free (alkaline) paper that additionally is ''uncoated'' and meets certain ''standards for folding and tearing'' is authorized by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) to carry the following notice: "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences—Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992."

The objective of ANSI Z39.48-1992 "is to establish criteria for coated and uncoated paper to last several hundred years" under optimal conditions in libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desired outcome of the standard is to reduce future preservation problems.

The scope of the standard is to cover publications and documents bought and maintained by libraries and archives. Such works include scholarly journals, periodicals, monographs, government documents, original documents, and significant works in fiction and non-fiction.

An equivalent international standard, ISO 9706, was published in 1994.&lt;ref name=iso9706&gt;Information and documentation – Paper for documents – Requirements for permanence. International Standard ISO 9706:1994, [[International Organization for Standardization]], Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers of acid-free paper can indicate the compliance of their product with the test requirements of the ISO 9706 or ANSI Z39.48-1992 standards using a circled [[infinity symbol]] (Unicode code point 267E, ♾).&lt;ref name=iso9706/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/ch01/ch01_sec035.html|title=The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition|website=The Chicago Manual of Style Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archival paper ==

'''Archival paper''' is an especially permanent, durable acid-free paper.  Archival paper is meant to be used for publications of high legal, historical, or significant value. In the USA, such paper must also be approved in accordance with the ANSI standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international standard for "permanent" paper is ISO 9706 and for "archival" paper, the standard is ISO 11108.&lt;ref&gt;Dahlo, R. (2000).  The Rationale of permanent Paper. In W. Manning &amp; V. Kremp (Eds.), ''IFLA Publications 91: A Reader in preservation and conservation.'' 58. Munchen: K. G. Saur. {{ISBN|3-598-21817-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, [[cotton paper|cotton rag]] paper is used for archival purposes, as it is not made from wood-based pulp. Thus, "archival paper" is sometimes broken down into two categories:
* '''Conservation-grade''' — acid-free, buffered paper made from wood-based pulp.
* '''Archival-grade''' (also Museum-grade) — cotton rag paper made from cotton pulp.

'''Alcatraz Island Lighthouse''' is a [[lighthouse]] – the first one built on the U.S. [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] – located on [[Alcatraz Island]] in [[California]]'s [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref name =USGS&gt;{{Cite GNIS|1809338|Alcatraz Island Lighthouse|September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the southern end of the island near the entrance to the prison.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=74|title=Alcatraz Island, CA|work=lighthousefriends.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first light house on the island was completed in 1854, and served the bay during its time as a [[Alcatraz Citadel|Citadel]] and military prison. It was replaced by a taller ({{convert|95|ft}} above mean sea level) concrete tower built in 1909 to the south of the original one which was demolished after it was damaged due to [[earthquake]] in 1906. The automation of the lighthouse with a modern [[beacon]] took place in 1963, the year Alcatraz closed as the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. It is the oldest light station on the island with a modern beacon and is part of the museum on the island.&lt;ref name =USGS/&gt;&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt;  Although when viewed from afar it easily looks the tallest structure on Alcatraz, it is actually shorter than the [[Alcatraz Water Tower]], but as it lies on higher ground it looks much taller.

==History==
[[File:Alcatraz light original2.jpg|thumb|left|Original lighthouse]]
[[File:USCGalcatraz2.JPG|thumb|left|Alcatraz Lighthouse, 1909, U.S. Coast Guard Archive]]
Even though the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Indians]] of the San Francisco area are stated to be the original settlers on the island (they collected eggs from the large flock of birds that regularly gathered there), Alcatraz got its name in 1775 only when [[Juan de Ayala]], a [[Spaniard]] was engaged to survey the harbor and the San Francisco Bay. Since he observed pelicans in large numbers on the island he named the island as "Isla de los Alcatraces" meaning the "Island of Pelicans". The island is separated from the main land by more than {{Convert|1|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=" Mcshane 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last= Mcshane|first= M.|title= Encyclopedia of American Prisons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlje5poN3IQC&amp;pg=PA34|year=1996|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=9780815313502|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gold rush]] and the inherent risk of the choppy waters of the west coast prompted the urgent need for establishing lighthouses. Congress recognized the need and passed suitable acts in the years 1851 and 1852 to build seven lighthouses on the West Coast to guide navigation.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt; The Baltimore firm of Gibbons and Kelly was awarded the contract to build seven lighthouses in California, at Alcatraz Island, [[Fort Point Light (California)|Fort Point]], [[Point Pinos Light|Point Pinos]], [[Point Loma Light (old)|Point Loma]], [[Farallon Island Light|Farallon Island]], and [[Humboldt Harbor Light|Humboldt Bay]], and one at [[Cape Disappointment Lighthouse|Cape Disappointment]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]. Equipment were shipped on Oriole, reached San Francisco on January 29, 1853. The Alcatraz Lighthouse was the first to be completed in July 1853, making it the oldest major navigational light on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. However, the foundation for building the light house had begun much before the equipment reached San Francisco.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt;

[[File:Alcatraz Island at Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|Alcatraz Light at sunset]]
In the original order placed for supply of the equipment Argand lamps and parabolic reflectors had been specified as the Fresnel lens, created by [[Augustin Fresnel]] of France in 1822 was considered very costly at that time. However, the Lighthouse Board which replaced the [[Fifth Auditor of the Treasury]]'s control, decided to install Fresnel lenses in all lighthouses considering its established better performance, even though the cost was high. The Baltimore firm was informed of this change before the equipment was shipped.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt; The shipping involved a long sea voyage of {{Convert|12000|mi|km}} from the East Coast going round the cape of [[South America]].&lt;ref name=" Jones 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last= Jones |first= Ray |title= The Lighthouse Encyclopedia: The Definitive Reference |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WQxxM-lZL4gC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=10 September 2012|year=2007|publisher= Globe Pequot |isbn=978-0-7627-4578-4|pages=34, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was lit on June 1, 1854, from a fixed, third-order Fresnel lens. In 1902, it was transferred to the [[Cape St. Elias Lighthouse]] in Alaska and replaced by a revolving fourth-order Fresnel lens, producing a white flash every five seconds.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt;

In 1909–12, the present cell house of Alcatraz was built. Since the new structure would interfere with the operation of the lighthouse, a taller {{convert|25.6|m|ft}}, concrete tower was built south of the original lighthouse. The original lighthouse had been damaged during the great [[San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and was eventually torn down. In 1963, the Alcatraz Lighthouse was automated by the [[United States Coast Guard]]. In 1970 a fire destroyed the warden's house, the keepers' quarters and other buildings on the island. The only remaining building is the tall cement tower equipped with a modern beacon. The lighthouse has been a museum since 2000 and can be visited.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt; In over 50 years, the lighthouse has not been seriously damaged despite many prison escapes, the [[Battle of Alcatraz]] and fires.&lt;ref name="Light"/&gt;

==Structural details==
[[File:Alcatraz11.JPEG|thumb|left]]
[[File:Alcatraz lighthouse in 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Alcatraz Lighthouse, 2007]]
The first lighthouse was {{convert|50|ft|m}} in height, and was based on a design that was typical of early "[[Cape Cod style]]" lighthouses, in which the light tower was an integral part of the keeper's house, and was centered atop the dwelling's roof. Construction of the foundation started in 1852, and the one-and-a-half-storied keeper's house and light were completed in 1853. The lens arrived in October 1853 and Michael Cassin lit it on June 1, 1854, thus setting a "milestone" of sorts for this lighthouse, as the first lighthouse on the [[Pacific Coast]]. The old lighthouse was damaged in the earthquake which occurred on Wednesday the April 18, 1906. A new lighthouse was built to the south east of the old one. The old lighthouse existed alongside the new structure for a while and used as a storehouse, but was eventually demolished between 1912 and 1913.&lt;ref name=" Champion Jr. 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last= Champion Jr.|first= Jerry Lewis |title= Alcatraz Unchained|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQV5wM6qj1oC&amp;pg=PA18|year=2012|publisher= AuthorHouse |isbn=9781468587531|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing lighthouse is built to a height of {{convert|84|ft|m}},&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt; {{convert|214|ft|m}} above sea level,&lt;ref name=" Champion Jr. 2012"/&gt; to the south of the original lighthouse. Its foundation is made of masonry while the octagonal pyramidal shaped tower is made of concrete. Initially, a third order Fresnel reflector was installed in 1854, and was replaced by a fourth order reflector in 1903. The foghorn bell was replaced by electronic Klaxon. Near the base of the tower was family accommodation also built to house three keepers and their families.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Light"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/weblighthouses/LHCA.asp|title= Historic Light Station Information&amp; Photography, California |work= Alcatraz Island Light|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar "Cape-cod style" lighthouses, encircling the thick light brick tower, were built at Point Loma in [[San Diego]], Point Pinos near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and also on the Southeast Farallon Island about {{convert|30|mi}} west of the San Francisco Strait.&lt;ref name="Jones 2007"/&gt; 
[[File:Alcatraz Light blueprint.jpg|thumb|left|Coastguard building blueprint]]
There was also a telephone installed, in the 1930, in the keepers quarters (moved to the hall later) known to and accessed only by the keepers. When the Federal Penitentiary was established on the island more telephones were installed and was made accessible to others also.&lt;ref name=" Champion Jr. 2012"/&gt;

The lighthouse was operated and maintained by the keepers whose responsibility included operation of fog signals found located on the northern and southern tips of the island. The prison guards facilitated the keepers to blow the fog horns as they were in advantageous position stationed on the elevated watch towers; the guards who were in position to see "a bank of fog started to roll through the Golden Gate", would inform  notify the keepers so that the fog horns could be activated.&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt;

===Navigation aids===
The leading marks which guide the ships while entering the island are the lime point which is {{convert|2.5|mi}} east and the black point which is lime {{convert|1|mi}} north. The island itself is interspersed with several buildings and military towers. The highest point of the island is where the light house is located. Northwestern and southeastern tips of the island have small buildings which housed the fog signals (the electric horns were installed in small buildings known as "mid twentieth century foghorn shacks".&lt;ref name=" Jones 2007"/&gt;). The white  light is shown by a grey tower flashes white that  lasts for 0.5 seconds and eclipses' for 4.5 seconds and forming with the Fort Point light House a range for crossing the bar for the main ship. Fog signals are electric sirens, one on the southeast end sounding two blasts of 4 seconds duration, every 30 seconds while the one on the northwest end gives a single blast every 20 seconds of 5 seconds duration.&lt;ref name="Survey1917"&gt;{{cite book|last= Survey|first= U.S. Coast and Geodetic |title= United States coast pilot: Pacific Coast. California, Oregon, and Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdhBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA91|year=1817|publisher= G.P.O.,|isbn=9781468587531|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Keepers==
The three lighthouse keepers, known as "wickies", were dressed in prescribed formal uniforms which consisted of a "navy blue hat, sack coat, vest and trousers". Decorative buttons and insignia patches adorned their uniforms. The keepers worked on an eight-hour shift with the beacon lighted all through the year; during day time the lens was covered and protected from sun rays.&lt;ref name=" Champion Jr. 2012"/&gt;

The island's lighthouse keepers included:&lt;ref name="lighthousefriends.com"/&gt;
* Michael Cassin (1853–1855)
* John Sloan (1855–1856)
* Underwhill Van Wagner (1856–1862)
* Hartford Joy (1862–1872)
* Amasa Bushnell (1872–1874)
* William W. Scott (1874–1875)
* John A. F. McFarland (1875–1878)
* John T. Huie (1878–1882)
* John A. F. McFarland (1882–1888)
* Benjamin F. Leeds (1888–1905)
* Henry W. Young (1905–1909)
* James Anderson (1909 – at least 1912)
* Frederick Arthur Harrington (1919–1938) was the keeper of both the light houses and remained as keeper till his death in 1938.&lt;ref name=" Champion Jr. 2012"/&gt;
* Harry Davis (1938 – at least 1940)
* Edward Schneider

Kurzweil was born in [[New York City]]. He was raised in [[East Meadow, New York|East Meadow]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from New College at [[Hofstra University]] in 1971 and a [[Master of Library and Information Science|Master of Library Science]] from [[Florida State University]] in 1972.

As a scholar-in-residence and guest speaker in synagogues and other [[Jew]]ish organizations in the United States, as well as through the books he has written on [[Judaism]], the [[Torah]], [[Kabbalah]], and Jewish [[Genealogy|genealogical]] research, Kurzweil's career has been focused around helping others to discover the Jewish tradition. During his 17-year tenure at Jason Aronson Publishers, he commissioned and published over 650 volumes of Jewish interest,&lt;ref name="njjn012507"/&gt; a substantial contribution to the contemporary English-language Jewish library. Kurzweil has also been editor-in-chief of the Jewish Book Club,&lt;ref name="TJW2588"/&gt; president of the Jewish Book Council, and editorial consultant for [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Jossey-Bass]].

Kurzweil's book ''From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History'' is considered to be a definitive introductory guide on the topic.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} Kurzweil has also authored two books in the [[for Dummies]] series: ''Kabbalah for Dummies'' and ''The Torah for Dummies''. His other books are ''On the Road with Rabbi Steinsaltz'', ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Genealogy'' and ''My Generations: A Course in Jewish Family History'', which is commonly used as a textbook at synagogue schools in the United States.

==Career==

===In literature===

====Author====
Kurzweil's interest in writing formed early in his childhood.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; His first article, "Today's Troubled Youth: A Teenager's View", was published at the age of 15. It first appeared in ''[[Newsday]]'' and became nationally syndicated. It was included in the weekly current events reading supplement then commonly used in public schools in the United States.&lt;ref name="newsday19680127"&gt;{{cite news 
  | last = Kurzweil
  | first = Arthur
  | work = Newsday 
  | title = Today's Troubled Youth: A Teenager's View 
  | date = 1968-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurzweil spent ten years working as a [[freelance writer]], writing articles for numerous publications including [http://www.hadassahmagazine.org ''Hadassah''], ''National Jewish Monthly'', ''[[Moment Magazine]]'' and ''L.I.'' (''Newsday'''s Sunday magazine). He also contributed articles to ''The Jewish Almanac'' (1980), ''The Jewish Family Book: A Creative Approach to Raising Kids'' (1981), the three volumes comprising ''The Jewish Catalog'' ([[Jewish Publication Society]] in 1973, 1976 and 1980, a 1960's style compilation of [[do-it-yourself]] guides covering a wide range of topics of interest for Jewish people. Kurzweil contributed to articles about building a personal Jewish library, Judaica [[philately]], and Jewish genealogy.

His interest in genealogy coincided with the release of [[Alex Haley]]'s book ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' and ''Catching the Wave'' in 1976. He wrote "Past Shock: How One Man Took a Journey Back into His Family's History", a feature article for ''L.I.''. The publication of this article initiated his career as both a professional writer and a public speaker. His weekly column, ''Finding Jewish Roots'', appeared in ''The [[Jewish Week]]'', a Jewish newspaper in New York, in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, Kurzweil wrote a cover story for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, "Hizzoner's Roots", a genealogical study of former New York City Mayor [[Ed Koch]]'s past.&lt;ref name="hizzoner"&gt;{{cite journal 
  | last = Kurzweil
  | first = Arthur
  | journal = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] 
  | title = Hizzoner's Roots 
  | date = 1979-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivated by his own confused and inconsistent treatment of New York City's numerous beggars, Kurzweil, in ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime: The Treatment of Beggars According to Jewish Tradition'', poses 16 questions reflecting his ambivalence on accommodating their seemingly relentless requests for a handout. He then demonstrates how a relative novice can do research to find meaningful answers within the framework of the Jewish tradition.&lt;ref name="tikumolam"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.usy.org/resources/publications/topubs.asp| title= Tikum Olam Publications List, United Synagogue Youth| accessdate= 2008-03-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080331044658/http://www.usy.org/resources/publications/topubs.asp| archivedate= 31 March 2008| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History'' was first published in 1980 and has since been published in a third revised edition. The book provides information on Kurzweil's own family history quest in addition to step-by-step advice on gathering information on one's family history from family members, family papers, [[Holocaust]] research, immigration and naturalization records, and online databases, among other sources. A revised and updated version of this book was published by Jossey-Bass in 2004.

After an extended period of time during which Kurzweil's efforts were focused on publishing books by other authors, Kurzweil returned to his own writing, with books such as ''On the Road with Rabbi Steinsaltz: 25 Years of Pre-Dawn Car Trips, Mind-Blowing Encounters, and Inspiring Conversations with a Man of Wisdom'' in 2006, ''Kabbalah for Dummies'' in 2007 and ''The Torah for Dummies'' in 2008.

In 2009, Jossey-Bass published ''Pebbles of Wisdom From Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz: Edited and with Notes by Arthur Kurzweil''. It includes the internationally renowned rabbi's thoughts on the big topics of life and spirituality, culled from more than thirty years Rabbi Steinsaltz's lectures, writings, interviews, and conversations.

====Editor====
Kurzweil's credits as an editor include, ''Behold a Great Image: The Contemporary Jewish Experience in Photographs'' in 1978 co-edited with Sharon Strassfeld.&lt;ref name="Behold"&gt;

===Educator===

As a speaker, teacher, and scholar-in-residence, Kurzweil's teachings have covered various topics of Jewish interest, including the [[Talmud]], Kabbalah, and genealogy. His Kabbalah courses are frequently based upon the contemporary book by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose: A Discourse on the Essence of Jewish Existence and Belief'', which he has claimed has had more influence on his life than any other book.&lt;ref name="ontheroad"&gt;{{cite book

Among the various forums at which Kurzweil has lectured and taught are Jewish educator conferences, such as the Conference for Alternatives in Jewish Education (CAJE), retreat centers, such as Elat Chayyim, The Aleph Society where he is the acting coordinator for the Talmud Circle Project, synagogues, schools, Jewish community centers, teacher conferences, and university groups, both in the United States and abroad. As a prolific lecturer and teacher, Kurzweil has been credited as "one individual who has made a major contribution to the resurgence in adult Jewish education.&lt;ref name="JESNA12"&gt;

===Genealogist===
Kurzweil co-founded the first Jewish Genealogical Society in 1977 and was co-publisher with Steven W. Siegel of ''Toledot: The Journal of Jewish Genealogy'' (1977–1982).&lt;ref name="avotaynu"&gt;{{cite book

There are now over 80 Jewish Genealogical Societies worldwide.

In 1999, Kurzweil was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies]] (IAJGS)&lt;ref name="IAJGS"&gt;{{cite web

"In deep appreciation of your trailblazing work which teaches us that learning about Jewish family history is possible, despite ages of community destruction, Diaspora and the Holocaust. We will always be grateful that you showed us the way, and for your past and continued inspiration to all Jewish genealogists and new Jewish genealogical societies that continue to be created worldwide because of your vision."

Kurzweil serves on the Honorary Advisory Board for the International Institute for Jewish Genealogy (IIJG)&lt;ref name="IIJG"&gt;{{cite web

The IIJG is committed to developing Jewish genealogy into a recognized academic discipline, within the realm of Jewish Studies and in association with a broad range of other sciences on an interdisciplinary basis.

===Magician===
Kurzweil was introduced to magic by his father who took him to a magic shop to help with a third grade school project.&lt;ref name="tricksandtractates"&gt;
{{cite news 
  | last = Lipman
  | first = Steve
  | title = Tricks and Tractates
  | publisher = [[The Jewish Week]]
  | date = 2004-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first magic trick, one that transformed a penny into a dime, was purchased for him by his father. Kurzweil belongs to the [[Society of American Magicians]] as well as the [[International Brotherhood of Magicians]]. Inspired by [[Project Magic]], an effort to encourage physical therapists to use magic tricks as part of therapy founded by magician [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], Kurzweil has spent time teaching physical therapists how to use magic tricks as a rehabilitative tool.

Although the [[Torah]] and Jewish authorities specifically prohibits "supernatural magic", tricks which rely upon sleight-of-hand and misdirection to fool the eye are permitted. Since 2004, Kurzweil has performed a Jewish-themed magic show, "Searching for God in a Magic Shop", that combines magic tricks and illusions with a spiritual message. Of his presentation, Kurzweil states,
 
{{quote|It's not a magic show at all, but a discussion of one of the most profound and important ideas in all of Jewish thought. All that God does is for the good even though we, his human audience, may not see it—because we don't see everything. The audience doesn't see everything—that's the human predicament. Accepting the notion of "gam zu l'tovah" (an idiomatic [[Aramaic]] expression taught in the Talmud meaning "Everything is for the best") has transformed my life.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;}}

The encyclopedia was originally named ''Narrative of Monarchs and Officials in the Past Dynasties'' but was later renamed to ''Yuangui'', meaning the [[Oracle bone|oracle tortoise shells]], and ''Cefu'', the imperial's storehouse of [[literature]]. The work was started in 1005 and finished in 1013 by [[Wang Qinruo]] and numerous other scholars. It was one of the four books that were divided into 1,000 volumes. It was almost twice as large as the ''[[Imperial Reader of the Taiping Era]]'' and was ranked second in the ''[[Siku Quanshu]]'' collections.  It consisted of about 9.4 million words (or [[Chinese characters]]), which included many political [[essay]]s, [[biographies]] of rulers and subjects, [[Memorandum|memorial]]s, and [[decree]]s.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

{{Technical|date=February 2018}}

In [[computer science]], '''cycle detection''' or '''cycle finding''' is the [[algorithm]]ic problem of finding a cycle in a [[sequence]] of [[iterated function]] values.

For any [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{mvar|f}} that maps a [[finite set]] {{mvar|S}} to itself, and any initial value {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} in {{mvar|S}}, the sequence of iterated function values

:&lt;math&gt; x_0,\ x_1=f(x_0),\ x_2=f(x_1),\ \dots,\ x_i=f(x_{i-1}),\ \dots&lt;/math&gt;

must eventually use the same value twice: there must be some pair of distinct indices {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} such that {{math|1=''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Once this happens, the sequence must continue [[periodic sequence|periodically]], by repeating the same sequence of values from {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Cycle detection is the problem of finding {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}}, given {{mvar|f}} and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Several algorithms for finding cycles quickly and with little memory are known. Floyd's tortoise and the hare algorithm moves two pointers at different speeds through the sequence of values until they both point to equal values. Alternatively, Brent's algorithm is based on the idea of [[exponential search]]. Both Floyd's and Brent's algorithms use only a constant number of memory cells, and take a number of function evaluations that is proportional to the distance from the start of the sequence to the first repetition. Several other algorithms trade off larger amounts of memory for fewer function evaluations.

The applications of cycle detection include testing the quality of [[pseudorandom number generator]]s and [[cryptographic hash function]]s, [[computational number theory]] algorithms, detection of [[infinite loop]]s in computer programs and periodic configurations in [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]], and the automated [[Shape analysis (software)|shape analysis]] of [[linked list]] data structures.

==Example==
[[File:Functional graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A function from and to the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and the corresponding functional graph]]
The figure shows a function {{mvar|f}} that maps the set {{math|1=''S'' = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}}} to itself. If one starts from {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 2}} and repeatedly applies {{mvar|f}}, one sees the sequence of values
:{{math|2, 0, 6, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1, ....}}
The cycle in this value sequence is {{math|6, 3, 1}}.

==Definitions==

Let {{mvar|S}} be any finite set, {{mvar|f}} be any function from {{mvar|S}} to itself, and {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be any element of {{mvar|S}}. For any {{math|''i'' &gt; 0}}, let {{math|1=''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Let {{mvar|μ}} be the smallest index such that the value {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} reappears infinitely often within the sequence of values {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and let {{mvar|λ}} (the loop length) be the smallest positive integer such that {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''λ'' + ''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The cycle detection problem is the task of finding {{mvar|λ}} and&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|μ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Algorithmic Cryptanalysis|first=Antoine|last=Joux|publisher=CRC Press|year=2009|isbn=9781420070033|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buQajqt-_iUC&amp;pg=PA223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One can view the same problem [[graph theory|graph-theoretically]], by constructing a [[functional graph]] (that is, a [[directed graph]] in which each vertex has a single outgoing edge) the vertices of which are the elements of {{mvar|S}} and the edges of which map an element to the corresponding function value, as shown in the figure. The set of vertices [[Reachability|reachable]] from  starting vertex {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} form a subgraph with a shape resembling the [[Rho (letter)|Greek letter rho]] ({{mvar|ρ}}): a path of length {{mvar|μ}} from {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to a [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] of {{mvar|λ}} vertices.&lt;ref name="j224"&gt;{{harvtxt|Joux|2009|page=224}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer representation==
Generally, {{mvar|f}} will not be specified as a table of values, the way it is shown in the figure above. Rather, a cycle detection algorithm may be given access either to the sequence of values {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, or to  a subroutine for calculating {{mvar|f}}. The task is to find {{mvar|λ}} and {{mvar|μ}} while examining as few values from the sequence or performing as few subroutine calls as possible. Typically, also, the [[space complexity]] of an algorithm for the cycle detection problem is of importance: we wish to solve the problem while using an amount of memory significantly smaller than it would take to store the entire sequence.

In some applications, and in particular in [[Pollard's rho algorithm]] for [[integer factorization]], the algorithm has much more limited access to {{mvar|S}} and to {{mvar|f}}. In Pollard's rho algorithm, for instance, {{mvar|S}} is the set of integers modulo an unknown prime factor of the number to be factorized, so even the size of {{mvar|S}} is unknown to the algorithm.
To allow cycle detection algorithms to be used with such limited knowledge, they may be designed based on the following capabilities. Initially, the algorithm is assumed to have in its memory an object representing a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] to the starting value {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At any step, it may perform one of three actions: it may copy any pointer it has to another object in memory, it may apply {{mvar|f}} and replace any of its pointers by a pointer to the next object in the sequence, or it may apply a subroutine for determining whether two of its pointers represent equal values in the sequence. The equality test action may involve some nontrivial computation: for instance, in Pollard's rho algorithm, it is implemented by testing whether the difference between two stored values has a nontrivial [[greatest common divisor]] with the number to be factored.&lt;ref name="j224"/&gt; In this context, by analogy to the [[pointer machine]] model of computation, an algorithm that only uses pointer copying, advancement within the sequence, and equality tests may be called a pointer algorithm.

==Algorithms==

If the input is given as a subroutine for calculating {{mvar|f}}, the cycle detection problem may be trivially solved using only {{math|''λ'' + ''μ''}} function applications, simply by computing the sequence of values {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and using a [[data structure]] such as a [[hash table]] to store these values and test whether each subsequent value has already been stored. However, the space complexity of this algorithm is proportional to {{math|''λ'' + ''μ''}}, unnecessarily large. Additionally, to implement this method as a pointer algorithm would require applying the equality test to each pair of values, resulting in quadratic time overall. Thus, research in this area has concentrated on two goals: using less space than this naive algorithm, and finding pointer algorithms that use fewer equality tests.

===Floyd's Tortoise and Hare===
[[File:Tortoise and hare algorithm.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Floyd's "tortoise and hare" cycle detection algorithm, applied to the sequence 2, 0, 6, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1, ...]]
'''Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm''' is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds.
It is also called the "tortoise and the hare algorithm", alluding to Aesop's fable of [[The Tortoise and the Hare]].

The algorithm is named after [[Robert W. Floyd]], who was credited with its invention by [[Donald Knuth]].&lt;ref name="knuth"&gt;{{citation|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|title=The Art of Computer Programming, vol. II: Seminumerical Algorithms|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1969|page=7, exercises 6 and 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Applied Cryptography,'' by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nSzoG72E93MC&amp;pg=PA125 p. 125], describes this algorithm and others&lt;/ref&gt; However, the algorithm does not appear in Floyd's published work, and this may be a misattribution: Floyd describes algorithms for listing all simple cycles in a [[directed graph]] in a 1967 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Floyd|first=R.W.|authorlink=Robert W. Floyd|title=Nondeterministic Algorithms|journal=J. ACM|pages=636–644|volume=14|issue=4|year=1967|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/321420.321422|doi=10.1145/321420.321422}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this paper does not describe the cycle-finding problem in functional graphs that is the subject of this article. In fact, Knuth's statement (in 1969), attributing it to Floyd, without citation, is the first known appearance in print, and it thus may be a [[Mathematical folklore|folk theorem]], not attributable to a single individual.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hash Function BLAKE,'' by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Willi Meier, Raphael C.-W. Phan, Luca Henzen (2015), [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhPmBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21], footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The key insight in the algorithm is as follows. If there is a cycle, then, for any integers {{math|''i'' ≥ ''μ''}} and {{math|''k'' ≥ 0}}, {{math|1=''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + ''kλ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{mvar|λ}} is the length of the loop to be found and {{mvar|μ}} is the index of the first element of the cycle. Based on this, it can then be shown that {{math|1=''i'' = ''kλ'' ≥ ''μ''}} for some {{math|''k''}} if and only if {{math|1=''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Thus, the algorithm only needs to check for repeated values of this special form, one twice as far from the start of the sequence as the other, to find a period {{mvar|ν}} of a repetition that is a multiple of {{mvar|λ}}.
Once {{mvar|ν}} is found, the algorithm retraces the sequence from its start to find the first repeated value {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the sequence, using the fact that {{mvar|λ}} divides {{mvar|ν}} and therefore that {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ'' + ''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Finally, once the value of {{mvar|μ}} is known it is trivial to find the length {{mvar|λ}} of the shortest repeating cycle, by searching for the first position {{math|''μ'' + ''λ''}} for which {{math|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ'' + ''λ''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The algorithm thus maintains two pointers into the given sequence, one (the tortoise) at {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, and the other (the hare) at {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At each step of the algorithm, it increases {{mvar|i}} by one, moving the tortoise one step forward and the hare two steps forward in the sequence, and then compares the sequence values at these two pointers. The smallest value of {{math|''i'' &amp;gt; 0}} for which the tortoise and hare point to equal values is the desired value {{mvar|ν}}.

The following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code shows how this idea may be implemented as an algorithm.

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def floyd(f, x0):
    # Main phase of algorithm: finding a repetition x_i = x_2i.
    # The hare moves twice as quickly as the tortoise and
    # the distance between them increases by 1 at each step.
    # Eventually they will both be inside the cycle and then,
    # at some point, the distance between them will be
    # divisible by the period λ.
    tortoise = f(x0) # f(x0) is the element/node next to x0.
    hare = f(f(x0))
    while tortoise != hare:
        tortoise = f(tortoise)
        hare = f(f(hare))
  
    # At this point the tortoise position, ν, which is also equal
    # to the distance between hare and tortoise, is divisible by
    # the period λ. So hare moving in circle one step at a time, 
    # and tortoise (reset to x0) moving towards the circle, will 
    # intersect at the beginning of the circle. Because the 
    # distance between them is constant at 2ν, a multiple of λ,
    # they will agree as soon as the tortoise reaches index μ.

    # Find the position μ of first repetition.    
    mu = 0
    tortoise = x0
    while tortoise != hare:
        tortoise = f(tortoise)
        hare = f(hare)   # Hare and tortoise move at same speed
        mu += 1
 
    # Find the length of the shortest cycle starting from x_μ
    # The hare moves one step at a time while tortoise is still.
    # lam is incremented until λ is found.
    lam = 1
    hare = f(tortoise)
    while tortoise != hare:
        hare = f(hare)
        lam += 1
 
    return lam, mu
&lt;/source&gt;

This code only accesses the sequence by storing and copying pointers, function evaluations, and equality tests; therefore, it qualifies as a pointer algorithm. The algorithm uses {{math|''O''(''λ'' + ''μ'')}} operations of these types, and {{math|''O''(1)}} storage space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Joux|2009}}, Section 7.1.1, Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, pp. 225–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brent's algorithm===

[[Richard Brent (scientist)|Richard P. Brent]] described an alternative cycle detection algorithm that, like the tortoise and hare algorithm, requires only two pointers into the sequence.&lt;ref name="brent"&gt;{{citation|first=R. P.|last=Brent|authorlink=Richard Brent (scientist)|title=An improved Monte Carlo factorization algorithm|journal=[[BIT Numerical Mathematics ]]|volume=20|year=1980|pages=176–184|url=http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/rpb051i.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF01933190|issue=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is based on a different principle: searching for the smallest [[power of two]] {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;}} that is larger than both {{mvar|λ}} and {{mvar|μ}}. For {{math|1=''i'' = 0, 1, 2, ...}}, the algorithm compares {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} with each subsequent sequence value up to the next power of two, stopping when it finds a match. It has two advantages compared to the tortoise and hare algorithm: it finds the correct length {{mvar|λ}} of the cycle directly, rather than needing to search for it in a subsequent stage, and its steps involve only one evaluation of {{mvar|f}} rather than three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Joux|2009}}, Section 7.1.2, Brent's cycle-finding algorithm, pp. 226–227.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Python code shows how this technique works in more detail.
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
def brent(f, x0):
    # main phase: search successive powers of two
    power = lam = 1
    tortoise = x0
    hare = f(x0)  # f(x0) is the element/node next to x0.
    while tortoise != hare:
        if power == lam:  # time to start a new power of two?
            tortoise = hare
            power *= 2
            lam = 0
        hare = f(hare)
        lam += 1

    # Find the position of the first repetition of length λ
    mu = 0
    tortoise = hare = x0
    for i in range(lam):
    # range(lam) produces a list with the values 0, 1, ... , lam-1
        hare = f(hare)
    # The distance between the hare and tortoise is now λ.

    # Next, the hare and tortoise move at same speed until they agree
    while tortoise != hare:
        tortoise = f(tortoise)
        hare = f(hare)
        mu += 1
 
    return lam, mu
&lt;/source&gt;

Like the tortoise and hare algorithm, this is a pointer algorithm that uses {{math|''O''(''λ'' + ''μ'')}} tests and function evaluations and {{math|''O''(1)}} storage space. 
It is not difficult to show that the number of function evaluations can never be higher than for Floyd's algorithm.
Brent claims that, on average, his cycle finding algorithm runs around 36% more quickly than Floyd's and that it speeds up the [[Pollard rho algorithm]] by around 24%. He also performs an [[average case analysis]] for a randomized version of the algorithm in which the sequence of indices traced by the slower of the two pointers is not the powers of two themselves, but rather a randomized multiple of the powers of two. Although his main intended application was in integer factorization algorithms, Brent also discusses applications in testing pseudorandom number generators.&lt;ref name="brent"/&gt;

===Gosper's algorithm===
R. W. Gosper's algorithm&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hackersdelight.org/hdcodetxt/loopdet.c.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/flows.html&lt;/ref&gt; finds the period but not the starting point of the first cycle. Its main feature is that it never backs up to reevaluate the generator function, and is economical in both space and time. For example, if it is known a priori that the generator function has a period of 2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; then 33 words is sufficient.

===Time–space tradeoffs===
A number of authors have studied techniques for cycle detection that use more memory than Floyd's and Brent's methods, but detect cycles more quickly. In general these methods store several previously-computed sequence values, and test whether each new value equals one of the previously-computed values. In order to do so quickly, they typically use a [[hash table]] or similar data structure for storing the previously-computed values, and therefore are not pointer algorithms: in particular, they usually cannot be applied to Pollard's rho algorithm. Where these methods differ is in how they determine which values to store. Following Nivasch,&lt;ref name="nivasch"&gt;{{citation|first=Gabriel|last=Nivasch|title=Cycle detection using a stack|journal=[[Information Processing Letters]]|volume=90|year=2004|pages=135–140|doi=10.1016/j.ipl.2004.01.016|issue=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; we survey these techniques briefly.

*Brent&lt;ref name="brent"/&gt; already describes variations of his technique in which the indices of saved sequence values are powers of a number {{mvar|R}} other than two. By choosing {{mvar|R}} to be a number close to one, and storing the sequence values at indices that are near a sequence of consecutive powers of {{mvar|R}}, a cycle detection algorithm can use a number of function evaluations that is within an arbitrarily small factor of the optimum {{math|''λ'' + ''μ''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Claus P.|last1=Schnorr|authorlink1=Claus P. Schnorr|first2=Hendrik W.|last2=Lenstra|authorlink2=Hendrik Lenstra|title=A Monte Carlo factoring algorithm with linear storage|journal=[[Mathematics of Computation]]|volume=43|issue=167|year=1984|pages=289–311|doi=10.2307/2007414|jstor=2007414}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teske"&gt;{{citation|first=Edlyn|last=Teske|title=A space-efficient algorithm for group structure computation|journal=[[Mathematics of Computation]]|volume=67|issue=224|year=1998|pages=1637–1663|doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-98-00968-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sedgewick, Szymanski, and Yao&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Robert|last1=Sedgewick|authorlink1=Robert Sedgewick (computer scientist)|first2=Thomas G.|last2=Szymanski|first3=Andrew C.-C.|last3=Yao|authorlink3=Andrew Yao|title=The complexity of finding cycles in periodic functions|journal=[[SIAM Journal on Computing]]|volume=11|issue=2|year=1982|pages=376–390|doi=10.1137/0211030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  provide a method that uses {{mvar|M}} memory cells and requires in the worst case only &lt;math&gt;(\lambda+\mu)(1+cM^{-1/2})&lt;/math&gt; function evaluations, for some constant {{mvar|c}}, which they show to be optimal. The technique involves maintaining a numerical parameter {{mvar|d}}, storing in a table only those positions in the sequence that are multiples of {{mvar|d}}, and clearing the table and doubling {{mvar|d}} whenever too many values have been stored.
*Several authors have described ''distinguished point'' methods that store function values in a table based on a criterion involving the values, rather than (as in the method of Sedgewick et al.) based on their positions. For instance, values equal to zero modulo some value {{mvar|d}} might be stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Paul C.|last1=van Oorschot|first2=Michael J.|last2=Wiener|title=Parallel collision search with cryptanalytic applications|journal=[[Journal of Cryptology]]|volume=12|issue=1|year=1999|pages=1–28|doi=10.1007/PL00003816}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qd"&gt;{{citation|first1=J.-J.|last1=Quisquater|first2=J.-P.|last2=Delescaille|contribution=How easy is collision search?

P. Woodruff with the suggestion of storing a random sample of previously seen values, making an appropriate random choice at each step so that the sample remains random.
*Nivasch&lt;ref name="nivasch"/&gt; describes an algorithm that does not use a fixed amount of memory, but for which the expected amount of memory used (under the assumption that the input function is random) is logarithmic in the sequence length. An item is stored in the memory table, with this technique, when no later item has a smaller value. As Nivasch shows, the items with this technique can be maintained using a [[Stack (data structure)|stack data structure]], and each successive sequence value need be compared only to the top of the stack. The algorithm terminates when the repeated sequence element with smallest value is found. Running the same algorithm with multiple stacks, using random permutations of the values to reorder the values within each stack, allows a time–space tradeoff similar to the previous algorithms. However, even the version of this algorithm with a single stack is not a pointer algorithm, due to the comparisons needed to determine which of two values is smaller.

Any cycle detection algorithm that stores at most {{mvar|M}} values from the input sequence must perform at least &lt;math&gt;(\lambda+\mu)(1+\frac{1}{M-1})&lt;/math&gt; function evaluations.&lt;ref name="fich"&gt;{{citation|first=Faith Ellen|last=Fich|authorlink=Faith Ellen|contribution=Lower bounds for the cycle detection problem|title=Proc. 13th ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]]|year=1981|doi=10.1145/800076.802462|pages=96–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Eric W.|last1=Allender|authorlink1=Eric Allender|first2=Maria M.|last2=Klawe|authorlink2=Maria Klawe|title=Improved lower bounds for the cycle detection problem|journal=[[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|Theoretical Computer Science]]|volume=36|issue=2–3|pages=231–237|year=1985|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(85)90044-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Cycle detection has been used in many applications.
*Determining the cycle length of a [[pseudorandom number generator]] is one measure of its strength. This is the application cited by Knuth in describing Floyd's method.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt; Brent&lt;ref name="brent"/&gt; describes the results of testing a [[linear congruential generator]] in this fashion; its period turned out to be significantly smaller than advertised. For more complex generators, the sequence of values in which the cycle is to be found may not represent the output of the generator, but rather its internal state.
*Several [[Number theory|number-theoretic]] algorithms are based on cycle detection, including [[Pollard's rho algorithm]] for integer factorization&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=J. M.|last=Pollard|title=A Monte Carlo method for factorization|journal=BIT|volume=15|year=1975|pages=331–334|doi=10.1007/BF01933667|issue=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his related [[Pollard's kangaroo algorithm|kangaroo algorithm]] for the [[discrete logarithm]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=J. M.|last=Pollard|title=Monte Carlo methods for index computation {{math|(mod ''p''}})|journal=[[Mathematics of Computation]]|volume=32|issue=143|year=1978|pages=918–924|doi=10.2307/2006496|publisher=American Mathematical Society|jstor=2006496}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] applications, the ability to find two distinct values ''x''&lt;sub&gt;μ&amp;minus;-1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;λ+μ&amp;minus;-1&lt;/sub&gt; mapped by some cryptographic function ƒ to the same value ''x''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; may indicate a weakness in ƒ. For instance, Quisquater and Delescaille&lt;ref name="qd"/&gt; apply cycle detection algorithms in the search for a message and a pair of [[Data Encryption Standard]] keys that map that message to the same encrypted value; [[Burt Kaliski|Kaliski]], [[Ron Rivest|Rivest]], and [[Alan Sherman|Sherman]]&lt;ref name="krs"&gt;{{citation|first1=Burton S., Jr.|last1=Kaliski|first2=Ronald L.|last2=Rivest|authorlink2=Ron Rivest|first3=Alan T.|last3=Sherman|title=Is the Data Encryption Standard a group? (Results of cycling experiments on DES)|journal=[[Journal of Cryptology]]|volume=1|issue=1|year=1988|pages=3–36|doi=10.1007/BF00206323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also use cycle detection algorithms to attack DES. The technique may also be used to find a [[hash collision|collision]] in a [[cryptographic hash function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Joux|2009}}, Section 7.5, Collisions in hash functions, pp. 242–245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cycle detection may be helpful as a way of discovering [[infinite loop]]s in certain types of [[computer program]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Allen|last=Van Gelder|title=Efficient loop detection in Prolog using the tortoise-and-hare technique|journal=Journal of Logic Programming|volume=4|issue=1|pages=23–31|year=1987|doi=10.1016/0743-1066(87)90020-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Oscillator (cellular automaton)|Periodic configurations]] in [[cellular automaton]] simulations may be found by applying cycle detection algorithms to the sequence of automaton states.&lt;ref name="nivasch"/&gt;
*[[Shape analysis (software)|Shape analysis]] of [[linked list]] data structures is a technique for verifying the correctness of an algorithm using those structures. If a node in the list incorrectly points to an earlier node in the same list, the structure will form a cycle that can be detected by these algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Mikhail|last1=Auguston|first2=Miu Har|last2=Hon|contribution=Assertions for Dynamic Shape Analysis of List Data Structures|pages=37–42|title=AADEBUG '97, Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Automatic Debugging|series=Linköping Electronic Articles in Computer and Information Science|publisher=[[Linköping University]]|url=http://www.ep.liu.se/ea/cis/1997/009/04/|year=1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Common Lisp]], the [[S-expression]] printer, under control of the &lt;code&gt;*print-circle*&lt;/code&gt; variable, detects circular list structure and prints it compactly.
*Teske&lt;ref name="teske"/&gt; describes applications in [[computational group theory]]: determining the structure of an [[Abelian group]] from a set of its generators. The cryptographic algorithms of Kaliski et al.&lt;ref name="krs"/&gt; may also be viewed as attempting to infer the structure of an unknown group.
*{{harvtxt|Fich|1981}} briefly mentions an application to [[computer simulation]] of [[celestial mechanics]], which she attributes to [[William Kahan]]. In this application, cycle detection in the [[phase space]] of an orbital system may be used to determine whether the system is periodic to within the accuracy of the simulation.&lt;ref name="fich"/&gt;

The '''European Association of Directory and Database Publishers''', known as '''EADP''', was founded in 1966.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11186">The '''Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art''' is located on the fourth floor of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[New York City]], United States. 

==History==
The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art opened on March 23, 2007 at the Brooklyn Museum as the first public space of its kind in the country; it is a nexus for feminist art, theory, and activism. The {{convert|8300|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center, located on the museum's fourth floor, aims to create a compelling and interactive environment to raise awareness and educate future generations about [[feminism]]’s impact on culture.

Since 2007 the Center has been the permanent home of [[Judy Chicago]]'s landmark feminist work ''[[The Dinner Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/arts/19iht-raafemina-28463.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Dana | last=Micucci | title=Feminist art gets place of pride in Brooklyn | date=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kort|first=Michele|title=Home at Last|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2007/homeatlast.asp|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=[[Ms. Magazine]]|date=Winter 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's Forum is a venue for public programs and a platform of advocacy for women’s issues, and its Feminist Art and Herstory galleries present critically acclaimed [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/exhibitions/index.php exhibitions]. The Council for Feminist Art, a membership group, supports the ongoing educational programming and the continuing success of the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The Center's namesake and founder, [[Elizabeth Sackler|Elizabeth A. Sackler]], is a [[philanthropist]] and [[art collector]].

==Layout==
''The Dinner Party''{{’}}s gallery is the centerpiece of a dramatic design for the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art that was conceived and developed by award-winning architect [http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/susan_rodriguez.php Susan T. Rodriguez], FAIA, a partner in [[Ennead Architects]]. ''The Dinner Party'', which includes 39 placesettings as well as the names of 999 women on a ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]]'', is enclosed in large, canting glass walls that provide a first glimpse of Chicago’s work. It is surrounded by a series of distinct, yet interconnected series of galleries that include two changing exhibition galleries and a study center that can be transformed from an academic forum into a multimedia gallery, as required, by a large pivoting wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallery Design|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/about/gallery_design.php|website=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: About the Center|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Art Base==
An original initiative from the Center for Feminist Art is its “Feminist Art Base.”&lt;ref name="fab" /&gt; This database is a self-generated selection of past and present artists, whose work reflect feminist ideas, investments, and concerns, such as [[Karen Heagle]], [[Julia Kunin]] and Clarity Haynes.  The database is actively added to with artists from the around the world, who continue to build their profiles. Each profile includes short biographies, CVs, and exemplary works as well as a “Feminist Art Statement.” This personal and living database wishes to be a comprehensive resource for achieving the Center’s mission: “''to present feminism in an approachable and relevant manner, to educate new generations about the meaning of feminist art, and to raise awareness of feminism's cultural contributions.''”&lt;ref name="fab"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/index.php | title=Feminist Art Base| publisher=Brooklyn Museum| accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Awards==
In March 2012 The Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art celebrated its fifth anniversary by honoring fifteen contemporary women with the Sackler Center First Awards. The awards, conceived by Elizabeth Sackler, are given each year to women who have broken a gender barrier to make a remarkable achievement and contribution in her respective field.

The '''Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database''' ('''FAOSTAT''') website disseminates [[Statistics|statistical data]] collected and maintained by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO). FAOSTAT data are provided as a [[Time series|time-series]] from 1961 in most domains for 245 countries in English, Spanish and French.

==About FAOSTAT==
FAOSTAT is maintained by the Statistics Division of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]]. In working directly with the countries, the Statistics Division supports the development of national statistical strategies, the strengthening of [[institutional|Institution]] and technical capacities, and the improvement of statistical systems.

The FAOSTAT system is one of FAO’s most important corporate systems. It is a major component of FAO’s [[information systems]], contributing to the organization’s strategic objective of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating information relating to [[nutrition]], [[food]] and [[agriculture]] for development and the fight against global hunger and malnutrition. It is at the core of the World Agricultural Information Centre (WAICENT). WAICENT gives access to FAO’s vast store of information on agricultural and food topics – statistical data, documents, books, images, and maps.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==FAOSTAT Domains==
*'''Production''' The Agricultural Production domain covers: Produced quantities, producer prices, value at [[Farm gate value|farmgate]], harvested area, yield per [[hectare]].
*'''Trade''' The Agriculture Trade domain provides comprehensive, comparable, and up-to-date annual trade statistics by country, region and economic country groups for about 600 individual food and agriculture commodities since 1961. The detailed food and agriculture trade data collected, processed and disseminated by FAO according to the standard International Merchandise Trade Statistics Methodology (IMTS) are directly submitted by the national authorities to FAO or received via international or regional partner organizations. Data for missing reporters are estimated manly through the use of the data reported by the trading partners. The total merchandise trade value by country is annually updated according to the national publications on Balance of Payment and trade statistics and harmonised with the consolidated figures disseminated by the WTO-Common Data Set (CDS) on Total Merchandise Trade Statistics by countries.
*'''Food Security''' Food supply data is some of the most important data in FAOSTAT. In fact, this data is for the basis for estimation of global and national [[malnutrition|undernourishment]] assessment, when it is combined with parameters and other data sets. This data has been the foundation of [[Food Balance Sheet]]s ever since they were first constructed. The data is accessed by both business and governments for [[Economic impact analysis|economic analysis]] and policy setting, as well as being used by the academic community.
*'''Agri-Environmental Indicators''' Agri-environmental indicators (AEI) are indicators able to describe and assess state and trends in the environmental performance of agriculture to furnish useful indications to [[scientist]]s and [[Politician|policymakers]] about the state of the environment, about the effects of different policies, as well as about the efficiency in the use of budgets in terms of environmental outcomes.
*'''Food Balance Sheet''' A food balance sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's [[food supply]] during a specified reference period. Food balance sheets are prepared for both individual countries and regional/economic country aggregates. The domain covers production, trade, [[fodder|feed]] and [[seed]], waste, other utilisation, and food availability.
*'''Prices''' The prices domain of FAOSTAT contains: annual and monthly producer prices, annual [[producer price index]], and [[consumer price index]].
*'''Resources''' Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain. The national distribution of land, among [[arable land]], [[pastures|pasture]] and other lands, as well as the importance of [[irrigation]] are just some of the interesting data sets.
*'''Emissions''' FAOSTAT data on [[Greenhouse gas|Greenhouse Gas]] (GHG) emissions by countries are provided within the FAOSTAT Emissions database [1,2,3], covering nearly 200 countries. GHG emissions are estimated in agreement with the default methodologies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories [2].  The FAOSTAT Emissions data directly contributed to the IPCC 5th Assessment Report [3]. The GHG data are updated automatically at annual intervals. They are accessible in FAOSTAT via two separate domains: Emissions-Agriculture and Emissions-Land Use.
*'''Emissions-Agriculture''' This FAOSTAT data domain contains estimates of GHG emissions for nearly 200 countries, for the reference period 1961–present [1,2,3], following default (Tier 1) IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories [4]. Emissions from agriculture comprise methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases released through microbial fixation and decomposition processes in crop fields and livestock systems, in the following sub-categories:
** Enteric Fermentation 
** Manure Management
** Rice Cultivation 
** Synthetic Fertilizers
** Manure applied to Soils
** Manure left on Pasture 
** Crop Residues
** Cultivation of Organic Soils
** Burning - Crop Residues
** Burning – Savanna
** Energy Use in Agriculture

The FAOSTAT data contributed to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report [5].

*'''Emissions-Land Use''' This FAOSTAT data domain contains estimates of GHG emissions for nearly 200 countries, for the reference period 1990-2010 [1, 2, 3], following default (Tier 1) IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories [4]. The GHG data include emissions by sources and removals by sinks from Forestry and Other Land Use activities (FOLU), also referred to as Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). Except for Biomass Burning, containing only non-CO2 emissions from anthropogenic fires, FOLU emissions and removals are dominated by CO2 lost or stored as a result of human intervention on the following four IPCC land use categories:
** Forest Land (net forest conversion, forest)
** Cropland (cropland organic soils)
** Grassland (grassland organic soils)
** Biomass Burning (biomass and peat fires)
Emissions and removals are calculated both within land categories (e.g. due to management) and for conversion between land categories (e.g. due to human-driven land use change). Data contribute to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report [5].
*'''Investment''' In the FAOSTAT investment domain, data can be found on [[Capital Stock|stock]], external assistance to agriculture, [[Machinery|machine (mechanical)]], and [[government spending]].
*'''Forestry''' FAOSTAT–Forestry provides annual production and trade estimates for numerous [[forest products]], primarily wood products such as roundwood, sawnwood, wood panels, pulp and paper. For many forest products, historical data are available from 1961. The forestry domain covers: forestry production and forestry trade flows

Data contained in FAOSTAT are also published in the FAO Statistical Yearbook in hard copy and online.

'''Frampton v McCully''' [1976] 1 NZLR 270 is a New Zealand case cited regarding whether a contract that is subject to one parties solicitor's approval and whether such approval can be with held for non conveyancing matters.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
McCully entered in a conditional sale agreement with Moir for a trust property, with the condition being subject to the approval of the trust's solicitor (and trustee) Mr Frampton. The approval was not limited to just conveyancing matters. Mr Frampton subsequently refused to give approval for the sale, for non conveyancing reasons.
McCully claimed that solicitors approval was only allowed to be with held for conveyancy matters.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal ruled that as the sales agreement was clearly a conditional offer, and as that condition was never met, there was no legally binding contract between the parties.

The '''Frans Hals Museum''' is a museum located in [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]]. 

The museum was established in 1862. In 1950, the museum was split in two locations when the collection of modern art was moved to the ''[[Frans Hals Museum - Hal|Museum De Hallen]]'' (since 2018 called ''Hal)''. The main collection, including its famous 17th-century [[Frans Hals]] paintings, for which the museum is named, is located in the former ''[[Oude Mannenhuis]]'' on the Groot Heiligland.

The museum was founded in 1862 in the newly renovated former Dominican church cloisters located in the back of the [[City Hall (Haarlem)|Haarlem city hall]] known as the ''Prinsenhof'', and when it needed more space, it moved to the recently vacated location of the town orphanage in 1913.  The collection is based on the large number of paintings owned by the City of Haarlem, which includes over 100 artworks seized from Catholic churches in the 1580s after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and Haarlem art rescued from demolished local buildings from the 15th century onwards.

In 2018 the museum re-merged with ''Museum De Hallen'' to form a single museum called the Frans Hals Museum with two locations: ''Hof'' (located on Groot Heiligland) and ''[[Frans Hals Museum - Hal|Hal]]'' (located on Grote Markt)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/news/a-marriage-made-in-art-heaven/|title=A marriage made in art heaven - Frans Hals Museum|work=Frans Hals Museum|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History of the Old Men's Almshouse ==

[[Image:Frans Hals - De regentessen van het oudemannenhuis.jpg|thumb|left|Group portrait of the [[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]], by Frans Hals, 1664]]
The Haarlem ''Oude Mannenhuis'' was a [[hofje]] founded in 1609. The residential rooms were situated around a courtyard in the style of contemporary [[Hofjes in Haarlem|Haarlem Hofjes]]. Each of the thirty little houses was inhabited by two men; to be eligible to living there they had to be at least 60 years old, honest Haarlem residents, and single. They were required to bring their own household goods listed as a bed, a chair with a cushion, a tin chamberpot, three blankets, six good shirts and six nightcaps. They were locked in each night at eight o'clock in the summer and at seven in the winter. The residents had to make a weekly collection with a poor-box, and a statue of a man holding this can be seen in the entrance hall of the museum. The old men's home was governed by five regents, whose portraits, painted by Frans Hals in 1664, are on display.

Though the men's home dates from 1609, only the main hall is still mostly intact. During the intervening centuries the complex was renovated beyond recognition, most notably by the previous inhabitants, the Haarlem municipal orphanage which made use of the complex from 1810 until 1908, when it moved to the [[Coen Cuserhof]]. During the French occupation, the old men still living in the hofje were moved a block away to the present-day [[Proveniershuis]], when the art collections of the two institutions were merged. The art of both locations, as well as the art of several other former Haarlem institutions, is now in the Frans Hals museum collection. The most notable artworks from the Oude Mannenhuis are the two group portraits of regents and regentesses by Frans Hals. The inventory of the Proveniershuis was drawn up by [[Pieter Langendijk]] and though some of the paintings have since been reattributed, his list is largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1mV6p35NufEC&amp;pg=PA352 Collections of Paintings in Haarlem, 1572-1745] by [[Pieter Biesboer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The impressive regents' rooms have been rebuilt from other Haarlem locations. A room on the street side has a curious keystone above the door with masonic symbols denoting a mason's society and the text 'Metsselaars Proef-Kamer 1648 12/29'.

== History of the collection ==
[[File:Frans Hals 014.jpg|thumb|right|The military group portraits by Hals were almost black until they were first cleaned in the early 20th century under the guidance of [[Gerrit David Gratama]]. The [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633|Festive banquet of the Officers of the St. Hadrian Nightwatch of Haarlem]] by Frans Hals in 1633 had lost its landscape view to layers of varnish.]]
[[Image:Capturing Damiate.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Coat of arms of Haarlem|Capture of '''Damietta''' by Haarlem crusaders]] according to the legend of the Haarlem shield. Painting by Cornelis Claesz van Wieringen (ca. 1580-1633), son of a Haarlem ship captain, friend of [[Hendrick Goltzius]] and [[Cornelis van Haarlem]], and designer of the tapestry of the same subject that still hangs in the Haarlem city hall today]]

The older pieces of the museum collection, consisting of primarily religious themes, are Haarlem relics from the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], when all Roman Catholic art was formally seized by the city council in 1648. Frans Hals himself worked as the first official city-paid restorer for some of these pieces. The city council then proceeded in the 17th century to rewrite Haarlem history, and purchased various large pieces to decorate the city hall, telling stories such as the [[Siege of Damietta (1218)|legend of Damiate]], or the legend of the Haarlem Shield. During this time the city hall functioned as a semi-public museum, though the term didn't even exist yet. The first signs of an official museum with a curator occurred when the [[Dutch Society of Science]], founded in 1752, started to rent the Prinsenhof room of the city hall in 1754 for its meetings and began to furnish it as an [[Cabinet of curiosities]]. From an inventory list in the city archives it can be seen that they used as a model for their system of naming and presentation, the book ''Amboinsche Rariteitkamer'' by [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]]. They shared the room with the [[Synod]] of the [[Dutch Reformed]] Church, that used it once every six years for its meetings. They hired a woman for the dusting and serving tea, and in 1768 they hired a man as curator, who was responsible for the entire collection and the medical ''Hortus'' garden in the yard.&lt;ref name="maatschappij"&gt;{{nl icon}} [[Johannes Abraham Bierens de Haan]], De geschiedenis van een verdwenen Haarlemsch museum van natuurlijke historie. Het Kabinet van Naturalien van de Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen 1759-1866. Haarlem, F. Bohn, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacious room soon proved too small for the number of donated artifacts it received from its members, thanks to the increase in shipping and associated travel. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, Haarlem became a bedroom community of Amsterdam, with many wealthy bankers becoming members of the young Society. The old paintings became just a colorful backdrop for chests filled with stuffed animals and prepared specimens. In 1777 the Society moved its overflowing collection to a renovated house on the Grote Houtstraat, where the new young curator [[Martin van Marum]] would live the rest of his life. This building, situated next to the [[Doopsgezinde kerk, Haarlem|Mennonite]] church, was mortgaged with the Mennonite banker [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], who was not a member of the Society, but who created his own arts society and whose later testament would be the basis for the [[Teylers Museum]], where van Marum would also become curator.

This move essentially split the collection, and the ''natural history half'' is currently in the collection of the [[Teylers Museum]]. Though the paintings and the garden remained back at city hall, 40 years after [[Carl Linnaeus]] had published his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' no one was interested in the garden (which was set up as a living version of that book), and still fewer people were interested in the religious art. The city hall was seen as a depot of large pieces of historical importance, and the next large group of paintings to join the collection occurred when [[Napoleon]] disbanded the guilds in the Netherlands in 1794. The guilds' property reverted to the state. This is how the larger pieces that Hals painted for the guilds came into the collection. Without an official curator, the painting collection was only available to be seen by appointment with the city clerk, a situation that has remained up to the present day for the large pieces still located there, such as the whalebone from [[Willem Barentsz]] trip to [[Novaya Zemlya|Nova Zembla]] or the portrait of [[Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer]].

===Collection as of 1862===
[[File:Office of Haarlem mayor.JPG|thumb|The mayor's room at city hall. These paintings have not been cleaned, because they are not officially in the collection of the Frans Hals Museum]]
In the mid-19th century the back cloisters were given an extra floor for additional showing space, and it was at this time that the museum opened its doors to the public via a separate entrance than the main city hall entrance. This was also the first time that all the group portraits could be shown hanging near each other. No works of modern art were bought at that time, and the decision to form the museum was to cater to the visitors of other Haarlem museums. At the time, modern art could be seen at the nearby [[Teylers Eerste Schilderijenzaal]] in [[Teylers Museum]], and also in the gallery of the ''Museum voor Levende Nederlandsche Meesters'', otherwise known as the ''Haarlemsche Paviljoen'', a museum that was open from 1838 until 1885 in the former home of [[Henry Hope]] he called [[Villa Welgelegen]]. The art critic [[Victor de Stuers]] was very angry about Haarlem being the location of such museums, as there was no artistic climate there to speak of.&lt;ref name=Stuers&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_gid001187301_01/_gid001187301_01_0060.php Commentary in "De Gids" number 37], by Victor de Stuers, 1873&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the collection at the Paviljoen for lacking works by contemporary painters such as "Israëls, Bosboom, Bles, Bisschop, van de Sande Bakhuijzen, Bakker Korff, and Alma Tadema", and though works by these painters were already on view at Teylers at the time, the Frans Hals museum collection only has a few paintings by the first two in their collection today. Stuers also felt it was a scandal that the city fathers in charge of the municipal museum made no effort to stop the sale of a [[:File:Possibly after Frans Hals 001.jpg|portrait of Willem van Heythuijzen]] to the Brussels museum in 1872.&lt;ref name=Stuers/&gt;

Thus this antiquated collection is the one that was transferred to the Groot Heiligland in 1913, and large pieces that were not in the cloisters at that time, such as the painting by [[Dirck Ferreris]] installed in the mayor's room, remained at city hall. A few of these were formally given to the museum in 1962, such as [[The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627]] and [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630]]. In 1962 when the museum celebrated its 100-year anniversary as a municipal collection, the collection had already been split again into a modern and a classical one, with the modern art housed in a new wing on the north side of the complex. Today the modern art is displayed in the [[Verweyhal]]. The museum celebrated its 100-year anniversary on the Groot Heiligland in 2013 with a Frans Hals exhibition that included reproductions being placed around the city in original locations.

== Collection on display ==
[[File:WLANL - mickeymousestudio - 28003-Maarten van Heemskerck-Ecce homo.jpg|thumb|The largest paintings are the religious works by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and others]]

Aside from several works by Hals and other artworks originally from the collections of many former guilds, monasteries and churches of Haarlem, the collection of over 750 works also includes objects relating to Haarlem that have been acquired by local donations and purchases. The museum is specialized in restoration and research on the works of Haarlem painters in the 17th century and of the painters of the 16th century who taught them to paint, most notably Jan van Scorel, Maerten van Heemskerck, Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem. In the late 19th century the museum became something of a pilgrimage site for young impressionists, who were fascinated by the loose brushwork visible in the two group portraits of regents by Hals that he painted when he was in his eighties. This is the reason that after the move to the present location in 1913, the museum took on the name of Frans Hals as these were considered the most prominent paintings of the collection at the time. The museum is still famous for group portraits by Hals, but since the [[Haarlem schutterij|group portraits from the military guilds]] were cleaned in the early 20th century, it is these which most visitors come to see today. Most of the objects and paintings can not be displayed for lack of space, and the museum rotates its collection through exhibitions at various locations in Haarlem, though works by some prominent painters cannot be lent out and remain in storage.

===Installed art from other Haarlem locations===
[[File:Oudemannenhuis thans Frans Hals Museum 2012-09-22 19-24-22.jpg|thumb|A window overlooking the courtyard in the museum]]

Several stately rooms saved from torn-down Haarlem houses have been partially reconstructed and a collection of Haarlem silver saved from various local churches can be seen in the former regent rooms of the almshouse, which now seem much grander than they were originally. The windows have been decorated with art by anonymous Haarlem glass artists, most of which has been acquired through municipal demolitions work. Spread along the corridors are beautiful Dutch tiles from local salvage operations that have been installed along the walls, accompanied by 17th century furniture including clocks, chairs, and chests.

The museum as an institution is only responsible for its collection, which is mostly oil paintings. Other applied art that has been installed is the responsibility of the municipal culture department, and the museum rents the premises from them. This is the reason that visitors are offered much more information about the paintings than about other aspects of the building, including the objects in the courtyard.

[[File:Cornelis Engelsz - Old man grateful for alms.jpg|thumb|right|''Old man grateful for alms'' - this piece represents the sculpture above the entranceway to the "Oude Mannenhuis", and probably was painted around the time the building was opened in 1604. Painted by Haarlem painter [[Cornelis Engelsz]].]]

Between 1605 and 1635 over 100,000 paintings were produced in Haarlem.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Museum exhibition in 2008 "Haarlem, The Cradle of the Golden Age"&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of these have survived, and most have left town, but this does say something about the artistic climate in the city. At that time art ownership in the city was 25%, a record high. More art has survived up to today from that period in Haarlem than from any other Dutch city, thanks mostly to the ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' published by [[Karel van Mander]] there in 1604. The former curator [[Pieter Biesboer]] has created inventories of Haarlem art and worked on several catalogues for the museum, mostly based on the works created before 1800.

'''''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music''''' is an academic reference work. It was initiated by editors at [[Garland Publishing]] in 1988 as a 10-volume series of encyclopedias of world music. The final volumes appeared in 2001, but editions have since been updated. It is widely regarded as an authoritative academic source for [[ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;J.E.

'''Gore District Council v Power Co Ltd''' [1997] 1 NZLR 537 is a cited case in New Zealand that confirms that a contract can be for an indefinite term, as well as confirming that a contract does not become frustrated simply due to it being a bad bargain.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 1927, the [[Gore, New Zealand|Gore Borough Council]] transferred its local power supply assets to the Southland Electric Power Board (later to become Power Co), in return for Power Co supplying all the council's electricity for 1 penny a unit "for all time hereafter."

With no mechanism for increasing the price to allow for inflation, etc., this contract subsequently became somewhat onerous for Power Co, as by 1994 the unit price of electricity had increased by 770%. On top of that, the council's power usage had also increased by 840%.

Faced with an annual loss of $188,000 in supplying the council's electricity under the contract, in 1995 Power Co gave the council 15 months' notice of termination of the contract, citing that the ability to terminate the contract was implied, and failing that, that the contract was frustrated due the change of circumstances that has occurred since 1927, including  the substantial inflation.

==Decision==
The court ruled that a contract for an indefinite term whilst may be rare, is not forbidden under contract law. The court also denied the contract was frustrated as contracts are not frustrated just because they turn out to be bad bargains.

{{about|the botanist|his son, the linguist|Henry Allan Gleason (linguist)}}

'''Henry Allan Gleason''' (1882–1975) was an American [[ecology|ecologist]], [[botany|botanist]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]], known for his endorsement of the individualistic or open community concept of [[ecological succession]], and his opposition to [[Frederic Clements]]'s concept of the [[Climax community|climax]] state of an [[ecosystem]]. His ideas were largely dismissed during his working life, leading him to move into plant taxonomy, but found favour late in the twentieth century.

== Life and work ==
Gleason was born in [[Dalton City, Illinois]], and after undergraduate and master's work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] earned a PhD from [[Columbia University]] in Biology in 1906. He held faculty positions at the University of Illinois, the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[University of Michigan]], before returning to the East Coast, to the [[New York Botanical Garden]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where he remained for the rest of his career, until 1950.

In Gleason's early [[ecology|ecological]] research on the [[vegetation]] of [[Illinois]], around 1909-1912, he worked largely within the theoretical structure endorsed by [[ecology|ecologist]] [[Frederic Clements]], whose work on [[ecological succession|succession]] was the most influential during the first decades of the twentieth century. Building on [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry C. Cowles]]'s landmark research at the [[Indiana Dunes]] and some of the ideas of his mentor [[Charles Bessey]] at the [[University of Nebraska]], Clements had developed a theory of plant succession in which vegetation could be explained by reference to an ideal sequence of development called a [[sere (ecology)|sere]]. Clements sometimes compared the development of seres to the growth of individual [[organism]]s, and suggested that under the right circumstances, seres would culminate in the best [[adaptation|adapted]] form of vegetation, which he called the [[Climax community|climax]] state. In his early research, Gleason interpreted the vegetation of Illinois using Clementsian concepts like [[association (ecology)|associations]], climax states, [[pioneer plant|pioneer]] species, and dominant species.

However, in 1918, Gleason began to express significant doubts on the usefulness of some of Clements's widely employed vocabulary, especially the use of the organism [[metaphor]] to describe the growth of vegetation, and the treatment of the units of vegetation as including climaxes. (What units should be used in the analysis of vegetation was a widely disputed issue in early twentieth-century ecology.) In 1926, Gleason expressed even stronger objections to Clements's theory. First, he argued that Clements's identification of particular [[natural kind|kinds]] of vegetation assumed too much [[wiktionary:Homogeneity|homogeneity]], since areas of vegetation are actually similar to one another only to degrees. Second, he argued that Clements's associating particular vegetation types with particular areas underestimated the real diversity of vegetation. These objections together cast doubt, for Gleason, on the "integrity of the [[association (ecology)|association]] concept" itself—on identifying any grouping of species as amounting to a nameable association, like "oak-maple association," as botanists and ecologists (including Gleason himself) normally had.

As an alternative to describing vegetation in terms of [[association (ecology)|associations]], Gleason offered "the Individualistic concept of ecology," in which "the phenomena of vegetation depend completely upon the phenomena of the individual" species (1917), and plant associations are less structured than he thought Clements's theory maintained. At times, Gleason suggested that the distribution of plants approaches mathematical [[randomness]].

Clements never responded in print to Gleason's objections and alternative models, and they were largely ignored until the 1950s, when research by a number of ecologists (particularly [[Robert Whittaker]] and [[John T. Curtis]]) supported Gleasonian models. Subsequently, 'species-individualistic' models have become prevalent in community ecology.

Frustration due to dismissal of his ecological ideas without serious consideration may have contributed to Gleason's general abandonment of ecology. From the 1930s onward, he shifted the focus of his work to plant taxonomy, where he became an influential figure, working for many years at the New York Botanical garden, and authoring with [[Arthur Cronquist]] one of the authoritative floras of northeastern North America.

Gleason married Eleanor Theodolinda  Mattei, the daughter of Swiss-American winemaker [[Andrew Mattei]]; they met on a steamship, where Gleason was on a botanical expedition, while Mattei was taking a grand tour of the world following her graduation from [[Mills College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Gleason |first1=Jean Berko |authorlink=Jean Berko Gleason |title=A life well lived |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=56 |issue=10 |date=November 2009 |pages=1266–1267 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200910/rtx091001236p.pdf#page=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their elder son, [[Henry Allan Gleason Jr]] (1917–2007), was a [[Linguistics|linguist]] and Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Toronto]]. Their second son, [[Andrew Gleason]], (1921–2008), was a mathematician and Professor Emeritus at [[Harvard University]].

The '''Hermitage-Vyborg Center''' is an external branch of the [[Saint Petersburg]] based [[Hermitage Museum]] in the [[Russia]]n town of [[Vyborg]]. The museum was opened in 2010. Hermitage-Vyborg Center is located in the 1930 completed '''Vyborg Art Museum and Drawing School''' building, which was designed by the [[Finland|Finnish]] architect [[Uno Ullberg]].

== History ==
Vyborg Art Museum and Drawing School was built in 1929–1930 as the town was a part of [[Finland]]. The [[Classical architecture|classicism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] style building is located on the top of the 16th-century Panzerlachs Bastion, which was one of the fortifications of the [[Vyborg town wall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in-arch.net/Viipuri/funk1.html VIIPURI ART MUSEUM AND DRAWING SCHOOL] In-Arch. Retrieved 3 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Alvar Aalto]]'s famous [[Vyborg Library]], it is another remarkable piece of Finnish-era [[modern architecture]] in Vyborg.

The Vyborg Art Museum and Drawing School were founded by the 1890 established Vyborg Art Society ({{lang-fi|Viipurin taideyhdistys}}). The museum had a large collection of Finnish and European art as well as works of various Russian masters. Vyborg was the second largest city in Finland and the Vyborg Art Museum was considered as the country's second most significant art museum, next to [[Ateneum]] in [[Helsinki]]. It was severely damaged during [[World War II]] and the collections were relocated to several Finnish art museums. After the war was over, Vyborg became a part of [[Soviet Union]] and the building was renovated for administrative use.

The latest renovations took place in the early 2000s. A children's art school was opened in 2003 and the Hermitage-Vyborg Center project was launched in November 2007. The branch museum was finally opened in June 2010.

== History ==
The cats were present in the museum, originally a palace, since the 18th century;&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers/&gt; in 1745, [[Elizabeth of Russia]] ordered cats to be placed in the palace in order to control the mice.&lt;ref name=McGrane&gt;McGrane, Sally.

Retrieved on July 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; James Rodgers of the [[BBC]] stated that the belief is that the cats originated from [[Kazan]], a city known for having cats good at catching mice. The cats remained in St. Petersburg except during [[World War II]],&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers/&gt; when the existing cat population was killed. A new group of cats replaced the previous cats since the rat population had increased.&lt;ref name=Marquardt/&gt;

In the late 1990s,&lt;!--About 15 years before 2012 is 1997--&gt; Khaltunen began a programme to care for the cats, which previously lived in poor conditions.&lt;ref name=McGrane/&gt; As of 2007, the museum began adopting cats needing homes.&lt;ref name=BBCRodgers/&gt;  

In 2011, the museum began a "Catfest", a celebration of its cat population. "Catfest" has included cat painting contests and scavenger hunts for children.&lt;ref name=McGrane/&gt;

Beginning in 2015, because of the number of visiting tourists, a website has been set up by the museum for people who may be interested in adopting a cat. “It is an honor to adopt a Hermitage cat,” one potential cat owner was told.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2015/11/hermitage-museum-also-serves-as-cat-rescue-adoption-center/|title=Russia’s Hermitage Museum Is Filled With Cats|date=17 November 2015|publisher=''[[The Daily Observer]]''|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immigration consultant''' is a person who helps people to [[Emigration|emigrate]] from one country to another country and through legal and documentation process to increase the chances of immigration for study, work, travel or business purpose. Immigration consultants are legal experts and have knowledge about immigration laws and visa laws and about the procedure of getting different types of [[Travel visa|visa]].

In the United States, immigration consultants/[[notaries]] do not have formal immigration law training, and they are not allowed to answer even the most basic legal questions that every immigrant has when applying for an immigration benefit. Doing so would constitute the [[unauthorized practice of law]], which is a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/general/immigration_consultants |title=Immigration Consultants &amp;#124; State of California - Department of Justice - Office of the Attorney General |website=Oag.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many organizations including the [[Central America Resource Center]] recommend that all persons seeking immigration assistance completely avoid notaries and immigration consultants and, instead, seek legal advice from a licensed attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carecen-la.org/why_should_i_pay_a_notary_or_an_immigration_consultant_if_the_law_permits_him_her_to_do_practically_nothing_for_me |title=Why should I pay a notary or an immigration consultant if the law permits him/her to do practically nothing for me? - Central American Resource Center (CARECEN) |website=Carecen-la.org |date= |accessdate=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many governments have authorized bodies that provide licence to deserving immigration consultants who are thoroughly up-to-date about the visa and immigration rules of their country. Canada provides the certification through [[Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council]], and Australia provides it through [[Migration Agents Registration Authority]].

==Origins==
Immigration consultants started working in the 1960s when a large number of qualified people have started migrating from Asia and Latin America to U.S.A., Canada and Europe. Generally these developed countries have requirement of highly skilled professionals and so they have very strict and complicated rules for immigration and visa processing. To help aid people who need clarity regarding the visa and immigration rules of various countries, this concept of immigration consultancies has come forward.

'''Jabal al-Druze''' ({{lang-ar|جبل الدروز}}, {{lang-fr|Djebel Druze}}) was an autonomous state in the [[French Mandate of Syria]] from 1921 to 1936, designed to function as a government for the local [[Druze]] population under French oversight.

}}
On March 4, 1922, it was proclaimed as the '''State of Souaida''', after the capital [[As-Suwayda]], but in 1927 it was renamed '''Jabal al-Druze''' or '''Jabal Druze State'''. The name comes from the [[Jabal al-Druze]] mountain.

== History ==
[[File:Druzeindependance1925.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Druze celebrating their independence in 1925.]]
{{Druze|History}}
The Druze state was formed on May 1, 1921, in former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territory, while other statelets were installed in other parts of the Syrian mandate (e.g. the [[Alawite State]] in the [[Lattakia]] region). Jabal al-Druze was home to about 50,000 Druze. It was the first, and remains the only, autonomous entity to be populated and governed by Druze. The 1925 [[Great Syrian Revolt|Syrian Revolution]] began in Jabal al-Druze under the leadership of [[Sultan al-Atrash]], and quickly spread to [[Damascus]] and other non-Druze areas outside the [[Jabal al-Druze]] region. Protests against the division of Syrian territory into statelets were a main theme of Syrian [[colonialism|anti-colonial]] nationalism, which eventually won the victory to reunite the entire French-mandated territory, except [[Lebanon]] (which had become independent) and [[Alexandretta]], which was annexed to Turkey as the [[Hatay Province]].

As a result of [[Syrian nationalist]] pressure, under the [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence (1936)|Franco-Syrian Treaty]] of 1936, Jabal al-Druze ceased to exist as an autonomous entity and was incorporated into [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]].

García Gabaldón, S. Navarro and C. Valcárcel, dir. by P. Aullón de Haro, in Madrid, Verbum (Col. Verbum Mayor), 1997-2002, 6 vols.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholar==
He was considered an extraordinarily intellectual figure in the Europe of his time,&lt;ref&gt;P. Aullón de Haro, ''La Escuela Universalista Española del siglo XVIII'', Madrid, Sequitur, 2016; P. Aullón de Haro and J. García Gabaldón (eds.), ''Juan Andrés y la Escuela Universalista Española'', Madrid, Ediciones Complutense, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; but was ignored for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This was for several reasons, as much
circumstantial as general interest. Andrés trained in the former University of Gandia, was a Professor of [[Rhetoric]], and a young Jesuit forced into exile in Italy 1767. He first settled in [[Ferrara]], and then the Marquis of Bianchi welcomed him to his palace in [[Mantua]]. Here, he enjoyed life with the Marquis's family, until the arrival of Napoleon, more than twenty years of happy and productive stay that allowed him to complete the major part of his work. In England it was studied and followed mostly by Henry Hallam.&lt;ref&gt;See Davide Mombelli, "La recepción de la obra de Andrés en el siglo XIX: Henry Hallam y la Historia comparada de la literatura europea", in Biblioteca Humanismoeuropa: [https://indd.adobe.com/view/7e49950a-937d-4442-8306-566a80c9059a ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==
Andrés is also the author of, among many other titles, ''Family Letters, (Tour of Italy)'' (Madrid and Valencia, 1786–1800),&lt;ref&gt;Ed. by I. Arbillaga and C. Valcárcel, dir. by P. Aullón de Haro, in Madrid, Verbum (Col. Verbum Mayor), 2004, 2. vols.&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish-language work is one of the most important of its kind and a major European piece, mainly composed of a literary-scientific and especially bibliographic journey. The thoughts of Andrés, settled in the late neoclassical Age of Enlightenment responds with a strong Spanish-Italian tradition not only identifiable with the big fellow Jesuits, victims of expulsion, most prominently [[Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro|Lorenzo Hervas]], builder of [[comparative linguistics]], and the great music theorist Antonio Eximeno together with whom were seen as the nucleus of the eighteenth century ''School of Spanish Universalists'', but further amplified the line represented by Ignacio de Luzan, [[Ludovico Antonio Muratori]] and the great pioneer and genius [[Giambattista Vico]]. Andrés, with his sight almost gone at the end of his life, spent his final professional occupation in charge of the Royal Library of Naples, to finally die in Rome in the protection of his religious congregation. The first and most important volume (given the main feelings of the sense of self and the critical nature of the new edition) of his major work was republished in Madrid in 1997, it was completed in 2002.

The '''Kall-Rasmussen Fragment''' is a [[parchment]] page from [[Circa|c.]] 1275. It is one of the four fragments remaining, or early copy of, the original [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s [[Gesta Danorum]]. Its size is about 19x11cm. It consists of two pages with four written sides.

==History==
Found in 1855 by ''M. N. C. Kall Rasmussen'' in the Danish [[Danish National Archives|Geheime-archive]] (Danish National Archives), where it was used as staple-list on [[Kronborg]] Castles [[cadastre]] of 1627-1628. It is now owned by the [[Danish Royal Library|Royal Library]] of [[Copenhagen]]. It has the Royal Library signature of ''Ny kgl. Saml. Fol. 570''.

Correspond to page 320-324 in [[Peter Erasmus Müller]] Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1839 or page 181.17 – 184.16 in [[Jørgen Olrik]] &amp; H. Ræder's Latin version of ''Gesta Danorum'' from 1931.

Most '''countries of the world''' have '''different names''' in different languages. Some countries have also undergone name changes for political or other reasons. This article attempts to give all known alternative names for all nations, countries and sovereign states. It does not offer any opinion about what the "original", "real", or "correct" name of any country is or was.

Countries are listed alphabetically by their '''current best-known name in English'''. Each English name is followed by its currently best-known equivalents in other languages, listed in English alphabetical order (ignoring accents) by name and by language. Historical and/or alternative versions, where included, are noted as such. Foreign names that are the same as their English equivalents are listed, to provide an answer to the question "What is that name in..."?. See also: [[List of alternative country names]]

Entries are formatted as follows: languages written in the Latin alphabet use "'''Name''' (language)" [for example, "'''Afeganistão''' (Portuguese)"] and are alphabetized in the list according to English rules of alphabetical order. Languages written in other [[writing system]]s use "'''Romanization''' - native script (language)" [for example, "'''English''' - אַרגענטינע (Yiddish)"] and are alphabetized in the list by the romanized form.

For reasons of size, this article is broken into four parts:
*'''List of country names in various languages (A–C)'''
*[[List of country names in various languages (D–I)]]
*[[List of country names in various languages (J–P)]]
*[[List of country names in various languages (Q–Z)]]

[[File:Lorscher Bienensegen (Detail).tif | thumb|Detail (rotated)]]

The '''Lorsch Bee Blessing''' (German: ''Lorscher Bienensegen'') is a [[apiary|bee-keeping]] prayer intended to bring home [[Western honey bee|honey bee]]s in good health to their hives. It is believed to have been written in the 9th century, and was discovered in a manuscript (on fol. 58r of the ''Pal. lat. 220'' in the [[Vatican Library]], a copy of the [[Apocalypse of Paul]]) from the monastery in [[Lorsch]], Germany, famous for the [[Lorsch Codex]]. Despite being a Christian prayer written in [[Old High German]], it has remarkable similarities to the [[Anglo-Saxon]] and apparently pagan "[[For a Swarm of Bees]]" (Old English "''wiþ ymbe''") magic charm, and may reflect a common pre-Christian Germanic cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=GRENDON209&gt;Grendon (1909:209)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==

===Old High German===
:''Kirst, imbi ist hûcze''
:''Nû fliuc dû, vihu mînaz, hera''
:''Fridu frôno in munt godes''
:''gisunt heim zi comonne''

:''Sizi, sizi bîna''
:''Inbôt dir sancte Maria''
:''Hurolob ni habe dû''
:''Zi holce ni flûc dû''

:''Noh dû mir nindrinnês''
:''Noh dû mir nintuuinnêst''
:''Sizi vilu stillo''
:''Uuirki godes uuillon''

===Translation===
:Christ, the bee swarm is out here!
:Now fly, you my animals, come.
:In the Lord's peace, in God's protection,
:come home in good health.

:Sit, sit bees.
:The command to you from the Holy Mary.
:You have no vacation;
:Don't fly into the woods;

:Neither should you slip away from me.
:Nor escape from me.
:Sit completely still.
:Do God's will.

Manta rays have unique spot patterning on their undersides, which allows for individual identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=A.D.|last2=Dudgeon|first2=C.L.|last3=Bennett|first3=M.B.|title=Size and structure of a photographically identified population of manta rays Manta alfredi in southern Mozambique|journal=Marine Biology|date=2011|volume=158|issue=5|pages=1111–1124|doi=10.1007/s00227-011-1634-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00227-011-1634-6#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scuba diving|Scuba divers]] around the world can photograph mantas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographing Mantas|url=http://www.mantamatcher.org/photographing.jsp|website=mantamatcher.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upload their manta identification photographs to the Manta Matcher website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Participate: Report an Encounter|url=http://mantamatcher.org/submit.jsp|website=mantamatcher.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting global research and conservation efforts.

Manta Matcher is a pattern matching software that eases researcher workload; key spot pattern features are extracted using a [[scale-invariant feature transform]] (SIFT) algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Town|first1=Christopher|last2=Marshall|first2=Andrea|last3=Nutthaporn|first3=Sebastien|title=Manta Matcher: automated photographic identification of manta rays using keypoint features|journal=Ecology and Evolution|date=2013|volume=3|issue=7|pages=1902–1914|doi=10.1002/ECE3.587|pmid=23919138|pmc=3728933}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can cope with complications presented by highly variable spot patterns and low contrast photographs.

This [[citizen science]] tool is free to use by researchers worldwide. Manta Matcher represents the first{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} global initiative to centralize manta ray sightings and facilitate research on these vulnerable species through collaborative studies, including the cross-referencing of regional databases.

Manta Matcher has already supported research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Germanov|first1=Elitza|last2=Marshall|first2=Andrea|title=Running the Gauntlet: regional movement patterns of Manta alfredi through a complex of parks and fisheries|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2014|volume=9|issue=10|page=e110071|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0110071|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0110071|pmid=25337865|pmc=4206290}}&lt;/ref&gt; that contributed to the listing of [[Manta alfredi|reef mantas]] (''Manta alfredi'') on Appendix 1 of the [[Convention on Migratory Species]] in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=31 Species of Migratory Animals Given UN Protection|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/31-species-of-migratory-animals-given-un-protection-20141110-11js7y.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Medea''''' is a 1904 [[steam yacht]] preserved in the [[Maritime Museum of San Diego]], United States. Named after [[Medea]], the wife of [[Jason]], she was built on the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] at [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] shipyard at [[Linthouse]] by John Stephen for William Macalister Hall of Torrisdale Castle, [[Scotland]].

During [[World War I]], the [[French Navy]] purchased ''Medea'' and armed her with a 75mm cannon for use in convoy escort duty. (Her name under the French flag was ''Corneille''.) Between the wars, she was owned by members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. During [[World War II]], the [[Royal Navy]] put her to work anchoring [[barrage balloon]]s at the mouth of the [[Thames]].

After World War II, ''Medea'' passed among Norwegian, British, and Swedish owners before being purchased by Paul Whittier in 1971. Whittier restored the yacht to its original condition and donated her to the Maritime Museum of San Diego in 1973.

''Medea'' was featured in the "[[List of Dirty Jobs episodes#ep44 (53)|Steam Ship Cleaner]]" episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[Dirty Jobs]]'', when [[Mike Rowe (television host)|Mike Rowe]] cleaned the inside of the boilers of the yacht.

The '''''Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla''''' ({{lang-pt|Minimanual do Guerrilheiro Urbano}}) is a book written by Brazilian guerrilla fighter [[Carlos Marighella]] in 1969. It consists of advice on how to disrupt and overthrow an authoritarian regime, aiming at revolution. The text has been banned in many countries, but remains in print and on bookshelves in several others, including the United States.

{{quotation|It is necessary for every urban guerrilla to keep in mind always that he can only maintain his existence if he is disposed to kill the police and those dedicated to repression, and if he is determined to expropriate the wealth of the big capitalists, the latifundists and the imperialists.}}

The ''minimanual'' was written to be short and concise. It describes ways and strategies for a successful revolution, like the Cuban and Chinese ones.

Published four years after the 1965 rise of the [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian dictatorship]] and just one year after the worldwide 1968 [[Protests of 1968|student rebellions]], and at a time where hopes for international revolution among left-wing militants and intellectuals were at their highest, the ''minimanual'' became an important tool and reference point for many [[Maoism|Maoist]], [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] and revolutionary socialist activists and guerrillas, and was also studied extensively by national liberation movements and organizations such as the [[PLO]] and the [[Sandinistas]].

The '''Nordic Institute of Dental Materials AS '''('''NIOM AS''') is the Nordic Cooperative Body for dental biomaterials. The Institute’s activities in research, materials testing, standardisation and research-based consulting are directed towards dental health services and health authorities in the Nordic countries. The Institute is owned jointly by UniRand (a wholly owned subsidiary of the University of Oslo) and the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services. Activities are financed by the [[Nordic Council]] of Ministers and the Nordic ministries for health services. Materials testing and consulting services also generate income.
As a joint Nordic resource center, NIOM collaborates with dental schools and research institutions and provides services to government health authorities, dental professionals, and the public in the Nordic countries in the field of dental biomaterials.

==History==
NIOM was established in 1972, as a joint Nordic institute located close to Ullevaal Stadium in [[Oslo]]. A programme for testing and certification of dental biomaterials on the Nordic market was established, and the first lists of certified materials were published in 1974. Products were tested every year, and the Nordic health authorities required, or strongly recommended, that dentists used NIOM certified products. In 1992, the laboratory obtained official accreditation for testing dental [[biomaterial]]s. These testing and certification activities continued until 1998 when the European [[Medical device]]s [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] came into force, introducing a new, joint European regulatory scheme for the certification ([[CE mark|CE marking]]) of medical and dental biomaterials and devices. 
[[File:Light setting dental material.jpg|thumb|right|Light curing of a dental filling material to be tested]]
Today, the Institute maintains its competency in the [[Accreditation|accredited]] testing of dental biomaterials, and promotes this activity with manufacturers and regulatory bodies. 
Before 2004, had the responsibility as a [[Notified Body]] for the use of the [[CE mark]] on dental products. 
The provision of an accredited laboratory service to industry, health authorities and other parties remains one of NIOM's core activities.

On January 1 2010 NIOM’s status changed from a Nordic Institute to a Nordic Co-operative Body. This means that ownership of NIOM is transferred from the [[Nordic Council]] of Ministers to UniRand a.s. (an arm of the University of Oslo) and the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services to create a proprietary company, Nordic Institute of Dental Materials (NIOM). NIOM continues the work   with the same staff and professional services.

==Research==
[[File:Bonding denture teeth.jpg|thumb|right|Testing of bonding strength of denture teeth]]
Research is a major part of the portfolio of work at NIOM. The institute collaborates with universities and research centres in dentistry, medicine and materials science in the Nordic countries and worldwide. Research underpins both standardization activities and the information and recommendations provided to health authorities, the dental profession and the public. Projects include material characterization and properties, [[biocompatibility]] and clinical performance.

==Services for dental professionals==
NIOM provides evidence- and research-based information on dental [[biomaterial]]s and [[medical device]]s to dental personnel, health authorities and to the public. This is promulgated through articles in the Nordic dental journals, journals for dental technicians, KDM-reports (Kunskapscenter för Dentala Material) and a continuous updating of the NIOM website. There is ongoing work on a register of dental products ("DMN" - Dentala Material Norden).
NIOM also provides on-line services, E-mail and telephone, related to dental biomaterials.

==Testing and consulting services==

NIOM carries out testing according to relevant product standards and according to selected methods as requested by the client. TNIOM offers consulting services in questions related to dental biomaterials. Consultancies cover questions related to properties, performance, safety and development of dental biomaterials.

==Standardization== 
[[File:Agar overlay test.jpg|thumb|right|Biologic evaluation of orthodontic wires by agar overlay using epithelial cells]]
NIOM has for many years contributed to standardization at an international level both through the International organization for Standardization - [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and within Europe through the [[European Committee for Standardization|Comité Européen de Normalisation]] (CEN). Development of new [[Technical standard|standards]] and revision of existing standards have been the main focus. Standards in dentistry set requirements for the properties of dental materials and dental instrumentation, and prescribe procedures for the testing of dental materials. Participation in standardization work for dental products and for [[biocompatibility]] in general allows NIOM to have an influence on test methods and requirements for dental products. NIOM has had, and still has, a major impact on the selection of methodology and requirements of the dental product standards, and the requirements are often based on results from research activities at NIOM.

International standardization is organized in different Technical Committees (TC), each dealing with a specific field of interest. Each committee is again divided into smaller subcommittees and working groups devoted to different topics of the field. Scientists from the institute are technical experts and conveners of working groups within the following technical committees: ISO/TC 106 Dentistry; ISO/TC 194 Biocompatibility of medical devices; CEN/TC 55 Dentistry, and CEN/TC 206 Biocompatibility of medical and dental materials and devices. [[Standards Norway]] (SN) is the national member body in the European and International standardization organizations.

[[Image:14 2 List of Radzivill Chron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Tale of Bygone Years'' in [[Radziwiłł Chronicle]]]]

The '''''Tale of Bygone Years''''' ({{lang-orv|Повѣсть времѧньныхъ лѣтъ}}, ''Pověstĭ Vremęnĭnyhŭ Lětŭ'') known in English-language historiography as the '''''Primary Chronicle''''' is a history of [[Kievan Rus']] from about 850 to 1110, originally compiled in [[Kiev]] about 1113.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=/pages/p/o/povisthdavremennykhlitit.htm|title=The Tale of Bygone Years– Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is considered to be a fundamental source in the interpretation of the history of the [[Eastern Slavs]].

==Three editions==
===First===
[[File:The_Historian_Nestor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Historian Nestor by [[Leo Mol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uartlib.org/downloads/VitrajiLeoMol_uartlib.org.pdf|title= Mol, Leo }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Tradition long regarded the original compilation as the work of a monk named [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] (c. 1056 – c. 1114); hence scholars spoke of ''Nestor's Chronicle'' or of ''Nestor's manuscript''. His compilation has not survived. Nestor's many sources included
* the earlier but now lost Slavonic chronicles
* the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] annals of [[John Malalas]], a Greek chronicler, who in 563 produced an 18 book work of intertwined myth and truth
* the Byzantine annals of [[George Hamartolus]], a monk, who tried to adhere strictly to truth, and whose works are the unique contemporary source for the period 813–842&lt;!-- 
          It appears to me that the period i have removed, and the following repetitious phrase that i have merely suppressed from display, were occasioned simply by an editor who correctly saw that 6 phrases made too long a list but for whatever reason didn't resort to a bullet list. If it's i who is the ignorant fool, don't hesitate to revert me, including restoring the following suject, adverb, and verb!

Sources of ''Nestor's Chronicle'' also included --&gt;
* [[bylina|byliny&lt;!-- plural of bylina --&gt;]],&lt;ref name=Primary&gt;Cross, Samuel Hazzard; Sherbowitz-Wetzor, Olgerd P. (translators &amp; editors) ''The Russian Primary Chronicle, Laurentian Text''. The Mediaeval Academy of America, Cambridge, Maschusetts, 1930 &amp; 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}  which were traditional East Slavic oral epic narrative poems
* [[Norse saga]]s&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt;{{rp|43}}
* several Greek religious texts
* [[Rus'–Byzantine Treaty (disambiguation)|Rus'–Byzantine treaties]]
* oral accounts of [[Yan Vyshatich]] and of other military leaders. 
Nestor worked at the court of [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev]] (ruled 1093–1113), and probably shared Sviatopolk's pro-Scandinavian policies.

The early part of the ''Chronicle'' features many anecdotal stories, among them 
* those of the arrival of the three [[Varangian]] [[Sineus and Truvor|brothers]],
* the founding of [[Kiev]]
* the murder of [[Askold and Dir]], ca. 882
* the death of [[Oleg of Kiev|Oleg]] in 912, the "cause" of which was reported foreseen by him
* the thorough vengeance taken by [[Olga of Kiev|Olga]], the wife of [[Igor of Kiev|Igor]], on the [[Drevlians]], who had murdered her husband;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbs, Joanna.  ''Mother Russia, The Feminine Myth in Russian Culture''.  Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1988, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;  (Her actions secured [[Kievan Rus']] from the Drevlians, preventing her from having to marry a Drevlian prince, and allowing her to act as regent until her young son came of age.)

The account of the labors of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] among the [[Slavic peoples]] also makes a very interesting tale, and to Nestor we owe the story of the summary way in which [[Vladimir the Great]] (ruled 980 to 1015) suppressed the worship of [[Perun]] and other traditional gods at Kiev.&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt;{{rp|116}}

===Second===
In the year 1116, Nestor's text was extensively edited by the [[hegumen]] [[Sylvestr of Kiev|Sylvester]] who appended his name at the end of the chronicle. As [[Vladimir Monomakh]] was the patron of the village of [[Vydubychi]] (now a neighborhood of Kiev) where Sylvester's monastery was situated, the new edition glorified Vladimir and made him the central figure of later narrative.&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt;{{rp|17}} This second version of Nestor's work is preserved in the Laurentian codex (see below).

===Third===
A third edition followed two years later and centered on the person of Vladimir's son and heir, [[Mstislav the Great]]. The author of this revision could have been Greek, for he corrected and updated much data on Byzantine affairs. This latest revision of Nestor's work is preserved in the Hypatian codex (see below).

==Two manuscripts==
Because the original of the chronicle as well as the earliest known copies are lost, it is difficult to establish the original content of the chronicle. The two main sources for the chronicle's text as it is known presently are the Laurentian Codex and the Hypatian Codex.

The [[Laurentian Codex]] was compiled in what are today Russian lands by the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhegorod]] monk Laurentius for the Prince [[Dmitry Konstantinovich]] in 1377. The original text he used was a codex (since lost) compiled for the Grand Duke [[Mikhail of Tver]] in 1305. The account continues until 1305, but the years 898–922, 1263–83 and 1288–94 are missing for reasons unknown. The manuscript was acquired by the famous [[Aleksei Musin-Pushkin|Count Musin-Pushkin]] in 1792 and subsequently presented to the [[National Library of Russia]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

The [[Hypatian Codex]] dates to the 15th century. It was written in what are today Ukrainian lands and incorporates much information from the lost 12th-century Kievan and 13th-century [[Halych]]ian chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CC%5CH%5CChronicles.htm|title=Chronicles– Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The language of this work is the East Slavic version of [[Church Slavonic language]] with many additional irregular east-slavisms (like other east-Slavic codices of the time). Whereas the Laurentian (Muscovite) text traces the Kievan legacy through to the Muscovite princes, the Hypatian text traces the Kievan legacy through the rulers of the [[Halych]] principality. The Hypatian codex was rediscovered in Kiev in the 1620s, and a copy was made for Prince Kostiantyn Ostrozhsky&lt;!--No-one after 1608 in Russian Wiki--&gt;. A copy was found in Russia in the 18th century at the [[Ipatiev Monastery]] of [[Kostroma]] by the Russian historian Nikolai Karamzin.

Numerous monographs and published versions of the chronicle have been made, the earliest known being in 1767. [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]] published a pioneering [[textology|textological]] analysis of the narrative in 1908. [[Dmitry Likhachev]] and other Soviet scholars partly revisited his findings. Their versions attempted to reconstruct the pre-Nestorian chronicle, compiled at the court of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] in the mid-11th century.

==Assessment==
Unlike many other medieval chronicles written by European monks, the ''Tale of Bygone Years'' is unique as the only written testimony on the earliest history of East Slavic people.&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt;{{rp|23}}  Its comprehensive account of the history of [[Kievan Rus|Rus']] is unmatched in other sources, although important correctives are provided by the [[Novgorod First Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Aleksandr Zenkovsky|Zenkovsky, Serge A.]]: ''Medieval Russia’s epics, chronicles, and tales.''  A Meridian Book, Penguin Books, New York, 1963, page 77&lt;/ref&gt; It is also valuable as a prime example of the [[Old East Slavic language#Old East Slavic Literature|Old East Slavonic literature]].&lt;ref name=Primary/&gt;{{rp|3}}

'''''R v Motomane''''',&lt;ref&gt;1961 (4) SA 569 (W).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African criminal law, heard on February 3, 1961, with significance especially for the question of the ''novus actus interveniens''.

== Facts ==
The accused, charged with murder, had knifed a woman, thereby injuring a vein. The bleeding stopped, but a clot formed. The woman would probably have recovered in the ordinary course, but this course was interrupted when a medical practitioner decided to operate: a prudent decision but not a necessary one. The clot was disturbed during the operation; the woman haemorrhaged and bled to death.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the burden of proof was upon the accused to show, on the probabilities, that there was an interruption of the causal chain. The court held that the causal chain had been broken, and that the Crown had failed to prove that the accused was responsible for the death of the deceased. The accused was convicted instead of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

== Criticism ==
The influential academic CR Snyman disapproves of this judgment, preferring that in ''[[S v Mabole]]''.&lt;ref&gt;1968 (4) SA 811 (R).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baby Riots of 1888''' took place in the summer of 1888 in [[Korean Empire|Joseon Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;Neff, Robert D. ''Korea Through Western Eyes''. Seoul: SNU Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours circulated that foreigners in Seoul were kidnapping young Korean infants and children, gouging out their eyes for use as camera lenses, grinding their internal organs for use in medicine, and eating them. These rumours implicated both the western powers that were present in Korea at the time, as well as the Japanese. These riots saw Koreans gathering outside hospitals, schools and churches run by foreigners to rail against the 'baby-snatchers' inside. Many in the foreign community were alarmed by the ferocity of the riots and made preparations to leave Korea, and diplomatic representatives of the foreign legations pressed the Joseon government to repudiate the rumours, which they did reluctantly.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Kirk W. ''Traditions, Treaties and Trade''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While it was initially speculated that the [[Heungseon Daewongun]] instigated the incident in a manner similar to the [[Imo Incident]], or the combination of Catholic zeal and local anti-Christian sentiment, many began to speculate that these rumours were deliberately spread by the order of [[Yuan Shikai]], the ambassador and representative of the suzerain [[Qing dynasty]] in China, either to scare off foreign investment in Korea or provoke a military intervention. For his part, Yuan emphatically denied this to his superior, [[Li Hongzhang]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, p. 171-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Brave Little Tailor'''" or "'''The Valiant Little Tailor'''" or "'''The Gallant Tailor"''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Das tapfere Schneiderlein'') is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], tale number 20.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Household Tales'',"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm020.html The Brave Little Tailor]"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Jacobs]] collected another variant "A Dozen at One Blow" in ''European Folk and Fairy Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''European Folk and Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/jacobs/european/dozenblow.html "A Dozen at One Blow" ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Blue Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/295.htm "The Brave Little Tailor"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another of many versions of the tale appears in ''[[A Book of Giants]]'' by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]].

In the [[Aarne–Thompson–Uther system]] of [[classifying folktales]], it is type 1640,&lt;ref name="Heiner" /&gt; with elements of several other story types.&lt;ref name="Ashliman" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
A [[tailor]] is preparing to eat some [[jam]], but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading "Seven at One Blow". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a [[giant]] who assumes that "Seven at One Blow" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a "rock" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.

Impressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.

The tailor enters the royal service, but the other [[soldier]]s are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the [[king]] that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabbed the heart of the giants.

The king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a [[unicorn]], another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a [[wild boar]], but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.

Duly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the kings servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says "Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm020.html&lt;/ref&gt; Terrified, the kings servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right.

==Characterization==
* Tailor – this character is clever, intelligent, and confident. He uses [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] and other cunning to trick other characters. For example, various forms of [[psychological manipulation]] to influence the behavior of others, such as turning the pair of giants against each other, and playing on the assassins' and the earlier giants' assumptions and fears.  Similarly, he uses [[decoy]] tactics to lure the [[quest]] animals (unicorn, boar) into his traps, and to avoid being killed in the first giant's bed.  This reliance on trickery and manipulation by the [[protagonist]] is a feature of the stock character of the [[antihero]].
* King – this character is very mistrusting and judgmental, who uses the promise of half the kingdom to persuade the protagonist to take on seemingly deadly tasks. The king is one-dimensional as a character, and is essentially a [[plot device]], the source of challenges for the protagonist to overcome to achieve the desired goal.
* Princess – the prize for completing all these challenges is the hand in marriage of the princess, and along with it, half the kingdom. She sets great store by the social class of royal birthright, so when she finds out that the man she has married is no more than a poor tailor, she is furious, and tries to have him killed. Her self-absorbed vindictiveness, and its easy defeat, is consistent with the stock character of the [[Shrew (stock character)|shrewish bride]].

==Motifs and themes==
In the [[Aarne–Thompson–Uther]] system of [[Classifying folktales|folktale classification]], the core of the story is [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] type 1640,&lt;ref name="Heiner"&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, "[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/bravetailor/other.html Tales Similar to the Brave Little Tailor]"&lt;/ref&gt; named The Brave Tailor for this story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The ATU System |work=AT Types of Folktales |first=Tormod |last=Kinnes |date=2009 |url= http://oaks.nvg.org/folktale-types.html |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It also include episodes of type 1060, Squeezing Water from a Stone; type 1062, A Contest in Throwing Stones; type 1052, A Contest in Carrying a Tree; type 1051, Springing with a Bent Tree; and type 1115, Attempting to Kill the Hero in His Bed.&lt;ref name="Ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimmtales.html The Grimm Brothers' Children's and Household Tales]"&lt;/ref&gt;

The story features several more general [[Theme (literature)|themes]] common to numerous folktales and more formal literature:{{original research inline|certain=yes|date=September 2015|reason=These appear to be the opinion of a Wikipedia editor, not any sources.}}
* Class, or "birth" – the tailor overcomes the [[social class]] system and exceeds his birthright as a tailor, going from peasant to king.
* Clever upstart – using nothing but his ingenuity, the tailor uses the killing of seven flies in one blow to gradually increase his social standing.
* Danger – despite the great risk of bodily harm, the tailor continues on his quest to spread word of his conquest and claim his fortune. He proves himself fearless.
* Outwitting of opponents – the tailor repeatedly outwits the people, giants, and animals he comes into contact with. Using only his brains and a little skill, he manages to overcome many obstacles.

==Relation to other stories==
"The Brave Little Tailor" has close similarities to other folktales collected around Europe, including "[[The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll]]" (Norway) and "[[Stan Bolovan]]" (Romania). It also shares many elements with "[[Jack the Giant Killer]]" (Cornwall and England, with ties to "[[Bluebeard]]" folktales of Brittany, and earlier [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] stories of Wales), though the protagonist in that story uses his guile to actually kill giants.  Both the Scandinavian and British variants feature a recurring [[stock character]] fairy-tale hero, respectively: [[Jack (hero)|Jack]] (also associated with other giant-related stories, such as "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]"), and [[Askeladden]], also known as Boots.  It is also similar to the Greek myth of [[Hercules]] in which Hercules is promised the ability to become a god if he slays the monsters, much like the main character in "The Brave Little Tailor" is promised the ability to become king through marrying the king's daughter if he kills the beasts in the story.

The technique of tricking the later giants into fighting each other is identical to the technique used by [[Cadmus]], in [[Greek mythology]] and a related surviving Greek folktale, to deal with the warriors who sprang up where he sowed [[dragon]]'s teeth into the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Dorson, "Foreword", p xxii, Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th-century [[Fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', a similar strategy is also employed by the wizard [[Gandalf]] to keep three [[troll]]s fighting amongst themselves, until the rising sun turns them to stone.

==Adaptations==
* [[Mickey Mouse]] appeared in a 1938 [[Disney]] short cartoon, ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'', based on this tale.
* [[Tibor Harsányi]] composed a [[Suite (music)|suite]], ''L'histoire du petit tailleur'', for narrator, seven instruments, and percussion in 1950.  One of the most famous recordings of this work was performed by the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]] conducted by [[Georges Prêtre]], with [[Peter Ustinov]] as the narrator reading in both English ([[Angel Records]], 1966) and French (''Pour les Enfants'', EMI Classics France, 2002).
* The story formed an episode of the second season of ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'', a 1987–1989 [[anime]] television series.
* The Valiant Little Tailor was featured in the first seasons of ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', a 1995–2000 [[HBO]] animated TV series, where it was set in the West African [[Sahel]]. The tailor was called Bongo and was voiced by [[David Alan Grier]] and also featured the voice talents of [[James Earl Jones]] as King Dakkar, [[Mark Curry (actor)|Mark Curry]] as the Giant, [[Dawnn Lewis]] as Princess Songe, and [[Zakes Mokae]] as an exclusive character named Mr. Barbooska.
*''Le vaillant petit tailleur'' is a 2004 French-language novel by [[Éric Chevillard]] retelling the fairy tale in a [[Postmodern literature|postmodernist]] way.
*"Satmaar Palowan"("The Wrestler Who Kills Seven"), a short story by eminent Bengali writer  [[Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury]] was inspired by this tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://omegalibrary.com/viewtopic.php?id=2700|title=সাতমার পালোয়ান : উপেন্দ্রকিশোর রায়চৌধুরী (ছোটোগল্প), SATMAR PALOAN (Page 1) — STORY (ছোটগল্প) — Banglalibrary|website=omegalibrary.com|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[:ru:Храбрый портняжка (мультфильм)|Soviet cartoon]] based on the fairy tale was produced in 1964, directed by the [[Brumberg sisters]].

'''''The New York Times Almanac''''' was an [[almanac]] published in the [[United States]]. There were two separate and distinct series of almanacs by this name.

The first of the two was initially published in 1969 by New York Times Books as the 1056 page '''''The New York Times Encyclopedia Almanac 1970'''''.  A 16-page supplement with late breaking news was made available to all purchasers in early 1970.  After its third year of publication it was rebranded as '''''The Official [[Associated Press]] Almanac 1973''''' and published by Hammond Almanac, Inc., a [[Dell Publishing|Dell Books]] imprint.  Publication continued for ten additional years - as '''''The Official Associated Press Almanac''''' for 1974 and 1975, as '''''The [[CBS News]] Almanac''''' for 1976, 1977 and 1978, and finally as '''''The Hammond Almanac''''' for its ultimate five years, 1979-1983.

The second ''NYTA'' was the successor to the '''''Universal Almanac'''''. Its publisher, [[Andrews McMeel Publishing|Andrews &amp; McMeel]], decided to discontinue that almanac, with the final edition being the 1997 issue.  John W. Wright, the editor of the ''Universal Almanac'', owned the rights to its content.  He approached [[The New York Times Company]], who agreed with his idea of creating a new almanac with the newspaper's name on it. [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] was then brought in as the publisher, and the first edition was published in late 1997 as ''1998 New York Times Almanac''. Wright became the general editor of the ''NYTA''. The 1998 edition of the almanac included a good deal of information from the ''Universal Almanac'', with some members of ''The Times'' news staff contributing articles about the major news events of the year, as well as the maps in the book. It ceased publication after the 2011 edition.

The '''Unix wars''' were the struggles between [[vendor]]s of the [[Unix]] [[computer]] [[operating system]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s to set the standard for Unix thenceforth.

==Origins==
Although [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] created [[Unix]], by the 1980s, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[Computer Systems Research Group]] was the leading noncommercial Unix developer.&lt;ref name="fiedler198310"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-10/1983_10_BYTE_08-10_UNIX#page/n133/mode/2up | title=The Unix Tutorial / Part 3: Unix in the Microcomputer Marketplace | work=BYTE | date=October 1983 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Fiedler, Ryan | pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, the three common versions of Unix were AT&amp;T's [[UNIX System III|System III]], the basis of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xenix]] and the IBM-endorsed [[PC/IX]], among others; AT&amp;T's [[UNIX System V|System V]], which it sought to establish as the new Unix standard;&lt;ref name="shea19840220"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hS4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=New developments may decide battle over Unix | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-02-20 | accessdate=25 February 2016 | author=Shea, Tom | pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD). All were derived from AT&amp;T's [[Research Unix]], but had diverged considerably. Further, each vendor's version of Unix was different to some degree.

For example, at a mid-1980s [[Usenix]] conference, many AT&amp;T staff had buttons which read "System V: Consider it Standard" and a number of major vendors were promoting products based on System V. On the other hand, System V did not yet have TCP/IP networking built in and BSD 4.2 did; vendors of engineering workstations were nearly all using BSD and posters that said "4.2 &gt; V" were available.

A group of vendors formed the [[X/Open]] [[open standard|standard]]s group in 1984, with the aim of forming compatible [[open system (computing)|open system]]s. They chose to base their system on Unix.

X/Open caught AT&amp;T's attention. To increase the uniformity of Unix, AT&amp;T and leading BSD Unix vendor [[Sun Microsystems]] started work in 1987 on a unified system. (The feasibility of this had been demonstrated a few years earlier by the [[US Army]] [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]]'s System V environment for BSD Unix.) This was eventually released as ''System V Release 4'' (SVR4).

While this decision was applauded by customers and the trade press, certain other Unix licensees feared Sun would be unduly advantaged. They formed the [[Open Software Foundation]] (OSF) in 1988. The same year, AT&amp;T and another group of licensees responded by forming [[UNIX International]] (UI). Technical issues soon took a back seat to vicious and public commercial competition between the two "open" versions of Unix, with X/Open holding the middle ground. A 1990 study of various Unix versions' reliability found that on each version, between a quarter and a third of operating system utilities could be made to [[Crash (computing)|crash]] by [[fuzz testing|fuzzing]]; the researchers attributed this, in part, to the "race for features, power, and performance" resulting from BSD–System V rivalry, which left developers little time to worry about reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Barton P. |first2=Louis |last2=Fredriksen |first3=Bryan |last3=So |title=An empirical study of the reliability of UNIX utilities |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=33 |issue=12 |year=1990 |pages=32–44 |url=http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/paradyn/technical_papers/fuzz.pdf |doi=10.1145/96267.96279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardization==
The 1988 POSIX standard initially concentrated on system C library functions beyond what was included in the forthcoming C standard; later it expanded to specify other aspects of the system environment. POSIX specified a "lowest common denominator" that could be met by both System V and BSD-based variants, as well as some non-UNIX systems, with a reasonable amount of effort.

In March 1993, the major participants in UI and OSF formed the [[Common Open Software Environment]] (COSE) alliance, effectively marking the end of the most significant era of the Unix wars. In June, AT&amp;T sold its UNIX assets to [[Novell]], and in October Novell transferred the Unix brand to X/Open.

In 1996, X/Open and the new OSF merged to form the [[Open Group]]. COSE work such as the [[Single UNIX Specification]], the current standard for branded Unix, is now the responsibility of the Open Group, which also controls the current POSIX standards.

Since then, occasional bursts of Unix factionalism have broken out, such as the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]]/SCO "[[3DA]]" alliance in 1995, and [[Project Monterey]] in 1998, a teaming of [[IBM]], [[Santa Cruz Operation|SCO]], [[Sequent Computer Systems|Sequent]] and [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] which was followed by litigation ([[SCO v. IBM]]) between IBM and the [[The SCO Group|new SCO, formerly Caldera]].

==BSD and the rise of Linux==
BSD purged copyrighted AT&amp;T code from 1989 to 1994. During this time various open-source BSD x86 derivatives took shape, starting with [[386BSD]], which was soon succeeded by [[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]]. [[OpenBSD]] emerged in 1995 as a fork of NetBSD, [[DragonFly BSD]] as a fork from FreeBSD in 2003. [[Mac OS X v10.5]] is the first operating system with open source BSD code to be certified as fully Unix compliant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/comm/press/19-2-nov07.htm Mac OS X Leopard Achieves UNIX 03 Product Standard Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; BSD systems can claim direct ancestry from [[Version 7 Unix]]. Or, according to Open Source advocate [[Eric Raymond]], BSD systems can be considered "genetic Unix", if not "trademark Unix."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/print.php/2208691&lt;/ref&gt;

During BSD's [[UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc. |period of legal turmoil]] (1992–94),&lt;ref name="832 F.Supp. 790"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Unix System Laboratories v. Berkeley Software |vol=832 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=790 |pinpoint= |court=[[United States District Court for the District of New Jersey|D.N.J.]] |date=1993 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/19931622832fsupp79011506 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nearly-complete [[GNU]] operating system was made operational by the inclusion of the [[Linux kernel]] and lumped together under the label "[[Linux]]". GNU had been written from scratch to avoid copyright issues. Linux systems broadly aim for compatibility with [[POSIX]].

'''White marlin''' (''Kajikia albida''), also known as Atlantic white marlin, marlin, skilligalee,&lt;ref&gt;White Marlin - Kajikia albida - Overview - Encyclopedia of Life. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://eol.org/pages/206865/overview&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of billfish that lives in the epipelagic zone of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. They are found between the latitudes of 45° N and 45° S in waters deeper than 100 m. Even though white marlin are found in bodies of water that are deeper than 100 m they tend to stay near the surface. White marlin have been found near banks, shoals, and canyons, but they are not limited to those locations.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;Braun, C., Kaplan, M., Horodysky, A., Llopiz, J. 2015. Satellite telemetry reveals physical processes driving billfish behavior. Animal Biotelemetry.&lt;/ref&gt; They prefer warm surface temperatures greater than 22&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Hoolihan, J. 2013. White Marlin. International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. 2.1.7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification ==
White marlin are commonly misidentified as [[roundscale spearfish]] (''Tetrapturus georgii''). This likely caused a miscount of the population size of white marlin and roundscale spearfish before they were determined genetically different in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Differentiation between the two species can be done with close external examination. As described in the name, roundscale spearfish have a broadband, round anterior end of their scales. White marlin scales are more rigid and rounded on the posterior region of the scale.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; Another way to identify between the two species without doing a genetic test is by looking at the distance between the anal opening and the anal fin. In roundscale spearfish, the anal opening is further way from the anal fin (greater than half the length of the anal fin) than it is in the white marlin.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Collette, B.B., McDowell, J.R. and Graves, J.E. (2006). ''Phylogeny of Recent billfishes (Xiphioidei)''. Bull. Mar. Sci. 79(3): 455-468.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
In 1860, [[Felipe Poey]] gave the white marlin the name ''Tetrapturus albidus''. This classification places the species in the same genus as shortbill spearfish, Mediterranean spearfish, roundscale spearfish, and longbill spearfish. Researchers have identified fossils from the genus ''Tetrapturus'' dating back to the [[Langhian|Langhian Age]] 15 million years ago (Mya). Extinct ancestors, such as species from the genus ''[[Palaeorhynchus]]'' date to as early as 56 Mya.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

''Tetrapturus albidus'' was the accepted name for white marlin until 2006. At this time, Collette and his colleagues' genetic testing suggested that white marlin and Indo-Pacific striped marlin should be classified in the genus ''Kajikia''.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;White Marlin Biological Review Team. 2007. Atlantic White Marlin Status Review. Report to National Marine Fisheries Service, Southeast Regional Office, United States. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''Kajikia albida'' and its close relative ''[[Kajikia audax]]'' (striped marlin) have been scientifically determined to be genetically distinct from the species in the genus ''[[Tetrapturus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Kajikia albida'' (Poey, 1860). (2012, December 21). Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=712906&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance and anatomy ==
White marlin are mid-sized billfish with a bill that is round in cross section, and distinctly forked [[Fish fin|caudal fin]].&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; Their body structure is designed for fast swimming with a long, streamlined appearance. The length of ''K. albida'' is measured from the lower jaw to the fork of the tail (lower-jaw fork length; LJFL). The largest white marlin reported was 2.8&amp;nbsp;m (9.2&amp;nbsp;ft) LJFL and weighed over 82&amp;nbsp;kg (180.8&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; The coloring of white marlin is used as [[countershading]], with a dark blue dorsal side and a dirty white ventral side.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Nakamura, I. (1985). Billfishes of the world: an annotated and illustrated catalogue of marlins, sailfishes, spearfishes and swordfishes known to date. Prepared by Izumi Nakamura. Rome: United Nations Development Program: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Though all white marlin have the same coloring pattern, they are sexually dimorphic, with the females usually larger.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; One of the most noticeable features of white marlin is the dorsal fin, which extends along the majority of the dorsal portion of its body. The dorsal fin consists of typically 28 to 46 rays. These rays make up a fin tall and rounded in the anterior, but quickly levels off and then decreases as it extends to the posterior. Behind the large primary dorsal fin is the secondary dorsal fin, which is made up of five to six rays.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; White marlin have a set of similar pectoral fins and pelvic fins. These two sets of fin are rounded and wide at the tip. They also have two anal fins which can be used for identification between species. The [[lateral line]] on this species is prominent, with a hump above the pectoral fin and extends the length of the fish toward the caudal fin.
[[File:Tetrapturus_albidus.jpg|thumb|Illustration of white marlin]]
Internally, white marlin do not have a swim bladder, but instead have small, bubble-shaped chambers that act as a swim bladder. Similarly to most vertebrates, they have symmetrical gonads.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; Unlike other marine fish, white marlin do not have gill rakers which are involved in suspension feeding.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; White marlin do have small but sharp teeth that are used when eating fish and [[cephalopod]]s.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

== Distribution ==
White marlin are found throughout warmer waters of the Atlantic between 45°N to 45°S, it is found in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Caribbean Sea]], and [[Mediterranean Sea]], although records from the Mediterranean Sea and from as far north as [[Brittany]], France, appear to refer to [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]].&lt;ref name = IUCN/&gt;

== Feeding and diet ==
White marlin are near the top of the food chain and will consume any prey they can find that is manageable for their size. Schooling [[Flying fish|flyingfish]], small [[tuna]], [[mahi-mahi]] (dolphinfish, dorado), and [[squid]] are the preferred prey of white marlin.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; They sometime forage for food with help of other predators. White marlin usually keep to themselves, but associate with other apex predators to increase the efficiency of foraging.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; They also obtain food is by diving down in a V- or U- shaped [[parabola]] to about 200 m in search of food that is not at the surface.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; To survive in these lower temperatures and darker environments, white marlin have larger eyes and a way to selectively warm their eye and brain tissue.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

== Lifecycle and migration ==
The lifecycle of ''K. albida'' begins with a large spawning in warm tropical waters near the equator. Each female can lay 190,000 to 586,000 eggs.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; The Gulf of Mexico, [[Mona Passage]], Southwest Bermuda, and northwest Grand Bahama Island are a few locations that have been located as prime spawning ground for white marlin.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;They return to the warm, shallow, equatorial waters each year to spawn.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Growth of white marlin is very rapid, with males reaching sexual maturity at only 153.2&amp;nbsp;cm LJFL and females becoming sexually mature at 189.9&amp;nbsp;cm LJFL. The lifespan of white marlin has been identified as 15 or more years.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt;

White marlin are ram ventilators, which means they have to be constantly moving to breathe.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Many have made long transatlantic journeys. One white marlin resurfaced 6,517&amp;nbsp;km (4,083 miles) from where it was tagged 474 days later.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, M., Prince, E. D., Serafy, J. E., Holts, D. B., Davy, K. B., Pepperell, J. G., Lowry, M. B. and Holdsworth, J. C. 2003. Global overview of the major constituent-based billfish tagging programs and their results since 1954. Marine and Freshwater Research, 54: 489-507&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fishing and conservation ==
Prior to 2001, roundscale spearfish and white marlin were identified as the same species. Researchers from Nova Southeastern University's Guy Harvey Research Institute, Dania Beach, Florida, first discovered that these two species were significantly different in 2001 through genetic tests. Before this discovery. the two species made up a population that was of least concern to the IUCN. Placement into the endangered species list was not established until 2007, when the population numbers had already dropped below easily recoverable levels.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schrope, M. 2013. Fishy numbers. for white marlin stocks. ''Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America'', ''110'' (11), 4151-4153.&lt;/ref&gt;

White marlin fishing is a multimillion-dollar organization in well-developed countries. Restrictions are in place to limit the size of fish that can be taken, but the angling process can be devastating to fish. The time spent on the hook, outside handling, dehooking, and releasing a white marlin exhaust enough energy that up to 32% of the time, the marlin cannot maintain buoyancy in the water. When fishing for any billfish, use of a circle hook, which can be dehooked more quickly than other hooks, is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Schlenker L.S. 2014. Physiological Stress and Post-Release Mortality of White Marlin (Kajikia albida) Caught in the U.S. Recreational Fishery (Master’s Thesis). The College of William and Mary.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean waters, the fish is required by federal regulations to be kept in the water, boatside, to maximize its chances of surviving after release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=61a595968a83cb26ff613b5638da391f&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=50:12.0.1.1.3.3.1.2&amp;idno=50]{{Citation|title=e-CFR: Title 50: Wildlife and Fisheries PART 635.21(a)(1)|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=61a595968a83cb26ff613b5638da391f&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=50:12.0.1.1.3.3.1.2&amp;idno=50|language=en-US|accessdate=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that removing a billfish from the water may increase their risk of death after release by ~30 percent (research ongoing).

About 90% of the annual catch is caught accidentally in [[bycatch]] from fishing around the world.&lt;ref name=":07"/&gt; Many billfish are caught in gillnets or on longline hooks that were meant to catch other fish species. Since these hooks and nets are set for long periods of time, white marlin become food to sharks, pilot whales, and killer whales. In response to the decrease in white marlin, marine life agencies have developed acts and plans such as the Atlantic Tunas Conservation Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to protect vulnerable species. The U.S. Fishery Management plan for the Atlantic billfish has, as an objective, to educate and increase knowledge about billfish and their roles in the ecosystem. In the United States, billfishing is reserved for recreational fishing only.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

==Additional information==
[[Ocean City, Maryland]], is known as the White Marlin Capital of the World. The city hosts the annual White Marlin Open, a big-game tournament which attracts anglers from all over the world, and which frequently pays out over a million dollars to the winning team. The tournament encourages tag-and-release (nonlethal) handling of the fish, although winning marlin are often brought back to the marina for verification of the size and weight. The 2010 White Marlin Open was held at Harbour Island Marina on 14th Street and the Bay.

The 2016 White Marlin Open created controversy when the only fish that met the minimum weight requirement of 70&amp;nbsp;lbs, was disqualified when the crew of the winning boat, ''Kallianassa'', was deemed to have failed a polygraph which implied that tournament rules were broken during the clash. The boat's owner, Phillip G. Heasley, was denied the $2.8 million of prize money.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6420">'''Winifred Needler''' (June 14, 1904 – September 5, 1987) was a German-born Canadian [[Egyptologist]] at the Museum of Ontario Archaeology, where she rose to be keeper of the Near Eastern Collections and later curator of the Egyptian Department. She also taught at the University of Toronto.

==Early life and education==
Winifred Ellen Needler was born in [[Weimar, Germany]], to Mary Winifred (Chisholm) Needler and George Henry Needler, a professor of German at the University of Toronto.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; She was known to family and friends as 'Friedel' or 'Friedl'.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; She was educated at St. Margaret's College and [[Oakwood Collegiate Institute]], following which she got her B.A. in modern languages and philosophy at [[University College, Toronto]].&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; She then spent a year studying art at the [[Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; In 1928 she moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to study at the  School of Fine Arts and Crafts, where she won a number of prizes for her artwork.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

==Career==
For five years Needler struggled to make a living as a commercial artist, but this eventually proved impossible during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; In 1935, she got a job as a draftsperson and cataloguer at the [[Museum of Ontario Archaeology]], drawing specimens for the museum's card system.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; She became increasingly interested in the Egyptian collection and began to concentrate on it. In  1938, she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship that allowed her to take a leave of absence from the museum and study at Yale University.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; During her year at Yale, she studied with [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], Cornelius Osgood, and Ludlow Bull.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; She could not stay to complete the two-year master's degree, although Rostovtzeff argued that a paper she wrote for him on [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] sculpture was so good that it should be accepted as a master's thesis.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; She received her M.A. in 1961 from the University of Toronto.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

On her return to Canada in 1939, Needler undertook a systematic organization and classification of the museum's extensive collection of Near Eastern antiquities, many collected by then-director [[Charles Trick Currelly]].&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; After holding various positions in the museum, in 1951 she was appointed to a top curatorial post as keeper of the Near Eastern Collections.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; She helped to expand the museum's holdings of artefacts from the Near East.&lt;ref name=ROM/&gt; A decade later, when the museum decided to split the Near Eastern Collections in two, she was appointed curator of the half that was named the Egyptian Department.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

Needler was able to do field work only intermittently. She spent the summers of 1941 and 1942 in field work at the old mission in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; Then in 1947 she had her first chance to do field work in Egypt, joining a team at the temple of [[Seti I]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], where she worked alongside [[Amice Calverley]] to copy wall paintings and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; In 1956, she spent a month at [[Jericho]], where [[Kathleen Kenyon]] was leading the excavations, drawing and recording newfound objects. In 1962–63 she spent time working with [[Walter Bryan Emery]] at [[Buhen]] in the Sudan and at [[Qasr Ibrim]] in Egypt, where archeological salvage work was under way in advance of the construction of [[Aswan Dam]].&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; Needler worked on excavating a cemetery,  dismantling a temple built by [[Queen Hatshepsut]], and making drawings of artifacts removed from the sites.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

In 1943–44, Needler designed and painted a large frieze for the museum's Egyptian gallery that was {{convert|42|in|m|order=flip}} wide and extended {{convert|82|ft|order=flip}} around three walls of the gallery.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; Populated with some five dozen figures and animals adapted from Egyptian tomb paintings, the mural aimed to capture the spirit and style of [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] art.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; The mural is no longer on public display but is preserved in the museum's archives.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

In 1953, Needler was appointed a special lecturer in the Department of Fine Art at the 
University of Toronto.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; After 12 years, she moved over to the Department of Near Eastern Studies as an associate professor and taught there until she retired in 1970.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

In 1969, Needler was awarded a prestigious [[Charles Edwin Wilbour#Legacy|Wilbour Fellowship]] by the [[Brooklyn Museum]], with the goal of publishing an account of that museum's collection of [[Prehistoric Egypt|predynastic]] and archaic Egyptian art.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; Needler's research for this monograph occupied the years 1970 (when she retired from the Museum of Ontario Archaeology) to 1975.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; However, publication was delayed until 1984 because museum publication funds ran low and outside funding had to be secured.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt; Needler's monograph is considered a valuable and original contribution to the study of Egyptian art and archeology.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

In 1982, [[Bishop's  University]] honored Needler with an honorary doctorate in recognition of her service to the Museum of Ontario Archaeology and to the field of Egyptology.&lt;ref name=Katary/&gt;

'''''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack Australia''''' (also known as '''''Wisden Australia''''') was a [[cricket]] annual and reference book, the [[Australia]]n version of  ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', generally known as ''Wisden''. The Australian edition's gestation period was lengthy: the first edition appeared in 1998, when the Preface referred to a March 1981 report in ''[[The Australian]]'' announcing the imminent appearance of the Australian edition.

''Wisden Australia'' was published by Hardie Grant Publishing of Melbourne, at or near the beginning of the Australian season, in November or early December.  In contrast to the yellow cover of the parent publication ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', its cover was predominantly bright green. The last two editions published, those of 2004-05 and 2005–06, emulated the parent by featuring dustjackets with photographs.

The Australian edition was also somewhat slimmer and cheaper, as there were fewer games to report on in Australia; in most other respects the format and content of the Australian edition were similar to those of the English version. One difference was that the former's coverage of first [[grade cricket]] in each state and territory was more comprehensive than the latter's relatively sketchy  coverage of top level [[List of English and Welsh cricket league clubs|English club and league cricket]].

The first two editions, dated 1998 and 1999, covered the 1997-98 and 1998-99 Australian seasons respectively. The numbering changed with the third edition, which adopted the practice of the English almanack by including in its title the date of the season immediately after the season covered. Thus the 2000-01 edition covered the 1999-2000 season, and so on up to the 2005-06 edition, the eighth in the series, published in 2005 which covered the domestic season 2004-05 and the 2005 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] tour in England.

No further edition has been published since 2005. The most comprehensive reviews and records of Australian cricket are now to be found online or in the reports of the various state cricket associations. The website of [[Cricket Australia]], the national body, does not cover grade cricket in any detail.
