}}'''''Ageod's American Civil War II''''' is a historical operational [[turn-based strategy]] computer game (WEGO system) that places players at the head of the [[United States|U.S.]] or [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865).

Most of the individual years of campaign between 1861 and 1865 are playable via a separate scenario (to be refined during beta testing). Advanced scenarios will allow recreation of some yearly or theater campaigns, and there is a Grand Campaign covering the whole war. The game is a sequel to ''[[Ageod's American Civil War]]'', which was released in 2007. The game partnered with the [[Civil War Trust]], and a portion of proceeds from the sale of the game was donated to the trust.&lt;ref name="CWTinterview"&gt;[http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-ii-a-designer.html Civil War II: A Designer Interview, Civil War Trust, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
This is a turn-based game, with each term representing one-half of a month, roughly 15 days. The game takes place on a map of most of North America divided into regions. Areas in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean are not accessible. The player takes on the role of the [[Union Army]] or the [[Confederate Army]]. The game uses a simultaneous turn or WEGO system where the player sees the opponent's starting point, but does not know what the opponent will do. The amount of information each player sees about their opponent is also affected by a [[fog of war]]. Battles are fought on behalf of the players, with the player's choice of command structure and unit mix being critical in determining outcomes.&lt;ref name="CWTinterview"/&gt;

==Development==
The game was based on the research used to develop ''[[Ageod's American Civil War]]'' as well as help from the community.

''Ageod's American Civil War II'' was called an artisan achievement by wargamer.com, which also noted that the game may not be for everyone, largely due to the micromanagement required.&lt;ref name="WG"&gt;[http://www.wargamer.com/reviews/civil-war-ii-an-artisan-achivement/ Tanaleon, James, "Civil War II: an Artisan Achievment" (sic)]. wargamer.com, September 27, 2013, accessed December 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogart’s influence is felt throughout the contemporary theatre: through the widespread adoption of SITI’s training methods of [[Viewpoints]] and [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]], her oeuvre of groundbreaking productions, and her guidance at SITI as well as Columbia University of such diverse talents as Pavol Liska, [[Diane Paulus]], [[James Dacre]], [[Kim Weild]], [[Jay Scheib]], [[Sophie Hunter]], [[Shura Baryshnikov]], [[Darko Tresnjak]], [[Robert O'Hara]], [[Rachel Chavkin]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Weild Biography|url=http://www.kimweild.com/about/|website=Kim Weild}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diane Paulus Biography|url=http://www.dianepaulus.net/press/paulusAmericanTheatre.html|website=Diane Paulus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sophie Hunter Biography|url=http://sophiehunter.net/thehuntress|website=Sophie Hunter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jay Scheib Biography|url=http://www.jayscheib.com/pdf_files/jayscheib_cv.pdf|website=Jay Scheib}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arts.columbia.edu/news/theaanson-mount-98-performs-mankind-written-robert-ohara-96|title=Anson Mount '98 Performs in 'Mankind', Written By Robert O'Hara '96|last=|first=|date=December 4, 2017|website=Columbia University School of the Arts|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

Bogart earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Bard College]] in 1974, followed by a Master of Arts degree from [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]] in 1977. She served as Artistic Director of the [[Trinity Repertory Company]] for its 1989–90 season. From 1990–92 she was president of TCG (Theater Communications Group). In 1992 together with Tadashi Suzuki she founded SITI Company with a mission to create new work, to train young theatre artists and to encourage international collaboration. She has served as SITI Company’s Artistic Director since 1992 and since 2011 she shares the leadership with Company members Ellen Lauren and Leon Ingulsrud.

From 1987 – 1992 Bogart served as the Artistic Director of Via Theater. Founded by Bogart and Brian Jucha, Via Theater created a number of highly regarded productions in New York City including ''[[Assimil]]'', ''No Plays, No Poetry'', and ''Cinderella/Cendrillon''.  The company led workshops and residencies around the United States.

Between 1980 and 1992, Bogart taught at the Max Reinhart Academy, The Bern Conservatory, The [[University of Alaska]], [[Bennington College]], The American Center (Paris, France), [[Williams College]], New York University, [[University of California at San Diego]], and [[Playwrights Horizons Theater School]]. Since 1993 she has served as a Professor at Columbia University where she heads the Graduate Directing Program.

Since 1992 Bogart has taught in residencies around the world and given workshops and master classes at institutions as diverse as La Mama, [[Umbria]], the [[Abbey Theatre]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland, many US universities and colleges, as well as theaters and conservatories on many continents. Her skills as a speaker and public intellectual have garnered her over 50 speaking engagements since 1988.

Bogart has written ''A Director Prepares'', ''And Then, You Act'' and co-authored ''The Viewpoints Book'' with Tina Landau, in which she outlines her theories of and approaches to making theatre. Shorter works have appeared in ''The Humana Festival – The Complete Plays'' (1996 and 1999), ''[[American Theatre (magazine)|American Theatre]]'' magazine and ''[[The Drama Review]]''.

In "Anne Bogart: Viewpoints", drama critic [[Mel Gussow]] refers to Bogart as “a director of the present moment and, one might add, the prescient moment. Relentlessly she searches for imaginative ways to renew the theatrical experience, to make it more relevant for herself and those who are receiving it.”

Bogart is the granddaughter of Admiral [[Raymond Ames Spruance]], Commander of Task Force 16 and later the overall commander of US Naval Forces at the pivotal [[Battle of Midway]].

Anne Bogart is married to Rena Chelouche Fogel.

== Viewpoints and Suzuki ==

After working together with [[Mary Overlie]] at NYU in 1979, Bogart developed a version of an improvisational, ensemble-building technique called Viewpoints, based on Overlie's Six View Points of dance. Coupled with Suzuki, the intense physical acting training developed by [[Tadashi Suzuki]] and his Company, SCOT, SITI Company’s training methods have become widespread tools of theatre instruction with classes of various levels taught in Universities and colleges across the United States and in seasonal intensives led by SITI Company members in New York City, [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] and in cities around the world.

== Awards and recognition ==

Bogart has won two Best Director [[Obie Award]]s, one for ''No Plays No Poetry But Philosophical Reflections Practical Instructions Provocative Opinions and Pointers From a Noted Critic and Playwright'' (1988) based on the theories of [[Bertolt Brecht]] and the other for [[Paula Vogel]]'s ''[[The Baltimore Waltz]]'' (1990). In 1984, she was also honored with the [[Bessie Awards|Bessie Award]] for Choreographer/Creator for her work with ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. In 1995 Bogart received an ATHE Career achievement award and in 2005 was honored with and [[American Theatre Wing]] award. In 1998 Bogart received a grant from the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]]. In 2000 she received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and in 2006 she was awarded a US Artists Fellowship. She has received University awards from institutions around the world including Trinity College, [[Emory University]], [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], Bard College, [[City University of New York]], and the [[Yale Dramatic Association]]. Bogart has received three Honorary Doctorates, in 2011 from Skidmore College, in 2013 from Bard College and in 2015 from Cornish College.  In 2012 she was one of the recipients of the inaugural round of Doris Duke Performing Artist Awards. Bogart is the 2012 recipient of the Richard B. Fisher Award presented at BAM. In 2018 London University awarded Bogart a Leverhulme Professorship &lt;ref&gt;https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/sites/default/files/VP%20March%202018_v2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Asphalt 4: Elite Racing''''' is a [[racing video game|racing game]] published and developed by [[Gameloft]]. It was released on [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[iPod]] on August 28, 2008; [[N-Gage (service)|N-Gage]] on January 20, 2009; [[mobile phones]] in mid-July 2008; and [[DSiWare]] on July 6, 2009. This game marks the first game in the ''[[Asphalt (series)|Asphalt series]]'' to be released for iOS. The game was retired later, in 2014, after ''Asphalt 5'' was removed from the App Store.

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay of ''Asphalt 4: Elite Racing'' is similar to that of the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series. The main gameplay involves the player starting out with one or two of the most basic cars and earning money by winning races and performing illegal acts. Money can then be spent on upgrades or new cars. The game's quality may vary depending on the system it's being played on. [[Lamborghini]] and [[Audi]] cars are removed in ''Asphalt 4'' and replaced with [[Ferrari]] and [[Bugatti Automobiles|Bugatti]], though they returned in ''[[Asphalt 5]]''.

== Development ==
''Asphalt 4: Elite Racing'' was first developed in 2008 for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[iPods]] that have click wheels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20874">'''Babies switched at birth''' are [[infant|babies]] who, because of either error or malice, are interchanged with each other at [[childbirth|birth]] or very soon thereafter, leading to the babies being unknowingly raised by parents who are not their biological [[parent]]s. The occurrence is not unknown but rarely discovered in real life{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, but is much more common as a [[plot device]] in novels and films, such as the TV series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'' and ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]''.

==As a literary plot device==
The [[plot device]] of babies who are switched at birth, or in their cradles, has been a common one in American fiction since the 18th century.  It is one of the several identifiable characteristics of [[melodrama]] that are plot devices dealing with situations that are highly improbable in real life.&lt;ref name=Merish&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion To American Fiction 1780-1865|editor=Shirley Samuels|page=192|author=Lori Merish|chapter=Melodrama and American Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23422-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of this common theme has continued ever since.  The device was used a number of times by [[W. S. Gilbert]], including in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]]s ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.  In both cases, well-born babies were switched with commoners.  [[Mark Twain]] later used this plot device in ''[[The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson]]'' (1893), where two babies, one white and one black, are switched at birth, resulting in both [[passing (racial identity)|passing]] for races that they are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Race, Citizenship, and Law in American Literature|editor=Ross Posnock|pages=174&amp;ndash;182|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-01093-4|chapter=The positivist alternative|author=Gregg Crane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the themes that [[television film]]s regularly exploited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Movies at Home: How Hollywood Came to Television|author=Kerry Segrave|page=139|year=1999|publisher=McFarland &amp;amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0654-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be a popular theme in the 1990s and 21st century with (for examples) it being employed as a plot device in ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' (the characters [[Cindy "Mac" Mackenzie]] and [[Madison Sinclair]]), in ''[[Neighbours]]'' (the characters [[Bree Timmins]] and [[Anne Baxter (Neighbours)|Anne Baxter]]), ''[[Night and Day (TV series)|Night and Day]]'' (the characters Jane Harper and Della Wells) and in ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (children of [[Lauren Fenmore Baldwin]] and [[Sheila Carter]]).  A non-human example occurs in the ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' franchise, when the son of intelligent apes Zira and Cornelius is swapped with a 20th-century circus ape's infant, in order to assure the survival of the offspring that can become sentient. In ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' the characters [[Juanita Solis (daughter)|Juanita Solis]] and [[Acquaintances of Gabrielle Solis#Grace Sanchez|Grace Sanchez]] were switched at birth by a nurse named Teresa Pruitt. In the Philippine television series, ''[[Mara Clara]]'', the characters Mara [[Mara Clara|Davis]]/[[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|David]] and Clara [[Mara Clara|del]] [[Mara Clara (2010 TV series)|Valle]] were switched at birth by Gary for revenge after his former lover was married to another man. On the [[ABC Family]] series ''[[Switched at Birth (TV series)|Switched at Birth]]'', the characters Bay and Daphne were switched at birth.

Baby switching storylines are a staple of daytime drama, as in the case of ''The Young and the Restless'' mentioned above. Other notable switched-at-birth storylines on American soaps include ''[[One Life to Live]]''{{-'}}s story, begun in 1979, in which prostitute Katrina Karr, who had planned to put her child up for adoption as soon as it was born, and former nun Jenny Vernon both gave birth to girls at the same hospital, at the same time. Jenny's baby died in the maternity ward as Karen Wolek and Marco Dane (posing as a doctor) visited the child. As they knew Katrina had planned to give up her baby girl, Karen and Marco switched the newborns. It was not until 1982 that the truth came out and Jenny tearfully gave baby Mary back to Katrina.

In 2008, another ''One Life to Live'' storyline saw Starr Manning pregnant with Cole Thornhart's baby. Her cousin Jessica Brennan was also pregnant with her late husband's baby. Starr went into labor as her father Todd Manning (later revealed to be his twin brother Victor) planned to kidnap his grandchild and raise the baby secretly with Cole's amnesiac mother Marty Saybrooke. Tess, one of Jessica's alter personalities, had taken control of Jessica's life and went into premature labor. Starr, with the help of the baby's adoptive mother Marcie McBain and Starr's mother Blair Manning, gave birth to a healthy girl, whom she named Hope. Tess's child, named Chloe, was stillborn. The trauma of Chloe's death resulted in the emergence of another alter, Bess, who took Jessica's deceased baby to the hospital and switched her with Starr's healthy child. Seven months later, Jessica realized what had happened and told the truth to her cousin.

Possibly the most complex storyline involving the switched-at-birth plot device ran simultaneously on ''[[All My Children]]'' and ''One Life to Live''.&lt;ref&gt;http://onelifetolive.about.com/library/news/blbaby_switch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Involved were ''All My Children''{{-'}}s Bianca Montgomery and Babe Chandler, and ''One Life to Live''{{-'}}s Kelly Cramer Buchanan, as well as many other characters.

In [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, the baby Aegon Targaryen was switched with a commoner's baby at some point prior to the Sack of King's Landing in order to save him from being killed during the rebellion against the Targaryen dynasty. After the commoner's baby is killed, everyone believes that Aegon is dead when in fact he is preparing to take back his grandfather's throne.

In the 1971 manga/anime ''[[Wandering Sun]] / Nozomi in the Sun'' (''Sasurai no Taiyou''), Miki and Nozomi are two girls who were switched at birth by the nurse Michiko Nohara, who holds a personal grudge against one of the families involved. Miki should've been raised as the daughter of the poor but loving Mine family but instead is taken in by the rich and snobbish Kouda clan, and Nozomi the opposite. The deceit isn't properly revealed until almost the end of the series.

In the ''[[Umineko no naku koro ni]]'' visual novels, Rudolf Ushiromiya's wife Asumu and mistress/later second wife Kyrie were pregnant and gave birth at roughly the same time. Rudolf had the children switched when Asumu's child was stillborn so the affair wouldn't be uncovered, and after Asumu's death from an illness, he married Kyrie. The surviving child grows into the protagonist of the games, Battler Ushiromiya, who believes himself to be Asumu and Rudolf's son until later in the story.

In the game ''[[Tales of the Abyss]]'', Princess Natalia Luzu Kimlasca-Lanvaldear died few after birth so her nanny Maggie switched her with her also newborn granddaughter, Meryl Oakland. This causes Meryl's mother Sylvia (Maggie's own daughter) to commit suicide out of grief, and her father Badaq soon became the enemy general Largo the Black Lion. Meryl, now Natalia, is raised as the Princess and doesn't find out the truth until she's a teenager.

==In reality==

In real life, such a switch occurs rarely.&lt;ref name=Merish /&gt; Since many cases of babies switched at birth are likely undocumented or unknown, the following is presumably not an exhaustive list.

*In 1931, at the [[Leiden University Medical Center]], female babies Agnes van Vegten and Lenie van Duyn were switched. Suspicions did not rise until two decades later, when the girls met at a wedding and wondered at their mutual likeness to each other's family.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters (1955, December 28). "CHANGELING" SUES PARENTS :Dutch Case Ruled Inadmissible. The Manchester Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1951, at a hospital in [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]], the babies of Mary Miller and Kay McDonald were accidentally switched. Mary Miller immediately suspected that a switch had occurred, as the baby she received weighed a full two pounds less than at the hospital. Mary Miller knew Kay McDonald, and assumed that it was their baby she had taken home.  However, a series of circumstances kept Mary Miller from actively pursuing her suspicion for 43 years, when she revealed to the now grown girls, Sue McDonald and Martha Miller, what she suspected of their births. Genetic tests later confirmed that a switch did in fact occur. The story was featured on an episode of the radio show ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1496358/public_radio_to_air_story_of_pdc_babies_switched_at/ View - redOrbit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1253 2011 | Archive | This American Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1953, at Pioneer Memorial Hospital in [[Heppner, Oregon]], two babies were switched. In May 2009, the women discovered they were switched. DeeAnn Angell of Fossil and Kay Rene Reed of Condon learned about the mistake from an 86-year-old woman who was a former neighbor. The former neighbor said that one of the girls' mothers, Marjorie Angell, insisted back in 1953 that she had been given the wrong baby after nurses returned from bathing them. But her concerns were ignored. With both sets of parents dead, the Reed and Angell siblings compared notes and family stories, learning that rumors of a mix-up had been around for years. Kay Rene Reed decided to get their DNA tested, and that confirmed the mistake. They both say they just have to move forward with their lives now, and they celebrated their latest birthday together.
*In March 1953, at San-Ikukai Hospital in Tokyo's Sumida Ward, hospital staff mistook a baby boy for another baby boy born 13 minutes later. This story was referred to as the tale of the Japanese "prince and pauper." Sixty years later, a 60-year-old Japanese truck driver discovered he was switched at birth after being born to a rich family. The man was raised by a single mother in a 100-square-foot apartment. The boy who was raised in his place by the rich family became the president of a real estate company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/11/29/247807768/japanese-prince-switched-at-birth-was-raised-a-pauper | title=Japanese 'Prince' Switched At Birth Was Raised A Pauper | publisher=NPR| date=Nov 29, 2013 | accessdate=15 July 2014 | author=Calamur, Krishnadev}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Man born to wealthy parents lived in poverty after being switched at birth|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc1tOM6Qn5Y|website=YouTube|publisher=Global Report News|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Kimberly Mays and Arlena Twigg were switched at birth as a result of a [[medical error]] in a hospital in [[Wauchula, Florida]];&lt;ref name=Guggenheim&gt;{{cite book|title=What's Wrong With Children's Rights?|author=Martin Guggenheim|page=56|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-01721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the events surrounding their case were subsequently dramatized as the made-for-TV movie ''[[Switched at Birth (film)|Switched at Birth]]''.
*In 1975, at least two known cases occurred in [[Norway House]], [[Manitoba]] of babies being switched at birth at the Norway House Hospital: Luke Monias and Norman Barkman,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-men-switched-at-birth-1.3317638 "2 Manitoba men switched at birth dealing with 'stolen identity'"]. [[CBC Manitoba]], November 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leon Swanson and David Tait Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/switched-birth-first-nation-hospital-manitoba-1.3736933 "Manitoba men weep after learning they were switched at birth 41 years ago"]. [[CBC Manitoba]], August 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Both pairs of boys were from the same small communities, and had been lifelong friends of their switch-mates before learning of the switches only in the mid-2010s.
*The Mixed-Up Brothers of [[Bogotá]] refers to two sets of [[identical twins]] that got separated at birth in 1988 and were raised as [[nonidentical twins]]. The twins reunited in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=DOMINUS|first1=SUSAN|title=The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota.html|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chai|first1=Carmen|title=Watch: A tale of two sets of identical twins, mixed up at birth|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2117243/watch-a-tale-of-two-sets-of-identical-twins-mixed-up-at-birth/|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=Global News|publisher=Global News|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Where are the 'Mixed up brothers of Bogota' now?|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4432849113001/where-are-the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota-now/?#sp=show-clips|accessdate=31 August 2016|work=Fox News|date=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogotá|url=http://imgur.com/gallery/bIo6A|website=imgur|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The sons of two [[South Africa]]n women, Margaret Clinton-Parker and Sandra Dawkins, were accidentally switched at birth in 1989; the women sued in the [[High Court of South Africa]] in [[Johannesburg]] in 1995, demanding damages of [[South African rand|ZAR]]120,000 each from the government of the province of [[Gauteng]] for the error.&lt;ref name ="old"&gt;''Clinton-Parker v. Administrator, Transvaal''; ''Dawkins v. Administrator, Transvaal'' 1996 (2) SA 37 (W)&lt;/ref&gt; They were later that year awarded damages to cover medical expenses and the future projected costs of visiting their biological children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Deseret News]]|date=1995-08-22|title=2 MOMS SUING OVER SONS SWITCHED AT BIRTH|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DSNB/lib00497,0F360DC14A813699.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Damages awarded after babies switched|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]|date=1995-10-22|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/KC/lib00144,0EAF4234676AD331.html|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each family kept the child they had been living with, though, and raised them as their own even after learning of the switch. That was until one of the boys, Robin, at the age of 15, decided to leave Sandy Dawkins to go and live with his biological mother, Margaret Clinton-Parker. The boys spent the remainder of their childhood living as brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=267887 Switched at birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, it was discovered that Canadians Brent Tremblay and Marcus Holmes had been switched at birth 21 years earlier. The error was discovered when Brent and his twin, George Holmes, met each other at Carleton University in Ottawa.  The Children's Aid Society of Ontario later settled with the families involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/switched.asp snopes.com: Twins Switched at Birth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, it was discovered that Callie Johnson and Rebecca Chittum had been switched at birth in 1995 in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. The switch was discovered when a DNA test of Callie Johnson to determine paternity for [[child support]] found that she was not biologically related to either her purported father, Carlton Conley, or her purported mother, Paula Johnson. In a tragic coincidence, Callie's biological parents Kevin Chittum and Whitney Rogers died in a car accident the day after Paula Johnson learned of the results of the DNA test. Five others also died in the car accident, but Rebecca Chittum, Johnson's three-year-old biological daughter whom the deceased couple had been raising as their child, was at home with her supposed grandparents at the time of the accident. Over the next decade, Paula Johnson repeatedly grappled with Rebecca's purported grandparents for custody and visitation rights, until a judge determined that the two girls were old enough to express their own wishes with regard to seeing their biological relatives. In 2001, Carlton Conley married the sister of his biological daughter Rebecca's deceased adoptive father Kevin Chittum. Rebecca Chittum lived with the couple as of 2008 but had limited contact with her biological mother, while Callie lived with Paula Johnson and occasionally visited her biological relatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/168155 Two families, 10 years later - Roanoke.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2001, it was reported that a 35-year-old woman from the [[Canary Islands]] had discovered that she was one of a set of [[identical twins]] and that she had been accidentally switched at birth with another girl. She grew up as an only child, until a friend of her twin mistook her for being that twin. But the person was shocked by the striking similarity in appearance and summoned them together. They took a DNA test, which proved they were identical twins. The twin who had grown up thinking that another girl was her twin said that the girl she thought was her twin looked nothing like her. Since the women were born in a state hospital, they sued the government for damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7422635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spain twins sue over birth mix-up | date=May 27, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On December 9, 2006, two newborn girls were switched in a hospital in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] town of Trebic. The families did not find out until September 2007, when a couple of friends of one of the fathers made fun of him for not being the biological father of the baby. DNA tests proved that the girl was indeed switched. After days of investigation, the other family was found. The babies were gradually introduced to their biological parents and returned to their birth homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://czechdaily.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/babies-switched-at-birth-verdict-hospital-to-pay-33m// Switched At Birth Verdict: Hospital to Pay « The Czech Daily Word&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 10, 2011, it was discovered that two [[Russia]]n newborn girls were switched 12 years beforehand in a town in the [[Ural Mountains]]. The truth emerged after the ex-husband of one of the mothers refused to pay alimony for the child on the basis that she looked nothing like him. DNA tests proved that the child was neither's biological daughter. The other family was discovered across town with the biological daughter. The children will stay with their adoptive parents, and both families are demanding 5 million [[rubles]] in damage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15244382 Russian families sue child mix-up hospital ]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Moses Cushworth, the son of U.K. citizen Rich Cushworth and his Salvadoran wife Mercedes "Mercy" Casanalles, was switched with another baby at a Salvadoran hospital in May 2015. Getting Moses out of El Salvador became a nine-month process requiring the help of U.K. Ambassador [[Bernhard Garside]] in obtaining a passport for the boy, due to the problems with the birth certificate.

==Anti-switch techniques==
Some hospitals take fingerprints, foot prints, or palm prints of newborns to prevent babies from being mixed up.  Nurses also double check with the mother, checking the identity of that person as well, in order to prevent errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Obstetrics for Nurses|author=Joseph Bolivar De Lee|publisher=W. B. Saunders|location=London and Philadelphia|year=1966|page=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Childhood and Adolescence: A Psychology of the Growing Person|author=Lawrence Joseph Stone and Joseph Church|year=1973|publisher=Random House UK Ltd|isbn=0-394-31723-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many hospitals also have policies in which a medical record number is assigned to an infant at birth, and bands with this number as well as the last name of the mother of the infant, the sex of the infant, and the date and time of birth are placed on the infant and the mother immediately after [[parturition]] before the mother and child are separated.  A band may also be placed on the father (or other person chosen by the mother) at the time of birth.

'''''Below the Surface''''' is a 1938 [[Adventure film|adventure tale]] set in the coal region of [[Newcastle, Australia]]. Only part of the movie survives today.

==Plot==
Two miners compete for an important coal contract. One of them attempts to sabotage the other but fails.

==Cast==
*[[Stan Tolhurst]]
*Phyllis Reilly
*Neil Carlton
*Jimmy McMahon
*Lawrence Taylor
*Reg King
*Billy Baker
*Leonard Clarke
*Frank Baker
*Billy Crooks

==Production==
The main investor in the movie was a prominent music house in Sydney. The film was shot on location in [[Cronulla]], Sydney and Newcastle, with studio work done at [[Pagewood Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17437532 |title=MINERS' SONS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=10 January 1938 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17441802 |title=AUSTRALIAN FILM. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=1 December 1937 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kather and Tolhurt built a mine set themselves. Shooting took place from November 1937 to February 1938.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt;

==Release==
Like Kathner's first movie, ''[[Phantom Gold]]'' (1937), it was refused to be considered eligible for registration under the New South Wales [[Film Quota Act]] on the grounds of poor quality.&lt;ref name="pike"&gt;Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, ''Australian Film 1900–1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was never released to cinemas, the only one of Kather's movies to suffer this fate.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press, 1989, p151&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1938 Australian Cinema Entertainments announced plans to make four more features that year for £40,000, the first which was to be ''Diamonds in the Rough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17442842 |title=AUSTRALIAN FILMS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=3 February 1938 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not eventuate. Tolhurst did revive the name with his company, ACE Films, in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46944500 |title=Ambitious film project by Australians. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=27 September 1947 |accessdate=15 August 2012 |page=40 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aston ethos big.jpg|thumb|An Aston ''Ethos'' hardware character generator]]
A '''character generator''', often abbreviated as '''CG''', is a device or software that produces static or animated text (such as [[news crawl]]s and [[credits roll]]s) for [[Keying (graphics)|keying]] into a [[video]] stream. Modern character generators are computer-based, and can generate graphics as well as text.

==History==

[[Monoscope]]s were used as character generators for [[text mode]] video rendering in computer displays for a short time in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/c/CK1414.pdf |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] components division, industrial components operation |title= ''CK1414 Symbolray character generating cathode ray tube'' data sheet |date=15 April 1966 |format=PDF |accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[CBS Laboratories]] Vidiac,&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc13276/m1/44/ University of North Texas - Automatic Typographic-Quality Typesetting Techniques: A State-of-the-Art Review]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[A.B. Dick Company|A. B. Dick]] 990 System, were among the earliest character generators for broadcast television.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/First-Hand:Inventing_the_Vidifont:_the_first_electronics_graphics_machine_used_in_television_production|title=IEEE Global History Network - First-Hand:Inventing the Vidifont: the first electronics graphics machine used in television production|author=Stanley Baron|date=2008-12-14|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS Laboratories later developed the more advanced Vidifont system in preparation for the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 US presidential elections]], where a rapid method of all-electronic character generation was required so that news outlets could identify unexpected interviewees on the spot.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; A similar generator using analogue electronics, Anchor, was developed by the [[BBC]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/engineering/bbc_engineering_84.pdf BBC Engineering, Number 84, October 1970, pp15-19]&lt;/ref&gt; and used in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|general election]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq8PMfpA-6g&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;x-yt-ts=1422327029&amp;x-yt-cl=84838260#t=2569 BBC Election 1970 - Part 1, 42:49]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq8PMfpA-6g&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;x-yt-ts=1422327029&amp;x-yt-cl=84838260#t=2604 BBC Election 1970 - Part 1, 43:24]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

In the television business in [[North America]], the [[digital on-screen graphic]]s generated by character generators are also often called "Chyrons", after the [[Chyron Corporation]], whether or not Chyron made the character generator. Similarly, in the [[United Kingdom]], such graphics are often called "Astons", after [[Aston Broadcast Systems]]. These are examples of [[genericized trademark]]s.

Character generators are primarily used in the broadcast areas of [[live television]] sports or [[television news]] presentations, given that the modern character generator can rapidly (i.e., "on the fly") generate high-resolution, animated graphics for use when an unforeseen situation in a broadcast dictates an opportunity for [[breaking news]] coverage—for example, when, in a football game, a previously unknown player begins to have what looks to become an outstanding day, the character generator [[Operator (profession)|operator]] can rapidly build a new graphic using the template "shell" of a similarly-designed graphic. The character generator is one of many technologies used to meet the demands of live television, where events on the field or in the [[newsroom]] dictate the direction of the coverage. As character generator development has progressed, the distinction between hardware and software generators has become less distinct as new platforms and operating systems evolve to meet the live television consumer's expectations.

==Methods==

Before character generators were available, the primary method of adding titles to video images was to dedicate one camera to shooting white letters on a black background, which then was combined with the video from a live-action camera to form what appeared to be a single image with white letters seemingly superimposed over it. In fact, to this day (and despite the fact that this technology is long-since antiquated by the modern CG) some directors of live TV continue to order the [[technical director]] (TD) to "add the super" when they want the CG output "superimposed" over the image of another camera. As technology advanced, the ability to "key" ([[compositing]]) these white letters over live video became available, involving electronically "cutting a hole" (analogous to cutting a keyhole) in the shape of the letters from the title camera and then electronically adding the letters to the holes cut into the live action camera image. Again, some directors still call this "keying the graphic". Finally, the modern CG allowed not only more precise and realistic "keying", but also the addition of multiple picture elements from the CG to further the illusion of a 3-dimensional graphic physically overlying a video image. The addition of full-[[motion graphics]] from the CG and the animation of graphic elements by the CG blur the line between "character generator" and "[[computer graphics]]", combining the CG's ability to elegantly present graphics and video with the computer's ability to interface with game scoring and timing systems, to keep running totals of an athlete's performance on the field or the court and to derive statistics both for individual players and the teams involved, and to interface with computer systems located at other game venues or at a [[television network]]'s [[master control]] central broadcast center. On televised sporting events, [[score bug]]s are present. They contain CG data from that game, CG data from other games in progress, other games already completed, and games yet to come, all in an effort to keep the viewer from having to "[[channel surf]]" to another station to watch another [[television program]]. Viewers who do not change channels watch the first channel's [[television advertising]] (also included in CG output) which then generates [[revenue]] for the television network.

Although the distinction between hardware and software CGs is becoming less evident as technology advances, and as consumer-grade computing equipment becomes more graphically sophisticated, it remains easiest to view CG's as either hardware- or software-dependent.

==Hardware character generators==

[[File:Sony XV-T33F creates title Wikipedia.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=58.0|right|Creation of a title with the above shown hardware character generator (1994; the menu displayed on the TV screen is controlled by the pen movement on the drawing area)]]
Hardware character generators are used in [[television studio]]s and [[video editing]] suites. A [[desktop publishing]]-like interface can be used to generate static and moving text or graphics, which the device then encodes into some high-quality video signal, like digital [[Serial Digital Interface]] (SDI) or analog [[component video]], [[High-definition television|high definition]] or even [[RGB]] video. They also provide a [[Keying (graphics)|key]] signal, which the compositing [[vision mixer]] can use as an [[alpha channel]] to determine which areas of the CG video are translucent.

==Software character generators==
Software CGs run on standard off-the-shelf computer hardware and are often integrated into [[video editing software]] such as [[non-linear editing system]] (NLE). Some stand-alone character generator products are available, however, for applications that do not even attempt to offer text generation on their own, as high-end [[video editing]] software often does, or whose internal CG effects are not flexible and powerful enough. Some software CGs can be used in live production with special software and computer video interface cards. In that case, they are equivalent to hardware generators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Cinemax Comedy Experiment''' was an [[anthology series]] broadcast on [[Cinemax]] throughout the mid-to-late 1980s. Every episode was written and directed by a different [[standup comedy|standup comedian]]; the gimmick of the series was that Cinemax placed no limits on what could be presented in the show, allowing the comedians total creative freedom. The series came out of a time in the history of [[cable television]] when comedy programs were considered premium content due to the high grosses of comedy films at the box office. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/18/arts/cinemax-experimenting-in-comedy.html Farber, Stephen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

'''Colorforms''' is a creative [[toy]] named for the simple shapes and forms cut from colored vinyl sheeting that cling to a smooth backing surface without adhesives. These pieces are used to create picture graphics and designs, which can then be changed countless times by repositioning the removable color forms. The name also refers to the specific [[registered trademark symbol|registered]] [[trademark]] brand these products are produced under, as well as the company that manufactures the toys, '''Colorforms Brand, LLC.'''

Sets initially featured basic geometric shapes and bright primary colors on black or white backgrounds. Eventually, however, the Colorforms line evolved to include full-color illustrated play sets, games and puzzles, interactive books and creative activity sets for children of all ages. The licensing of media properties related to contemporary [[Popular culture|pop culture]] became integral to the product and company's success. Since its inception, more than a billion Colorforms play sets have been produced and sold.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Design==
Colorforms are sheet-thin, die-cut [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] pieces, in colorful geometric "forms" and abstract shapes (figural or object), often with over-printed images that are to be attached to a smooth plastic laminated [[paperboard]] background, much like placing [[paper doll]]s against a paper backdrop. The pieces stick to the background without chemical or static [[adhesion]], and in a secure, but non-permanent manner when a [[vacuum]] is created between the two polished surfaces, holding the piece in place. The Colorforms vinyl pieces can then be repositioned on the board a virtually unlimited number of times to create new designs and scenarios. The sets aide in promoting creative expression, concentration skills, comprehension of spatial relationships, and manual dexterity in young children.

==History==
The Colorforms concept was developed by Harry and Patricia Kislevitz in 1951, firmly rooted in the [[Modernism|Modernist]] design ethos and reflecting the [[Color Field]] abstract style prevalent at the time.

The basic concept behind Colorforms is the ability to adhere and reposition abstract and geometric color form shapes on random surfaces to create art. Both recent art students, the couple discovered the idea when they acquired several rolls of flexible paper-thin colored vinyl used to manufacture plastic pocketbooks, and found that it would stick to the glossy paint in their bathroom and allow them to reposition it at will without affecting either surface. Simply cutting shapes out of the material and sticking them to the wall turned out to be amusing enough that they left extra vinyl with a pair of scissors for guests to add to their creation. The positive reactions they got to the project led Harry to believe there was market potential for a product.

The original Colorforms sets were spiral-bound booklets hand-assembled by the husband and wife team in their New York city apartment. The first 1,000 sets were sold '[[Proof of concept|on concept]]' to the [[FAO Schwarz]] toy store. Shallow boxed sets containing screen-printed, die-cut pieces, and illustrated backgrounds began appearing soon after. The company used the slogan ''"It's More Fun To Play The Colorforms Way!"'' in print ads and television commercials to promote their products. Prominent graphic designer [[Paul Rand]] was commissioned to create the company logo that remains in use today; he also gave input for a 'signature' edition play set.

The company rarely employed an in-house creative staff, relying instead on the Kislevitz' own artistic direction provided to top freelance illustrators for layouts and finished work. Indeed, even the company's [[creative director]] from 1965 until 1986, toy designer and inventor [[Mel Birnkrant]], was not a formal Colorforms employee, working instead for a [[royalties|royalty]] percentage.

The defining feature of most Colorforms play sets is their signature plastic ‘Stick-Ons™’ that can be placed and repositioned on top of graphic backgrounds to create endless scenes and scenarios at a child's whim.

==Company timeline==

==Products==
Original character sets focused on household themes such as Miss Weather, a girl whose wardrobe changed with the weather, and Miss Cookie's Kitchen, a woman with a variety of kitchen tools and utensils. Later sets relied on the use of licensed cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse, and Gumby. Colorforms products have expanded beyond the simple "paper doll" concept to more than 75 Colorforms toy products currently in distribution, with more added every year.

==Licensed characters==
The first Colorforms product to utilize a licensed character property featured [[Popeye]], the [[King Features Syndicate]] cartoon character, released as a boxed set in 1957. Since then, licensed products have remained critically important to the Colorforms marketing strategy, with hundreds of brands connected to Colorforms. Later Colorforms licensed various properties, producing sets supporting varied cartoons, TV series, movie releases, and popular musical artists, like [[The Beatles]], ''[[Peanuts]]'', ''[[Gumby]]*'', ''[[Tarzan]]'', ''[[The Three Stooges]]'', ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Do little]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] (along with a whole pantheon of comic book super heroes), and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', [[Michael Jackson]], ''[[The Smurfs]]'', and even ''[[Steve Urkel]]''.

In a licensing twist, Colorforms developed their own character property, [[Sugar &amp; Spice (Colorforms)|Sugar &amp; Spice]] to compete with [[Strawberry Shortcake]] (1979) when master license holder, [[Kenner Products]] would not allow wide usage of character rights throughout the toy industry. Colorforms turned around and sold their character concept to other companies that got shut out of the 'Shortcake' craze. Another property that Colorforms was never able to translate into their own form was the lucrative ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise, again because Kenner held the toy products master license very tightly.

==Other products==
In 1968, saw an interesting diversion from the typical 2-dimensional toy lines that Colorforms specialized in, when they released The [[Outer Space Men]] (a.k.a. Colorform Aliens) bendy [[action figure]]s. This group of aliens, hailing from other planets in our [[Solar System]] were designed to tie into the popularity of [[Mattel|Mattel's]] [[Major Matt Mason]] astronaut line (1966); Colorforms nicely complimented the larger manufacturer's line due to Mattel's dearth of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] adversaries. Colorforms also offered a respectable [[Counterfeit consumer goods|'knockoff']] of the [[Silly Putty]] concept—the pliable rubbery clay-like substance that picked up newspaper-ink images when pressed upon them, with ''Moon Putty'' and ''Monster Print Putty.'' The former packaged in a hard plastic moon container, and the latter, packed in a little plastic human skull for heightened "monster" effect.

The Colorforms company was the major licensee of the [[Plasticine]] brand of modeling clay in the United States from 1979 until at least 1984; Plasticine is a non-drying putty-like modeling material made from a proprietary mix chalk and vasoline. This provided Colorforms with a viable competing product against [[Hasbro]]'s [[Play-Doh]].

Colorforms acquired the rights to license and distribute [[Shrinky Dinks]] in 1981, and continued creating and promoting their products until the brand was sold to Milton Bradley in 1988.

The company has also, at times, carried a wide range of children's board games, and both child-targeted, and high-end jigsaw puzzles.

==9 Story Ownership (2018-present)==
In 1997, Colorforms was acquired by [[Toy Biz]]. A year later, Colorforms was sold off to [[University Games Corporation]]. In September 2014, it became a new division of [[Out of the Blue Enterprises]], as Colorforms Brand, LLC. In January 2018, Toronto-based [[9 Story Media Group]] acquired Out of the Blue also inheriting Colorforms&lt;ref&gt;http://kidscreen.com/2018/01/12/9-story-bolsters-us-presence-with-out-of-the-blue-acquisition/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Conga (disambiguation)}}
[[File:US Navy 081203-N-7446H-004 Sailors from various Yokosuka commands form a conga line with students and members of the Yokosuka Social Welfare Center.jpg|thumb|280px|A conga line formed during a Christmas [[disco]] party.]]
The '''conga line''' is a [[Novelty and fad dances|novelty]] [[line dance]] that was derived from the [[Cuba]]n [[Conga (music)|carnival dance of the same name]] and became popular in the US in the 1930s and 1950s. The dancers form a long, processing line, which would usually turn into a [[circle dance|circle]]. It has three [[shuffle step]]s on the beat, followed by a kick that is slightly ahead of the fourth beat. The conga, a term sometimes mistakenly believed to be derived from the African [[Kingdom of Kongo|region of Congo]], is both a lyrical and danceable genre, rooted in the music of carnival troupes or [[comparsa]]s.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Pablo Julian. "Conga", ''People, History, Culture of Cuba''. Luis Martinel-Fernandez, D.H. Figneredo, Louis A. Perez, Jr. and Luis Gonzales. London, Westpoint Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2003. 396-397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The conga dance was believed to have been brought over from Africa by slaves in the West Indies,&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
and became a popular street dance in Cuba. The style was appropriated by politicians during the early years of republic
in an attempt to appeal to the masses before election. During the [[Gerardo Machado|Machado]] dictatorship in Cuba, [[Havana]] citizens were forbidden to dance the conga, because rival groups would work themselves to high excitement and explode into street fighting. When [[Fulgencio Batista]] became president in the 1940s, he permitted people to dance congas during elections, but a police permit was required.&lt;ref name="orovio"&gt;Orovio, Helio. ''Cuban music from A to Z''. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The conga dance style is more of a march, which is characterized by its distinctive [[conga drum]] rhythm. It differs from the [[Cuban rumba]], which uses more hip movements and shows the sensually aggressive attitude of each dancer. [[Conga music]] is played with a [[staccato]] beat as its base, which gives [[rhythm]] to the movements of the dancers. Conga dancers lift their legs in time with the rhythm of the music, marking each beat with the strong motion of their body.

The basic [[dance steps]] start from left leg 1-2-3 kick then repeat, opposite. Originally, a band member wearing a drum would venture onto the dance floor and begin zig-zagging around while drumming out the rhythm. Dancers would start joining up behind the drummer, forming a line that moved like a slithering snake in an open circle. The line (or the circular chain) would grow longer and the drumming more intense until it finally stopped. The dance has two styles, which is a single line form and partners. The single line is more popular in Cuba.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;

== Western popularity ==
Beginning in the late 1930s and booming in the 1940s, it became wildly popular in the [[US]], due in no small measure to Hollywood's "Latin" musicals.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; [[RKO Pictures]]' offerings were particularly influential, notably ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]'' (1940), in which [[Desi Arnaz]] appeared as a conga-playing Argentine student.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; Spanish-Catalan bandleader [[Xavier Cugat]], who gave Arnaz his musical start, helped to popularize the dance, but the biggest impact belonged to Arnaz himself.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; It is prominently featured in the 1941 [[Deanna Durbin]] film, [[It Started With Eve]], in which [[Deanna Durbin|Durbin]] and [[Charles Laughton]] dance it together in a nightclub.

With its simple march step, the interlinking of dancers circling about in single file, and one-two-three-bump rhythm with the fourth beat strongly marked, the dance was not only attractive but also readily accessible to US and other foreign audiences. The dance started to gain a foothold in the US around 1929, when the original La Conga nightclub opened its doors in [[Manhattan]]. It is believed that the La Conga was at Broadway and 51st Street.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;[http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3conga.htm  Watson, Sonny. "Conga", ''Street Swing''. 1999. August 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, the conga was well known in New York.

The widespread popularity of the dance resulted in many cultural references in contemporary media. For example, the conga line was a recurring theme in [[Warner Bros.]] animated cartoons of the 1940s.

This music and dance form has become totally assimilated into Cuba's musical heritage and has been used in many film soundtracks in the US and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="orovio" /&gt; One of the earliest and most successful of 20th-century Cuban musical exports, the conga lacked the polyrhythmic sophistication of the [[son (music)|son]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], or [[salsa music|salsa]] but served to nurture the future receptivity of an international public to the wider gamut of Cuban musical styles.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The video game Team Fortress 2 has adopted the conga as an in game "taunt", and has become a notable feature in the game, often being parodied in fan-made content such as animations or add-ons to the game.

The conga has been featured in countless films and TV series', though in most cases it was intended to serve as a distraction for the main characters to slip away silently.

In 1984 the British band [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace]] reached number 10 in the UK charts &lt;ref name="everyhit"&gt;[http://www.everyhit.com/ EveryHit.com] - search for "Black Lace" as "Name of artist" and "Do the Conga" as "Title of song"&lt;/ref&gt; with the song "Do the Conga".

The long-time jingle for [[Dad's Root Beer|Dad's Old-Fashioned Root Beer]] employed a conga beat.

== Career ==
She auditioned for [[AKB48]] and, after becoming a reserve, she was recommended for NMB48's third-generation members. She passed the audition and became the first captain of the newly founded Team BII in 2012.

In 2013, in the Janken Taikai, she got the second position&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2013/09/19/142/|title=松井珠理奈VS上枝恵美加、勝敗を分けた"経験"と"勘" - AKB48じゃんけん大会|last=Corporation|first=Mynavi|website=マイナビニュース|language=ja-JP|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which granted her to appear in a single for AKB48.

In March 2015 she announced she would be taking a hiatus of her activities as an idol in order to focus on her studies and going abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoshidoru48.blogspot.jp/2015/04/kamieda-emika-will-cease-her-nmb.html|title=Kamieda Emika will cease her NMB activities temporarily|website=hoshidoru48.Blogspot.jp|access-date=December 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-month pause she joined back his team in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2059927/full/|title=NMB・上枝恵美加、休業からの本格復帰を宣言「これからも引っ張って行きたい」|work=ORICON NEWS|access-date=2017-06-12|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from community college in 2016.

After the general NMB48 shuffle of late 2016, Kamieda was appointed member of Team M.

In 2017 she started hosting a radio program twice a month with Anna Ijiri (former vice-captain of Team BII) called Unlimited.

In order to pursue her acting career, on July 2, 2017, she announced her graduation making the stage performance of July 31 her last appearance as an NMB48 member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20170731-01865197-nksports-ent|title=ＮＭＢ上枝恵美加が卒業「私にしか出来ない道を」（日刊スポーツ） - Yahoo!ニュース|trans-title=|work=Yahoo!ニュース|access-date=2017-08-04|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamieda's hobbies are horse-back riding, [[One Piece]], beatboxing, and dancing.

She can speak English fluently (as seen in co-hosting the show Tanieda English 谷枝イングリッシュ with Airi Tanigawa)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://48videodouga.net/index.php?schbox=TaniEda%20English|title=TaniEda English|website=48videodouga.net|language=en|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ynnnmb48channel.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/%E8%B0%B7%E6%9E%9D%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5|title=谷枝イングリッシュ - YNN NMB48 CHANNEL|trans-title=|website=ynnnmb48channel.wiki.fc2.com|language=ja|access-date=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and has studied on a short-term period exchange in [[Australia]], she can use Spanish to some extent since she is living in Spain

'''''Forced''''' is a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] and [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]] [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Betadwarf|BetaDwarf]], released in October 2013 for [[Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] through the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform as well as [[Wii U]]. It is about gladiators fighting for their freedom in a fantasy arena and are assisted by a spirit-like character called Balfus. Gameplay consists of selecting a weapon class and abilities to combat the various enemies of each arena, while solving puzzles using the help of Balfus. BetaDwarf was formed by a small group of students in 2011, who began developing the game in an unused classroom in [[Aalborg University – Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. They were removed months later and launched a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign involving an [[Imgur]] picture which documented their progress. ''Forced'' received moderate to favorable reviews with most critics praising its competitive gameplay and puzzle-system. The game's weak plot, technical glitches and excess difficulty were the negative highlights. It won the Level Up 2013 Intel award and BetaDwarf received the Danish Developer Of The Year (2013) for it.

==Gameplay==
''Forced'' is an [[action role-playing game]]&lt;ref name=IGLeRay /&gt; having a [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] view for up to four players in the combat arena. Players have to select a weapon, which have 16 unlockable abilities each, similar to a [[character class]]. Though single player mode is also available, the game is mostly about [[cooperative gameplay]] by selecting a weapon class and abilities which complement the other players', while combating demons of various sizes and solving environmental puzzles—using a [[will-o-wisp]]-like companion called Balfus the Spirit Mentor.&lt;ref name=RPSRossignol&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rossignol|first1=Jim|title=Wot I Think: Forced|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/11/01/wot-i-think-forced/|publisher=Rock Paper Shotgun|accessdate=2014-06-22|date=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Forced gameplay.jpeg|thumb|The Mark combat system and the interaction with Balfus are the special features in ''Forced''. Here one player fights three enemies (image cropped and [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] not visible), with each hit giving them marks (in white, above their [[health (gaming)|health]] bars). The player ordered Balfus (top-left) to move over the shrine nearby, causing him to have a green circular healing aura.]]
There are four weapon classes: the Storm Bow, the Volcanic Hammer, the Spirit Knives, and the Frost Shield;&lt;ref name="hardcore gamer review" /&gt; each have the tactical roles of a long range attacker, slow melee attacker, fast melee attacker and a [[tank (gaming)|tank]] respectively. The active and passive abilities available for each class allow some form of customization.&lt;ref name=IGLeRay&gt;{{cite web|last1=LeRay|first1=Lena|title=Forced forces mighty fine co-op play|url=http://indiegames.com/2013/10/forced_forces_co-op_play_at_it.html|publisher=IndieGames.com|accessdate=2014-06-24|date=October 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007014947/http://indiegames.com/2013/10/forced_forces_co-op_play_at_it.html|archivedate=2013-10-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weapon class and selected abilities (which also have [[cooldown]]s) can be changed before the start of any arena level. Each player must choose a different weapon class. Balfus can be made to interact with the environment's [[spiritual plane]] by ordering him to activate or trigger props like healing pedestals or set off a stunning blast from traps.&lt;ref name=RPSRossignol/&gt;&lt;ref name=RPGWelhouse&gt;{{cite web|last1=Welhouse|first1=Zach|title=FORCED - Staff Review|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/indie/forced/reviews/forcedstrev1.html|publisher=RPGamer|accessdate=2014-06-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209175541/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/indie/forced/reviews/forcedstrev1.html|archivedate=2014-02-09|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can travel with the characters, float in space or can be called to their location.&lt;ref name=RPGFRichardson /&gt; Good positioning and communication will help the players use Balfus efficiently; the need to do this while facing waves of enemies, makes the game more challenging.&lt;ref name=IGLeRay/&gt;

Gems are rewarded after completion of each arena trial. They can be used to enhance the weapons by unlocking more ability slots and new abilities at regular intervals. Each trial contains three gems as a reward. The first requires completion, the second is a specific challenge and the third is a time trial. If the arena boss is too difficult, it is possible to complete all these challenges to earn extra gems. ''Forced'' has a Mark Combat System,&lt;ref name=Gama&gt;{{cite web|title=Award-winning Indie Forced Headed to Gamescom, PAX Prime|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/198326/Awardwinning_Indie_Forced_Headed_to_Gamescom_PAXPrime.php|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=2014-06-23|date=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where weapons cause marks on the enemies. Greater number of marks cause certain abilities to have better effects, thus making it more effective to hit a group of enemies a few times before using an ability, rather than using it at the start. Though the difficulty increases in proportion to the number of players and sharing Balfus needs communication between them, multiplayer is easier and lets the player focus on specific abilities and tactical roles instead of being forced to cover every possibility in single player; also, if a player dies, the trial can be completed as long as another survives till the end.&lt;ref name=RPGWelhouse/&gt;

==Plot==
The players are cast as slaves who are forced to fight in a fantasy gladiator arena, which is reason for the game title.&lt;ref name=RPSRossignol/&gt; The slaves are from a village where people are bred solely to be gladiators and fight for the pleasure of demon types to win their freedom. The players have the help of Balfus, a Spirit Mentor, and need to overcome the challenges and defeat the guardians of each arena. Spirit Mentors guide gladiators through the arena and Balfus is revealed to have done so for previous dead gladiators before the player. Balfus remains the source of drama since the protagonists are silent throughout the game and the antagonists do not go beyond taunting them.&lt;ref name=RPGWelhouse/&gt;

In their first arena fight, they defeat the guardian called "Wrathhoof", who refuses to accept defeat to let them pass to the next arena. Despite Balfus' warning that this would be against the rules, Wrathhoof continues to attack the players who then kill him. The players and Balfus try to keep this murder of a guardian a secret and embark to the next arena, where the next guardian Slarth, discovers what they did. Slarth and the next guardian Graw are revealed to be former gladiators themselves and Balfus, their mentor. The players then defeat and kill Slarth. On killing Graw, Balfus decides to end this gladiator event by killing the remaining guardian Mordar and the final guardian called "The Master".

==Development==

''Forced'' won the  Level Up 2013 Intel award and BetaDwarf received the Danish Developer Of The Year at the 2013 Spilprisen game awards held by the Danish Producers Association.&lt;ref name=Gama /&gt;&lt;ref name=Edge&gt;{{cite journal|title=Region Specific profile: BetaDwarf|journal=Edge|date=August 4, 2013|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/region-specific-profile-betadwarf/|accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received moderate to favorable reviews. Brittany Vincent of [[Hardcore Gamer]] gave the game a 4/5, calling it "a gleeful return to form for cooperative play."&lt;ref name="hardcore gamer review" /&gt; [[Jim Rossignol]] from [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] called it a "competently produced game" but said that it "simply lacks flair, and combined with the slightly awkward mechanics in co-op play, means it never feels wholly convincing."&lt;ref name=RPSRossignol/&gt; Lena LeRay from [[IndieGames.com]] felt the voice acting was mediocre and acknowledged the lack of depth in the plot but said that the "engaging gameplay" compensated it.&lt;ref name=IGLeRay/&gt; Bob Richardson from RPGFan also highlighted these issues in addition to various technical glitches in multiplayer.&lt;ref name=RPGFRichardson/&gt; Richardson praised the gameplay, the puzzle system and the skill customization, giving the game 80% rating.&lt;ref name=RPGFRichardson/&gt; He said, "''Forced'' is purely an intrinsic experience: defeat is the result of lack of cooperation and skill, and victory is directly related to teamwork, communication, and aptitude."&lt;ref name=RPGFRichardson/&gt;

Zach Welhouse from RPGamer gave it a 3/5 calling the combat "complex and rewarding" and multiplayer "a good balance of tactics and adrenaline."&lt;ref name=RPGWelhouse/&gt; He also praised the music, Balfus's character and called the puzzle-solving system "unique" but noted the bare plot and game difficulty as its negative highlights.&lt;ref name=RPGWelhouse/&gt; Welhouse commented, "The sheer number of ways to die makes it difficult to tell how much of ''Forced'' is unfair and how much is a series of lessons in avoiding dangerous situations to unlock a new ability is a compelling system for squeezing the most effort out of a player."&lt;ref name=RPGWelhouse/&gt; Jason Venter from [[GameSpot]], gave it 5/10 and said, "It's a challenging game with built-in reasons to revisit familiar areas, but it's also too demanding for its own good, and the results are more frustrating than satisfying."&lt;ref name=GSVenter/&gt; Mike Gunn from NZGamer.com gave it 8.6/10 and said, "Such a simple game, but one with a lot of tactical and strategic depth."&lt;ref name=NZGGunn/&gt;

A '''four-color deck''' is identical to the standard [[French deck]] except for the color of the [[suit (cards)|suits]].  In a typical English four-color deck, hearts are red and spades are black as usual, but clubs are green and diamonds are blue.&lt;ref name=pcg1&gt;Pollett, Andrea. [http://a_pollett.tripod.com/cards19.htm Sizes, Shapes and Colours] at Andy's Playing Cards. Retrieved 15 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other color combinations have been used over the centuries, in other areas or for certain games.

== No-revoke decks ==
[[File:Skatblatt Turnierbild.jpg|thumb|left|Skat tournament deck]]
[[File:Tarok American Card.jpg|thumb|right|Tarock deck by Petrtyl &amp; Son]]
Four-color decks made for [[trick-taking game]]s such as [[contract bridge|bridge]], [[whist]], or [[jass]] are often called '''no-revoke decks''' because they are perceived to reduce the risk of a player accidentally [[revoke|revoking]] (illegally playing a card of a suit other than that led). Dozens of card manufacturers have developed four-colored suit cards for bridge during the 1900s and continue into this century. 

The earliest such deck in the US is by J. Y. Humphreys who created the "Seminole Wars Deck" in 1819, which had four colored suits of blue spades, green clubs, red hearts and yellow diamonds.&lt;ref name=Hochman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dawson|first1=Tom|last2=Dawson|first2=Judy|title=The Hochman Encyclopedia of American Playing Cards|date=2014|publisher=Conjuring Arts Research Center|location=New York|pages=233-238|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German game of [[skat (card game)|skat]] the official tournament standard since the 1990s is to use a no-revoke deck known as a ''Turnierbild'' deck.  In these decks, spades are green and diamonds are yellow, the clubs and hearts being respectively black and red as normal, which also reflects the suit order: clubs, spades, hearts, diamonds. This is intended as a compromise for players (typically from former [[East Germany]]) who prefer [[German playing cards|German suits]] over French; the green spades translate to ''leaves'' and the yellow diamonds to ''bells'' in the German suits.&lt;ref name=pcg1/&gt;

In 1922, August Petrtyl &amp; Son produced a [[Tarot card game|tarock]] deck with black clubs, yellow diamonds, pink hearts, and green spades in the United States. They were sold in two versions, a full 78-card deck and a 54-card deck.&lt;ref name=Hochman/&gt; The smaller deck is structured the same as ''[[Industrie und Glück]]'' decks as it was designed to play a variant of [[Königrufen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|date=2009|publisher=Maproom Publications|location=Oxford|pages=S 39-S 43|edition=Supplement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poker ==
A four-color deck for poker using the black spades, red hearts, green clubs, and blue diamonds was developed and publicized by [[Mike Caro]]. It was introduced at his World Poker Finals at [[Foxwoods Resort Casino]] in 1992. His original design was not a success as the colors were a surprise to players.&lt;ref&gt;"Mike Caro's Four Color Deck" by Diane McHaffie, Poker Player February, 2006 issue&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Poker Tour]] uses the same colors as Caro's deck to display the players' cards for increased visibility on small television screens.

Four-color decks have become a somewhat popular option in [[online poker]] software interfaces since often each player may use their preferred design of [[playing cards]] without affecting others' experience, and since visibility is not as good on a small screen as in face-to-face play, especially as many online players play multiple tables simultaneously, with shorter time limits in which to make decisions. Having each suit represented by a different color can allow players to more easily recognize a [[flush (poker)|flush]].

'''''Josie and the Pussycats''''' (formatted as '''''Josie and the Pussy Cats''''' in the opening titles) is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]], based upon the [[Archie Comics]] [[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)|comic book series of the same name]] created by [[Dan DeCarlo]]. Produced for [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning television]] by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]], sixteen episodes of ''Josie and the Pussycats'' aired on CBS during the 1970–71 television season and were rerun during the 1971–72 season. In 1972, the show was re-conceptualized as '''''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space''''', sixteen episodes of which aired on CBS during the 1972–73 season and were rerun the following season until January 1974. Reruns of the original series alternated between CBS, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and [[NBC]] from 1974 through 1976.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons’ Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records&lt;/ref&gt; This brought its national Saturday morning TV run on three networks to six years.

''Josie and the Pussycats'' featured an all-girl [[pop rock|pop music]] band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. On the [[Television|small-screen]], the group consisted of level-headed lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Josie, intelligent bassist Valerie, and air-headed [[blonde]] drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III,  his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular [[roadie]] Alan.

The show, more similar to Hanna-Barbera's successful ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' than the original ''Josie'' comic book, is famous for its music, the girls' leopard print [[leotard]]s (replete with "long tails and ears for hats," as the theme song states), and for featuring Valerie as the first regularly appearing female [[African American|black]] character in a Saturday morning cartoon show.&lt;ref&gt;Charles, Don. Long Tails and Ears for Hats: The Story of Josie and The Pussy Cats.&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode featured a Josie and the Pussycats song played over a chase scene, which, in a similar fashion to ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', featured the group running after and from a selection of haplessly villainous characters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Creation and development==

===Origins===
During the 1968-69 television season, the first ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]''-based Saturday morning cartoon, ''[[The Archie Show]],'' was a huge success, not only in the ratings on [[CBS]], but also on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts: [[The Archies]]' song "[[Sugar, Sugar]]" hit the #1 spot on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts in September 1969, becoming the number one song of the year. Animation studio [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] wanted to duplicate the success their competitors [[Filmation]] were having with ''[[The Archie Show]]''. After a failed attempt at developing a teenage-music-band show of their own called ''[[Scooby-Doo|Mysteries Five]]'' (which eventually became ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]''), they decided to go to the source and contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting one of their remaining properties into a show similar to ''The Archie Show.'' Archie and Hanna-Barbera collaborated to adapt Archie's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie]]'' comic book into a music-based property about a teenage music band, adding new characters (Alan M. and Valerie) while dismissing others.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley, Ian (2005). ''Can Rock and Roll Save the World? A History of Music and Comics''. SAF Publishing Ltd. pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===The music===
{{Main article|Josie and the Pussycats (album)}}

In preparation for the upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera began working on putting together a real-life [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also record an album of songs to be used both as radio singles and in the TV series.

The [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] recordings were produced by La La Productions, run by Danny Janssen and Bobby Young. They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability; early plans, which did not come to fruition, called for a live-action Pussycats segment at the end of each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sue Sheridan |url=http://donosdump.com/Jozine/SueSharidan.html |title=Sue Sheridan liner notes |publisher=Donosdump.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Kathleen Dougherty (Cathy Dougher) as Josie, [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]] (later known as Cheryl Ladd) as Melody, and [[Patrice Holloway]] as Valerie.

Janssen presented the newly formed band to [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] to finalize the production deal. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast [[Patrice Holloway]], because they had decided to portray "Josie and the Pussycats" as an all-white trio and had altered Valerie, who had been conceived as [[African-American]] and was already appearing as such in Archie Comics' revamped ''Josie and the Pussycats'' comic book, to make her white. Janssen refused to recast Holloway and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented and allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being African-American.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes from ''Josie and the Pussycats: Stop Look and Listen: The Capitol Recordings'' [CD Set]. Burbank: Rhino Handmade. Text available at http://www.geocities.com/antlion7/josie.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The Valerie character was the first African-American female character on a regular Saturday morning cartoon series. ''[[The Hardy Boys (1969 TV series)|The Hardy Boys]]'' drummer Pete Jones had been the first African-American male to appear on Saturday mornings a year earlier.

===Theme song===
The show's theme song, titled "Josie and the Pussycats", was written by [[Hoyt Curtin]], [[William Hanna]] (under the pseudonym "Denby Williams")  and [[Joseph Barbera]] (under the pseudonym "Joseph Roland"). Patrice Holloway, the singing voice of Valerie, sings the lead vocal on the recording. The theme song was based on melodies from an incidental tune played on various Hanna-Barbera cartoons since ''[[The Jetsons]]''.

A cover of "Josie and the Pussycats" performed by [[Juliana Hatfield]] and [[Tanya Donelly]] is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].&lt;ref&gt;CD liner notes: Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series overview==
''Josie and the Pussycats'' debuted on the [[CBS]] [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup on September 12, 1970, with the episode "The Nemo's a No-No Affair." The animated version of ''Josie'' was an amalgam of plot devices, villain types, settings, moods, and tones from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Space Ghost]]'', and ''[[Shazzan]]''.

Like ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was originally broadcast with a [[laugh track]]. Later home video and DVD releases omit the laugh track. [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], however, have aired the show its original broadcast format with laughter intact.

===Plot===
Each episode would find the Pussycats and crew en route to perform a gig or record a song in some exotic location. Somehow, often due to something Alexandra did, they would accidentally find themselves mixed up in an adventure/mystery. The antagonist was always a diabolical mad scientist, spy, or criminal who wanted to take over the world using some hi-tech device. The Pussycats would usually find themselves in possession of the plans for an invention, an item of interest to the villains, a secret spy message, etc., and the villains would give chase. Eventually, the Pussycats would formulate a plan to destroy the villain's plans and bring them to justice, which result in a final chase sequence set to a Pussycats song.

The Pussycats would succeed in capturing the villain and get back to their gig/recording session/etc. The final gag always centered around one of Alexandra's attempts to interfere with/put an end to The Pussycats' performance and/or steal Alan away from Josie, which would always backfire on her.

==Characters==
* '''Josephine "Josie" McCoy''' (voiced by [[Janet Waldo]]/sung by Cathy Dougher) - The red-headed lead singer, songwriter, guitarist and leader of the band. Josie shares an attraction with Alan, the road manager.
* '''Valerie Brown''' (voiced by Barbara Pariot/sung by [[Patrice Holloway]]) - The band's African American bassist and backup singer. The voice of reason in the group, Valerie is highly intelligent and a mechanical wizard.
* '''Melody Valentine''' (voiced by [[Jackie Joseph]]/sung by [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]]) - The band's drummer and backup singer and a stereotypical [[dumb blonde]]. What Melody lacks in intellect she makes up for in heart; to wit, her perpetual sweetness and optimism.  Her ears twitch when the group is in danger.
* '''Alan M. Mayberry''' (voiced by [[Jerry Dexter]]) - The group's tall, blond and muscular roadie and Josie's love interest.
* '''Alexander Cabot III''' (voiced by [[Casey Kasem]]) - the group's manager, highly identifiable by his brightly-colored mod wardrobe, sunglasses, and idiotic promotion schemes; he is the twin brother of Alexandra.  Alexander is an admitted coward, but in sharp contrast to his sister Alexandra, is good-hearted.  Alexander and Valerie have a slight attraction to one another at times. He also seems to be attracted to Melody. Alexander is similar and shares the resemblance of [[Shaggy Rogers]] in Scooby-Doo. In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' crossover episode "The Haunted Showboat", Casey Kasem voices both Alexander Cabot III and Shaggy Rogers.
* '''Alexandra Cabot''' (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni]]) - The only girl who is not a Pussycat, identified by her long black pony-tailed hair with a white streak through the center of it, suggesting a pole-cat, or skunk. Mean and bullying, Alexandra is Alexander's twin sister but otherwise has no identifiable role with the band nor any reason for associating with it. She is constantly bitter and jealous of the band's success without her, believing that she should be "the ''real'' star of the band," and constantly plots to steal the spotlight (and Alan's affections) from Josie, only to have every scheme fail in humiliating fashion. Despite her jealousy, she remains loyal to the group and will usually fight with them against villains, using her brash personality to intimidate the opposition.
* '''Sebastian''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]) - Alexandra's snickering cat, whose black and white fur resembles Alexandra's hair and whose utterances sound the same as another Messick character, [[Muttley]].  He enjoys being mean and sometimes appears to go to the enemy's side, but usually only to trick the villain so he can have a chance to help the group escape. He sometimes uses his claws to pick locks.  Alexandra sometimes recruits Sebastian to pull dirty tricks on Josie, but even these tricks usually backfire. In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' crossover episode "The Haunted Showboat", Messick voiced both Sebastian and Scooby-Doo at the same time.
* '''Bleep''' - (also voiced by [[Don Messick]] and appears only in ''[[Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space]]'') Melody's fluffy pet alien with pink extremities. He makes a "bleep" sound (thus his name) which only Melody can understand. Bleep can also generate invisible sound waves from his mouth and eyes.

In September 1972, a sequel spin-off series titled ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' debuted on CBS. This version of the series launched the characters into outer space; the opening credits sequence shows the group taking a promotional photo at the launch site of a new spaceship and a jealous Alexandra elbowing the cast aside to steal the spotlight from Josie. However, Alexandra is jerked inside as well and triggers the launch sequence, sending them and the ship into deep space. Despite never having been in the spaceship before, Val seems to know how to pilot it.  Every episode centered on the Pussycats encountering a strange new world, where they would encounter and often be kidnapped by various alien races before escaping and attempting to return home.

Musical numbers and chase sequences set to newly recorded songs were featured in this spin-off series as with the original. ''Josie in Outer Space'' also added the character of Bleep, a pet-sized fluffy alien adopted by Melody, who was the only one who could understand the creature (who only says "Bleep") and numerous other alien animals encountered.

The 16 episodes of ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' were re-run for the 1973-1974 season until January 26, 1974, when CBS canceled it and ordered no more new ''Josie'' episodes from Hanna-Barbera. ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' contained a laugh track as well but utilized an inferior [[Laugh track#Making their own|version created by the studio]].

==After cancellation==
Josie and The Pussycats made a final appearance as animated characters in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973, episode of '' [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', "The Haunted Showboat". Early production art for Hanna-Barbera's 1977 "all-star" ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]'' spoof ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' featured Alexandra, Sebastian, Alexander, and Melody among other Hanna-Barbera characters as members of the "Scooby Doobies" team, but legal problems prevented their inclusion in the final program.

In 1976, [[Rand McNally]] published a children's book based on the ''Josie'' TV show, ''Hanna-Barbera's Josie and the Pussycats: The Bag Factory Detour''.

The original ''Josie and the Pussycats'' series was re-run on [[NBC]] Saturday morning for the 1975-1976 season, and weekdays in syndication from 1977 to 1982. In the mid-1980s, both series, along with a number of other 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons, were on board [[USA Cartoon Express|USA Network's ''Cartoon Express'']]; they would next appear on [[Cartoon Network]] in 1992, where all 32 episodes were run in the same time slot. Both programs, as of March 3, 2014, are in the library of [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] (Turner Broadcasting's archive cartoon channel).

==Reception==

''Josie and the Pussycats'' was named the 100th best animated series by entertainment website [[IGN]], which referred to ''Josie'' as an amusing show for the way in which it combined elements from ''[[The Archie Show]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''.&lt;ref name="ign100"&gt;{{cite web|title=100, Josie and the Pussycats |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/100.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-01-23 |date=2009-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119005004/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/100.html |archivedate=2009-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs and spoofs==
In 2001, Cartoon Network began airing a ''Josie and the Pussycats'' short, called "Musical Evolution", featured the Pussycats performing their theme song through the various eras of popular music, including pop, [[disco]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]-like [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[country music|country]], and [[techno music|techno]]. Different animation styles are used for each era. The same year, ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was adapted into a [[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|live-action motion picture]]. The film, produced by [[Universal Pictures]], featured a punk rock cover of the theme song during the end credits.

The 2004–2007 [[Comedy Central]] animated TV series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' featured a character named [[Foxxy Love]]. An African-American mystery-solving musician, she was a direct parody of the ''Josie and the Pussycats'' character Valerie Brown.&lt;ref&gt;M. Keith Booker (2006). ''Drawn to television: prime-time animation from the Flintstones to Family guy''. Westort, CT: Praeger Publishers/Greenwood Publishing Group. Pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Several episodes of ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', a later Hanna-Barbera show, had similar plots to ''Josie and the Pussycats'' episodes, specifically ''A Greenthumb is Not a Goldfinger'' (''Island of the Giant Plants''), ''X Marks the Spot'' (''Out of Sight''), and the ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' episode ''Warrior Women of Amazonia'' (called ''The Hidden Valley of Amazonia'' in ''Speed Buggy'').

In 2016, Josie and the Pussycats was rebooted as a comic book. This update features the origins of the band. Originally, Josie was a struggling musician who merely played an emptied bar while heckled by her former friend, Alexandra. After talking with her roommate, Melody and bringing a stray cat to the vets, they meet Valerie, a veterinarian. The trio decided to play for the Animal Shelter Fundraiser. Despite Alexandra's attempts, the trio is a success and decided to call themselves Josie and The Pussycats, where they meet the producer Alan M.

The 2017 live action TV series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' featured Josie and the Pussycats as African-American students at the local high school. [[List_of_Riverdale_characters#Josie_McCoy|Josie's]] mother is the town mayor.

{{Mesopotamian myth (7)}}

The '''Lament for Ur''', or '''Lamentation over the city of Ur''' is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[lament]] composed around the time of the fall of [[Ur]] to the [[Elamites]] and the end of the city's [[Third Dynasty of Ur|third dynasty]] (c. 2000 BC).

==Laments==

It contains one of five known [[Mesopotamia]]n "city laments"&amp;mdash;[[dirge]]s for ruined cities in the voice of the city's [[tutelary deity|tutelary goddess]].

The other city laments are:
*The [[Lament for Sumer and Ur]]
*The [[Lament for Nippur]]
*The [[Lament for Eridu]]
*The [[Lament for Uruk]]

The [[Book of Lamentations]] of the [[Old Testament]], which bewails the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of [[Babylon]] in the sixth century B.C., is similar in style and theme to these earlier [[Mesopotamia]]n laments. Similar laments can be found in the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the [[Book of Ezekiel]] and the [[Book of Psalms]], [[Psalm 137]] ({{Bibleverse||Psalms|137:1-9|HE}}), a song covered by [[Boney M]] in 1978 as [[Rivers of Babylon]].&lt;ref name="MatthewsBenjamin2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Victor Harold Matthews]]|author2=Don C. Benjamin|title=Old Testament parallels: laws and stories from the ancient Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gVAFOSDhL4C&amp;pg=PA248|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=2006|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=978-0-8091-4435-8|pages=248–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compilation==

The first lines of the lament were discovered on the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] catalogue of the [[Babylonia]]n section, tablet numbers 2204, 2270, 2302 and 19751 from their excavations at the [[temple]] [[library]] at [[Nippur]]. These were translated by [[George Aaron Barton]] in 1918 and first published as "Sumerian religious texts" in ''[[Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions]]'', number six, entitled "A prayer for the city of [[Ur]]".&lt;ref name="Barton1918"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Aaron Barton|title=Miscellaneous Babylonian inscriptions, p. 45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nn5hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 May 2011|date=1918|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restored tablet is {{convert|9|by|4.5|by|1.75|in|cm}} at its thickest point. Barton noted that "from the portions that can be translated it appears to be a prayer for the city of Ur at a time of great danger and distress. It seems impossible to assign it with certainty to any particular period." He noted that it was plausible but unconfirmed to conjecture that it "was written in the last days of [[Ibbi-Sin]] when Ur was tottering to its fall".&lt;ref name="Barton1918"/&gt;

[[Edward Chiera]] published other tablets CBS 3878, 6889, 6905, 7975, 8079, 10227, 13911 and 14110 in "Sumerian texts of varied contents" in 1934, which combined with tablets CBS 3901, 3927, 8023, 9316, 11078 and 14234 to further restore the myth, calling it a "Lamentation over the city of Ur".&lt;ref name="ChieraKramer1934"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Chiera|author2=Samuel Noah Kramer|author3=University of Pennsylvania.

[[Samuel Noah Kramer]] amongst others worked to translate several others from the Istanbul collection including Ni 4496, 1162, 2401, 2510, 2518, 2780, 2911, 3166, 4024, 4424, 4429, 4459, 4474, 4566, 9586, 9599, 9623, 9822 and 9969.&lt;ref name="Kramer1944"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=Sumerian literary texts from Nippur: in the Museum of the Ancient Orient at Istanbul, 32, 45, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 and 99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqdIGQAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1944|publisher=American Schools of Oriental Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CigKizilyay1969"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muazzez Cig|author2=Hatice Kizilyay|title=Sumerian literary tablets and fragments in the archeological museum of Istanbul-I, 81, 95, 100, 107, 115, 118, 139, 142 and 147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vrEnGwAACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|date=1969|publisher=Tarih Kurumu Basimevi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tablets from the Istanbul collection, numbers Ni 2510 and 2518 were translated  by Edward Chiera in 1924 in "Sumerian religious texts".&lt;ref name="Chieraottoman1924"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Chiera|author2=Constantinople.

Other tablets and versions were used to bring the myth to its present form with a composite text by Miguel Civil produced in 1989 and latest translations by [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] in 1987 and Joachim Krecher in 1996.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.2.2.2&amp;charenc=j# The Lament for Ur., Black, J.A., Cunningham, G., Robson, E., and Zólyomi, G., The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature, Oxford 1998-.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.4.80.2&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=&amp;lineid=c4802.B.22#c4802.B.22 ETCSLtransliteration : c.4.80.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

The lament is composed of four hundred and thirty eight lines in eleven ''kirugu'' (sections), arranged in [[stanza]]s of six lines. It describes the goddess [[Ningal]], who weeps for her city after pleading with the god [[Enlil]] to call back a destructive storm. Interspersed with the goddess's wailing are other sections, possibly of different origin and composition; these describe the [[ghost town]] that Ur has become, recount the wrath of Enlil's storm, and invoke the protection of the god [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] ([[Nergal]] or [[Suen]]) against future calamities. Ningal, the wife of the moon god Nanna, goes on to recall her petition to the leaders of the gods, [[Anu|An]] and [[Enlil]] to change their minds and not to destroy Ur.&lt;ref name="Launderville2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dale Launderville|title=Piety and politics: the dynamics of royal authority in Homeric Greece, biblical Israel, and old Babylonian Mesopotamia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4oHNWUWTSkC&amp;pg=PA248|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=2003|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3994-7|pages=248–}}&lt;/ref&gt; She does this both in private and in a speech to the [[Annunaki]] assembly:

{{cquote|I verily clasped legs, laid hold of arms, truly I shed my tears before An, truly I made supplication, I myself before Enlil: "May my city not be ravaged, I said to them, May Ur not be ravaged.&lt;ref name="Launderville2003"/&gt;}}

The [[wikt:council|council]] of gods decide that the Ur III dynasty, which had reigned for around one hundred years, had its destiny apportioned to end. The temple [[treasury]] was raided by invading [[Elam]]ites and the centre of power in Sumer moved to Isin, while control of trade in Ur passed to several leading families of the city. Kenneth Wade suggested that [[Terah]], the father of [[Abraham]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] could have been one of the heads of such a leading family ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|11:28|HE}}).&lt;ref name="Wade2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth R. Wade|title=Journey to Moriah: The Untold Story of How Abraham Became the Friend of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9tiuu1byC8C&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=February 2004|publisher=Pacific Press Publishing|isbn=978-0-8163-2024-0|pages=21–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[metaphor]] of a [[garden]] [[hut (dwelling)|hut]] being knocked down is used for the destroyed temple of Ur and in subsequent lines this metaphorical language is extended to the rest of the setting, reminiscent of the representation of Jerusalem as a "booth" in the [[Book of Amos]] ({{Bibleverse||Amos|9:11|HE}}).&lt;ref name="EllensEllens2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Harold Ellens|author2=Deborah L. Ellens|author3=Rolf P.

{{cquote|My faithful house ... like a tent, a pulled-up harvest shed, like a pulled-up harvest shed! Ur, my home filled with things, my well-filled house and city that were pulled up, were verily pulled up.&lt;ref name="EllensEllens2004"/&gt;}}

The different temples throughout the land are described with their patron gods or goddesses abandoning the temples, like [[sheepfold]]s:

{{cquote|[[Ninlil]] has abandoned that house, the Ki-ur, and has let the breezes haunt her sheepfold. The queen of [[Kesh (Sumer)|Kesh]] has abandoned it and has let the breezes haunt her sheepfold. Ninmah has abandoned that house Kesh and has let the breezes haunt her sheepfold.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

Edward L. Greenstein has noted the emptying of sheep pens as a metaphor of the destruction of the city. He also notes that the speakers of the laments are generally male lamentation-priests, who take on the characteristics of a traditional female singer and ask for the gods to be appeased so the temples can be restored. Then a goddess, sometimes accompanied by a god notes the devastation and weeps bitterly with a dirge about the destructive storm and an entreats to the gods to return to the sanctuaries. The destruction of the Elamites is compared in the myth to imagery of a rising [[flood]] and raging [[storm]]. This imagery is facilitated by the title of Enlil as the "god of the winds"&lt;ref name="Weisman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Weisman|title=The Oxford handbook of the elegy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1d5OlvBRc38C&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=6 June 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-922813-3|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following text suggests that the setting of the myth was subject to a destructive storm prior to its final destruction:&lt;ref name="Louvain1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Institut orientaliste de Louvain|title=Orientalia Lovaniensia periodica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOZtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=1977|publisher=Instituut voor Oriëntalistiek.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Alas, storm after storm swept the Land together: the great storm of heaven, the ever-roaring storm, the malicious storm which swept over the Land, the storm which destroyed cities, the storm which destroyed houses, the storm which destroyed cow-pens, the storm which burned sheepfolds, which laid hands on the holy rites, which defiled the weighty counsel, the storm which cut off all that is good from the Land.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

Various buildings are noted to be destroyed in Enlil's storm, including the shrines of Agrun-kug and Egal-mah,  the [[Ekur]] (the sanctuary of Enlil), the Iri-kug, the Eridug and the Unug.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt; The destruction of the E-kic-nu-jal is described in detail. {{cquote|The good house of the lofty untouchable mountain, E-kic-nu-jal, was entirely devoured by large axes. The people of Cimacki and Elam, the destroyers, counted its worth as only thirty shekels. They broke up the good house with pickaxes. They reduced the city to ruin mounds.&lt;ref name="ETCSL"/&gt;}}

Images of what was lost, and the scorched earth that was left behind indicate the scale of the catastrophe. The Line 274 reads {{cquote|"[[Garden of Eden|eden]] kiri-zal bi du-du-a-mu gir-gin ha-ba-hu-hur" - My [[steppe]], established for [[joy]], was scorched like an [[oven]].&lt;ref name="Michalowski1989"/&gt;}}

The destruction of the location is reported to Enlil, and his consort Ninlil, who are praised and exalted at the end of the myth.&lt;ref name="Ramet1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabrina P. Ramet|title=Gender reversals and gender cultures: anthropological and historical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDalL3qJavgC&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-11482-0|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

The Lament for Ur has been well known to scholarship and well edited for a long time. Piotr Michalowski has suggested this gave literary primacy to the myth over the [[Lament for Sumer and Ur]], originally called the "Second Lament for Ur", which he argues was chronologically a more archaic version.&lt;ref name="Michalowski1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Michalowski|title=The lamentation over the destruction of Sumer and Ur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=te_g2xGYIFEC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=1989|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-43-0|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip S. Alexander compares lines seventeen and eighteen of the myth with {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|2:17|HE}} "The Lord has done what he purposed, he has carried out his threat; as he ordained long ago, he has demolished without pity", suggesting this could "allude to some mysterious, ineluctable fate ordained for [[Zion]] in the distant past":

{{cquote|The wild bull of Eridug has abandoned it and has let the breezes haunt his sheepfold. Enki has abandoned that house Eridug and has let the breezes haunt his sheepfold.&lt;ref name="Alexander2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip S. Alexander|title=The Targum of Lamentations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kmUaWZy6JZQC&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5864-2|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The devastation of cities and settlements by natural disasters and invaders has been used widely throughout the history of literature since the end of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]]. A stela (pictured) from [[Iraq]] depicts a similar destruction of a mountain house at [[Susa]]. 

{{cquote|Dead men, not potsherds. Covered the approaches. The walls were gaping, the high gates, the roads, were piled with dead. In the side streets, where feasting crows would gather, scattered they lay. In all the side streets and roadways bodies lay. In the open fields that used to fill with dancers, they lay in heaps. The country's blood now filled its holes, like metal in a mould; Bodies dissolved - like fat left in the sun.&lt;ref name="Tsouras2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter G. Tsouras|title=The Book of Military Quotations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDgnD0omDo0C&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=24 October 2005|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-2340-3|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Michelle Breyer suggested tribes of neighbouring [[shepherd]]s destroyed the city and called Ur, "the last great city to fall".&lt;ref name="Breyer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelle Breyer|title=Ancient Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3bFW1qY8eYC&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=December 1997|publisher=Teacher Created Resources|isbn=978-1-55734-573-8|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Local Community Radio Act''' is an [[Act of Congress|act]] of [[broadcast law]] in the [[United States]], explicitly authorizing the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to license local [[low-power broadcasting]] in the [[FM broadcast]] [[band (radio)|band]] (LPFM).  After five years and four versions, it passed the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2010, granting [[equal protection]] to [[community radio]] stations with regard to [[broadcast translator|translator]] and [[single-frequency network|booster]] stations.  All three types of stations remain secondary to full-power [[radio station]]s, which are typically owned by major corporations and [[nonprofit]]s.  (Previously, this second-class status was only a part of FCC regulation, rather than law.)  The act negates the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000, which enacted prevented community LPFM stations on the basis of [[RF interference]].

==Versions==

===Local Community Radio Act of 2005===
* Introduced by U.S. Senators [[John McCain]], [[Maria Cantwell]], [[Patrick Leahy]]
* After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124200511/http://fcc.gov/oet/info/mitrereport/ the MITRE Report] to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and won't have a significant effect on other stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525090155/http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Sen. Leahy, "This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=8904246a-cd92-489c-81b1-48d8eddc4298&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local Community Radio Act of 2007===

Sponsored in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] by Congressmen [[Mike Doyle (Pennsylvania politician)|Mike Doyle]] and [[Lee Terry]] and in the [[U.S. Senate]] by Senators [[Maria Cantwell]] and [[John McCain]] the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;GovTrack.us. (2007) "H.R. 2802: Local Community Radio Act of 2007." ''GovTrack.us.'' Retrieved February 12, 2008, from http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2802&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as Never Passed.

===Local Community Radio Act of 2009===
This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It required FCC to alter current rules in order to eliminate the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-[[adjacent channel|adjacent-channel]] stations.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"&gt;WashingtonWatch.com. (2009) "H.R. 1147, The Local Community Radio Act of 2009." "WashingtonWatch.com." Retrieved May 23, 2009, from http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/111_HR_1147.html#toc2&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, there had been a minimum distance requirement, however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;RADIO magazine - The Radio Technology Leader. (2004) "FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress." "Media Access Project." Retrieved May 24, 2009, from {{cite web |url=http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100247/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a [[radio reading service]] (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired.)&lt;ref&gt;KPBS Radio Reading Service. "About." "KPBS." Retrieved May 23, 2009, from http://kpbsreadingservice.org&lt;/ref&gt; This protection was to ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make licenses available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions be made with regard to local community needs.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"/&gt;

The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.

===Local Community Radio Act of 2010===
The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 4, 2011 as {{USPL|111|371}}, after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010.  In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission Chair Julius Genachowski said, "Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming.  This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country."  The Act states the following: The Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, shall ensure that--
(1) licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations;
(2) such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and
(3) FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.
In General- The Federal Communications Commission shall modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between--
(1) low-power FM stations; and
(2) full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.

==Rulemaking==
In July 2011, the FCC issued a [[notice of proposed rulemaking]] in response to the law.  It proposes to put a "floor" on the number of community LPFM stations in each [[media market]], without considering the land area which the market covers.  This could be detrimental for community stations in markets with a lower [[population density]], and could result in LPFM stations being pushed into the [[exurb]]s, where more [[channel (communications)|channel]]s are available, but far fewer potential listeners live within a small [[broadcast range]].

A March 19, 2012 FTC ruling appears to address the concern that major corporations using "translator" stations as LPFMs, originating programming that could otherwise only have been heard on [[AM broadcasting|AM]] or on a proprietary digital radio system called [[HD Radio]].  This use, disallowed by the FCC, could have circumvented caps intended to prevent excessive [[concentration of media ownership]], and violates the [[noncommercial educational|noncommercial]], [[local programming|localism]], [[effective radiated power|power]], and [[HAAT|height]] rules that other community LPFM stations must abide by.&lt;ref&gt;RawStory.com, FCC decision strikes critical blow to right-wing radio dominance, March 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mattermost''' is a [[Open-source software|open-source]], [[Self-hosting|self-hostable]] chat service. It is designed as an internal chat for organisations and companies, and mostly markets itself as an alternative to [[Slack (software)|Slack]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mattermost.org/why-we-made-mattermost-an-open-source-slack-alternative/|title=Why we made Mattermost  an open source Slack-alternative {{!}} Mattermost|website=www.mattermost.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code was originally proprietary, as Mattermost was used as an internal chat tool inside SpinPunch, a game developer studio, but was later open-sourced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 1.0 was released on 2.10.2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-3-4-16/|title=Open source Slack-alternative reaches 1.0: Self-host ready, Slack-compatible, MIT licensed - Mattermost Private Cloud Messaging|date=2015-10-02|work=Mattermost Private Cloud Messaging|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is maintained and developed by Mattermost Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mattermost|title=Crunchbase|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company generates funds by selling support services and additional features, that aren't in the open-source edition.

There are Clients on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[MacOS]], and [[Linux]] and for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

In the media Mattermost is mostly regarded as an alternative to the more popular Slack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://t3n.de/news/quelloffene-slack-alternative-mattermost-645316/|title=Quelloffene Slack-Alternative zum Selbsthosten: Mattermost 1.0 in der Kurzvorstellung|work=t3n News|access-date=2018-10-21|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://entwickler.de/online/tools/mattermost-184240.html|title=Mattermost - Open-Source-Alternative zu Slack|date=2015-10-23|work=entwickler.de|access-date=2018-10-21|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.okturtles.org/2015/11/five-open-source-slack-alternatives/|title=Five Open-Source Slack Alternatives »  okTurtles Blog|website=blog.okturtles.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@russleyshaw/which-chat-platform-should-i-use-d73f22d558f3|title=Which Chat Platform Should I Use?|last=Shaw|first=Russley|date=2017-05-09|website=Russley Shaw|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also got integrated into [[GitLab]] as "GitLab Mattermost",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://about.gitlab.com/2015/08/18/gitlab-loves-mattermost/|title=GitLab Mattermost, an open source on-premises Slack alternative|date=2015-08-18|work=GitLab|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the mean time GitLab aquired [[Gitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/03/15/gitlab-acquires-software-chat-startup-gitter-will-open-source-the-code/|title=GitLab acquires software chat startup Gitter, will open-source the code|date=2017-03-15|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; another popular chat tool.

'''MegaHits''' was a [[video lottery terminal]] (VLT) multiple-progressive jackpot game that began on July 15, 2011, and ended on July 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Megahits |url=https://www.powerball.com/games/megahits |website=Powerball |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MegaHits replaced [[Cashola]], which was offered from July 2006 to May 15, 2011. Cashola was offered at lottery-run casinos in [[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]], [[Rhode Island Lottery|Rhode Island]], and [[West Virginia Lottery|West Virginia]]; the same three lotteries take part in MegaHits. In 2013, three of [[Ohio Lottery|Ohio]]'s casinos started offering MegaHits; the following year, four of [[Maryland Lottery|Maryland]]'s casinos started offering it. As of April 2016, fifteen lottery-run casinos offered MegaHits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where to Play MegaHits|url=http://www.powerball.com/megahits/wheretoplay/mh_wtp.asp|website=Powerball official website|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MegaHits featured five progressive jackpots, unlike Cashola, where only the top prize rolled until it was won. Except for the jackpot that was won if a player making the maximum wager spun nine "MegaHits" symbols (which can be won from any MegaHits machine and therefore is fed by all its players regardless of amount wagered) the progressive jackpot pools for spinning five to eight "MegaHits" symbols were won within each MegaHits member. As an example, the game's four progressives within Delaware were fed only by MegaHits wagers in Delaware, while the top progressive (whose starting jackpot is $100,000) was fed by ''all'' MegaHits wagers in the five states.

Unlike Cashola, whose jackpot was annuitized with a cash option, all MegaHits progressives were paid in cash, including the linked progressive.

[[International Game Technology]] supplied the VLTs that were used by MegaHits players.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Missing Link''' is a [[mechanical puzzle]] invented in 1981 by Steven P. Hanson and Jeffrey D. Breslow.

The puzzle has four sides, each depicting a chain of a different color. Each side contains four tiles, except one which contains three tiles and a gap. The top and bottom rows can be rotated, and tiles can slide up or down into the gap. The objective is to scramble the tiles and then restore them to their original configuration.

The two middle rows cannot be rotated. To move tiles in these rows, you need to loop the tiles from one row to another, up and down.

There are 15 tiles and a gap, giving a maximum of 16! arrangements. However, the middle tiles of each four-tile chain are identical, and each position is equivalent to seven other positions obtained by rotating the entire puzzle (about its axis or upside-down), reducing the number of arrangements to 16! / 8 / 8  = 326,918,592,000. If the three long chains are also considered interchangeable, then the number of arrangements is further reduced to 16! / 8 / 8 / 6 = 54,486,432,000.

A '''mobile comic''' is a digital [[comic]] or [[comic strip|cartoon strip]] that can be purchased, downloaded, read and sometimes edited or shared with friends via [[mobile phones]].

== Overview ==
Increasingly the line between digital comics, animation and games is blurring and the same applies to their mobile counterparts as mobile comics become multimedia with sounds and interactivity. In 2008 [[IDW Publishing]] and [[Devil's Due Publishing]] (now Devil's Due Digital) became two of the earliest adopters of comics for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=IDW ON THE CHANGING FACE OF MOBILE COMICS|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24637|publisher=Comic Book Resource|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devil's Due's initially offered mobile comics through companies such as [[Uclick]], on their GoComics Mobile Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peres|first=Josh|title=uclick Brings Devil's Due to Cell Phones|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/comics/gocomics/prweb805404.htm|publisher=PR Web|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Mobile comic content has until recently been miniatuarized or adapted versions of established branded comic content. With the rise of file sharing and piracy it has been increasingly hard for publishers to control money leakage from digital/mobile comics and as such publishers (especially traditional Japanese Manga houses) have shied away from licensing digital or mobile comics.

This however, has led to the rise of user-generated (independent artists) using platforms to publish and sell their work at low cost, and (for the first time in years) do so profitably.

The challenges for mobile comics creation include:

* Small screen size, which means as little text as possible can be included.
* Different handsets with different screen sizes and technical specifications means the same java viewer will not work on all phones.
* Story telling must end within 25 frames, or less. The number of frames depends on delivery method

Several mobile content providers have now developed their own mobile comics platforms, some using java-based applications which have to be downloaded to the mobile first before comics can be viewed. Others are using Multi Media Messaging and WAP subscription to deliver strips. However, there are platforms for iPhone and iPad that have been developed to distribute RSS-based webcomics for free, such as the iOS application [http://www.appsbergersyndrome.com/Comic_Avenue/pressrelease.html Comic Avenue].

==Titles==
Initially the titles released were existing comics licensed for the new medium but new titles are emerging purely on the mobile phone.  ''Thunder Road'' is the first original title for the medium, featuring artist Steven Sanders who previously worked on ''[[The Five Fists of Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/rage/118457104446937.htm Thunder Road: Comics On Your Phone Should Be Good], Silver Bullet Comic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocomics.com/thunderroad/ GoComics Books - Mobile Comic Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=121552  TALKING TO THE THUNDER ROAD CREATORS], July 19, 2007, [[Newsarama]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Carnival of Souls'' is the first digital and motion comic book series on Blackberry's App World, written by Jazan Wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crackberry.com/carnival-souls-1st-comic-book-app-app-world/ Carnival of Souls - 1st Comic Book App in App World- Mobile Comic Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/05/carnival-comics-scares-up-downloadable-apps.html Carnival Comics scares up downloadable apps / LA Times ], May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Carrier'' is the first original graphic novel exclusively on the iPhone, written by Evan Young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/news/125362814735622.htm/ The Carrier released: First graphic novel exclusive to iPhone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Sept 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alien Revolution'' an eight chapter multi language comic, by Illot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alienrevolution.org Alien Revolution: Multi language.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], by Illot 2016&lt;/ref&gt;''Mobilecomic'' A collection of comics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4664">'''Mobile gambling''' refers to playing games of chance or skill for money by using a remote device such as a  [[tablet computer]], [[smartphone]] or a [[mobile phone]] with a wireless internet connection. Over a hundred mobile casinos are operating as of December 2013, with most of the big casino operators in gambling now providing a mobile platform for their player base.

==Market==
In 2005, Jupiter Research forecast that global mobile gambling services would generate revenues of more than $19.3 billion [[US]] dollars by 2009.&lt;ref name=gua1&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate = 22 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a large discrepancy between the 2005 forecast and the 2009 reality is attributed to the unexpected 2006 US prohibition of all internet based gambling.

The mobile gambling market, as of 2011 is still in flux. The European Union still does not have a unified mobile gambling legislative framework in place. Each European country has their own set of widely different laws which regulate mobile gambling ranging from Finland where a government monopoly operates internet casinos to Norway which is in favor of complete prohibition of [[online gambling]].

===Market projections===
According to a Juniper Research report&lt;ref name=jr2010&gt;{{Cite press release
  | title = Mobile Gambling Wagers to Surpass $48bn by 2015

  | accessdate = 22 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; released in September 2010 the total sum wagered on mobile casino games is expected to surpass $48 billion US dollars by 2015. The report bases this prediction on (1) the high growth rates of mobile casinos, lotteries and sports betting providers in major emerging markets and China; (2) liberalization of mobile gambling legislation in Europe; (3) United States repealing the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]], permitting people in the US to legally gamble online again.&lt;ref name=jr2010/&gt;

A 2010 Gartner forecast sees 2014 global mobile gambling revenues reach $11.4 billion.&lt;ref name=gar2010/&gt;

==Mobile casino games==
According to a February 2010 comScore MobiLens study&lt;ref name=cs2010&gt;{{Cite press release
  | title = Smartphone Adoption Shifting Dynamics of U.S. Mobile Gaming Market

  | accessdate = 22 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the U.S. mobile gaming market, smartphone subscribers are much more likely to play mobile casino games than subscribers of generic phones. The study revealed that 7.6% of smartphone subscribers and 1.2% of generic mobile subscribers played mobile casino games within a three-month time frame.&lt;ref name=cs2010/&gt;

Aside from availability online, United States of America-based mobile casino apps have appeared in several land-based locations that can be utilized to gamble only while physically present on the casino's property. This extends to outside areas that are still within the boundaries of the property, making them the first type of slot machine, sports-betting, and random number generated gambling to take place legally off the licensed gaming floor while still inside a U.S. casino.

According to [[VentureBeat]], Google does not allow any real-money gambling apps on its [[Google Play Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Betcade launches early access for Android gambling apps|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/14/betcade-launches-early-access-for-android-gambling-apps/|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Apple and Google reversed a decision to permit mobile gambling applications to be distributed by their service in the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A '''model release''', known in similar contexts as a '''[[liability waiver]]''', is a [[legal release]] typically signed by the subject of a [[photograph]] granting permission to [[Publishing|publish]] the photograph in one form or another. The legal rights of the signatories in reference to the material is thereafter subject to the allowances and restrictions stated in the release, and also possibly in exchange for compensation paid to the photographed.  A model release is not needed for most photograph publication because of [[freedom of speech]] rights (which [[freedom of speech by country|vary by country]].)  A model release is needed for publication where [[personality rights]] or [[privacy rights]] would otherwise be infringed.

No release is required for publication, as news, of a photo taken of an identifiable person when the person is in a [[public place]].  In general, no release is required for publication of a photo taken of an identifiable person when the person is in a public space unless the use is for trade or direct commercial use, which is defined as promoting a product, service, or idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asmp.org/tutorials/frequently-asked-questions-about-privacy-and-libel.html FAQ about privacy and libel] ASMP.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication of a photo of an identifiable person, even if taken when the person is in a public place, that implies endorsement, without a model release signed by that person, can result in [[civil liability]] for whoever publishes the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cob.org/documents/mayor/eob/legal-rights-of-photographers.pdf Legal rights of photographers] COB.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that no model release is needed for the act of taking the photograph.  Rather, if needed, the model release applies to the publication of the photograph.  Liability rests solely with the publisher, except under special conditions.  The photographer is typically not the publisher of the photograph, but usually licenses the photograph to someone else to publish.  It is typical for the photographer to obtain the model release not merely because they are present at the time and ''can'' get it, but also because it gives them more opportunity to license the photograph later to a party who wishes to publish it.

Note that the issue of model release forms and liability waivers is a legal area related to [[privacy]] and is separate from [[copyright]].  Also, the need for model releases pertains to public ''use'' of the photos: i.e., publishing them, commercially or not.  The act of ''taking'' a photo of someone in a public setting without a model release, or of viewing or non-commercially showing such a photo in private, generally does not create legal exposure, at least in the [[United States]].

The legal issues surrounding model releases are complex and vary by jurisdiction.  Although the risk to photographers is virtually nil (so long as proper disclosures of the existence of a release, and its content is made to whoever licenses the photo for publication), the business need for having releases rises substantially if the main source of income from the photographer's work lies within industries that would require them (such as advertising). In short, [[photojournalist]]s almost never need to obtain model releases for images they shoot for (or sell to) news or qualified editorial publications.

Photographers who also ''publish'' images may need releases to protect themselves, but there is a distinction between making an image ''available for sale'' (even via a [[e-commerce|website]]), which is not considered ''publication'' in a form that would require a release, and the use of the same image to promote a product or service in a way that would require a release.

== Types of release ==
* '''Adult release''': This is the form most commonly referred to as a "model release". The language of this release is normally intended for use by models over the [[age of majority]].
* '''Minor release''': This variant of the model release contains language referring to the model (who is a minor) in the third-person, and required signature by a parent or other [[legal guardian]] of the model. A release which is not signed by a parent or guardian may afford no legal protection to the publisher.
* '''Group release''': This is a modified version of the adult release, which includes additional signature lines to accommodate use by multiple models or subjects in a single image.

'''"My EBT"''' is a [[hip-hop]] song performed by [[Stanley Lafleur]] under the alias "Mr. EBT". The song laments  what can be done with an [[Electronic Benefit Transfer]] card (used for financial entitlements in the [[United States]].) 

The song and its video became controversial, especially among [[conservative]] pundits, who considered the song a glorification of the country's welfare system.

==Content==
The lyrics of "My EBT" are based on real-life examples of welfare abuse that Lafleur had witnessed first-hand. The song laments a person using their sister's E.B.T. card (which is considered to be a fraudulent and hence also abusive use of the card) to acquire a large array of junk food (mostly [[potato chip]]s and [[soft drinks]]) from various stores ("never going hungry, swiping all day"), and attempting to, but failing to also purchase [[marijuana]] and [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] on the card as well.&lt;ref name=nydn-myebt&gt;{{cite web|last=Lysiak|first=Matthew|title=Ripped by conservatives, rapper 'Mr. EBT' defends video as parody of welfare abuses|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2011/09/24/2011-09-24_just_a_dopey_video_dont_rip_me_sez_mr_ebt_its_a_parody.html|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=th-benebt/&gt; As an excuse for the actions, the song also states that it is okay because "it's an E.B.T., it ain't food stamps."&lt;ref name=ebt-bh&gt;{{cite web|last=Gharam|first=Michael|title=Life’s a beach on EBT Street|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/op_ed/view/2011_0922lifes_a_beach_on_ebt_street/srvc=home&amp;position=1|publisher=[[The Boston Herald]]|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song was also accompanied by a music video posted on [[YouTube]], which featured Lafleur going around to various stores to purchase junk food using an E.B.T. card, much like what is described in the song itself.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IGfe2tAUbM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The song gained attention when its music video was posted by the [[Drudge Report]]. Numerous conservative commentators and websites criticized the song and video, complaining that the video "celebrat[ed] the pure coolness of any and all things gotten for nothing", and glorified welfare.&lt;ref name=nydn-myebt/&gt; [[Ben Shapiro]] criticized the song by stating that "it's almost impossible to sum up what's wrong with America's economy while standing on one leg. Unless your name is Mr. EBT", and that he is "the sort of leech who is bankrupting our society."&lt;ref name=th-benebt&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro|first=Ben|title=Four Minutes to Explain All That Is Wrong With America|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2011/09/21/four_minutes_to_explain_all_that_is_wrong_with_america/page/full/|publisher=Townhall.com|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to the criticism, Lefleur defended the video by saying that the song and video represented the problems with the E.B.T. system and people who abuse it, described as being people who "[rub] the benefit card in the face of taxpayers" (as he portrayed himself doing in the video), thus denying help to those who really need it the most.&lt;ref name=nydn-myebt/&gt;

The '''National Action Plan''' is an [[action plan]] that was established by the [[Government of Pakistan]] in January 2015 to crack down on [[Terrorism in Pakistan|terrorism]] and to supplement the ongoing [[Operation Zarb-e-Azb|anti-terrorist offensive]] in [[North Waziristan|North-Western Pakistan]]. It is considered as a major coordinated state retaliation following the deadly [[2014 Peshawar school massacre|Peshawar school attack]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Times, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn, Haider" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn News, Mateen Haider report" /&gt; The plan received unprecedented levels of support and co-operation across the country's political spectrum, inclusive of the federal and provincial governments.

It combines foreign and domestic policy initiatives aimed to crack down on and eventually eliminate [[:Category:Rebel groups in Pakistan|proscribed organisations]] across the country. The plan was provided as the framework for the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan]] which established speedy trial military courts for offences relating to terrorism.  It has also led to the resumption of capital punishment and mandatory re-verification through [[fingerprint recognition]] of all subscribers on [[mobile telephony]].&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

The National Action Plan authorises the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Foreign]], [[Ministry of Finance (Pakistan)|Finance]], and other ministerial departments to reach out to the [[Special relationship (international relations)|friendly]] Muslim countries to clamp down on financiers of [[Sectarianism in Pakistan|sectarian]] and [[Terrorism in Pakistan|terrorist networks]] operating against [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="Express Tribune, 2015" /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Army Public School.jpg|thumbnail|Army Public School, KPK]]
On 16 December 2014, six gunmen affiliated with the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Tehrik-i-Taliban]] (TTP) conducted a terrorist attack on the [[Army Public School Peshawar|Army Public School]] in the northwestern Pakistani city of [[Peshawar]].  The militants, all of whom were foreign nationals, included one [[Chechen people|Chechen]], three [[Arab people|Arabs]] and two [[Afghanistan|Afghans]].  They entered the school and opened fire on school staff and children,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA India" /&gt; killing 145 people, including 132 schoolchildren, ranging between eight and eighteen years of age.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The New York Times" /&gt; A rescue operation was launched by the [[Pakistan Army]]'s [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) special forces, who killed all six terrorists and rescued 960 people.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Express Tribune" /&gt;

==Establishment of the plan==
On 24 December 2014 political parties conference chaired by the then [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] reached consensus over the issue of setting up military courts for tackling terrorism cases in the country, along with a wider plan to tackle terrorism.&lt;ref name="Washington Times, 2014" /&gt;

{{quote|text=We have to act fast and whatever is agreed we have to implement it immediately...this agreement is a defining moment for Pakistan and we will eliminate terrorists from this country.|sign=Prime Minister Pakistan|source=&lt;ref name="dawn" /&gt;}}

On 24 December the Prime Minister (PM) in a televised address to the nation announced the 'National Action Plan' (NAP) to deal with terrorism.  According to the Interior Minister, the plan was prepared in the light of the decisions taken by All Parties Conference.  For this purpose the PM established the National Action Committee consisting of the members from all the political parties and decision were taken in the light of the recommendations of this committee.  The PM's address gave the following outline of the National Action Plan, the points of which were decided in the APC.

The [[Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf]] (PTI) called off the protests and participated in the APC.  However, it abstained from voting the bill and amendment.  [[Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F)]] (JUI F) and [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] (JI) also abstained from voting.  JI proposed that the word religion should be omitted from the text of the bill. JUI insisted that the word sect is objectionable.  The [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and [[Awami National Party]] (ANP) voted in favour of the bill and amendment.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DNA India" /&gt;

'''Nudity in American television''' has always been a controversial topic. Aside from a few exceptions, [[nudity]] in the [[United States]] has traditionally not been shown on [[terrestrial television]]. On the other hand, [[cable television]] has been much less constrained as far as nudity is concerned.

==History==
The [[Public Broadcasting Service]], which features nudity in anthropological documentaries as well as some films, was the first network to display national programming that featured frontal female nudity on television. In 1975&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/mantheincrediblemachine ''Man: The Incredible Machine'', in archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (with a rerun in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073164/|title="National Geographic Specials" Man: The Incredible Machine|work=IMDb|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the PBS ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' special ''[[Man: The Incredible Machine]]'' looked into parts of the human body and included in its opening scenes a fully nude woman in an [[Model (art)|artist's model]] pose; probably less for this than the innovative [[microcinematography|micro-]] and interior cinematography, this was for more than half a decade the most popular single program broadcast on the network.

The special-event miniseries, ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], featured some partial nudity of its cast, usually fleetingly, but more so than other commercial network programming in the US in the 1970s.

Throughout the United States, many metropolitan areas had [[independent television station]]s that were not affiliated with any of the national networks and showed programming only to people within their limited broadcast range. During the 1980s, many of these stations experimented with content containing frontal female nudity in movies during [[prime time]]. [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles, for example, showed an unedited version of the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', which featured fully exposed female breasts, between 7:30 and 11 p.m. The channel began the time slot with a video of director [[Miloš Forman]] stating that the film was too controversial to be allowed a faithful television broadcast (NBC's earlier broadcast had cut the film to fit the two hours format with commercials), but that KTLA believed that the culture had changed such that a complete broadcast would be tolerated and appreciated. Then, it was followed by a disclaimer that was repeated after each [[commercial break]].

[[KTVU]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] regularly showed uncensored films that contained nudity, such as ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973, with uncredited [[Suzanne Somers]] appearing topless in a pool scene), ''[[Big Bad Mama]]'' (1974, with [[Angie Dickinson]] and [[William Shatner]]), and ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'' (1971, which contained full frontal nudity in a [[nude swimming|nude bathing]] scene with then–teenage actress [[Jenny Agutter]]).

A number of stations in this era even went so far as to run promotions during which they would show a series of movies known for nudity in an attempt to get higher ratings for the week. In almost all cases, the nudity was restricted to showing exposed buttocks and female breasts.

By the end of the 1980s, most of these stations had started to receive complaints about such nudity and these broadcasts eventually stopped. In addition, some of these stations became [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliates and were no longer able to make independent programming decisions during prime time.

From the early 1990s until the early 2000s, some prime time series (such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Once and Again]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106079/trivia|title=NYPD Blue (TV Series 1993–2005)|work=IMDb|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBS]]'s ''[[Chicago Hope]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108724/trivia|title=Chicago Hope (TV Series 1994–2000)|work=IMDb|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[John Doe (TV series)|John Doe]]'') experimented with nudity. ''NYPD Blue'' is noteworthy for featuring nudity in the context of people engaging in sexual activity. While fully exposed female breasts were never shown, the show often depicted full back nudity of men and women.

In 1997, [[NBC]] broadcast an unedited version of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Holocaust]] film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' in prime time. The film features brief full-frontal nudity of both sexes in non-sexual contexts. Then-Congressman [[Tom Coburn]] criticized NBC's airing of the film for its nudity, violence and profanity. Both Democrats and Coburn's fellow Republicans criticized Coburn for his reaction, and defended the film and NBC's choice to air it in full. Coburn subsequently apologized for his reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/26/schindler.debate/ "After rebuke, congressman apologizes for 'Schindler's List' remarks"], CNN.com, February 26, 1997.  Accessed April 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
After [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed [[Janet Jackson]]'s breast during a live performance at the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|2004 Super Bowl halftime show]], a [[moral panic]] occurred, and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) tightened its indecency rules due to public pressure.

As a consequence of the public and media reaction to the incident, major networks edited some of their shows. [[CBS]] removed a shot of a naked man from ''[[Without a Trace]]'', while [[NBC]] deleted a two-second shot of an elderly woman's breast from ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-us.asp?parentid=7685 "American TV pushes nudity off the schedule"], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', February 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, prime time television networks became more reluctant to show even non-explicit nudity in their TV shows. In the current climate, nudity is almost unknown on any [[broadcast television]] show&amp;nbsp;— with the exception being [[animated series]] such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'' (which spoofed the conservative phase of American television in the episode "[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]").

Cable television, on the other hand, is not bound by FCC rules and can show whatever material their executives consider suitable. With some exceptions, while cable channels that rely on advertising still do not show nudity during prime time, nudity is often shown on [[premium cable]] channels such as [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[HBO]] and [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM). [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] is one of the few commercial–dependent cable channels that features nudity in its programming (notably the controversial ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' and [[American Horror Story]]). [[SundanceTV]] will allow nudity. [[Discovery Channel|Discovery]] and other [[Documentary film|documentary]]-related channels may show nudity in a journalistic context, such as that of [[indigenous peoples]].

''[[Dating Naked]]'' is an American [[reality TV|reality series]] [[dating game show]] shown on [[VH1]]. Modelled on Dutch show ''[[Adam Zkt. Eva]]'', the series debuted in July 2014, and ran through 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Black, Elizabeth |title=Dating Naked Gets The Greenlight For Season Three! |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/205761/dating-naked-gets-the-greenlight-for-season-three/ |work=[[VH1]] |date=September 14, 2015 |accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show matches up heterosexual contestants who are nude most of the time. The genitals of all participants along with the female breasts, and occasionally the buttocks, are blurred out. ''[[Naked and Afraid]]'' is an American reality series shown on the [[Discovery Channel]]. The fifth season premiered on March 13, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonin|first=Liane|title=Discovery reveals even more with bare pairs on 'Naked &amp; Afraid'|url=http://www.hitfix.com/starr-raving/discovery-reveals-even-more-with-bare-pairs-on-naked-afraid|work=HitFix|accessdate=July 6, 2013|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title='Naked &amp; Afraid' to Premiere Sunday, June 23 on Discovery|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/05/28/naked-afraid-to-premiere-sunday-june-23-on-discovery/184514/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|accessdate=July 6, 2013|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each episode chronicles the lives of two [[survivalists]] (one female, one male) who meet for the first time and are given the task of surviving a stay in the wilderness naked for 21 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurp|first=Josh|title=‘Naked And Afraid’ Star Explains How She Caught Fish With Her ‘Private Parts’|url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2013/04/naked-and-afraid-star-explains-how-she-caught-fish-with-her-private-parts/|work=UPROXX|accessdate=July 6, 2013|date=April 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan|first=Don|title=Discovery Channel bares all with upcoming 'Naked' shows|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/discovery-bares-new-naked-shows-article-1.1308199|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=July 6, 2013|date=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, the contestants' crotch area and the women's breasts are blurred out.

While nudity practically disappeared from network television, a [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] study of sex on television released in November 2005 showed that TV characters are having sex twice as often as they were in 1998. The study examined more than 1,000 hours of programming.

In recent years, a number of cable stations in the United States have begun to air R-rated movies uncensored. They include ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' airing on FX.

'''''QI News''''' was an [[internet television]] show produced by ''Quite Interesting Limited'', the company which produces the British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]''. It
was broadcast on [[ComedyBox.tv]]. It was a mock news programme, which instead of broadcasting news stories, broadcast "quite interesting" stories. Other than the stories, the show also played on the characters in it, mainly the two news readers.

==Show==
''QI News'' was a five-minute long show which reported "quite interesting" things from around the world. It was presented by two newsreaders, brash American Bob Squire ([[Glenn Wrage]]) and female Cambridge British co-anchor Sophie Langton ([[Katherine Jakeways]]). Other contributions were sometimes provided by correspondent Graham Prince ([[Robert Meakin]]). Off-screen, the Producer (Voice of [[Alexander McConnell (producer)|Alexander McConnell]]) tried to keep Squire and Langton in order.

Each programme ended with one of the characters mentioning a final fact. The other would say, "Is that news?" to which the first responded, "It's news to me". As the credits roll, a disclaimer appeared which read, "All the information in this programme is believed to be true", followed by humorous comments swearing that it is true.

==Production==
The script for ''QI News'' was written by Meakin and [[Justin Gayner]]. The research for the show was carried out by ''QI''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "Question Wranglers", [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|John Mitchinson]] and [[Piers Fletcher]], among others. ''QI''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s creator [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] was the [[executive producer]] and it was directed by [[Geoff Posner]].

'''National Radio Television Afghanistan''' ('''RTA'''; {{lang-ps|د افغانستان ملي راډيو تلويزون}} ''Da Afġanistan Mīlī Radīo Telvizoon'', {{lang-fa|رادیو تلویزیون ملی افغانستان}} ''Rādīo Telvizoon-e Mīlī-e Afġānestān'', branded as '''ملی''' (meaning ''national'')) is the [[public-broadcasting]] organization of [[Afghanistan]], based in [[Kabul]]. This [[governmental]] organ has a national television station ([[Afghanistan National Television]]) and a radio station (Radio Afghanistan).

Radio Afghanistan started with [[Radio Kabul]] in 1925 (1304 by the [[Iranian calendar]]), during the era of King [[Amanullah Khan]]. Two radio transmitters with the capacity of 400 watt were procured from the German company of [[Telefunken]], one of those has been installed on Koti Londoni near the bridge of Artel {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} which subsequently started to its operation and the second one had been transferred to [[Kandahar]] which on that period the musical programs and news were only being broadcast for few hours.

Radio Television Afghanistan has regional sub-stations for all [[Provinces of Afghanistan]] which operate radio services, and in some provinces, basic television at a provincial level. They broadcast material produced at provincial level, interspersed with news bulletins distributed by the Kabul-based news desk.  These stations are usually closely affiliated with the Provincial Governors' Offices.  Broadcast content includes high volumes of government messaging.

Although ''Richeut'' shares many of the same characteristics as other fabliaux, it has several unique features:  1.  It mentions the outcome of a sexual encounter.  2.  It breaks the taboo of incest.  3.  It is unusually long, containing 1019 lines.  4.  It does not use octosyllables, but a tailrhyme strophe.  5.  It has character development.  6.  The characters of Richeut and Herselot, the maid, exist outside of this text.&lt;ref&gt;Vernet, André.  “Fragments d’un Moniage Richeut?”  ''Études de langue et de littérature du Moyen Âge:  offertes à Felix Lecoy par ses collègues, ses élèves et ses amis''.

==Summary==
This tale recounts the life of a prostitute who uses men to her advantage.  She does not discriminate between classes, for she dupes a nobleman, a bourgeois and a clergyman into believing that they are the father of her son, whom she conceived on purpose because she felt that they were no longer paying her enough attention.  All three men lavish her and her son with gifts to the point of ruining themselves.  Her son, Samson, grows up with all of the privileges that money can buy.  Bored by his surroundings, he boasts to his mother that his education is complete for he can easily lead any woman into his bed and, subsequently, into the whorehouse.  His mother ridicules him and warns him of the treacherous ways of women.  Slighted, Samson claims that no woman will ever make a fool of him and heads out into the world.  Along his journeys, he conquers women of all nations and cheats men at dice, even becoming a monk at [[Clairvaux Abbey]] for a brief period of time. After twelve years of deflowering, pimping and dicing, he returns to his mother's hometown.  Although he does not recognize her, she knows him and sets out to prove wrong his last boast to her.  She tricks him into believing that Herselot, her faithful servant, is a young virgin whom he could never convince to go to bed with him.  Intent upon proving her incorrect, he sets out to triumph over the unconquerable and believes to have succeeded.  During the act however, he discovers that she is no more a virgin than he is.  In the meantime, Richeut convinces seven men of her acquaintance to beat her son, but not kill him.  Before Samson can leave Herselot's bed, the men beat him with Richeut intervening, pretending to save him from these men.  His boast of twelve years earlier has thus been proven wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, Ingrid D.  ''Engendering Vice:  The Exemplarity of the Old French Fabliaux''.  Diss.  U. of Kansas, 2007.

[[Russia]] took part in the first [[Eurovision Dance Contest]] in 2007. The couple chosen to represent the country were [[Vladislav Borodinov]] and [[Maria Sittel]].

|description=[[Henry Fillmore]]'s ''Troopers Tribunal'', a [[circus march]] for which Fillmore used a punning name – troupers, as in a circus troupe – in order to conceal whom he wrote the march for from his conservative father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usafband.af.mil/ensembles/BandDiscography.asp?albumID=38 Liner notes to Front &amp; Center, a Collection of American Marches], U.S. Air Force Band&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''screamer''' is a descriptive name for a [[circus]] [[March (music)|march]], in particular, an upbeat march intended to stir up the audience during the show.

== History ==
Screamers were mostly composed in a 60-year period (1895&amp;ndash;1955). Circuses were in need of music that would stir the audience into a frenzy, as four-footed animals galloped across the ring. Because march music was a prominent part of American music at that time, and because it carried such a quick tempo, it was this that ringmasters demanded.

== Musicality ==

Circus marches are faster than a normal military march, often 130 to 150 beats/minute.

Although screamers tend to follow the march form, many times they are abbreviated, and additions, such as a quick cornet call introduction to a new [[melody]], are included. A typical screamer lasts a minute to three and a half minutes.

Screamers are a very demanding type of music, due to their extremely fast and advanced rhythms, especially the low-brass parts. Double and even triple [[tonguing]] is often required in order to play these rhythms. The trio in "[[The Melody Shop]]" is a good example of this. 

Many screamers have [[Counterpoint|two prominent melodies playing at once]]. Although this is not unusual in a march, screamers tend to go further with this. The low-brass section can be playing a long, stately melody, while the [[woodwind]]s can be moving along with a phrase of 16th notes, or vice versa. 

Due to the circumstances in which screamers are played, dynamics tend to stay at a level forte. Unlike some military marches, [[Dynamics (music)|piano]] is rarely used.

== Composers ==
The most prominent composer of circus marches is [[Karl King|Karl L. King]], most notably with his march "Barnum &amp; Bailey's Favorite". Other screamer composers include [[Fred Jewell]] and [[Henry Fillmore]]. [[John Philip Sousa]] wrote "On Parade" and a few others, but his writing in the circus march style is not renowned.

Koenig has said that ''Serial'' is "about the basics: love and death and justice and truth. All these big, big things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://acculturated.com/nprs-absorbing-new-podcast-serial/ |title=NPR's Absorbing New Podcast,''Serial'' |date=October 10, 2014 |accessdate=October 14, 2014 |publisher=Acculturated |last=Olson |first=Marina |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015171727/http://acculturated.com/nprs-absorbing-new-podcast-serial/ |archivedate=October 15, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has noted, "this is not an original idea. Maybe in podcast form it is, and trying to do it as a documentary story is really, really hard.

===Season 2 (2015–16)===
In September 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the second season would focus on Sergeant [[Bowe Bergdahl]], an American [[United States Army|Army]] soldier who was held for five years by the Taliban, and then charged with desertion.

For Season 2, Koenig teamed up with Mark Boal, the [[Academy Award]] winning screenwriter of ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and his production company, Page 1. Boal had conducted a series of interviews with Bergdahl as part of a film production he was working on, and both Boal and Bergdahl gave Koenig permission to use those excerpts of those recorded interviews in episodes of ''Serial''.

Season 3 is meant as an analysis of the normal operation of the American criminal justice system, as opposed to Season 1 and 2 that followed "extraordinary" cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serialpodcast.org/season-three/about|title=About Season Three|website=Serial|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; K.Austin Collins of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' commented that the third season was "an overarching account of an institution: the criminal-justice system, writ large".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/serial-podcast-season-3-review|title=After a Long Break, Serial Has Its Day in Court|last=Collins|first=K.

When Lee broke it off, their friends had conflicting interpretations of Syed's behavior: he was either cool with it and sad, or in a rage and hatching a sinister plot to kill her. Syed consistently proclaims his innocence, but there are puzzling inconsistencies in the set of facts he tells.

Detectives interview Jen and then Jay, who says Syed told him he killed Lee, and then forced him to help bury her body.

Deirdre thinks the evidence against him was "thin". She advises Koenig to keep revisiting all the evidence, allowing uncertainties to remain until there is a tipping point when her questions are resolved.

A professional detective says the investigation of Lee's murder was better than average, and Jay had handed the police the case on a platter. Koenig and Snyder visit Jay, who declines an interview. Jay's friend Chris recalls what Jay told him about the murder, a story not consistent with Jay's courtroom version. Why did Jay agree to help Syed? Did Syed coerce Jay and threaten to hurt Jay's girlfriend Stephanie? His friends said Jay had a reputation for lying, but not about important things. Jay's friend Jen says she could understand why Jay might lie about some details, but she believed his story. Back to the question: what was the jury thinking?

Second, Lee's friend Summer says that Lee could not have been dead by 2:36, because she had a conversation with Lee between 2:30 and 2:45. Others also saw Lee after school that day. Third, Asia saw Syed at the library in that same time frame. Sarah Koenig explores Syed's perspective as he was questioned, arrested, tried, and sentenced, as well as his letters to friends about life in prison. She mentions that she has reasonable doubt, not in the legal sense, but in the "normal person" sense.

 |Title= The Best Defense is a Good Defense
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|12|04}}
 |Aux1={{Duration|m= 53 |s= 55}}
 |ShortSummary=Did anti-Muslim sentiment affect the prosecution? The prosecution argued that Syed's community would help him flee to Pakistan if bail were granted, making suggestions that Syed murdered Lee as religiously motivated killing by a lover with "honor besmirched". Defense attorney Cristina Gutierrez argued that someone else did it, and police did not look beyond Syed. His first trial ended in a mistrial, and in the second trial she cast suspicion on Mr. S and Jay as involved in the crime, but she did not present a clear outline of these arguments or scrutinize discrepancies in the call log timeline. Gutierrez discovered the prosecutor had secured an attorney for Jay – arguably a "benefit" worth money – in connection with his pleading guilty as an accessory and agreeing to testify, but the judge did not agree that this tainted Jay's testimony. Koenig does not believe Cristina Gutierrez intentionally bungled his defense, but within a year after Syed's trial, Gutierrez became very ill, her career collapsed, and she was disbarred.

 |ShortSummary=Koenig investigates negative rumors about Syed, though the rumors do not directly connect him to Lee's murder, and the most troubling rumors cannot be substantiated. People from his mosque were scared when he was arrested, some describing his story as a cautionary tale. Some believe Syed was duplicitous, capable of committing the crime. One rumor, that he stole money from the mosque, was partially confirmed by four people. Syed admitted taking some money when he was in eighth grade, but his mother found out, and he felt ashamed. Syed had a reputation as a peacemaker, "a good guy", helpful and caring. People who knew him in high school cannot believe he planned Lee's murder. Did Syed "lose it", and nurse feelings of rejection? Could Syed have committed murder in a dissociative state, not knowing he did it? Koenig explores whether Syed has true empathy or anti-social characteristics, and consults with psychologist Charles Ewing, who has interviewed many young murderers. Why does Syed not sound more angry about Jay or other people connected to his case? In an 18-page letter to Koenig, Syed reveals his concern about being perceived as manipulative, and says it doesn't matter how the podcast portrays him.

 |ShortSummary=After spending over a year researching the case, Koenig still is uncertain what happened the day that Lee disappeared. She reveals new information that happened as a result of people hearing about the podcast: she has spoken with Don, Lee's boyfriend of 13 days at the time of her disappearance, and with Jay's former co-worker, Josh. Koenig reviews the phone records again with her production team and determines that neither Jay's nor Syed's story of that day aligns with the evidence. Unresolved discrepancies also include Jen and Jay's stories about how they disposed of Jay's clothes and boots. Reviewing possible motives for the murder, Koenig and her producers reason that, if Syed is innocent, he had extraordinarily bad luck but several experts who reviewed the case tell them "the case is a mess". Syed's petition in the Court of Special Appeals is still alive but torn between two lawyers, he tells Koenig he will allow the Innocence Project to seek court approval to test the DNA found on Lee's body and a bottle found nearby, possibly pointing to another man, Ronald Lee Moore. Koenig expresses her desire to avoid unsubstantiated speculation and to focus on only the facts. She concludes that from a legal perspective, she would have voted to acquit Syed, although she still nurses doubts.

 |ShortSummary=In 2009, the search for Bergdahl was in hands of two low-level personnel recovery intel analysts for Afghanistan, at [[United States Central Command|CENTCOM]] in Tampa, not a division in-theater. Hostage recovery was not at the top of list of priorities for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[National Security Agency|NSA]], or other intelligence agencies, and resources were consequently not available. Because Bergdahl was held in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan, there were also complicated diplomatic issues. In 2013, General [[John F. Campbell (general)|John Campbell]] made it a top priority to recover Bergdahl, and Colonel [[Jason Amerine]] audited everything done in Bergdahl's case and in other hostage cases. Agencies such as CENTCOM, [[United States Special Operations Command|SOCOM]], [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] seemed to hand off responsibility for recovering not just Bergdahl, but other American hostages as well, making a dysfunctional hostage recovery policy. Koenig observes that frustration was the central theme expressed by those she interviewed, who were struggling against competing interests and limits on what the U.S. is willing risk to get hostages back.

 |ShortSummary=Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl gave a 380-page statement to General Kenneth Dahl, telling the story of his deployment and what happened when he walked away from his post. Bergdahl had been a good infantry soldier up until that point, who even volunteered for extra duty, a "squared away" soldier. He had become disillusioned at his first post in Alaska after basic training and found Army leadership to be lacking. The mission in Afghanistan was counterinsurgency and nation-building, but many soldiers expressed confusion over doing "humanitarian things," rather than seeking and destroying the Taliban enemy. Bergdahl wanted adventure and action, and was disappointed in his platoon's work. The platoon was assigned a rescue mission, but they were attacked on their return, in a firefight through a ravine, eventually limping back to the post with no losses, but they were upbraided for not shaving for six days. Bergdahl was angry about the battalion commander's misplaced priorities. Bergdahl wanted to "kill the bad guys", and do better at engaging the regular Afghans, but he felt the Army was not fulfilling its counter-insurgency mission. When the battalion was assigned to dig trenches near Moest in 110-degree heat of summer, the battalion commander aggressively berated them for being out of uniform, as a breakdown in discipline. Bergdahl was offended by the punishment, feeling the commander was incompetent, and out of control. He felt he had to cause a DUSTWUN to correct the situation. So was he selfish, or selfless?

 |Aux1={{Duration|m=37|s=58}}
 |ShortSummary= Has Bergdahl been telling the truth about his reasons for walking off base in Afghanistan, or just the version he could live with? Bergdahl says he left because Army leaders were dangerously bad. Dahl concluded Bergdahl's comments were truthful, that his motive was well-meaning, but based on incorrect assumptions. Mark Boal said Bergdahl's conclusions would make sense only to himself. Kayla Harrison described him as an unusual, smart, creative teenager, who forged his own strict, uncompromising moral code, who believed if you know something to be wrong in the world, you must take actions to correct it, and he was "impossibly unrealistic". He had romantic expectations, a rigid code of conduct, and a judgmental perspective. He joined the [[U.S. Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] in January 2006, at age 19. Overwhelmed, he had been hospitalized after a panic attack, and a psychologist had assessed his "mental state significant for situational anxiety", recommending discharge with "diagnosis: adjustment disorder with depression". Bergdahl felt he was being judged by his family as a failure, a black sheep who would not do the right thing. In May 2008, to get a waiver to join the Army, he submitted a medical discharge statement that left out his panic attack, hospitalization, and the doctor's note that before re-enlisting in the military, he needed clearance by a psychiatrist. He didn't tell anyone at home he was joining the Army. He just turned up one day in uniform. Kim Harrison said it was the worst idea ever. Koenig asks, "Should the Army have let Bowe in?”

 |Aux1={{Duration|m=36|s=56}}
 |ShortSummary= Did the Army screw up by accepting Bergdahl after his breakdown in Coast Guard basic training two years earlier? Dr. Elspeth Cameron Ritchie thought the Army waiver was not uncommon because information-sharing among different military branches is incomplete. Dr. Michael Valdevenos thought the Army recruiter should have scrutinized Bergdahl's record more thoroughly. Dahl concluded the recruiter had followed all procedures, but should have included review of his separation action. Mark Boal observed Bergdahl experienced the disillusion of someone who believes in the Army, who just wanted to talk to higher-ranking people in the military about improving command leadership. Bergdahl wanted to be the ideal soldier who fights for a cause he is committed to, who rallies behind trusted military leaders, with a code of honor, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. Bergdahl knew his expectations were unrealistic, but he still defended his vision of the way things should be. Bergdahl's June 27 broadcast e-mail to friends, "Who is John Gault?" referred to the industrialist in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', who shut down the world's economy in order to fix it. Dr. Christopher Lang diagnosed Bergdahl as having [[Schizotypal personality disorder]]. Valdevenos concurs that this diagnosis is accurate, describing people who are loners, lack close friends, with perceptual alterations and persistent social anxiety. Bergdahl's paranoia was worse under stress — he believed his commander might send them into a suicide operation. Koenig says this diagnosis makes his story more credible. His judgments about the commander may even be true, that American lives were put at risk to retrieve equipment. For Bergdahl, walking off base was not an absolute boundary, but it was not a rational thing to do. Maj. Margaret Kurtz, the court martial prosecutor, said at the time of his alleged misconduct, Bergdahl was able to appreciate the nature and quality and wrongfulness of his conduct. In other words, mental illness or no, he should be held responsible for his actions. Some soldiers thought Bergdahl's good intentions led to a bad "God-like" decision. Some thought he was lying; some thought he had good intentions, but they still could not forgive his actions. Others didn’t perceive there was danger in the reprimands, like Bergdahl did. His platoon was deeply hurt by his actions. Platoon members would die for each other, and because of that, they had become family together. Bergdahl's actions made them feel their whole deployment lost its meaning. Almost all the soldiers he served with thought he should go to court martial.

 |Title= Trade Secrets
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2016|03|03}}
 |Aux1={{Duration|m=48|s=46}}
 |ShortSummary= The U.S. State Department engaged in secret peace negotiations in Munich in 2010 with the Taliban that included a "confidence building" condition: trade Bergdahl for two prisoners at Guantanamo. But negotiator [[Richard Holbrooke]] died before political reconciliation could be achieved. There was a brief hopeful moment with new negotiator Mark Grossman, but then there was stagnation for months, and no progress seemed possible. In May 2011, the Taliban walked away from the talks. Then their demands escalated to include release of five GItmo prisoners, including Mullah Faisal. Setbacks included leaks, bad timing, and "old fashioned screw-ups", including the 2011 assassination of former Afghan president Rabbani.  In June 2013 a new Taliban office opened with the flag of the Islamic Emirate, in violation of the agreement with Karzai and U.S. representative James Dobbins. The word "emirate" was also on the wall of the building, which infuriated Karzai. The Taliban withdrew from peace talks, and Bergdahl stayed in captivity for another year. The Pakistan Army was gearing up to bomb Pakistani Taliban in Waziristan, and the U.S. had begun withdrawing troops, so prospects for Bergdahl's release were diminishing. Bergdahl's physical condition was deteriorating. U.S. officials, including Chuck Hagel, negotiated through Qatar, finally negotiating a deal for Bergdahl's release in exchange for the five Taliban prisoners at Guantanamo. On Saturday, May 31, 2014, word finally came that Bergdahl was safe and the trade could proceed. It was a transaction, not part of a larger peace negotiation. The Bergdahls had been assured that their son would not face charges, that his time with the Taliban was punishment enough, so they thought it was over, mission accomplished. Not quite.

 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2016|03|17}}
 |Aux1={{Duration|m=51|s=36}}
 |ShortSummary= When Koenig questions people about what bothers them about Bergdahl's case, most say that it has become so political. Was it inevitable that it became so combative? Susan Rice characterized his service with "honor and distinction", which angered the military. Soldiers in his platoon said he walked away, and some from his unit started a "He's not a hero" Facebook page. Fox News interviewed soldiers from Bergdahl's platoon and the story became a juggernaut, with bogus intel from a discredited source even saying Bergdahl had become a Muslim and wanted to be a warrior for Islam. The political right was using the story and the platoon for political purposes, trying to bait President Barack Obama because they had been offended by the Rose Garden ceremony, which they characterized as "a tone-deaf move" on the part of the White House. The President did not recognize the irregularities of Bergdahl's story of or questions about his disappearance, and there was no attempt to get to the bottom of the story. Why did the White House make such a mistake, instead of using an earlier  plan to have a quiet event?  In retrospect, it was important for the President to own the decision and explain the policy behind it. By law, Congress must be given 30-day notice before Guantanamo detainees are released, but the Department of Defense had taken the lead on the trade, and had not told Congress anything. Leaks could have derailed the fragile deal, jeopardizing Bergdahl's life. Congressional staffers felt they could no longer believe anything from DOD: first, where there had been a collegial relationship before, there was now "unprecedented, profound concern about national security risk…" Second, who signed off on the trade of five Taliban? Third, were they safe to release from Gitmo? The public anger at Bergdahl is personal, wrapped in larger questions about negotiating with terrorists. As a result of this anger, the Republican congress changed the legal wording on Gitmo foreign transfer language, creating a stricter standard as a direct result of the Bergdahl trade, and the administration not telling Congress the truth. Bergdahl also had a lengthy stay in Germany, where "SERE" experts (Survival, evasion, resistance, escape) from the military community planned Bergdahl's reintegration, and debriefs took weeks. Bergdahl was unaware he had become a subject of national interest. One important question has not been addressed: there has been no official report or investigation of whether people died or were injured in the search for Bergdahl.

 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2016|03|31}}
 |Aux1={{Duration|m=65 |s=05 }}
 |ShortSummary= Questions remain about Bergdahl's case. First, people with him during Coast Guard boot camp did not understand how could have enlisted in the Army, given their graphic recollections of his breakdown, which was not a "garden variety panic attack". General Kenneth Dahl wrote that Bergdahl's Coast Guard separation should have been examined more closely. Koenig summarizes: the Army messed up, Bergdahl messed up walking off base, and then there were five years with the Taliban. But that leaves out the reckoning desired by the military. They want an accounting. What was Bergdahl's fault, and what was not? General Michael Flynn, formerly head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, says authoritatively people died on missions to find Bergdahl. But the evidence is not so clear, in spite of the six names from the 501st battalion on missions to find DUSTWUN that have been cited in the media. Other soldiers in his unit were convinced that finding Bergdahl was part of all their missions following his disappearance, so the six deaths were connected to Bergdahl. Some cited resources dedicated to finding him that were not then available to other operations. Sergeant Major Ken Wolfe, however, advised looking "at a map and a timeframe", meaning after 45+ days, Bergdahl was in Pakistan. No infantry unit would be deployed to look for Bergdahl, as it would have required special forces. But what about second- and third-order consequences of his desertion? Wolfe dispels these arguments as "speculation and hypothetical". Perhaps the mission to find Bergdahl was the top cover to justify other unrelated missions the Army units needed to accomplish, as an excuse to gain assets and permission to "get outside the wire". Flynn points out they did not have bullet-proof intelligence on where Bergdahl was. But resources were diverted and people were injured and suffered because of looking for Bergdahl. Who is to blame for variables causing the deaths and injuries in wars? The country signed up for all the things attending war, including disillusioned youth and failing Army recruiting systems. Mark Boal's remaining question: what is an appropriate punishment for Bergdahl, who did not intend to cause harm? The Army treats most deserters who walk away from a base as headcases because it is so dangerous. Ambivalence about Bergdahl reflects societal confusion about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the war on terror. Bergdahl is still a soldier, now classified as "present for duty". He has an office job at a base in San Antonio, waiting for the Army to decide his fate, just waiting — which he knows how to do.

==Development and release==
The concept for ''Serial'' originated with an experiment in Koenig's basement.&lt;ref name="Mj" /&gt; Koenig and Snyder had pitched a different idea at a staff meeting for a weekly program on events during the previous seven days, which staff members received without enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/lilah-raptopoulos/sarah-koenig-on-unhappy-characters |title=Interview: Sarah Koenig on how ''Serial'' came to be |date=October 9, 2014 |accessdate=November 12, 2014 |website=Soundcloud.com |last=Raptopoulos |first=Lilah |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213021843/https://soundcloud.com/lilah-raptopoulos/sarah-koenig-on-unhappy-characters |archivedate=December 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Ira Glass]] asked Koenig if she had any other ideas, she mentioned podcasting a story that unfolded over time, a serialized narrative. In an interview with [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']], she explained that each episode would return to the same story, telling the next chapter of a long, true narrative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Episode one of the series was released on October 3, 2014, with additional episodes released weekly online. Glass introduced it as a spinoff of his popular radio program, ''This American Life'', and aired episode one on his show.&lt;ref name="Mj"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/09/ira-glass-sarah-koenig-julie-snyder-serial-podcast-this-american-life |title=''This American Life'' Channels ''True Detective'' in a New Podcast |date=September 19, 2014 |accessdate=October 12, 2014 |work=Mother Jones |last=Lurie |first=Julia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014100851/https://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/09/ira-glass-sarah-koenig-julie-snyder-serial-podcast-this-american-life |archivedate=October 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained, "We want to give you the same experience you get from a great [[HBO]] or [[Netflix]] series, where you get caught up with the characters and the thing unfolds week after week, but with a true story, and no pictures. Like ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', but you can enjoy it while you're driving."&lt;ref name="Mj" /&gt;

Introducing a ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'' segment about ''Serial'', [[Judy Woodruff]] noted that it is "an unexpected phenomenon",  and [[Hari Sreenivasan]] mentioned it has "five million downloads on iTunes, far more than any other podcast in history".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/serial-mania-says-growing-popularity-podcasts/|title = What 'Serial'-mania says about the growing popularity of podcasts|date = December 11, 2014|accessdate = December 12, 2014|website = PBS NEWSHOUR|publisher = NewsHour Productions LLC|last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141212030652/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/serial-mania-says-growing-popularity-podcasts/|archivedate = December 12, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calling the characters "rich and intriguing", ''[[The Daily Californian]]'' noted similarities to the film ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' (1988), and described the podcast as "gripping" and the story as "thrilling", while applauding the series for giving "listeners a unique opportunity to humanize the players".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/10/10/serial-podcast/ |title=Review: ''Serial'', a captivating new podcast |date=October 10, 2014 |accessdate=October 13, 2014 |website=[[The Daily Californian]] |publisher=The Independent Berkeley Student Publishing Co., Inc. |last=Schultz |first=Anya |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013163204/http://www.dailycal.org/2014/10/10/serial-podcast |archivedate=October 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slate''{{'}}s reviewer pointed out that ''Serial'' is not escapist and went on to note: "Someone in the show is not telling the truth about something very sinister. That's the narrative tension that makes ''Serial'' not only compelling but also unlike anything I can remember watching or reading before."&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' commented on the inherently riveting subject matter and noted that the top-notch reporting and podcast format yield "a novel twist on the investigative long-form piece".&lt;ref name="Balt" /&gt;

A critique from the journalism community was more qualified. First noting that some people believe there is a "podcast renaissance", the reviewer from [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Harvard's Nieman Journalism Lab]] observed that even though podcasts are not new, they are not yet mainstream.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Not all critiques of the podcasting format have been as equivocal. ''[[PopMatters]]'' observed that podcasting is a new distribution model, very different from television as a distribution model because it gives users access to media and the freedom to listen to episodes of a long-form story while doing other things. The reviewer applauded the focus on long-form journalism and added, "Suddenly you feel like the full promise of podcasting has just been unleashed. That long-form narrative nonfiction is really the way to best leverage the potential of podcasting as a distribution model."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.popmatters.com/feature/186862-the-flash/|title = The Iconographies – John Woo Said "For a Better Tomorrow:" CW's ''The Flash'' and ''This American Life's Serial''|date = October 13, 2014|accessdate = October 15, 2014|website = PopMatters|publisher = PopMatters.com|last = Q|first = shathley|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015134402/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/186862-the-flash/|archivedate = October 15, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Wall Street Journal'' critic observed: "podcasts have slipped marketers' minds.

Compare that to a typical radio CPM (roughly $1 to $18) or network TV ($5 to $20) or even a regular old web ad ($1 to $20), and the podcast wins."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/whats-behind-the-great-podcast-renaissance.html|title = What's Behind the Great Podcast Renaissance?|date = October 30, 2014|accessdate = November 12, 2014|website = New York – Daily Intelligencer|publisher = New York Media LLC|last = Roose|first = Kevin|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150715223055/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/10/whats-behind-the-great-podcast-renaissance.html|archivedate = July 15, 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Serial'' was honored with a Peabody award in April 2015, noting "''Serial'' rocketed podcasting into the cultural mainstream", and that it was an "experiment in long-form, non-fiction audio storytelling". It was cited for "its innovations of form and its compelling, drilling account of how guilt, truth, and reality are decided".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Serial|url = http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/serial|website = www.peabodyawards.com|access-date = January 20, 2016|date = 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160123165202/http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/serial|archivedate = January 23, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jeffrey P.

In an interview with [[Jon Ronson]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Syed's mother Shamim and younger brother Yusuf both said they listened to the podcast and that people sent transcripts to Syed in prison.

''The Guardian'' summarized the season by saying Koenig and her team managed to add to the conversation: "Not only did they let Bergdahl speak for himself, via a series of interviews with the film-maker Mark Boal, but they also asked and answered a question that no one – including the military or the US government – had seemingly bothered to investigate."&lt;ref name="Guardian16"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/05/serial-season-two-bowe-bergdahl-podcast | title=Serial season two: why did the 'must-listen show' suffer a sophomore slump? | author=Melissa Locker | date=5 April 2016 | publisher=The Guardian | access-date=14 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613190833/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/05/serial-season-two-bowe-bergdahl-podcast | archivedate=13 June 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Season 2 of ''Serial'' was less about solving a mystery and more about long-term investigative reporting and storytelling. Zach Baron of ''GQ Magazine'' reported that he liked the season overall and thought it gave an invaluable document of what it is like to serve in modern wars, but said it was also "something of a cultural disappointment, at least compared to last season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gq.com/story/serial-season-2 | title=Serial Season 2 Wasn't a Phenomenon—But It Was Still Pretty Phenomenal | author=Zach Baron | date=2 April 2016 | publisher=GQ | access-date=14 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615012538/http://www.gq.com/story/serial-season-2 | archivedate=15 June 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to Season 1's critical response, some felt that the lack of answers was "infuriating."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/01/serial-season-2-finale-recap-bowe-bergdahl | title=Serial finale recap: 'Present for Duty' | author=Chris Nashawaty | date=1 April 2016 | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | access-date=14 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714092646/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/01/serial-season-2-finale-recap-bowe-bergdahl | archivedate=14 July 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/when-serial-podcast-season-2-finale-bowe-bergdahls-future-season-3-subject-unclear-2345539 | title=When Is 'Serial' Podcast Season 2 Finale?

Switching to a bi-weekly schedule mid-season caused some to believe the series was losing momentum.&lt;ref name="Guardian16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT16"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/business/media/serial-podcast-needing-more-reporting-time-goes-biweekly.html | title='Serial' Podcast, Needing More Reporting Time, Goes Biweekly | author=John Koblin | date=12 January 2016 | publisher=New York Times | access-date=15 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318125904/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/business/media/serial-podcast-needing-more-reporting-time-goes-biweekly.html | archivedate=18 March 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/how-making-a-murderer-eclipsed-serial-season-2/ | title=How 'Making a Murderer' Eclipsed 'Serial' Season 2 | author=Tim Molloy | date=20 January 2016 | publisher=The Wrap | access-date=15 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611020026/http://www.thewrap.com/how-making-a-murderer-eclipsed-serial-season-2/ | archivedate=11 June 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'', Sarah Koenig and executive producer Julie Snyder said the download numbers for Season 2 were 50 million, higher than the numbers were by the time Season 1 ended.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;

===Season 3 (2018)===
{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}
Season 3 received mostly positive reviews.

'''Sign singing''' or '''Karaoke signing''' is [[singing]] using [[sign language]]. Typically a song is played, and the performer expressively performs a sign language version of the lyrics.  Whereas singing uses pitch, tone, and emotions to convey expressions, sign singing relies on the performer's hands, body, and facial expressions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalsigningchoircompetition.org/|title=National Signing Choir Competition UK|website=National Signing Choir Competition UK|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choirs can perform sign singing and have gathered popularity in recent years as accessibility for the Deaf community and interest in signing languages have risen.  Competitions in which sign choirs can compete include the National Singing Choir Competition in the UK.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Well-known sign singers include the Japanese [[Tomoko Nakayama]], a follower of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], and the bawdy Australian duo [[Dislabelled]]. In London in 2003, a series of "Deaf Idol" events were held where deaf participants competed in karaoke singing, dance etc., in a similar format to the TV show [[Pop Idol]].
Sign language can be used to express extremely nuanced feeling, and so sign singing is an important creative input for the deaf.

Sign singing is featured in the movie ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' during a scene when two members of the "happy hands club" perform a song titled "The Rose" written by Bette Midler, entirely in sign. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=FlatheadedGorilla|title=Napoleon Dynamite - Happy Hands Club [HD]|date=2011-08-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5G3XKsq7Ic|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signing club depicted in the film was largely inspired by a sign singing club that was previously established at [[Preston High School (Idaho)]], where the movie was filmed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.handsandvoices.org/articles/SocEmot/V9-4_happyhands.htm|title=Hands &amp; Voices :: Articles|website=www.handsandvoices.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film brought wider attention to the club, originally called the "Good hands club," which was founded by educator Dan Robertson, who conceived the idea for the group while studying [[ASL]] at Brigham Young University. In 2013 the troupe performed on stages at Disneyland, in the Tabernacle in Salt Lake City with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and flew to Orlando for the convention of a large corporation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A sign language interpretation by the late Kimberly Rae Schaefer during [[Pearl Jam]]'s 2000 tour for "[[Given to Fly]]" garnered public attention for the passionate and emotional signing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pearljam.com/acts/news/remembering-kimberly-rae-schaefer|title=Pearl Jam - Remembering Kimberly Rae Schaefer|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Television of the USSR''' ({{lang-ru|Центральное телевидение СССР|translit=Tsentral'noye televideniye SSSR}}; abbr. '''CT USSR''' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Lang-ru|ЦТ СССР|translit=TsT SSSR}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) was the [[state media|state]] [[television]] broadcaster of the [[Soviet Union]].

Soviet TV programming was highly diverse and somewhat similar to that of the [[BBC]] or American [[PBS]]. Like much of the Soviet media, CT USSR regularly promoted the agendas of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Initially, the service was operated, together with the national radio service, by the [[Ministry of Culture (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Culture]]. Later it was operated by the [[Gosteleradio]] committee, under the [[Ministry of Communications (Soviet Union)|Communications Ministry]] and the Information and Press Ministry, and later a [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]]-controlled network of television and radio broadcasting.

==First decades==
[[File:Tv.resolution.chart.0249.svg|thumb|250px|Early Soviet [[test card]] (TIT-0249BIS, ТИТ-0249бис).]]
Radio was the dominant medium in the former [[Soviet Union]], however, in the 1930s preparations for television were in full swing.

On 1 October 1934, the first television sets were made available to the public. The next year, the first television broadcasts began.

The [[Soviet Union]] television service began full-time experimental test broadcasts on 1 March 1938.

Regular public programming began on 9 March 1938 - with an evening of programmes, which included news, documentary films and entertainment on '''Channel 1''' in [[Moscow]]. At the same time, '''[[Petersburg - Channel 5|Channel 5 Leningrad]]''', the national television service from Leningrad and the northern [[Soviet Union]], was launched on 7 July the same year.

Programmes were stopped in 1941 at the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], for fear that the Shabolovka transmitter would be used as an [[Nazi Germany|enemy]] beacon. The same thing happened in Leningrad due to the almost 4 years siege there in the city.

The USSR television service began experimental test broadcasts on 7 May 1945 (two days before the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]]), in preparation for its full reopening.

Regular public programming resumed on 7 March 1948.

The USSR television service temporarily stopped broadcasts in December 1948 for major upgrade of the broadcast equipment, but by 1 May the next year, Leningrad and the northern/northwestern USSR resumed television broadcasts for the [[Palace Square]] May Day Parade.

Regular programming resumed on 16 June 1949, but was now broadcasting in [[576i|625 lines]] - a first in the world.

On 22 March 1951, the '''Moscow TV''' station was renamed, to avoid confusion by viewers about the forthcoming local channels, becoming the '''Central Television Station''', later known as '''Programme 1'''. Leningrad's television service was also renamed into '''Leningrad Television''', and continued its national broadcasts.

On 26 August 1952, the '''Leningrad Television Centre''' was inaugurated, the USSR's first state-of-the-art television studios.

On [[New Year's Day]] 1955 the '''Central Television Station''' began transmitting daily programming.

On 14 February 1956, the new '''Moscow Programme''' commenced broadcasting for viewers in Moscow and in the surrounding [[Moscow Oblast]].

The USSR television service (both '''Programme 1''' and '''Moscow Programme 2''') began experimental colour broadcast tests on 14 January 1960.

The next year, Leningrad Television moved its studios and officers to larger premises.

The USSR authorities began construction of a television center in [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] in 1963 for the television networks. It was opened in 1967 as part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. Leningrad would soon follow suit the next year as the newly renovated and expanded '''Leningrad Television Broadcasting Center''' reopened its doors.

On 1 September 1964, CT USSR Programme One launched [[Spokoynoy nochi, malyshi!]] (Good Night, Kids!) as an answer to the [[East Germany|East German]] [[Sandmännchen]]. The idea was an animated film and then sending them to bed before the programmes for adults began at 21:00 (with the main evening news [[Vremya]]). With several generations of children growing up with the show, it has remained a popular childhood memory. [[Russia 1]] still continues this practice today.

On 29 March 1965, '''Programme Three''' commenced broadcasting. It was originally an educational channel. This channel was shown only in the major cities in the European USSR (e.g. Moscow and [[Leningrad]]), and its programming was co-produced with the USSR Ministry of Education, oriented towards the nation's student population at all levels from pre-school till college.

==Expansion==
In 1965, CT USSR established a satellite network to expand the television service nationwide.
*1965 - Experimental broadcast to the Far East via the [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]] system.
*1971 - Regular broadcasts begin in Siberia, the Far East and central Asia via the [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]] system.
*1971 - The [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]] satellite begins programmes to viewers in Kazakhstan.
*1976 - [[Ekran]] (Screen) satellite begins broadcasts. The satellite network for viewers in Soviet Asia (programmes were relayed by transmitter in the European side) was given the name "'''Orbita'''" in the same year.

In 1967, the all-new, youth, sport and entertainment network '''Programme 4''' was launched. '''Programme 3''', which was from the beginning available to Moscow only, began broadcasting to the entire USSR via satellite in 1982. Thus, it was renamed '''All-Union Programme''' for this purpose and moved to channel 2 in 1977, while [[Moscow Programme]] switched to channel 3. Science and technology programming formerly on Programme 4 moved to '''Programme 6''' when that channel was launched on 25 December 1971.

Concerts and musical programs also commemorated these and other national holidays. Since 1971 it was also the official network for the USSR's [[Pesnya goda]] All-Union National Soviet Music Festival aired on New Year's Day, also soon becoming a holiday practice for viewers across the nation.

==Colour==
[[File:УЭИТ.svg|left|thumb|250px|Soviet test card used in TV broadcasts in the USSR after the introduction of colour (Ueit, УЭИТ).]] 
Colour television was introduced on 1 October 1967, making the [[Soviet Union]] the fourth country in [[Europe]] to switch to colour broadcast, after the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[BBC2]], [[West Germany]] and [[France]] (see [[Timeline of the introduction of color television in countries]]), again ready for the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the [[National Day|October Revolution]] on 7 November 1967. '''Moscow Programme''' and '''Leningrad Television''' were the first colour broadcasters, even through the 7 November 1967 parade was broadcast in monochrome in the main national channels and Programme 4. CT USSR chose the [[France|French]] [[SÉCAM]] colour standard, which would later be adopted across the Eastern Bloc ([[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]], however, settled for the [[PAL]] standard).

By 1976, full colour broadcasts began throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]] using the SECAM format on all television programs broadcast on all the national channels: '''[[Programme One]]''', '''[[Programme Two]]''', '''[[Moscow Programme]]''', '''Programme Four''' and '''Programme Five - Leningrad Television''', and in all the republican networks.

==Olympic Games==
The hosting of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] by [[Moscow]] was a source of pride for the Eastern Bloc. However, the Soviet [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 had caused outrage in the west, leading to a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott of the games]] by 64 western-aligned nations. CT USSR, as the host nation broadcaster, presented a colour broadcast of the Games to the world, and in Soviet territory the Games were broadcast on the two main channels with additional coverage on Program 3, Program 4 and Leningrad Television as well as the republican channels in Belarus, Ukraine (football) and Estonia (sailing). The other republican stations also simulcast and highlighted the entire event.

==Gorizont==
In 1988, the [[USSR]]-built [[Gorizont]] satellite was launched, providing television programming to much of Europe and northern Africa, and even eastern parts of the Americas. The programmes of all the Eastern European socialist republics, including the CT USSR channels, were broadcast on the satellite.

==The reforms==
Significant changes to CT USSR were made in the 1980s as the USSR underwent economic and popular political changes brought about by the [[Glasnost|reforms]] in Moscow under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

At first, CT USSR stuck to the party line and barely reported the opposition to the communist regime. However, after the rule of the [[CPSU]] began to break down in 1990, CT USSR reformed their programmes to remove propaganda and to report news freely.

By the time the [[Glasnost]] came into effect, the main news programme on the then Programme 1 (Vremya) was being produced without censorship or interference, and so it covered the events in full. In recognition of its reliable coverage, the programme was re-broadcast on several TV channels around the world (such as [[Australia]]'s [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] and the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Sky News]]).

CT USSR, at the same time, started a number of new programme strands and formats, including talk shows.

On 4 March 1988, emphasizing the Glasnost campaign, '''Programme 3''' and '''Programme 4''', plus '''Leningrad Television''' began to be carried across the Soviet territory via satellite.

Private TV channels such as [[ATV (Russia)|ATV]] and [[2x2 (TV channel)|2×2]] were also introduced ending the state monopoly on television broadcasting. By 1990, CTV-USSR debuted its first joint international partnership program with the [[American Broadcasting Company]], entitled ''Capital to Capital''.

===Dissolution of the USSR===
Upon the total dissolution of the country on [[Christmas Day|25 December 1991]], '''Soviet Central Television''' (by now part of the ''All-Union National Radio and Television Broadcasting Corporation'' due to a 1990 reform) ceased to be the state broadcaster of the former USSR.

On 27 December 1991, '''Ostankino Television 1''' and '''Ostankino Television 4''' (Presently '''[[Channel One (Russia)]]''' and '''[[NTV (Russia)]]''') took over the frequencies of '''Programme 1''' and '''Programme 4'''. '''Leningrad Television 5''' soon became '''St. Petersburg State Television Network''', broadcasting to all of [[Russia]] until 1997.

Employees of CT USSR were worried about job prospects in the new broadcaster and also had a loyalty to '''Soviet Central Television'''. Viewers accustomed to the Russian programming, were concerned at the loss of favourite shows. (Some of the Soviet Central Television shows are now consigned to '''[[Channel One Russia]]''' and '''[[Russia 1]]''')  Additionally the three big Russian channels - '''Channel One''', '''Russia 1''' and '''Petersburg-Channel 5''' - have a good amount of presence in the former Soviet territory, and most of the republican stations are now fully independent.

==Former television stations==
Soviet Central Television had three and later six [[television]] channels over its history.
* '''[[Programme One]]''' was formed in 1938, and began to broadcast a regular daily schedule in 1955. This was the main channel in the former [[Soviet Union]] and was a crucial tool for the dissemination of propaganda by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Its output included general entertainment, documentaries and news.
*'''[[Programme Two]]''' was created in 1965. (Its name at first was '''Programme Three'''.) Its programmes was mostly entertainment, cultural, news and sport programming. This is also called the '''All-Union Program''' due to its national reach across the Soviet Union and the fact that even programs of all forms from the various Union republics were also broadcast here.
*'''[[Moscow Programme]]''' was created in 1956, the second channel to be launched. Its programming was somewhat similar to Program One, but was more flavored at the [[Moscow]] City and Region citizens.
*'''Programme Four''' was created in 1967-1968. Its programming was aimed at the [[intelligentsia]] and students at all levels.
*'''Programme Five''' - '''Leningrad Television''', the national television service from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] ([[St. Petersburg]]) and the northern and northwestern USSR was created in 1938, four months after the birth of television in the [[Soviet Union]]. Programmes from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad City]] and Region were aired here, plus those from the USSR's Baltic republics (the republics also had their share on Program 2, the All-Union Program). Today, it is '''[[Petersburg - Channel 5]]''' and still airs nationally (from 1992–1997 and from 2004 to present).
*'''Programme Six - Technology Programme''', opened in 1971, was the channel for broadcasts of scientific and technological programming, until 1980 assigned as an emergency channel for civil defense measures during wartime. Today, Programme 6 is the sports channel '''[[Match TV]]'''.

'''Central Television USSR''' signed off for the final time on 27 December 1991 and became '''Ostankino Television Channel 1''' and '''Ostankino Television Channel 4''', of Ostankino State Television. Its two remaining channels carried former their predecessors' programming. The direct successor of Soviet Central Television in Russia, it became defunct on 30 November 1994, becoming the '''Channel One Russia''' of today (It was then called until 2002 as '''ORT 1-Public Russian Television Channel 1'''.)

==Appearances==

The UEIT [[test card]] was used.

==Colour TV standard==
When colour television was introduced in 1967, the [[SÉCAM]] system was chosen. Following the collapse of the USSR, some of its former republics switched to the PAL colour system.

==Finance==
Broadcasting in the USSR was heavily subsidized by the state.

===Advertising===
Advertising - in the form of "commercial" magazine programmes - appeared on Soviet television from the 1980s. However, the [[Planned economy|command economy]] had little or no competition between brands, so advertising was limited to informing viewers of the prices and availability of products.

With [[perestroika]], [[spot advertising]] was introduced to CT USSR in order to better cover the system's cost.

==In popular culture==

The satirical TV series ''SCTV'' did a 1980 episode consisting of skits centered around a Russian satellite colliding with the SCTV satellite and causing Russian TV to be broadcast on SCTV's signal, with Soviet Central Television satirized as '3CCCP1' (''Three CP One'') and '3CCCP2' ('Three CP Two') and containing further satires of Russian programing with shows like ''Tibor's Tractor'' (a farmer has a tractor that is the reincarnation of Khrushchev, spoofing ''My Mother The Car'') ''Hey Georgy'' (a man wanders around Russia helping everybody), and a daytime show, ''Today is Moscow''. The episode is featured on ''SCTV'' DVD Volume 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12349">The '''terminal investment hypothesis''' is the idea in [[life history theory]] that as an organism's residual reproductive value (or the total reproductive value minus the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt) decreases, its reproductive effort will increase. Thus, as an organism's prospects for survival decreases (through age or an immune challenge, for example), it will invest more in reproduction. This hypothesis is generally supported in animals, although results contrary to it do exist.

==Definition==
The terminal investment hypothesis posits that as residual reproductive value (measured as the total reproductive value minus the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt&lt;ref name="Williams1966"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0003-0147| volume = 100| issue = 916| pages = 687–690| last = Williams| first = George C.| title = Natural selection, the costs of reproduction, and a refinement of Lack's principle| journal = The American Naturalist| year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;) decreases, reproductive effort increases.&lt;ref name="VelandoDrummond2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velando|first1=A.|last2=Drummond|first2=H.|last3=Torres|first3=R.|title=Senescent birds redouble reproductive effort when ill: confirmation of the terminal investment hypothesis|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=273|issue=1593|year=2006|pages=1443–1448|issn=0962-8452|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3480}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based off of the cost of reproduction hypothesis, which says that an increase in resources dedicated to current reproduction decreases the potential for future reproduction. But, as the residual reproductive value decreases, the importance of this trade-off decreases, leading to increased investment in the current reproductive attempt.&lt;ref name="CreightonHeflin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creighton|first1=J. Curtis|last2=Heflin|first2=Nicholas D.|last3=Belk|first3=Mark C.|title=Cost of reproduction, resource quality, and terminal investment in a burying beetle|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=174|issue=5|year=2009|pages=673–684|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/605963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminal investment hypothesis can be illustrated by the equation

&lt;math&gt;\hat{c}=\frac{(a+b)\phi}{(\Phi-\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the total reproductive value, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the proportionate increase in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; resulting from a positive decision (where a ''yes-no'' decision must be made regarding whether or not to increase reproductive effort), &lt;math&gt;\hat{c}&lt;/math&gt; the cost of a positive decision where there is no selective pressure for either a positive decision or negative decision (this variable is also known as the "barely-justified cost"). The variable &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the proportionate loss in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; from a negative decision. The barely-justified cost is thus inversely proportional to the residual reproductive value. When the level of reproductive investment has not reached the point where the equation above is true, more positive decisions about reproductive effort will be made. Thus, as the residual reproductive value decreases, more positive decisions need to be made so the equation is equal.&lt;ref name="Williams1966"/&gt;

==In animals==
In animals, most tests of the terminal investment hypothesis are correlations of age and reproductive effort, immune challenges on all age stages, and immune challenges on older ages versus younger ages. The last type of test is considered to be a more reliable measure of senescence's effect on reproductive effort, as younger individuals should reduce reproductive effort to reduce the change of death because of their high future reproductive prospects, while older animals should increase effort because of their low future prospects.&lt;ref name="VelandoDrummond2006"/&gt; Overall, the terminal investment hypothesis is generally supported in a variety of animals.&lt;ref name="KoenigKnops2017"/&gt;
===In birds===
A study on [[blue tit]]s published in 2000 found that individuals injected with a human [[diphtheria]]–[[tetanus]] [[vaccine]] fed their nestlings less than those injected with a [[control group|control]] solution.&lt;ref name="RabergNilsson2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raberg|first1=L.|last2=Nilsson|first2=J.-A.|last3=Ilmonen|first3=P.|last4=Stjernman|first4=M.|last5=Hasselquist|first5=D.|title=The cost of an immune response: vaccination reduces parental effort|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=3|issue=5|year=2000|pages=382–386|issn=1461-023X|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00154.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study published in 2004, [[house sparrow]]s that were injected with a [[Newcastle disease]] vaccine were more likely to lay a replacement clutch after their first clutch had been artificially removed than those that were injected with a control solution.&lt;ref name="BonneaudMazuc2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonneaud|first1=Camille|last2=Mazuc|first2=Jeremy|last3=Chastel|first3=Olivier|last4=Westerdahl|first4=Helena|last5=Sorci|first5=Gabriele|title=Terminal investment induced by immune challenge and fitness traits associated with major histocompatibility complex in the house sparrow|journal=Evolution|volume=58|issue=12|year=2004|pages=2823–2830|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study published in 2006, old [[blue-footed booby|blue-footed boobies]] injected with [[lipopolysaccharide]]s (to challenge the immune system) before laying fledged more young than normal, whereas young individuals fledged less than normal.&lt;ref name="VelandoDrummond2006"/&gt; An increase in maternal effort in immune challenged birds may be mediated by the hormone [[corticosterone]]; a study published in 2015 found that [[house wren]]s injected with lipopolysaccharides increased foraging, and that measurements of corticosterone from eggs laid after injection found a positive correlation of this hormone with maternal foraging rates.&lt;ref name="BowersBowden2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=E. Keith|last2=Bowden|first2=Rachel M.|last3=Sakaluk|first3=Scott K.|last4=Thompson|first4=Charles F.|title=Immune activation generates corticosterone-mediated terminal reproductive investment in a wild bird|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=185|issue=6|year=2015|pages=769–783|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/681017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In insects===
A study published in 2009 supported the cost of reproduction and terminal investment hypotheses in the [[burying beetle]]. It found that beetles manipulated to overproduce young (by replacing a {{convert|30|g|oz}} [[mouse]] carcass with a {{convert|20|g|oz}} carcass) had shorter lifespans than those that bred on just {{convert|30|g|oz}} carcasses, followed by those that had a {{convert|20|g|oz}} carcass. In turn, non-breeding beetles had a significantly longer lifespan than those that bred. This supports the cost of reproduction hypothesis. Another experiment from the same study found beetles that first bred at 65 days had a larger brood size before dispersal (before the larvae start to pupate in the soil) than those that initially bred at 28 days. This supports the terminal investment hypothesis, and prevents the effect of an increased average brood size in older animals due to differential survival of quality individuals.&lt;ref name="CreightonHeflin2009"/&gt;

===In flatworms===
A study published in 2004 on the [[flatworm]] ''Diplostomum spathaceum''' found that as its intermediate host, a snail, aged, production of cercariae (which are passed on to the final host, a fish) decreased. This is in line with the [[bet hedging (biology)|bet hedging]] hypothesis, which, in this case, says that the flatworm should attempt to keep its host alive longer so that more young can be produced; it does not support the terminal investment hypothesis.&lt;ref name="KarvonenKirsi2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karvonen|first1=A.|last2=Kirsi|first2=S.|last3=Hudson|first3=P. J.|last4=Valtonen|first4=E. T.|title=Patterns of cercarial production from ''Diplostomum spathaceum'': terminal investment or bet hedging?|journal=Parasitology|volume=129|issue=1|year=2004|pages=87–92|issn=0031-1820|doi=10.1017/S0031182004005281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
A study published in 2002 found results contrary to the terminal investment hypothesis in [[reindeer]]. Calf weight peaked at the mother's seventh year of age, and declined thereafter. However, this would only be opposed to the hypothesis if reproductive costs did not increase with age. An alternative hypothesis, the senescence hypothesis, positing that reproductive output declines with age-related loss of function, was supported by the study.&lt;ref name="WeladjiMysterud2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weladji|first1=Robert B.|last2=Mysterud|first2=Atle|last3=Holand|first3=Øystein|last4=Lenvik|first4=Dag|title=Age-related reproductive effort in reindeer (''Rangifer tarandus''): evidence of senescence|journal=Oecologia|volume=131|issue=1|year=2002|pages=79–82|issn=0029-8549|doi=10.1007/s00442-001-0864-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive; a study on [[rhesus macaque]]s published in 2010 strongly supported the senescence hypothesis and weakly supported the terminal investment hypothesis. It found that older mothers were lighter, less active, and had lighter infants with reduced survival rates compared to younger mothers (supporting the senescence hypothesis), older individuals spent more time in contact with their young (supporting the senescence hypothesis).&lt;ref name="HoffmanHigham2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Christy L.|last2=Higham|first2=James P.|last3=Mas-Rivera|first3=Adaris|last4=Ayala|first4=James E.|last5=Maestripieri|first5=Dario|title=Terminal investment and senescence in rhesus macaques (''Macaca mulatta'') on Cayo Santiago|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=21|issue=5|year=2010|pages=972–978|issn=1465-7279|doi=10.1093/beheco/arq098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study published in 1982 on [[red deer]] on the island of [[Rùm|Rhum]] found that while older mothers produced less offspring (and lighter offspring, when they did) than expected for a given body weight, they had longer suckling bouts (which had previously been correlated with milk yield, calf body condition in early winter, and calf survival to spring) compared to younger mothers.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clutton-Brock|first1=T. H.|title=Reproductive effort and terminal investment in iteroparous animals|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=123|issue=2|year=1984|pages=212–229|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/284198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reptiles===
A study on [[spotted turtle]]s published in 2008 found that individuals in very poor condition sometimes did not breed. This is consistent with the bet hedging hypothesis, and indicates decision making on a large temporal scale (as spotted turtles may live for 65 to 110 years. However, individuals in poor condition generally produced a relatively large amount of small eggs; consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis.&lt;ref name="LitzgusBolton2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litzgus|first1=Jacqueline D.|last2=Bolton|first2=Frances|last3=Schulte-Hostedde|first3=Albrecht I.|title=Reproductive output depends on body condition in spotted turtles (''Clemmys guttata'')|journal=Copeia|volume=2008|issue=1|year=2008|pages=86–92|issn=0045-8511|doi=10.1643/CH-07-093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In plants==
Although the terminal investment hypothesis has been relatively widely studied in animals, there have been few studies of the hypothesis' application to plants. One study on members of the long-lived oak genus ''[[Quercus]]'' found that trees declined in condition towards the end of their lifespan, and did not invest an increasing proportion of their decreasing resources in reproduction.&lt;ref name="KoenigKnops2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Walter D.|last2=Knops|first2=Johannes M. H.|last3=Carmen|first3=William J.|last4=Pesendorfer|first4=Mario B.|title=Testing the terminal investment hypothesis in California oaks|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=189|issue=5|year=2017|pages=564–569|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/691161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Yammouni left in 2016.

The Janoskians have avid fans known as 'Janoskianators'. Their videos include performing gross out humor and non-consensual pranks on members of the public as well as each other, [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], dares and [[Sketch comedy|skits]].

== Group members ==
All original five members were born in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Three of them are brothers: Beau the eldest, Luke and Jai are twins, they met Daniel and James at school. Beau and Daniel finished high school but James, Luke and Jai dropped out to focus on the group.

The group consists of:
* Beau Peter Brooks, born {{birth date and age|df=yes|1993|7|31}}, the oldest of the Brooks Brothers. Beau is commonly known as the front man for their music, with many professions including singing, modelling and acting.
* Luke Anthony-Mark Brooks, born {{birth date and age|df=yes|1995|5|3}}, elder twin to Jai Brooks. Luke is also a singer in the group.
* Jaidon "Jai" Domenic-Matthew Brooks, born {{birth date and age|df=yes|1995|5|3}}, younger twin and brother to Luke and Beau Brooks. Similarly to his brothers, he is a singer in the group.
* Daniel John-Richard Sahyounie, also known as "Skip", born {{birth date and age|df=yes|1994|10|31}}, a vocalist in the band.

=== Former members ===
* James Anthony Yammouni, born {{birth date and age|df=yes|1996|2|27}}, a rapper in the group, as well as DJing for the Janoskian shows. He releases yearly megamixes on New Year and presents "The James Yammouni Show" on YouNow. He left in 2016.&lt;ref name="twitter.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/janoskians/status/744608293167857664 |title=Janoskians on Twitter |access-date=20 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724175418/https://twitter.com/janoskians/status/744608293167857664 |archive-date=24 July 2018 |dead-url=no}}{{Primary source inline|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first video was uploaded in September 2011.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2u_O2E2oQM&amp;t=48s |title=Break Up To Make Up |last=Janoskians |date=27 September 2011 |via=YouTube |access-date=13 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522061500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2u_O2E2oQM |archive-date=22 May 2015 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their early videos were initially intended to be a way to show off their pranks to personal friends, but as time went on, they became popular among the general public. In an interview, a member said their video, "Awkward Train Situations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4rkVVVJMlc&amp;t=61s |title=Awkward Train Situations – ORIGINAL |last=Janoskians |date=19 October 2012 |via=YouTube |access-date=13 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108002050/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4rkVVVJMlc |archive-date=8 November 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;" was a part of the beginning of their, "kick-off" launch as a label.&lt;ref name="TimeOut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.au.timeout.com/melbourne/timein/features/2369/the-janoskians |title=The Janoskians interview |publisher=TimeOut Melbourne |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829070204/http://www.au.timeout.com/melbourne/timein/features/2369/the-janoskians |archive-date=29 August 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Janoskians offer material on [[social networking service]]s and are commonly the subject of [[fanfiction]].&lt;ref name="theage.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |author=Adrian Lowe |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/no-meet-no-greet-janoskians-fans-sent-home-20120402-1w7mq.html |title=No meet, no greet: Janoskians fans sent home from Luna Park |work=The Age |date=16 February 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610020127/http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/no-meet-no-greet-janoskians-fans-sent-home-20120402-1w7mq.html |archive-date=10 June 2013 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The Janoskians have been criticised for their reckless, dangerous and juvenile behaviour, and pushing their boundaries too far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/police-called-in-after-clash-between-pranksters-the-janoskians-and-facebeef-at-federation-square/story-e6frf7jo-1226563598313 |title=Police called in after clash between pranksters The Janoskians and Facebeef at Federation Square |accessdate=13 August 2014 |date=29 January 2013 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825211601/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/police-called-in-after-clash-between-pranksters-the-janoskians-and-facebeef-at-federation-square/story-e6frf7jo-1226563598313 |archive-date=25 August 2014 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media commentator]] Prue MacSween stated that, "Their act – if you can call it that – is so juvenile, and I think really irresponsible. It's astounding the power of the internet now. It just tells you that this global audience can be viral and suddenly nobodies with very little talent can suddenly be known by the world." The group has been criticised for pulling "disgusting pranks on strangers" and for engaging in "sleazy, offensive and intimidating" behaviour around babies and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/the-janoskians-slammed-over-repulsive-video/story-fni0b7je-1226658087578 |title=The Janoskians under fire for sick baby skit |accessdate=13 August 2014 |date=6 June 2013 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307092608/http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/the-janoskians-slammed-over-repulsive-video/story-fni0b7je-1226658087578 |archive-date=7 March 2016 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ansiktet''''' (Swedish "The Face") is a [[1958 in film|1958]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] film written and directed by [[Ingmar Bergman]]. It was released theatrically as ''The Face'' in the [[United Kingdom]], although video releases have used the U.S. title ''The Magician''.

The film stars [[Max von Sydow]] as a traveling magician named Albert Vogler. Reading reports of a variety of supernatural disturbances at Vogler's prior performances abroad, the leading townspeople request that Vogler's troupe provide them a sample of their act, before allowing them public audiences. The scientifically minded disbelievers try to expose them as charlatans, but Vogler has a few tricks up his sleeve.

The film was distantly inspired by [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s play ''Magic'', which Bergman numbered among his favourites. Bergman staged a theatre production of "''Magic''" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] at one point.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[31st Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
''The Magician'' has a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|unanimous approval rating]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Don Druker of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called it "one of Bergman's most tightly structured and frightening films."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1013065-magician/ |title=The Magician (1958) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it "A thoughtful (and too-long underrated) portrait of a man who is part-faker, part-genius."&lt;ref name="MaltinGreen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonard Maltin|author2=Spencer Green|author3=Rob Edelman|title=Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLtaAAAAYAAJ|date=January 2010|publisher=Plume|isbn=978-0-452-29577-3|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Woody Allen]] selected ''The Magician'' as one of the five Bergman films that he would most recommend to those unfamiliar with the filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1648917,00.html|title=Woody Allen on Ingmar Bergman|last=Corliss|first=Richard|magazine=TIME|date=August 1, 2007|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], a '''triad''' is a set of three notes (or "[[pitch class|pitch classes]]") that can be stacked vertically in thirds.&lt;ref name="Pen"&gt;Ronald Pen, ''Introduction to Music'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1992): 81. {{ISBN|0-07-038068-6}}. "A triad is a set of notes consisting of three notes built on successive intervals of a third. A triad can be constructed upon any note by adding alternating notes drawn from the scale. ... In each case the note that forms the foundation pitch is called the ''root'', the middle tone of the triad is designated the ''third'' (because it is separated by the interval of a third from the root), and the top tone is referred to as the ''fifth'' (because it is a fifth away from the root)."&lt;/ref&gt; The term "harmonic triad" was coined by [[Johannes Lippius]] in his ''Synopsis musicae novae'' (1612).

When stacked in thirds, notes produce triads. The triad's members, from lowest-pitched tone to highest, are called:&lt;ref name="Pen"/&gt;

* the '''root'''
* the '''third''' – its interval above the root being a [[minor third]] (three semitones) or a [[major third]] (four semitones)
* the '''fifth''' – its interval above the third being a minor third or a major third, hence its interval above the root being a [[diminished fifth]] (six semitones), [[perfect fifth]] (seven semitones), or [[augmented fifth]] (eight semitones). Perfect fifths are the most commonly used interval above the root in Western [[Classical music|classical]], [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]].

(Note: The notes of a triad do not have to use the root as the lowest note of the triad, due to the principle of [[Inverted chord|inversion]]. A triad can also use the third or fifth as the lowest note of the triad. Inverting a triad does not change the root note.)

Some twentieth-century theorists, notably [[Howard Hanson]]&lt;ref&gt;Howard Hanson, ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music: Resources of the Tempered Scale'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carlton Gamer]],&lt;ref&gt;Carlton Gamer, "Some Combinational Resources of Equal-Tempered Systems", ''Journal of Music Theory'' 11, no. 1 (1967): 37, 46, 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; expand the term to refer to any combination of three different pitches, regardless of the intervals amongst them. The word used by other theorists for this more general concept is "triad".&lt;ref&gt;Julien Rushton, "Triad", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Others, notably [[Allen Forte]], use the term to refer to combinations apparently stacked of other intervals, as in "[[Quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] triad".&lt;ref&gt;Allen Forte, ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Structure_of_Atonal_Music.html?id=j9aV2JYHY4AC The Structure of Atonal Music]'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1973): {{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;!--Electronic search of GoogleBooks scan finds only one use of "triad" (in "diminished triad") and no occurrence of "quartal". Of course, the GoogleBooks search function may not be complete.--&gt; {{ISBN|0-300-02120-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late [[Renaissance music]] era, and especially during the [[Baroque music]] era (1600–1750), Western art music shifted from a more "horizontal" [[contrapuntal]] approach (in which [[Polyphony|multiple, independent melody lines were interwoven]]) toward [[Chord progression|progression]]s, which are sequences of triads. The progression approach, which was the foundation of the Baroque-era [[basso continuo]] accompaniment, required a more "vertical" approach, thus relying more heavily on the triad as the basic building block of [[Diatonic function#Functional harmony|functional harmony]].

The root tone of a triad, together with the degree of the scale to which it corresponds, primarily determine a given triad's function. Secondarily, a triad's function is determined by its quality: [[major third|major]], [[minor third|minor]], [[diminished triad|diminished]] or [[augmented triad|augmented]]. Major and minor triads are the most commonly used triad qualities in Western [[classical music|classical]], [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]]. In standard [[tonal music]], only major and minor triads can be used as a [[tonic (music)|tonic]] in a song or some other piece of music. That is, a song or other vocal or instrumental piece can be in the key of C&amp;nbsp;major or A&amp;nbsp;minor, but a song or some other piece cannot be in the key of B&amp;nbsp;diminished or F&amp;nbsp;augmented (although songs or other pieces might include these triads within the triad progression, typically in a [[Passing triad|temporary, passing role]]). Three of these four kinds of triads are found in the major (or diatonic) scale. In popular music and 18th-century classical music, major and minor triads are considered to be [[consonance (music)|consonant]] and stable, and diminished and augmented triads are considered to be [[dissonance (music)|dissonant]] and unstable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

{{quote|When we consider musical works we find that the triad is ever-present and that the interpolated [[dissonance (music)|dissonances]] have no other purpose than to effect the continuous variation of the triad.|[[Lorenz Mizler]] (1739)&lt;ref&gt;Allen Forte, ''Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice'', third edition (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1979): 136. {{ISBN|0-03-020756-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Construction==
Triads (or any other [[tertian]] triads) are built by superimposing ''every other'' note of a [[Diatonic|diatonic scale]] (e.g., standard major or minor scale). For example, a C&amp;nbsp;major triad uses the notes C–E–G. This spells a triad by ''skipping over'' D and F. While the interval from each note to the one above it is a third, the quality of those thirds varies depending on the quality of the triad:
*''major'' triads contain a major third and perfect fifth interval, symbolized: R 3 5 (or  0–4–7 as semitones) {{Audio|Major triad on C.mid|play}}
*''minor'' triads contain a minor third, and perfect fifth, symbolized: R {{music|flat}}3 5 (or  0–3–7) {{Audio|Minor triad on C.mid|play}}
*''diminished'' triads contain a minor third, and diminished fifth, symbolized: R {{music|flat}}3 {{music|flat}}5  (or  0–3–6) {{Audio|Diminished triad on C.mid|play}}
*''augmented'' triads contain a major third, and augmented fifth, symbolized: R 3 {{music|sharp}}5  (or  0–4–8) {{Audio|Augmented triad on C.mid|play}}

The above definitions spell out the interval of each note above the root. Since triads are constructed of stacked thirds, they can be alternatively defined as follows:
* ''major'' triads contain a major third with a minor third stacked above it, e.g., in the major triad C–E–G (C&amp;nbsp;major), the interval C–E is major third and E–G is a minor third.
* ''minor'' triads contain a minor third with a major third stacked above it, e.g., in the minor triad A–C–E (A&amp;nbsp;minor), A–C is a minor third and C–E is a major third.
* ''diminished'' triads contain two minor thirds stacked, e.g., B–D–F (B&amp;nbsp;diminished)
* ''augmented'' triads contain two major thirds stacked, e.g., D–F{{Music|sharp}}–A{{Music|sharp}} (D&amp;nbsp;augmented).

==Function==
[[File:Primary triads in C.png|thumb|Primary triads in C {{audio|Primary triads in C.mid|Play}}.]]
Each triad found in a diatonic (single-scale-based) key corresponds to a particular [[diatonic function]]. Functional harmony tends to rely heavily on the [[primary triad]]s: triads built on the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], [[subdominant]] (typically the ii or IV triad), and [[dominant (music)|dominant]]  (typically the V triad) degrees.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Daniel Harrison, ''Harmonic Function in Chromatic Music: A Renewed Dualist Theory and an Account of its Precedents'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994): 45. {{ISBN|0-226-31808-7}}. Cited on p.&amp;nbsp;274 of Deborah Rifkin, "A Theory of Motives for Prokofiev's Music", ''Music Theory Spectrum'' 26, no. 2 (2004): 265–289.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of these triads begin on the first, fourth, and fifth degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, otherwise symbolized: I, IV, and V (respectively). Primary triads, "express [[diatonic function|function]] clearly and unambiguously."&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The other triads of the diatonic key include the [[supertonic]], [[mediant (music)|mediant]], [[submediant]], and [[subtonic]], whose roots begin on the second, third, sixth, and seventh degrees (respectively) of the diatonic scale, otherwise symbolized: ii, iii, vi, and vii{{music|diminished}} (respectively). They function as auxiliary or supportive triads to the primary triads.
