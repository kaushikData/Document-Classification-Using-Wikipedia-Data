[[File:Antonia 1906.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A tower of the Antonia Fortress in 1906]]
The '''Antonia Fortress''' ([[Aramaic]]:קצטרא דאנטוניה)&lt;ref&gt;Based on Josephus' use of the word "citadel" or "fortress" when referring to the Antonia Fortress.&lt;/ref&gt; was a military barracks built over the [[Hasmonean Baris]] by [[Herod the Great]]. Named for his patron [[Mark Antony]], a pre 31 BC date is certain for the Fort as Mark Anthony was defeated by Octavius (later Augustus Caesar) at the sea battle of Actium in 31 BC. Built in [[Jerusalem]] on the site of earlier [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] and [[Hasmonean]] strongholds, the fortress was built at the eastern end of the great wall of the city (the second wall), on the northeastern side of the city, near the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Pool of Bethesda]].

==Description==
Although modern reconstructions often depict the fortress as having a tower at each of four corners, the historian [[Josephus]] repeatedly refers to it as ''the tower Antonia'', and stated that it had been built by [[John Hyrcanus]] for [[vestry|storing the vestments used in the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18:4:3&lt;/ref&gt; However, Josephus states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The general appearance of the whole was that of a tower with other towers at each of the four corners; three of these turrets were fifty [[cubits]] high, while that at the south-east angle rose to seventy cubits and so commanded a view of the whole area of the temple."&lt;ref&gt;B.J. v. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some archaeologists are of the opinion that the fortress was only a single tower, located at the south-east corner of the site;&lt;ref name="Benoit89"&gt;Pierre Benoit, "The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress", page 89, in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by Yigael Yadin), (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[Pierre Benoit (archaeologist)|Pierre Benoit]], former professor of New Testament studies at the [[École Biblique]], having carried out extensive archaeological studies of the site, concurs and adds that there is absolutely no [archaeological] support for there having been four towers.&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt;

Josephus attests to the importance of the Antonia: "For if the Temple lay as a fortress over the city, Antonia dominated the Temple &amp; the occupants of that post were the guards of all three." Josephus placed the Antonia at the northwest corner of the colonnades surrounding the Temple. Modern depictions often show the Antonia as being located along the north side of the temple enclosure. However, Josephus' description of the siege of Jerusalem suggests that it was separated from the temple enclosure itself and probably connected by two colonnades with a narrow space between them. Josephus' measurements suggest about a 600-foot separation between the two complexes.

Why did the two 600-foot aerial bridges disappear from the pages of history? They were mentioned in two 19th-century books written by scholars Lewin, Sanday &amp; Waterhouse, who probably read Josephus in the original Greek, whilst others, later relied on William Whiston, an 18th-century translator. We cannot know if Whiston was influenced by traditional thinking but he probably decided that Josephus had erred when he gave the length of the aerial roadways as a furlong ([[Stadion (unit)|Stadion]]), so Whiston used the words “no long space of ground”. War VI, 2, 144

Based upon Jerusalem’s topography and the impossibility of placing Fort Antonia six hundred feet further north of the alleged Temple Mount, Whiston’s translation obscured their existence, although there are ten references in Josephus to these bridges.

Prior to the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the Antonia housed some part of the Roman garrison of Jerusalem. The Romans also stored the [[Ephod|high priest's vestments]] within the Fortress.

During the defence of Herod’s Temple, supposedly the Jewish fighters demolished the Tower of Antonia. Josephus is adamant the Jews had no chance of destroying a huge Roman fort with 60-foot walls, defended by thousands of Roman troops. It’s the destruction of the two 600-foot aerial bridges that is meant. It fulfilled the prophecy: “When square the walls, the Temple falls.” Roman soldiers then hastened to construct siege banks against the Temple’s north wall. Battle lasted until they seized the sanctuary.

==Site of Pilate's ''Praetorium''?==
Traditionally, it has been thought that the vicinity of the Antonia Fortress later became the site of the ''[[Praetorium]]'', and that this latter building was the place where [[Jesus]] was taken to stand before [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] (see [[Pilate's court]]). However, this tradition was based on the mistaken assumption that an area of Roman flagstones, discovered beneath the [[Church of the Condemnation and Imposition of the Cross]] and the [[Convent of the Sisters of Zion]], was the pavement (Greek: ''lithostratos'') which the [[Bible]] describes as the location of [[Pontius Pilate]]'s [[judge|judgment]] of [[Jesus]];&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|19:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigation now indicates that these slabs are the paving of the eastern of two 2nd century [[Roman Forum|Forums]], built by [[Hadrian]] as part of the construction of [[Aelia Capitolina]].&lt;ref name="Benoit"&gt;[[Pierre Benoit (archaeologist)|Pierre Benoit]], ''The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress'', in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by [[Yigael Yadin]]), (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The site of the Forum had previously been a large open-air pool, the [[Struthion Pool]], which was constructed by the [[Hasmonean]]s, is mentioned by Josephus as being adjacent to the Fortress in the 1st century,&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish War'' 5:11:4&lt;/ref&gt; and is still present beneath Hadrian's flagstones; the traditional scene would require that everyone was walking on water.

Like [[Philo]], Josephus testifies that the Roman governors stayed in [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]] while they were in Jerusalem,&lt;ref name="Benoit87"&gt;Pierre Benoit, ''The Archaeological Reconstruction of the Antonia Fortress'', page 87, in ''Jerusalem Revealed'' (edited by Yigael Yadin), (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; and carrying out their judgements on the pavement immediately outside it;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'', 2:14:8&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus indicates that Herod's palace is on the Western Hill (Upper City)&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'', 5:2&lt;/ref&gt; and it has recently (2001) been rediscovered under a corner of the [[Tower of David|Jaffa Gate citadel]] according to Jacqueline Schaalje, "Israeli Archaeologists Discover Herod's Palace", The Jewish Magazine (October 2001}.  Archaeologists now therefore conclude that in the 1st century, the ''Praetorium'' – the residence of the governor (''Praefectus – later Procurator'') – was on the Western Hill, rather than the Antonia Fortress, on the diametrically opposite side of the city.&lt;ref name="Benoit" /&gt;

The '''Blackstone Canal''' was a waterway linking [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] (and Narragansett Bay) through the Blackstone Valley via a series of locks and [[canal]]s during the early 19th century.

==History==

The initiative for the canal came from Providence, where a merchant community wished to profit from trade with the farming country of the Blackstone Valley and Worcester County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachushistory.org/detocqueville-visit-united-states/articles/blackstone-canal-artery-heart-commonwealth| Teachushistory.org|Blackstone Canal-artery-heart of the Commonwealth]&lt;/ref&gt; The people of Worcester and the Blackstone Valley, eager for transport that would enable them to get better prices for their produce, welcomed the plan.  However, since the trade of central Massachusetts was at that time going overland through the port of Boston, Massachusetts commercial interests succeeded in stalling the project for several years.  Finally, in 1823, the  Blackstone Canal Company was organized through an act of the Massachusetts legislature, with a Rhode Island company soon following.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112"&gt;Muir, Diana, Reflections in Bullough's Pond, University Press of New England, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;  The canal's construction may have been motivated by competition among rival industrialists to curtail "[[water rights]]".&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{cite web |title=Stanely Woolen Mill, The Story |publisher=Deaneredevelopment.com |url=http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720070524/http://deaneredevelopment.com/stanley-woolen-mill-story.html |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction began in 1825 and cost $750,000 (twice its initial estimate). The canal opened on October 7, 1828 when the [[packet boat]] ''Lady Carrington'' arrived in Worcester, the first vessel to make the trip. The canal brought immediate prosperity to Worcester and the Valley; farmers' profits increased and mills were built, especially in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Muir, Diana p.112" /&gt; Using water to transport goods was a great improvement over the rough roads of the era. At the time of its construction, it represented the best available transportation technology.

It was a two-day trip for the canal boats from Worcester to Providence and another two-day trip to return to Worcester. The overnight stopping point was in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]]. Boston merchants moved to recapture the trade moving down the canal to Providence, opening a rail line to Worcester in 1835.  (Boston merchants opened three railroads in 1835, one to Lowell, one to Worcester, and one to Providence, RI. These were very new technology.) In 1847 the parallel [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] began operation, and the canal closed in 1848.

The canal was 35 feet or more in width. It ascended 451 feet, passing through an original 49 locks. The canal used "slack-water" to bypass narrow valley areas and intersected the Blackstone River 16 times over its 45-mile course. It ran in the river itself for 10% of its length. These portions proved troublesome since in summer, water was sometimes too low for navigation. In other periods, flooding was the problem. Winter added ice to the issues.

Each lock was 70 feet long by 10 feet wide and apparently 4–4.5 feet deep. All, except the wooden tide lock at Providence, were built of granite on a wooden foundation. The average lift of each lock was 9.2 feet, but there were variations.

The canal was engineered by [[Benjamin Wright]] (chief engineer of the [[Erie Canal]]) and Holmes Hutchinson (later Chief Engineer of New York's canals) as they were concluding work on the original Erie Canal. Its locks are therefore similar, although smaller, than the original Erie's.

The canal followed the course of Mill Creek from the center of Worcester, MA to the southern part of that community. It then followed the Blackstone River downstream to Ashton, RI. At Ashton, it paralleled the river's west bank, maintaining elevation until it entered Cranberry and Scotts Ponds on the divide of the watershed with the Moshassuck River. It then locked down into the Moshassuck Valley and followed that stream into Providence, RI.

==The canal today==
Since the canal's closure, parts of its watercourse were filled and other segments are now heavily overgrown with brush and trees. Other sections were converted to hydraulic canals for textile mills. Much of the lock masonry was sold for other purposes. Its remains, however, are still visible in many locations. About 85% of the canal remains. Two long sections of the canal exist in the [[Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park]] in Massachusetts and the [[Blackstone River State Park]] in Rhode Island. Other sections are also publicly owned.

The canal is the subject of several listings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  The southernmost portion of the canal, between Providence and the Ashton Dam in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island]], was listed in 1971; this list was expanded in 1991 to include the entire Rhode Island section.  A {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} section of the canal in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]] and [[Northbridge, Massachusetts]] was listed in 1973; this listing was expanded in 1995 to encompass the entire historic footprint of the canal in Massachusetts.

== Significance ==
The Blackstone Canal is historically significant as a transportation network arising from a canal-building frenzy of the early 19th-century. The canal played a key role in stimulating the industry between Providence and Worcester and the towns and villages along the Moshassuck
and Blackstone Rivers. Though its useful service life was just twenty years long, the canal and the parks incorporating the canal are "visible and tangible parts of the city's and the state's history of growth, planning, commercial ambition and prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/lincoln/linc_blackstone-canal_ronci-park.pdf | title=National Register of Historic Places - Blackstone Canal | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borqs has been a member of the [[Open Handset Alliance]] since 2008 and is also a member of the [[Symbian Foundation]]. Borqs is notable as the developer of the [[OPhone]], or Open Mobile System (OMS), for [[China Mobile]].&lt;ref name="Marbridge"&gt;[http://www.marbridgeconsulting.com/marbridgedaily/2011-06-08/article/46775/borqs_to_launch_ophone_30_in_q1_2012 Borqs to Launch OPhone 3.0 in Q1 2012], Marbridge Consulting Daily Report.&lt;/ref&gt; The OPhone is a Linux-kernel-based open source software platform that has been used in conjunction with China Mobile's proprietary [[TD-SCDMA]] [[3G]] network.

'''CHFS''' is a [[file system]] developed at the Department of Software Engineering, [[University of Szeged]], [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Intromail"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2011/11/10/msg011855.html | title=Intromail | accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first open source [[Flash memory]]-specific file system written for the [[NetBSD]] [[operating system]].

==Structure==
Similar to [[UBIFS]], the CHFS file system utilizes a separate layer for handling Flash aging and bad blocks, called EBH (erase block handler). The file system itself is modelled after [[JFFS2]], thus the internal structure is very similar.

==ChewieFS==
CHFS was originally called ChewieFS during development. The name was changed to avoid legal issues and to have a more neutral name.

==History==

===Early history===
{{see also|Acorn Computers}}
After Acorn withdrew from the [[desktop computer]] industry in 1998, Castle Technology acquired the rights to produce the [[Acorn A7000|A7000]], [[Acorn A7000|A7000+]] and [[RiscPC|RISC PC]] using the ''Acorn'' brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===2001-2008: Iyonix PC===
The [[Iyonix PC]] (codenamed ''Tungsten'') was developed as a [[Set-top box|set-top unit]] (STU) in secret by engineers at [[Pace plc|Pace's]] Shipley campus along with a [[32-bit]] version of [[RISC OS|RISC OS 4]] (known as RISC OS 5). When management discovered the project the campus was closed.&lt;ref name="RISCWorld - Volume 9, Issue 3"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.apdl.co.uk/riscworld/volume9/issue3/iyorip/index.htm
 | title = Iyonix R.I.P.
 | work = Foundation RISCWorld
 | publisher = Archimedes Public Domain Library
 | accessdate = 5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle Technology acquired the proposed designs and the original engineers from Pace to further develop the Tungsten into a [[desktop computer]]. Robert Sprowson, the original hardware designer, declined to join Castle Technology and so Peter Wild was recruited.&lt;ref name="RISCWorld - Volume 9, Issue 3"/&gt;

The Iyonix PC was released six months later. Although it was well received, it was not designed for long-term production and therefore used some components that were near obsolete when it was released.&lt;ref name="RISCWorld - Volume 9, Issue 3"/&gt;

A problem for the Iyonix PC was that it used [[lead]]ed components which were outlawed with the adoption of [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|Directive 2002/95/EC]] in February 2003 by the [[European Union]]. However, by this time Castle Technology was financially troubled and could not afforded to re-engineer the Iyonix PC without the leaded components.&lt;ref name="RISCWorld - Volume 9, Issue 3"/&gt; The remaining Iyonix stock were passed to Iyonix Limited which stopped distribution on 30 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

[[File:Crane machine slewing platform.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a modern mobile crane with [[outrigger]]s. The [[lattice girder|latticed]] boom is fitted with a [[Jib (crane)|jib]].]]
A '''crane''' is a type of [[machine]], generally equipped with a [[hoist (device)|hoist rope]], [[wire rope]]s or [[chain]]s, and [[Sheave (mechanical)|sheaves]], that can be used both to lift and lower materials and to move them horizontally. It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other places. The device uses one or more [[simple machine]]s to create [[mechanical advantage]] and thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed in the [[transport]] industry for the loading and unloading of freight, in the [[construction]] industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry for the assembling of [[heavy equipment]].

The first known construction cranes were invented by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and were powered by men or beasts of burden, such as donkeys. These cranes were used for the construction of tall buildings. Larger cranes were later developed, employing the use of human [[treadwheel]]s, permitting the lifting of heavier weights. In the [[High Middle Ages]], harbour cranes were introduced to load and unload ships and assist with their construction – some were built into stone towers for extra strength and stability. The earliest cranes were constructed from wood, but [[cast iron]], [[iron]] and [[steel]] took over with the coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

For many centuries, power was supplied by the physical exertion of men or animals, although hoists in [[watermill]]s and [[windmill]]s could be driven by the harnessed natural power. The first 'mechanical' power was provided by [[steam engine]]s, the earliest [[steam crane]] being introduced in the 18th or 19th century, with many remaining in use well into the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brynthomascranes.com/cranes-guide/#how-are-cranes-powered |title=How Are Cranes Powered? |publisher=Bryn Thomas Cranes |date=|accessdate=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern cranes usually use [[internal combustion engine]]s or [[electric motor]]s and [[hydraulic]] systems to provide a much greater lifting capability than was previously possible, although manual cranes are still utilized where the provision of power would be uneconomic.

Cranes exist in an enormous variety of forms – each tailored to a specific use. Sizes range from the smallest jib cranes, used inside workshops, to the tallest tower cranes, used for constructing high buildings. Mini-cranes are also used for constructing high buildings, in order to facilitate constructions by reaching tight spaces. Finally, we can find larger floating cranes, generally used to build oil rigs and salvage sunken ships.

Some lifting machines do not strictly fit the above definition of a crane, but are generally known as cranes, such as stacker cranes and loader cranes.

==Etymology==
Cranes were so called from the resemblance to the long neck of the [[Crane (bird)|bird]], cf. &lt;span title="géranos"&gt;{{lang-grc|γέρανος}}&lt;/span&gt;, French ''grue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cranes|volume=7|pages=368–372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
[[File:Trispastos scheme.svg|thumb|Greco-Roman ''Trispastos'' ("Three-pulley-crane"), the simplest crane type (150 kg load)]]

The crane for lifting heavy loads was invented by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] in the late 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological record shows that no later than c. 515 BC distinctive cuttings for both lifting tongs and [[Chain-linked Lewis|lewis irons]] begin to appear on stone blocks of Greek temples. Since these holes point at the use of a lifting device, and since they are to be found either above the center of gravity of the block, or in pairs equidistant from a point over the center of gravity, they are regarded by archaeologists as the positive evidence required for the existence of the crane.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 7"/&gt;

The introduction of the [[winch]] and [[pulley]] hoist soon lead to a widespread replacement of [[Inclined plane|ramps]] as the main means of vertical motion. For the next 200 years, Greek building sites witnessed a sharp reduction in the weights handled, as the new lifting technique made the use of several smaller stones more practical than fewer larger ones. In contrast to the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic period]] with its pattern of ever-increasing block sizes, Greek temples of the classical age like the [[Parthenon]] invariably featured stone blocks weighing less than 15–20 metric tons. Also, the practice of erecting large monolithic columns was practically abandoned in favour of using several column drums.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 14f."&gt;{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|pp=14ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the exact circumstances of the shift from the ramp to the crane technology remain unclear, it has been argued that the volatile social and political conditions of [[Greece]] were more suitable to the employment of small, professional construction teams than of large bodies of unskilled labour, making the crane more preferable to the Greek [[polis]] than the more labour-intensive ramp which had been the norm in the autocratic societies of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] or [[Assyria]].&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 14f."/&gt;

The first unequivocal literary evidence for the existence of the compound pulley system appears in the ''Mechanical Problems'' (''Mech''. 18, 853a32–853b13) attributed to [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), but perhaps composed at a slightly later date. Around the same time, block sizes at Greek temples began to match their archaic predecessors again, indicating that the more sophisticated compound pulley must have found its way to Greek construction sites by then.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 16"&gt;{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
{{See also|Treadwheel crane}}
[[File:Pentaspastos scheme.svg|thumb|Greco-Roman ''Pentaspastos'' ("Five-pulley-crane"), a medium-sized variant (c. 450 kg load)]]
[[File:Roemerkran.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of a 10.4&amp;nbsp;m high Roman ''Polyspastos'' powered by a treadwheel at [[Bonn]], Germany]]

The heyday of the crane in ancient times came during the [[Roman Empire]], when construction activity soared and buildings reached enormous dimensions. The Romans adopted the Greek crane and developed it further. We are relatively well informed about their lifting techniques, thanks to rather lengthy accounts by the engineers [[Vitruvius]] (''De Architectura'' 10.2, 1–10) and [[Heron of Alexandria]] (''Mechanica'' 3.2–5). There are also two surviving reliefs of Roman [[treadwheel crane]]s, with the [[Quintus Haterius|Haterii]] tombstone from the late first century AD being particularly detailed.

The simplest Roman crane, the ''trispastos'', consisted of a single-beam jib, a [[winch]], a [[rope]], and a block containing three pulleys. Having thus a [[mechanical advantage]] of 3:1, it has been calculated that a single man working the winch could raise 150&amp;nbsp;kg (3 pulleys x 50&amp;nbsp;kg = 150), assuming that 50&amp;nbsp;kg represent the maximum effort a man can exert over a longer time period. Heavier crane types featured five pulleys (''pentaspastos'') or, in case of the largest one, a set of three by five pulleys (''Polyspastos'') and came with two, three or four masts, depending on the maximum load. The ''polyspastos'', when worked by four men at both sides of the winch, could readily lift 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg (3 ropes x 5 pulleys x 4 men x 50&amp;nbsp;kg = 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg). If the winch was replaced by a treadwheel, the maximum load could be doubled to 6,000&amp;nbsp;kg at only half the crew, since the treadwheel possesses a much bigger mechanical advantage due to its larger diameter. This meant that, in comparison to the construction of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], where about 50 men were needed to move a 2.5 ton stone block up the ramp (50&amp;nbsp;kg per person), the lifting capability of the Roman ''polyspastos'' proved to be ''60 times'' higher (3,000&amp;nbsp;kg per person).&lt;ref&gt;All data from: {{harvnb|Dienel|Meighörner|1997|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, numerous extant Roman buildings which feature much heavier stone blocks than those handled by the ''polyspastos'' indicate that the overall lifting capability of the Romans went far beyond that of any single crane. At the temple of Jupiter at [[Baalbek]], for instance, the [[architrave]] blocks weigh up to 60 tons each, and one corner [[cornice]] block even over 100 tons, all of them raised to a height of about 19 m.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 16"/&gt; In [[Rome]], the capital block of Trajan's Column weighs 53.3 tons, which had to be lifted to a height of about 34 m (see [[Trajan's Column#Construction|construction of Trajan's Column]]).&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999, 426"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is assumed that Roman engineers lifted these extraordinary weights by two measures (see picture below for comparable Renaissance technique): First, as suggested by Heron, a lifting tower was set up, whose four masts were arranged in the shape of a quadrangle with parallel sides, not unlike a [[siege tower]], but with the column in the middle of the structure (''Mechanica'' 3.5).&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999, 427ff."&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=427ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, a multitude of [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]] were placed on the ground around the tower, for, although having a lower leverage ratio than treadwheels, capstans could be set up in higher numbers and run by more men (and, moreover, by draught animals).&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999, 434ff."&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=434ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of multiple capstans is also described by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (17.4.15) in connection with the lifting of the [[List of obelisks in Rome|Lateranense obelisk]] in the [[Circus Maximus]] (c. 357 AD). The maximum lifting capability of a single capstan can be established by the number of lewis iron holes bored into the monolith. In case of the Baalbek architrave blocks, which weigh between 55 and 60 tons, eight extant holes suggest an allowance of 7.5 ton per lewis iron, that is per capstan.&lt;ref name="Lancaster 1999, 436"&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifting such heavy weights in a concerted action required a great amount of coordination between the work groups applying the force to the capstans.

===Middle Ages===

During the [[High Middle Ages]], the treadwheel crane was reintroduced on a large scale after the technology had fallen into disuse in western Europe with the demise of the [[Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to a treadwheel (''magna rota'') reappears in archival literature in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; In navigation, the earliest uses of harbor cranes are documented for [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] in 1244, [[Antwerp]] in 1263, [[Brugge]] in 1288 and [[Hamburg]] in 1291,&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in England the treadwheel is not recorded before 1331.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 524"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tretkran (Bruegel).jpg|thumb|Double treadwheel crane in Pieter Bruegel's ''[[The Tower of Babel (Bruegel)|The Tower of Babel]]'']]

Generally, vertical transport could be done more safely and inexpensively by cranes than by customary methods. Typical areas of application were harbors, mines, and, in particular, building sites where the treadwheel crane played a pivotal role in the construction of the lofty [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]]. Nevertheless, both archival and pictorial sources of the time suggest that newly introduced machines like treadwheels or [[wheelbarrow]]s did not completely replace more labor-intensive methods like [[ladder]]s, [[Brick hod|hods]] and handbarrows. Rather, old and new machinery continued to coexist on medieval construction sites&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harbors.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345" /&gt;

Apart from treadwheels, medieval depictions also show cranes to be powered manually by windlasses with radiating [[spoke]]s, [[Crank (mechanism)|cranks]] and by the 15th century also by windlasses shaped like a [[ship's wheel]]. To smooth out irregularities of impulse and get over 'dead-spots' in the lifting process [[flywheel]]s are known to be in use as early as 1123.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact process by which the treadwheel crane was reintroduced is not recorded,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515" /&gt; although its return to construction sites has undoubtedly to be viewed in close connection with the simultaneous rise of Gothic architecture. The reappearance of the treadwheel crane may have resulted from a technological development of the [[windlass]] from which the treadwheel structurally and mechanically evolved. Alternatively, the medieval treadwheel may represent a deliberate reinvention of its Roman counterpart drawn from [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'' which was available in many monastic libraries. Its reintroduction may have been inspired, as well, by the observation of the labor-saving qualities of the [[Water wheel|waterwheel]] with which early treadwheels shared many structural similarities.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 524" /&gt;

====Structure and placement====
The medieval treadwheel was a large wooden wheel turning around a [[Axle|central shaft]] with a treadway wide enough for two workers walking side by side. While the earlier 'compass-arm' wheel had spokes directly driven into the central shaft, the more advanced 'clasp-arm' type featured arms arranged as chords to the wheel rim,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=525ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the possibility of using a thinner shaft and providing thus a greater mechanical advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|Single treadwheel crane working from top of the building]]

Contrary to a popularly held belief, cranes on medieval building sites were neither placed on the extremely lightweight [[scaffolding]] used at the time nor on the thin walls of the Gothic churches which were incapable of supporting the weight of both hoisting machine and load. Rather, cranes were placed in the initial stages of construction on the ground, often within the building. When a new floor was completed, and massive tie beams of the roof connected the walls, the crane was dismantled and reassembled on the roof beams from where it was moved from bay to bay during construction of the vaults.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 533"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the crane 'grew' and 'wandered' with the building with the result that today all extant construction cranes in England are found in church towers above the vaulting and below the roof, where they remained after building construction for bringing material for repairs aloft.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|pp=532ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less frequently, medieval illuminations also show cranes mounted on the outside of walls with the stand of the machine secured to putlogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mechanics and operation====
[[File:Trier Germany Alter Krahnen.jpg|thumb|right|Tower crane at the inland harbour of [[Trier]] from 1413.]]

In contrast to modern cranes, medieval cranes and hoists&amp;nbsp;– much like their counterparts in Greece and Rome&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 6"&gt;{{harvnb|Coulton|1974|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– were primarily capable of a vertical lift, and not used to move loads for a considerable distance horizontally as well.&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 533" /&gt; Accordingly, lifting work was organized at the workplace in a different way than today. In building construction, for example, it is assumed that the crane lifted the stone blocks either from the bottom directly into place,&lt;ref name="Matthies 1992, 533" /&gt; or from a place opposite the centre of the wall from where it could deliver the blocks for two teams working at each end of the wall.&lt;ref name="Coulton 1974, 6" /&gt; Additionally, the crane master who usually gave orders at the treadwheel workers from outside the crane was able to manipulate the movement laterally by a small rope attached to the load.&lt;ref name="Dienel, Meighörner 1997, 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Dienel|Meighörner|1997|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slewing cranes which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ashlar blocks were directly lifted by sling, lewis or devil's clamp (German ''Teufelskralle''), other objects were placed before in containers like [[pallet]]s, [[basket]]s, wooden boxes or [[barrel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noteworthy that medieval cranes rarely featured [[Ratchet (device)|ratchets]] or [[brake]]s to forestall the load from running backward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; This curious absence is explained by the high [[Friction|friction force]] exercised by medieval tread-wheels which normally prevented the wheel from accelerating beyond control.&lt;ref name="Dienel, Meighörner 1997, 17" /&gt;

====Harbour usage====
{{See also|List of historical harbour cranes}}
[[File:1742 build crane, used for mounting masts to large sailing vessels. Copenhagen, Denmark, Mastekranen, Holmen. Copenhagen, Denmark.JPG|thumb|right|A crane constructed in 1742, used for mounting masts to large sailing vessels. Copenhagen, Denmark]]

According to the "present state of knowledge" unknown in antiquity, stationary harbor cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345" /&gt; The typical harbor crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. These cranes were placed docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345" /&gt;

Two different types of harbor cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbors typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dockside cranes were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued to rely on the more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike construction cranes where the work speed was determined by the relatively slow progress of the masons, harbor cranes usually featured double treadwheels to speed up loading. The two treadwheels whose diameter is estimated to be 4&amp;nbsp;m or larger were attached to each side of the axle and rotated together.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345" /&gt; Their capacity was 2–3 tons which apparently corresponded to the customary size of marine cargo.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345" /&gt; Today, according to one survey, fifteen treadwheel harbor cranes from pre-industrial times are still extant throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;These are Bergen, Stockholm, Karlskrona (Sweden), Kopenhagen (Denmark), Harwich (England), Gdańsk (Poland), Lüneburg, Stade, Otterndorf, Marktbreit, Würzburg, Östrich, Bingen, Andernach and Trier (Germany). Cf. {{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in [[Gdańsk]], [[Cologne]] and [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346" /&gt; Beside these stationary cranes, [[crane vessel|floating cranes]] which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346" /&gt;

===Early modern age===
[[File:1586 Rome obelisk erection.jpg|thumb|Erection of the [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in 1586 by means of a lifting tower]]
[[File:Rheinpanorama 1856 detail Dom.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Old photo of the cathedral before completion shows the east end finished and roofed, while other parts of the building are in various stages of construction.|An 1856 photo of [[Cologne Cathedral]], then unfinished, with a 15th-century crane on south tower.]]
A lifting tower similar to that of the ancient Romans was used to great effect by the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architect]] [[Domenico Fontana]] in 1586 to relocate the 361&amp;nbsp;t heavy [[List of obelisks in Rome|Vatican obelisk]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his report, it becomes obvious that the coordination of the lift between the various pulling teams required a considerable amount of concentration and discipline, since, if the force was not applied evenly, the excessive stress on the ropes would make them rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|1999|pp=436–437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cranes were also used domestically during this period. The chimney or fireplace crane was used to swing pots and kettles over the fire and the height was adjusted by a [[Trammel hook|trammel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/technology/domestic/cooking.html The Victorian Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial revolution===
[[File:William george armstrong.jpg|thumb|[[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Sir William Armstrong]], inventor of the hydraulic crane.]]
With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] the first modern cranes were installed at harbours for loading cargo. In 1838, the industrialist and businessman [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] designed a hydraulic water powered crane. His design used a ram in a closed cylinder that was forced down by a pressurized fluid entering the cylinder&amp;nbsp;– a valve regulated the amount of fluid intake relative to the load on the crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machine-history.com/Armstrong%20Hydraulic%20Crane|title=Armstrong Hydraulic Crane|publisher=Machine-History.Com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110235111/http://www.machine-history.com/Armstrong%20Hydraulic%20Crane|archivedate=10 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 a scheme was set in motion to provide piped water from distant reservoirs to the households of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Armstrong was involved in this scheme and he proposed to Newcastle Corporation that the excess water pressure in the lower part of town could be used to power one of his hydraulic cranes for the loading of coal onto barges at the [[Quayside]]. He claimed that his invention would do the job faster and more cheaply than conventional cranes. The corporation agreed to his suggestion, and the experiment proved so successful that three more hydraulic cranes were installed on the Quayside.&lt;ref name="Dougan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dougan, David |year=1970 |title=The Great Gun-Maker: The Story of Lord Armstrong|publisher=Sandhill Press Ltd |isbn=0-946098-23-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of his hydraulic crane led Armstrong to establish the [[Armstrong Whitworth|Elswick works]] at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], to produce his [[hydraulic machinery]] for cranes and bridges in 1847. His company soon received orders for hydraulic cranes from Edinburgh and Northern Railways and from [[Port of Liverpool|Liverpool Docks]], as well as for hydraulic machinery for dock gates in [[Grimsby]]. The company expanded from a workforce of 300 and an annual production of 45 cranes in 1850, to almost 4,000 workers producing over 100 cranes per year by the early 1860s.&lt;ref name="Dougan"/&gt;

Armstrong spent the next few decades constantly improving his crane design –  his most significant innovation was the [[hydraulic accumulator]]. Where water pressure was not available on site for the use of hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at [[New Holland, North Lincolnshire|New Holland]] on the [[Humber Estuary]], he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. He eventually produced the hydraulic accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the downward force of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. This invention allowed much larger quantities of water to be forced through pipes at a constant pressure, thus increasing the crane's load capacity considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McKenzie, Peter |year=1983 |title=W.G. Armstrong: The Life and Times of Sir William George Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Cragside|publisher=Longhirst Press |isbn=0-946978-00-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his cranes, commissioned by the [[Italian Navy]] in 1883 and in use until the mid-1950s, is still standing in [[Venice]], where it is now in a state of disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 May 2010|title=Newcastle crane 'priceless' part of Venetian heritage|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/tyne/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8694000/8694543.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanical principles==
[[File:El movimiento de una grua.ogg|thumb|Crane movements]]
[[File:Shipyard Ishibras Ishikawajima Sermetal.JPG|thumb|left|450|Broken crane in Sermetal Shipyard, former [[IHI Corporation|Ishikawajima]] do Brasil – [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The cause of the accident was a lack of maintenance and misuse of the equipment.]]
[[File:Automated Crane With Utensils.jpg|thumb|right|Cranes can mount many different utensils depending on load (left). Cranes can be remote-controlled from the ground, allowing much more precise control, but without the view that a position atop the crane provides (right).]]
[[File:Crane flip.jpg|thumb|right|The stability of a mobile construction crane can be jeopardized when outriggers sink into soft soil, which can result in the crane tipping over.]]
There are three major considerations in the design of cranes. First, the crane must be able to lift the weight of the load; second, the crane must not topple; third, the crane must not rupture.

===Stability===
For stability, the sum of all [[Moment (physics)|moments]] about the base of the crane must be close to zero so that the crane does not overturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|title=How Tower Cranes Work|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/tower-crane.htm|work=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the magnitude of load that is permitted to be lifted (called the "rated load" in the US) is some value less than the load that will cause the crane to tip, thus providing a safety margin.

Under US standards for mobile cranes, the stability-limited rated load for a crawler crane is 75% of the tipping load. The stability-limited rated load for a mobile crane supported on outriggers is 85% of the tipping load. These requirements, along with additional safety-related aspects of crane design, are established by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers [http://www.asme.org] in the volume ASME B30.5-2018 ''Mobile and Locomotive Cranes''.

Standards for cranes mounted on ships or offshore platforms are somewhat stricter because of the dynamic load on the crane due to vessel motion. Additionally, the stability of the vessel or platform must be considered.

For stationary pedestal or kingpost mounted cranes, the moment created by the boom, jib, and load is resisted by the pedestal base or kingpost. Stress within the base must be less than the yield stress of the material or the crane will fail.

==Types==
===Mobile===
{{Main|Mobile crane}}

There are four principal types of mobile cranes: truck mounted, rough-terrain, crawler, and floating.

====Truck-mounted====
[[File:Truck-mounted crane building a bridge.jpg|200px|thumb|Deployed truck-mounted crane]]
[[File:Truck crane.jpg|thumb|200px|Truck-mounted crane]]
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
A [[truck]]-mounted crane has two parts: the carrier, often referred to as the ''lower'', and the lifting component which includes the boom, referred to as the ''upper''. These are mated together through a turntable, allowing the upper to swing from side to side. These modern hydraulic truck cranes are usually single-engine machines, with the same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane. The upper is usually powered via hydraulics run through the turntable from the pump mounted on the lower. In older model designs of hydraulic truck cranes, there were two engines. One in the lower pulled the crane down the road and ran a hydraulic pump for the outriggers and jacks. The one in the upper ran the upper through a hydraulic pump of its own. Many older operators favor the two-engine system due to leaking seals in the turntable of aging newer design cranes. Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic truck mounted crane in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunfab.com/about-us/history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck's engine to power loader cranes through the use of hydraulics.

Generally, these cranes are able to travel on highways, eliminating the need for special equipment to transport the crane unless weight or other size constrictions are in place such as local laws. If this is the case, most larger cranes are equipped with either special trailers to help spread the load over more axles or are able to disassemble to meet requirements. An example is counterweights. Often a crane will be followed by another truck hauling the counterweights that are removed for travel. In addition some cranes are able to remove the entire upper. However, this is usually only an issue in a large crane and mostly done with a conventional crane such as a Link-Belt HC-238. When working on the job site, [[outrigger]]s are extended horizontally from the chassis then vertically to level and stabilize the crane while stationary and [[Hoist (device)|hoisting]]. Many truck cranes have slow-travelling capability (a few miles per hour) while suspending a load. Great care must be taken not to swing the load sideways from the direction of travel, as most anti-tipping stability then lies in the stiffness of the chassis suspension. Most cranes of this type also have moving counterweights for stabilization beyond that provided by the outriggers. Loads suspended directly aft are the most stable, since most of the weight of the crane acts as a counterweight. Factory-calculated charts (or [[Safe Load Indicator|electronic safeguards]]) are used by crane operators to determine the maximum safe loads for stationary (outriggered) work as well as (on-rubber) loads and travelling speeds.

Truck cranes range in lifting capacity from about {{convert|14.5|ST|LT t|lk=on}} to about {{convert|1300|ST|LT t|0}}. Although most only rotate about 180 degrees, the more expensive truck mounted cranes can turn a full 360 degrees.

====Rough terrain====
[[File:Omega 18.jpg|thumb|200px|Rough terrain crane]]
A rough terrain crane has a boom mounted on an undercarriage atop four rubber tires that is designed for off-road pick-and-carry operations. Outriggers are used to level and stabilize the crane for hoisting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://civilguides.com/different-types-of-cranes/|title=Top 12 Different Types of Cranes used in Construction Works.|last=Khan|first=Inamullah|date=2017-07-14|work=CivilGuides|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These telescopic cranes are single-engine machines, with the same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane, similar to a crawler crane. The engine is usually mounted in the undercarriage rather than in the upper, as with crawler crane. Most have 4 wheel drive and 4 wheel steering for traversing tighter and slicker terrain than a standard truck crane, with less site prep.

====Crawler====
[[File:Big Tracked Construction Crane Auckland.jpg|thumb|200px|Crawler crane]]

A crawler crane has its boom mounted on an undercarriage fitted with a set of [[Continuous track|crawler tracks]] that provide both stability and mobility. Crawler cranes range in lifting capacity from about {{convert|40|to|3500|ST|LT t|1}}.

The main advantage of a crawler crane is its ready mobility and use, since the crane is able to operate on sites with minimal improvement and stable on its tracks without outriggers. Wide tracks spread the weight out over a great area and are far better than wheels at traversing soft ground without sinking in. A crawler crane is also capable of traveling with a load. Its main disadvantage is its weight, making it difficult and expensive to transport. Typically a large crawler must be disassembled at least into boom and cab and moved by trucks, rail cars or ships to its next location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://definecivil.com/types-of-cranes/|title=15 Types of Cranes used in Construction (SURPRISE List)|date=2018-09-21|work=Define Civil|access-date=2018-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Floating====
[[File:SSCVThialf.jpg|thumb|200px|Floating crane]]
{{main|Crane vessel}}
Floating cranes are used mainly in [[bridge]] building and [[port]] construction, but they are also used for occasional loading and unloading of especially heavy or awkward loads on and off ships. 
Some floating cranes are mounted on [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]], others are specialized crane [[barge]]s with a lifting capacity exceeding {{convert|10000|ST|LT t|0|lk=on}} and have been used to transport entire bridge sections. Floating cranes have also been used to salvage sunken [[ship]]s.

Crane vessels are often used in [[offshore construction]]. 
The largest revolving cranes can be found on [[SSCV Thialf]], which has two cranes with a capacity of {{convert|7100|t|ST LT|0|lk=on}} each. For 50 years, the largest such crane was "Herman the German" at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, one of three constructed by Hitler's Germany and captured in the war. The crane was sold to the Panama Canal in 1996 where it is now known as the "Titan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman the German|url=http://portoflongbeach.blogspot.com/2011/04/herman-german.html|accessdate=27 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other types====
=====All terrain=====
[[File:GMK3050 All Terrain Crane.jpg|thumb|200px|All terrain crane]]

An all-terrain crane is a hybrid combining the roadability of a truck-mounted and on-site maneuverability of a rough-terrain crane. It can both travel at speed on public roads and maneuver on rough terrain at the job site using all-wheel and crab steering.

AT’s have 2-9 axles and are designed for lifting loads up to {{convert|1200|t|ST LT|lk=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liebherr.com/at/en/products_at.asp?menuID=106082!8607-0|title=LTM11200-9.1|publisher=Liebherr|accessdate=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pick and carry=====
A pick and carry crane is similar to a mobile crane in that is designed to travel on public roads; however, Pick and Carry cranes have no stabiliser legs or outriggers and are designed to lift the load and carry it to its destination, within a small radius, then be able to drive to the next job. Pick and Carry cranes are popular in Australia where large distances are encountered between job sites. One popular manufacturer in Australia was Franna, who have since been bought by Terex, and now all Pick and Carry cranes are commonly referred to as "Frannas" even though they may be made by other manufacturers. Nearly every medium and large sized crane company in Australia has at least one and many companies have fleets of these cranes. The capacity range is usually ten to twenty tonnes maximum lift, although this is much less at the tip of the boom. Pick and Carry cranes have displaced the work usually completed by smaller truck cranes as the set-up time is much quicker. Many steel fabrication yards also use Pick and Carry cranes as they can "walk" with fabricated steel sections and place these where required with relative ease.

=====Sidelifter=====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0315-0001-026, Leipzig, Frühjahrsmesse, Freigelände, Sattelauflieger, Container.jpg|thumb|200px|Sidelift crane]]

A [[sidelifter]] crane is a road-going [[truck]] or [[semi-trailer]], able to hoist and transport ISO standard [[Intermodal container|containers]]. Container lift is done with parallel crane-like hoists, which can lift a container from the ground or from a [[flatcar|railway vehicle]].

=====Carry deck=====
A carry deck crane is a small 4 wheel crane with a 360 degree rotating boom placed right in the centre and an operators cab located at one end under this boom. The rear section houses the engine and the area above the wheels is a flat deck. Very much an American invention the Carry deck can hoist a load in a confined space and then load it on the deck space around the cab or engine and subsequently move to another site. The Carry Deck principle is the American version of the pick and carry crane and both allow the load to be moved by the crane over short distances.

=====Telescopic handler=====
Telescopic handlers are like forklift trucks that have a telescoping extendable boom like a crane. Early telescopic handlers only lifted in one direction and did not rotate;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QCgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=popular+science+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AnvcTt6DBMePgwfR96XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwCThu#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Crane Lifts Big Load."] ''Popular Science'', August 1948, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; however, several of the manufacturers have designed telescopic handlers that rotate 360 degrees through a turntable and these machines look almost identical to the Rough Terrain Crane. These new 360-degree telescopic handler/crane models have outriggers or stabiliser legs that must be lowered before lifting; however, their design has been simplified so that they can be more quickly deployed. These machines are often used to handle pallets of bricks and install frame trusses on many new building sites and they have eroded much of the work for small telescopic truck cranes. Many of the world's armed forces have purchased telescopic handlers and some of these are the much more expensive fully rotating types. Their off-road capability and their on site versatility to unload pallets using forks, or lift like a crane make them a valuable piece of machinery.

=====Harbour=====
Dry bulk or container cranes usually in the bay areas or inland water ways.

=====Railroad=====
[[File:Spr64.jpg|thumb|200px|Rail crane]]
{{main|Crane (railroad)}}

A railroad crane has flanged wheels for use on railroads. 
The simplest form is a crane mounted on a [[flatcar]]. More capable devices are purpose-built. Different types of crane are used for [[maintenance of way|maintenance work]], recovery operations and freight loading in goods yards and scrap handling facilities.

=====Aerial=====
[[File:CH-54-Skycrane-delivers-dozer-vietnam-oct-1966.jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial crane]]

[[Aerial crane]] or 'Sky cranes' usually are [[helicopter]]s designed to lift large loads. Helicopters are able to travel to and lift in areas that are difficult to reach by conventional cranes. Helicopter cranes are most commonly used to lift units/loads onto shopping centers and highrises. They can lift anything within their lifting capacity, (cars, boats, swimming pools, etc.). They also perform disaster relief after natural disasters for clean-up, and during wild-fires they are able to carry huge buckets of water to extinguish fires.

Some aerial cranes, mostly concepts, have also used lighter-than air aircraft, such as [[airship]]s.
{{clear}}

===Fixed===
Exchanging mobility for the ability to carry greater loads and reach greater heights due to increased stability, these types of cranes are characterised by the fact that their main structure does not move during the period of use. However, many can still be assembled and disassembled. The structures basically are fixed in one place.

====Tower{{anchor|Tower crane}}====
[[File:Tower Crane.JPG|thumb|200px|Tower crane atop [[Mont Blanc]]]]

Tower cranes are a modern form of balance crane that consist of the same basic parts. Fixed to the ground on a concrete slab (and sometimes attached to the sides of structures), tower cranes often give the best combination of height and lifting capacity and are used in the construction of tall buildings. The base is then attached to the mast which gives the crane its height. Further, the mast is attached to the slewing unit (gear and motor) that allows the crane to rotate. On top of the slewing unit there are three main parts which are: the long horizontal jib (working arm), shorter counter-jib, and the operator's cab.

[[File:Tower crane Dubai 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|Tower crane cabin]]
[[File:Кран с маховой стрелой.jpg|thumb|200px|Tower crane with "luffing" jib]]
The long horizontal jib is the part of the crane that carries the load. The counter-jib carries a counterweight, usually of concrete blocks, while the jib suspends the load to and from the center of the crane. The crane operator either sits in a cab at the top of the tower or controls the crane by radio remote control from the ground. In the first case the operator's cab is most usually located at the top of the tower attached to the turntable, but can be mounted on the jib, or partway down the tower. The lifting hook is operated by the crane operator using electric motors to manipulate wire rope cables through a system of sheaves. The hook is located on the long horizontal arm to lift the load which also contains its motor.

[[File:Rotating tower crane.ogv|thumb|right|200px|A tower crane rotates on its axis before lowering the lifting hook.]]
In order to hook and unhook the loads, the operator usually works in conjunction with a signaller (known as a 'dogger', 'rigger' or 'swamper'). They are most often in radio contact, and always use hand signals. The rigger or dogger directs the schedule of lifts for the crane, and is responsible for the safety of the [[Rigging (material handling)|rigging]] and loads.

=====Components=====
Tower cranes are used extensively in construction and other industry to hoist and move materials. There are many types of tower cranes. Although they are different in type, the main parts are the same, as follows:
* '''Mast''': the main supporting tower of the crane. It is made of steel trussed sections that are connected together during installation.
* '''Slewing unit''': the slewing unit sits at the top of the mast. This is the engine that enables the crane to rotate.
* '''Operating cabin''': on most tower cranes the operating cabin sits just above the slewing unit. It contains the operating controls, load-movement indicator system (LMI), scale, anemometer, etc.
* '''Jib''': the jib, or operating arm, extends horizontally from the crane. A "luffing" jib is able to move up and down; a fixed jib has a rolling trolley that runs along the underside to move goods horizontally.
* '''Counter jib''': holds counterweights, hoist motor, hoist drum and the electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cranecrews.com/crane-blog/tower-crane-anatomy|title = Tower crane anatomy|date = 2015-12-19|accessdate = 19 December 2015|website = Crane &amp; Rigging|publisher = |last = Elliott|first = Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hoist winch''': the hoist winch assembly consists of the hoist winch itself (motor, gearbox, hoist drum, hoist rope, and brakes), the hoist motor controller, and  supporting components such as the platform. Many tower cranes have transmissions with two or more speeds. 
* '''Hook''': the hook (or hooks) is used to connect the material to the crane. It is suspended from the hoist rope either at the tip, for luffing jib cranes, or in the hoist rope belly underneath the trolley for hammerhead cranes.
* '''Weights''': Large concrete counterweights are mounted toward the rear of the counterdeck, to compensate for the weight of the goods lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.86towercrane.com/article_4.htm |title=the component of the tower cranes |publisher=86towercrane.com |date=2012-04-21 |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627015719/http://www.86towercrane.com/article_4.htm |archivedate=27 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tower Cran break down (1).JPG|thumb|200px|This crane's main jib failed due to an overload.]]

=====Assembly=====
A tower crane is usually assembled by a telescopic jib (mobile) crane of greater reach (also see "self-erecting crane" below) and in the case of tower cranes that have risen while constructing very tall skyscrapers, a smaller crane (or derrick) will often be lifted to the roof of the completed tower to dismantle the tower crane afterwards, which may be more difficult than the installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Croucher |first=Martin |title=Myth of ‘Babu Sassi’ Remains After Burj Cranes Come Down |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data/theuae/2009/November/theuae_November338.xml&amp;section=theuae&amp;col= |accessdate=3 June 2011 |newspaper=[[Khaleej Times]] |date=11 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001080528/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/displayarticle.asp?xfile=data%2Ftheuae%2F2009%2FNovember%2Ftheuae_November338.xml&amp;section=theuae&amp;col= |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tower Cranes can often be Pedestrian Operated by a remote control, removing the need for a cab for the Crane Operator to work from.

=====Operation=====
Each model and distinctive style of tower crane has a predetermined lifting chart that can be applied to any radii available depending on its configuration. Similar to a mobile crane, a tower crane may lift an object of far greater mass closer to its center of rotation than at its maximum radius. An operator manipulates several levers and pedals to control each function of the crane.

====Self-erecting tower cranes====

[[File:Origami Crane.JPG|thumb|A self-erecting tower crane folds itself up at Erlangen, Germany.]]
Generally a type of pedestrian operated tower crane. Self erecting tower cranes are transported as a single unit and can be assembled by a qualified technician without the assistance of a larger mobile crane. They are bottom slewing cranes that stand on outriggers, have no counter jib, have their counter weights and ballast at the base of the mast, can not climb themselves, have a reduced capacity to standard tower cranes, and seldom have an operator's cabin.

In some cases, smaller self-erecting tower cranes may have axles permanently fitted to the tower section to make maneuvering the crane onsite easier.

For another animation of such a crane in use see this video:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.ca.gov/news/info/movies/sas_erection.htm |title=MTC&amp;nbsp;– News |publisher=Mtc.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608231418/http://www.mtc.ca.gov/news/info/movies/sas_erection.htm |archivedate=8 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Here, the crane is used to erect a scaffold which in turn contains a gantry to lift sections of a bridge spire.)

====Telescopic====
[[File:Telescopic crane, SouthGate, Bath.jpg|thumb|left|A telescopic mobile crane]]

A telescopic crane has a boom that consists of a number of tubes fitted one inside the other. A [[hydraulic cylinder]] or other powered mechanism extends or retracts the tubes to increase or decrease the total length of the boom. These types of booms are often used for short term construction projects, rescue jobs, lifting boats in and out of the water, etc. The relative compactness of telescopic booms makes them adaptable for many mobile applications.

Though not all telescopic cranes are mobile cranes, many of them are truck-mounted.

A telescopic tower crane has a telescopic mast and often a superstructure (jib) on top so that it functions as a tower crane. Some telescopic tower cranes also have a telescopic jib.

====Hammerhead====
[[File:Wfm crane north rotunda.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hammerhead crane ([[Finnieston Crane]])]]

The "hammerhead", or giant [[cantilever]], crane is a fixed-[[jib]] crane consisting of a steel-braced tower on which revolves a large, horizontal, double [[cantilever]]; the forward part of this cantilever or [[jib]] carries the lifting trolley, the jib is extended backwards in order to form a support for the machinery and counterbalancing weight. In addition to the motions of lifting and revolving, there is provided a so-called "racking" motion, by which the lifting trolley, with the load suspended, can be moved in and out along the jib without altering the level of the load. Such horizontal movement of the load is a marked feature of later crane design. These cranes are generally constructed in large sizes and can weigh up to 350&amp;nbsp;tons.

The design of ''Hammerkran'' evolved first in Germany around the turn of the 19th century and was adopted and developed for use in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[shipyard]]s to support the battleship construction program from 1904 to 1914. The ability of the hammerhead crane to lift heavy weights was useful for installing large pieces of [[battleship]]s such as [[armour plate]] and [[gun]] barrels. Giant cantilever cranes were also installed in naval shipyards in [[Japan]] and in the [[United States]]. The British government also installed a giant cantilever crane at the [[Singapore]] Naval Base (1938) and later a copy of the crane was installed at [[HMAS Kuttabul (naval base)|Garden Island Naval Dockyard]] in [[Sydney]] (1951). These cranes provided repair support for the battle fleet operating far from [[Great Britain]].

In the British Empire, the engineering firm [[Sir William Arrol &amp;&amp;nbsp;Co&amp;nbsp;Ltd]] was the principal manufacturer of giant cantilever cranes; the company built a total of fourteen. Among the sixty built in the world, few remain; seven in England and Scotland of about fifteen worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/iw.history/cowes/crane.htm |title=The Cowes Giant Cantilever Crane |publisher=Freespace.virgin.net |date=|accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Titan Clydebank]] is one of the 4 Scottish cranes on the Clydebank and preserved as a tourist attraction.

====Level luffing====
{{main|Level luffing crane}}

[[File:Dillingen Kran.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Level luffing crane]]]]
Normally a crane with a hinged jib will tend to have its hook also move up and down as the jib moves (or ''luffs''). A [[level luffing crane]] is a crane of this common design, but with an extra mechanism to keep the hook level when luffing.
{{clear}}

====Overhead====
[[File:DCC38974rvancopp.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[overhead crane]] being used in typical machine shop. The [[hoist (device)|hoist]] is operated via a wired pushbutton station to move system and the load in any direction]]

{{Main|Overhead crane}}
An [[overhead crane]], also known as a bridge crane, is a type of crane where the hook-and-line mechanism runs along a horizontal beam that itself runs along two widely separated rails. Often it is in a long factory building and runs along rails along the building's two long walls. It is similar to a [[gantry crane]]. Overhead cranes typically consist of either a single beam or a double beam construction. These can be built using typical steel beams or a more complex box girder type. Pictured on the right is a single bridge box girder crane with the [[hoist (device)|hoist]] and system operated with a control pendant. Double girder bridge are more typical when needing heavier capacity systems from 10 tons and above. The advantage of the box girder type configuration results in a system that has a lower deadweight yet a stronger overall system integrity. Also included would be a hoist to lift the items, the bridge, which spans the area covered by the crane, and a trolley to move along the bridge.

The most common overhead crane use is in the [[steel industry]]. At every step of the manufacturing process, until it leaves a factory as a finished product, [[steel]] is handled by an overhead crane. Raw materials are poured into a [[furnace]] by crane, hot steel is stored for cooling by an overhead crane, the finished coils are lifted and loaded onto [[truck]]s and [[train]]s by overhead crane, and the [[fabrication (metal)|fabricator]] or stamper uses an overhead crane to handle the steel in his factory. The [[automobile]] industry uses overhead cranes for handling of raw materials. Smaller [[workstation]] cranes handle lighter loads in a work-area, such as [[CNC]] mill or saw.

Almost all paper mills use bridge cranes for regular maintenance requiring removal of heavy press rolls and other equipment. The bridge cranes are used in the initial construction of paper machines because they facilitate installation of the heavy cast iron paper drying drums and other massive equipment, some weighing as much as 70 tons.

In many instances the cost of a bridge crane can be largely offset with savings from not renting mobile cranes in the construction of a facility that uses a lot of heavy process equipment.

====Gantry====
[[File:Hamburg.CTA.Altenwerder.BungaRaya.wmt.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Gantry crane]]]]

{{details|Container crane}}
A [[gantry crane]] has a [[hoist (device)|hoist]] in a fixed machinery house or on a trolley that runs horizontally along rails, usually fitted on a single beam (mono-girder) or two beams (twin-girder). The crane frame is supported on a gantry system with equalized beams and wheels that run on the gantry rail, usually perpendicular to the trolley travel direction. These cranes come in all sizes, and some can move very heavy loads, particularly the extremely large examples used in shipyards or industrial installations. A special version is the [[container crane]] (or "Portainer" crane, named by the first manufacturer), designed for loading and unloading ship-borne containers at a port.

Most [[container crane]]s are of this type.

====Deck====
[[File:Caroline Delmas (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deck crane]]

Located on the ships and boats, these are used for cargo operations or boat unloading and retrieval where no shore unloading facilities are available. Most are diesel-hydraulic or electric-hydraulic.

==== {{visible anchor|Jib}} ====
[[File:Pedestal Jib.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Jib crane]]

A jib crane is a type of crane where a horizontal member (''jib'' or ''boom''), supporting a moveable hoist, is fixed to a wall or to a floor-mounted pillar. Jib cranes are used in industrial premises and on military vehicles. The jib may swing through an arc, to give additional lateral movement, or be fixed. Similar cranes, often known simply as hoists, were fitted on the top floor of warehouse buildings to enable goods to be lifted to all floors.

====Bulk-handling====
[[File:SSA40588hafen.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Bulk-handling crane]]

[[Bulk-handling crane]]s are designed from the outset to carry a shell grab or bucket, rather than using a hook and a sling. They are used for bulk cargoes, such as coal, minerals, scrap metal etc.

====Loader====
[[File:Hydraulic Truck Crane.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Loader crane using a jib extension]]

A loader crane (also called a ''knuckle-boom crane'' or ''articulating crane'') is an electrically powered articulated arm fitted to a [[truck]] or [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]], and is used for loading/unloading the vehicle. The numerous jointed sections can be folded into a small space when the crane is not in use. One or more of the sections may be [[telescopic cylinder|telescopic]]. Often the crane will have a degree of automation and be able to unload or stow itself without an operator's instruction.

Unlike most cranes, the operator must move around the vehicle to be able to view his load; hence modern cranes may be fitted with a portable cabled or radio-linked control system to supplement the crane-mounted hydraulic control levers.

In the UK and Canada, this type of crane is often known colloquially as a "[[HIAB|Hiab]]", partly because this manufacturer invented the loader crane and was first into the UK market, and partly because the distinctive name was displayed prominently on the boom arm.&lt;ref name="hiab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cargotec.com/en-global/hiab/products/Loader-cranes/Pages/default.aspx|title=Hiab Loader Cranes - Custom-made cranes for highest productivity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322045427/http://www.cargotec.com/en-global/hiab/products/Loader-cranes/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=22 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rolloader''' crane is a loader crane mounted on a chassis with wheels. This chassis can ride on the trailer. Because the crane can move on the trailer, it can be a light crane, so the trailer is allowed to transport more goods.

====Stacker====
[[File:Automated Storage and Retrieval System - Defense Visual Information Center · DD-ST-96-00253.JPEG|thumb|100px|right|Stacker crane]]

A crane with a [[forklift]] type mechanism used in automated (computer controlled) [[warehouse]]s (known as an [[automated storage and retrieval system]] (AS/RS)). The crane moves on a track in an aisle of the warehouse. The fork can be raised or lowered to any of the levels of a storage rack and can be extended into the rack to store and retrieve product. The product can in some cases be as large as an [[automobile]]. Stacker cranes are often used in the large freezer warehouses of frozen food manufacturers. This automation avoids requiring forklift drivers to work in below freezing temperatures every day.

==Efficiency increase of cranes==
Lifetime of existing cranes made of welded metal structures can often be extended for many years by aftertreatment of weldings. During development of cranes, load level (lifting load) can be significantly increased by taking into account the IIW recommendations (the [[International Institute of Welding]] Technology IIW published the Guideline "Recommendations for the HFMI Treatment" in 2016) leads in most cases to an increase of the permissible lifting load and thus to an efficiency increase.

==Similar machines==
[[File:Film Shooting From a Crane.jpg|thumb|150px|Shooting a film from crane]]
The generally accepted definition of a crane is a machine for lifting and moving heavy objects by means of ropes or cables suspended from a movable arm. As such, a lifting machine that does not use cables, or else provides only vertical and not horizontal movement, cannot strictly be called a 'crane'.

Types of crane-like lifting machine include:
* [[Block and tackle]]
* [[Capstan (nautical)]]
* [[Hoist (device)]]
* [[Winch]]
* [[Windlass]]
* [[Cherry picker]]

More technically advanced types of such lifting machines are often known as 'cranes', regardless of the official definition of the term.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10104">A '''digital wallet''' refers to an electronic device or online service that allows an individual to make electronic transactions. This can include purchasing items on-line with a computer or using a smartphone to purchase something at a store. An individual's bank account can also be linked to the digital wallet. They might also have their driver's license, health card, loyalty card(s) and other ID documents stored on the phone. The credentials can be passed to a merchant's terminal wirelessly via [[near field communication]] (NFC). Increasingly, digital wallets are being made not just for basic financial transactions but to also authenticate the holder's credentials. For example, a digital wallet could verify the age of the buyer to the store while purchasing alcohol. The system has already gained popularity in Japan, where digital wallets are known as "wallet mobiles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Sarah|title=NTT Docomo to take Japanese mobile wallet global|url=http://www.nfcworld.com/2012/10/11/318353/ntt-docomo-to-take-japanese-mobile-wallet-global/|publisher=NFC World|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cryptocurrency wallet]] is a digital wallet where private keys are stored for cryptocurrencies like [[bitcoin]].

==Technology==
A digital wallet has both a software and information component. The software provides security and encryption for the personal information and for the actual transaction. Typically, digital wallets are stored on the client side and are easily self-maintained and fully compatible with most [[e-commerce]] Web sites. A server-side digital wallet, also known as a thin wallet, is one that an organization creates for and about you and maintains on its [[Server (computing)|servers]]. Server-side digital wallets are gaining popularity among major retailers due to the security, efficiency, and added utility it provides to the end-user, which increases their satisfaction of their overall purchase{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. The information component is basically a database of user-input information. This information consists of your shipping address, billing address, payment methods (including credit card numbers, expiry dates, and security numbers), and other information.

Digital wallets are composed of both digital wallet devices and digital wallet systems. There are dedicated digital wallet devices such as the biometric wallet by [[Alfred Dunhill|Dunhill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=David|title=Dunhill Wallet Uses Biometrics|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2378775,00.asp|publisher=PC Magazine|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a physical device that holds cash and cards along with a [[Bluetooth]] mobile connection. Presently there are further explorations for smartphones with NFC digital wallet capabilities, such as the [[Samsung]] Galaxy series and the [[Google Nexus]] smartphones utilizing [[Google]]'s [[Android operating system]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6 Plus]] utilizing [[Apple Pay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=OLIVAREZ-GILES|first=Nathan|title=Sprint's Galaxy Nexus: Can a Second Google Wallet Phone Ignite Mobile Payments?|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/sprints-galaxy-nexus-can-a-second-google-wallet-phone-ignite-mobile-payments/|accessdate=March 23, 2013|work=Wired|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include [[Samsung Pay]], [[Android Pay]], as well as payment services like [[PayPal]] and [[Venmo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Understanding Digital Wallets|url=https://www.alliedwallet.com/understanding-digital-wallets/|accessdate=March 23, 2013|work=Alliedwallet |date=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital wallet systems enable the widespread use of digital wallet transactions among various retail vendors in the form of mobile payments systems and digital wallet applications. The [[M-PESA]] mobile payments system and microfinancing service has widespread use in Kenya and Tanzania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dial M for money|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9414419?story_id=9414419|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=March 23, 2013|date=June 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[MasterCard PayPass]] application has been adopted by a number of vendors in the U.S. and worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PayPass Adoption Study|url=http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/new-mastercard-advisors-study-on-contactless-payments-shows-almost-30-lift-in-total-spend-within-first-year-of-adoption/|publisher=MasterCard Advisors|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital wallets are being used more and more in Asian countries as well. One in five consumers in Asia are now using a digital wallet, representing twofold increase from two years ago. A recent survey by MasterCard's mobile shopping survey shows on 8500 adults aged 18–64 across 14 markets showed, 45% users in China, 36.7% users in India and 23.3% users in Singapore are the biggest adopters of digital wallet. The survey was conducted on between October and December 2015. Also analysis showed (48.5%) consumers in these regions made purchase using smartphones. Indian consumers are leading the way with 76.4% using a smartphone to make purchase which is a drastic increase of 29.3% from previous year. This has made companies like Reliance and Amazon India to come out with its own digital wallet. Flipkart has already introduced its own digital wallet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/amazon-india-planning-launch-of-digital-wallet-in-a-bid-to-build-online-payments-business/articleshow/51282576.cms?intenttarget=no|title=Amazon India planning launch of digital wallet in a bid to build online payments business|first=Madhav|last=Chanchani|date=7 March 2016|publisher=|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payments for goods and services purchased online==
A client-side digital wallet requires minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} setup and is relatively easy to use. Once the software is installed, the user begins by entering all the pertinent information. The digital wallet is now set up. At the purchase or check-out page of an e-commerce site, the digital wallet software has the ability to automatically enter the user information in the online form. By default, most digital wallets prompt when the software recognizes a form in which it can fill out; if one chooses to fill out the form automatically, the user will be prompted for a [[password]]. This keeps unauthorized users away from viewing personal information stored on a particular computer.

===ECML===
Digital wallets are designed to be accurate when transferring data to retail checkout forms; however, if a particular e-commerce site has a peculiar checkout system, the digital wallet may fail to properly recognize the form's fields. This problem has been eliminated by sites and wallet software that use [[Electronic Commerce Modeling Language]] (ECML) technology. Electronic Commerce Modeling Language is a protocol that dictates how online retailers structure and set up their checkout forms. Participating e-commerce vendors who incorporate both digital wallet technology and ECML include: [[Microsoft]], [[Discover Financial|Discover]], [[IBM]], [[Omaha Steaks]] and [[Dell Computers]].

==Application of digital wallets==

Consumers are not required to fill out order forms on each site when they purchase an item because the information has already been stored and is automatically updated and entered into the order fields across merchant sites when using a digital wallet. Consumers also benefit when using digital wallets because their information is encrypted or protected by a private software code; merchants benefit by receiving protection against fraud.

Digital wallets are available to consumers free of charge, and they're fairly easy to obtain. For example, when a consumer makes a purchase at a merchant site that's set up to handle server-side digital wallets, he types his name and payment and shipping information into the merchant's own form. At the end of the purchase, the consumer is asked to sign up for a wallet of his choice by entering a user name and password for future purchases. Users can also acquire wallets at a wallet vendor's site.

Although a wallet is free for consumers, vendors charge merchants for wallets. Some wallet vendors make arrangements for merchants to pay them a percentage of every successful purchase directed through their wallets. In other cases, digital wallet vendors process the transactions between cardholders and participating merchants and charge merchants a flat fee.&lt;ref&gt;Computer World{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages for e-commerce sites==
Upwards of 25% of online shoppers abandon their order due to frustration in filling in forms.&lt;ref&gt;Graphic Arts Monthly, 1999{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital wallet combats this problem by giving users the option to transfer their information securely and accurately. This simplified approach to completing transactions results in better usability and ultimately more utility for the customer.

Digital Wallets can also increase the security of the transaction since the wallet typically does not pass payment card details to the website (a unique transaction identifier or token is shared instead).  Increasingly this approach is a feature of online [[payment gateways]], especially if the payment gateway offers a "hosted payment page" integration approach.

'''Failure to thrive''' ('''FTT'''), more recently known as '''faltering weight''' or '''weight faltering''',&lt;ref name=Review2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shields B, Wacogne I, Wright CM | title = Weight faltering and failure to thrive in infancy and early childhood | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue = sep25 1 | pages = e5931 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23014901 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e5931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] medicine, as well as [[veterinary medicine]] (where it is also referred to as '''ill-thrift'''), to indicate insufficient weight gain or inappropriate weight loss. When not more precisely defined, the term refers to pediatric patients.&lt;ref name="Review2012" /&gt; In children, it is usually defined in terms of weight, and can be evaluated either by a low weight for the child's age, or by a low rate of increase in the weight.&lt;ref name="Merck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://155.91.16.2/mmpe/sec19/ch286/ch286b.html |title=Failure to Thrive: Miscellaneous Disorders in Infants and Children: Merck Manual Professional |work= |access-date=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
FTT was first introduced in the early 20th century to describe poor growth in orphan children but became associated with negative implications (such as maternal deprivation) that often incorrectly explained the underlying issues.&lt;ref name="Estrem_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Estrem HH, Pados BF, Park J, Knafl KA, Thoyre SM | title = Feeding problems in infancy and early childhood: evolutionary concept analysis | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 56–70 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27601073 | doi = 10.1111/jan.13140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century, FTT was expanded to include many different issues related to poor growth, which made it broadly applicable but non-specific.&lt;ref name="Estrem_2017" /&gt; The current conceptualization of FTT acknowledges the complexity of faltering growth in children and has shed many of the negative stereotypes that plagued previous definitions.&lt;ref name="Estrem_2017" /&gt;

== Presentation ==
Failure to thrive occurs in children whose nutritional intake is insufficient for supporting normal growth and weight gain.&lt;ref name="Scholler_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Ingo | last1 = Scholler | first2 = S. | last2 = Nittur | name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-10-01|title=Understanding failure to thrive |journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|language=en|volume=22|issue=10|pages=438–442|doi=10.1016/j.paed.2012.02.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zitelli_2012"&gt;{{cite book|title=Zitelli and Davis' atlas of pediatric physical diagnosis|date=2012|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier| first1 = Basil J | last1 = Zitelli | first2 = Sara C | last2 = McIntire | first3 = Andrew J | last3 = Nowalk | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-323-07932-7 |edition=Sixth|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|oclc=793494374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018"&gt;{{cite book | title = Nelson pediatric symptom-based diagnosis| first1 = Robert |  last1 = Kliegman | first2 = Patricia S | last2 = Lye | first3 = Brett J | last3 = Bordini | first4 = Heather | last4 = Toth | first5 = Donald | last5 = Basel | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-323-39956-2|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | date = 2018 |oclc=986243536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to thrive typically presents before 2 years of age, when growth rates are highest.&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt; Parents may express concern about picky eating habits, poor weight gain, or smaller size compared relative to peers of similar age.&lt;ref name="Zitelli_2012" /&gt; Physicians often identify failure to thrive during routine office visits, when a child's growth parameters are not tracking appropriately on growth curves.&lt;ref name="Zitelli_2012" /&gt; Physicians look for many signs on physical exam that can indicate a potential cause of FTT. For example, findings such as scaling skin, spoon-shaped nails, cheilosis and neuropathy may indicate potential vitamin and mineral deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Needlman|first=Robert|title=Failure to Thrive|date=2007|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-032303506-4.10114-2|work=Pediatric Clinical Advisor|pages=201–202|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323035064|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has also been associated with FTT, and can present with characteristic findings including microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum and a thin vermillion border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://embryo.asu.edu/handle/10776/2099|title=Pre- and Post-natal Growth Deficiencies and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome |website= The Embryo Project Encyclopedia |language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malabsorption, due to disorders like Crohn's disease and cystic fibrosis, can present with abdominal distention and hyperactive bowel sounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Etiologies ==
Traditionally, causes of FTT have been divided into [[endogenous]] and [[exogenous]] causes. These causes can be largely grouped into three categories: '''inadequate caloric intake''', '''malabsorption/caloric retention defect''', and '''increased metabolic demands'''.&lt;ref name="Homan_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Homan GJ | title = Failure to Thrive: A Practical Guide | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–9 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27548594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial investigation should consider prenatal history, postnatal history, past medical history, feeding history to assess overall caloric intake, developmental history, family history, and psychosocial history.&lt;ref name="Scholler_2012" /&gt;

; [[Endogenous]] (or "organic"): Causes are due to physical or mental issues with the child itself. It can include various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]]. Problems with the [[gastrointestinal system]] such as excessive gas and acid reflux are painful conditions which may make the child unwilling to take in sufficient nutrition.&lt;ref name="Homan_2016" /&gt; [[Cystic fibrosis]],&lt;ref name="NG-_2017" /&gt; [[diarrhea]], [[liver disease]], [[anemia]] or [[Iron-deficiency anemia|iron deficiency]], and [[coeliac disease]] make it more difficult for the body to absorb nutrition.&lt;ref name="NG-_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Homan_2016" /&gt; Other causes include physical deformities such as [[cleft palate]] and [[Ankyloglossia|tongue tie]]. [[Milk allergies]] can cause endogenous FTT.&lt;ref name="Scholler_2012" /&gt; Also the [[metabolism]] may be raised by [[parasites]], [[asthma]], [[urinary tract infections]], and other fever-inducing infections, [[hyperthyroidism]] or [[Congenital Heart Disease|congenital heart disease]], so that it becomes difficult to get in sufficient calories to meet the higher caloric demands.&lt;ref name="Homan_2016" /&gt;
; [[Exogenous]] (or "nonorganic"): Caused by caregiver's actions. Examples include [[low milk supply|physical inability to produce enough breastmilk]],&lt;ref name="Homan_2016" /&gt; using only babies' cues to regulate breastfeeding so as to not offer a sufficient number of feeds (sleepy baby syndrome).&lt;ref name="PMC1483563"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Habbick BF, Gerrard JW | title = Failure to thrive in the contented breast-fed baby | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 131 | issue = 7 | pages = 765–8 | date = October 1984 | pmid = 6541091 | pmc = 1483563 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study on toddlers with exogenous FTT has found preliminary evidence suggesting that difficulty experienced during feeding times with this condition may in fact be impacted by preexisting sensory processing problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such difficulties with sensory processing are more commonly observed in toddlers who have a history of growth deficiency and feeding problems; however, further research is required in order to determine a causal relationship between sensory processing problems and nonorganic FTT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yi SH, Joung YS, Choe YH, Kim EH, Kwon JY | title = Sensory Processing Difficulties in Toddlers With Nonorganic Failure-to-Thrive and Feeding Problems | journal = Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition | volume = 60 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–24 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25564810 | doi = 10.1097/mpg.0000000000000707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, conflict settings and protracted emergencies, exogenous faltering may be caused by chronic food insecurity, lack of nutritional awareness, and other factors beyond the caregiver's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prendergast AJ, Humphrey JH | title = The stunting syndrome in developing countries | journal = Paediatrics and International Child Health | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 250–65 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25310000 | pmc = 4232245 | doi = 10.1179/2046905514Y.0000000158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 90% of failure to thrive cases are non-organic.&lt;ref name="Jaffe_2011" /&gt;
; Mixed: However, to think of the terms as [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] can be misleading, since both endogenous and exogenous factors may co-exist.&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt; For instance a child who is not getting sufficient nutrition may act content so that caregivers do not offer feedings of sufficient frequency or volume, and a child with severe acid reflux who appears to be in pain while eating may make a caregiver hesitant to offer sufficient feedings.&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt;

== Differential diagnosis by etiology ==

=== Inadequate caloric intake ===
* [[Poverty]]/Inadequate food supply – number one risk factor for failure to thrive globally&lt;ref name="Scholler_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt;
* Improper mixing of formula&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt;
* [[Postpartum depression]]/maternal depression – studies have shown that mothers with postpartum depression are at increased risk for experiencing breastfeeding difficulties&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel V, DeSouza N, Rodrigues M | title = Postnatal depression and infant growth and development in low income countries: a cohort study from Goa, India | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–37 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12495957 | pmc = 1719257 | doi = 10.1136/adc.88.1.34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Child neglect]] – prevalence of neglect in non-organic failure to thrive is estimated to be as high as 5–10%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-10-01|title=Understanding failure to thrive|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722212000261|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|language=en|volume=22|issue=10|pages=438–442|doi=10.1016/j.paed.2012.02.007|issn=1751-7222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]] – impaired oral motor coordination/poor suck&lt;ref name="Kliegman_2018" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
FTT may be evaluated through a multifaceted process, beginning with a patient history that notably includes diet history, which is a key element for identifying potential causes of FTT.&lt;ref name="Al_Nofal_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchand_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marchand V | title = The toddler who is falling off the growth chart | journal = Paediatrics &amp; Child Health | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 447–54 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 24082808 | pmc = 3474389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, a complete physical examination may be done, with special attention being paid to identifying possible organic sources of FTT.&lt;ref name="Al_Nofal_2013" /&gt; This could include looking for [[dysmorphic feature]]s, abnormal breathing sounds, and signs of specific [[Vitamin deficiency|vitamin and mineral deficiencies]].&lt;ref name="Al_Nofal_2013" /&gt; The physical exam may also reveal signs of possible child neglect or abuse.&lt;ref name="Al_Nofal_2013" /&gt; Based on the information gained from the history and physical examination, a workup can then be conducted, in which possible sources of FTT can be further probed, through blood work, X-rays, or other tests.&lt;ref name="Al_Nofal_2013" /&gt; Laboratory workup should be directed by concerning history and physical examination findings, as it is estimated that the usefulness of laboratory investigations for children with failure to thrive is 1.4%.&lt;ref name="Scholler_2012" /&gt; Initial bloodwork should be based on the clinical picture of the child.

== Treatment ==
Infants and children who have had unpleasant eating experiences (e.g. [[Acid Reflux|acid reflux]] or [[food intolerance]]) may be reluctant to eat their meals.&lt;ref name="Marchand_2012" /&gt; Additionally, force feeding an infant or child can discourage proper self-feeding practices and in-turn cause undue stress on both the child and their parents.&lt;ref name="Marchand_2012" /&gt; Psychosocial interventions can be targeted at encouraging the child to feed themselves during meals.&lt;ref name="NG-_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchand_2012" /&gt; Also, making mealtimes a positive, enjoyable experience through the use of positive reinforcement may improve eating habits in children who present with FTT.&lt;ref name="NG-_2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchand_2012" /&gt; If behavioral issues persist and are affecting nutritional habits in children with FTT it is recommended that the child see a psychologist.&lt;ref name="Marchand_2012" /&gt; If an underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, is identified as the cause of the child's failure to thrive then treatment is directed towards the underlying condition.&lt;ref name="Scholler_2012" /&gt; Special care should be taken to avoid refeeding syndrome when initiating feeds in a malnourished patient.

Children with failure to thrive are at an increased risk for long-term growth, cognitive, and behavioral complications.&lt;ref name="Larson-Nath_2016" /&gt; Studies have shown that children with failure to thrive during infancy were shorter and lower weight at school-age than their peers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">The popper is an effective and proven lure designed to move water using a concave or hollowed nose. Poppers aim to simulate any sort of distressed creature that might be moving or struggling on the surface of the water (baitfish, frogs, and insects are the most typical imitations). Originally this timeless lure was crafted from wood and painted or shaped to match the pattern of baitfish. This quickly evolved into more intricate patterns that mimicked a broader scope of the common prey of predatory fish. Along with different imitations, different materials and technologies have been integrated with this classic platform like rattles, soft bodies, and other synthetic body materials. This iconic pattern has been used to create topwater commotion for many decades, but has been most notable for its presence in bass fishing throughout America. Though this pattern is used for many other species of fish the bass is often tightly connected with topwater poppers. Another species often targeted with poppers is the GT. Catching GT on poppers is becoming more and more popular due to the GT's aggressive surface take.  Used by fly and conventional anglers alike this pattern has not failed fishermen since its creation around a century ago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">A '''flint axe''' was a [[Flint tool]] used during [[prehistoric]] times to perform a variety of tasks. These were at first just a cut piece of [[flint]] stone used as a [[hand axe]] but later wooden handles were attached to these axe heads. The stone exhibits a glass-like fracture similar to [[obsidian]], and can be [[knapped]] to form large blades. The offcuts were sharp enough to be used a small flint knives, while the larger parts of a knapped nodule could be polished to form an axe-head. They competed with other hard rocks such as [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]], which were produced at [[Langdale]] in the British [[Lake District]] and got larger as working continued. They tend to be larger and heavier than the simple axes, and are sometimes known as axe-hammers. 

There a many different types of flint axes. A specific one that appeared during the Early Stone Age was the core axe. This is an unpolished flint axe that is roughly hewn. The cutting edge is usually the widest part and has a pointed butt. Flake axes are created from the chips from the core axe&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/axe-knowledge/the-history-of-the-axe/|title=The history of the axe - Gränsfors Bruk|work=Gränsfors Bruk|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
[[Image:Feuersteinaxt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Late [[Stone Age]] flint axe, about 31 cm long]]

== Applications ==
During the prehistoric times, the flint axe was a widely used tools for multiple different tasks. They were widely used during the [[Neolithic]] period to clear forests for early farming. The polished axes were used directly to cut timber across the grain, but some types (known as a [[Splitting maul]]) were designed to split wood along the grain. The axe was also used to prepare different parts of the animals they killed. They would butcher the meat and prepare the skins. They could also use them to dig up different things when needed&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The flint axes were an everyday tool to use for some settlement sites. Some sites used them more for farming and some sites used them more for chopping down trees&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Diane L.|date=1990|title=The Flint axes of Nagada, Egypt : Analysis and Assessment of a Distinctive Predynastic Tool Type.|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1990_num_16_1_4516|journal=Paléorient|language=fr-FR|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.3406/paleo.1990.4516|issn=0153-9345}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When needed, flint axes were used as a weapon. At a burial site associated with the Globular Amphora Culture, there are 15 individual remains with similar injuries. Using forensic medical analyses to determine these injuries, it was determined that majority of the fractures came from a flint axe. Flint axes are normally found within the graves sites if this particular culture. It was undetermined if this was an invasion or if they used the flint axes as a ritual for the Neolithic community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konopka|first=Tomasz|last2=Szczepanek|first2=Anita|last3=Przybyła|first3=Marcin M.|last4=Włodarczak|first4=Piotr|date=2016-03-01|title=Evidence of interpersonal violence or a special funeral rite in the Neolithic multiple burial from Koszyce in southern Poland – a forensic analysis|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/anre/79/1/article-p69.xml|journal=Anthropological Review|language=en|volume=79|issue=1|pages=69–85|doi=10.1515/anre-2016-0006|issn=2083-4594}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Occurrence==
Flint nodules are commonly found in [[Cretaceous]] [[chalk]] deposits, such as those of southern [[Great Britain|Britain]] and every where but [[France]]. They were mined during the Neolithic period in many locations, one of the most famous being at [[Grimes Graves]] in [[Norfolk]], [[England]]. In Nagada, an Upper Egypt Predynastic settlement site, the Flint axe was one of the most commonly bi-facial tools located there. Flint axes have been discovered along the Nile Valley from Matmar to El Qara. These axes have also been located in Kharga Oasis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

[[Image:Garage door opener.jpg|thumb|A residential garage door opener. The motor is in the box on the upper-right.]]
A '''garage door opener''' is a motorized device that opens and closes [[garage door]]s controlled by switches on the garage wall.  Most also include a handheld radio [[remote control]] carried by the owner, which she can use to open the door from the outside when she drives up, and close it after she leaves.

== The electric opener ==
The electric overhead garage door opener was invented by C.G. Johnson in 1926 in Hartford City, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advanced Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Operations: Tradecraft Methods, Practices, Tactics, and Techniques|author=Robert J Girod|section=Garage Door Openers - High-tech Burglary|page=90|ISBN=9781482230741|year=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric Garage Door openers did not become popular until Era Meter Company of Chicago offered one after World War II where the overhead garage door could be opened via a key pad located on a post at the end of the driveway or a switch inside the garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;hl=en|title=Aids To Modern Living - Garage Doors|date=December 1946|journal=[[Popular Science]]|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in an elevator, the electric motor does not provide most of the power to move a heavy garage door. Instead, most of door's weight is offset by the counterbalance springs attached to the door. (Even manually operated garage doors have counterbalances; otherwise they would be too heavy for a person to open or close them.) In a typical design, [[torsion spring]]s apply torque to a shaft, and that shaft applies a force to the garage door via steel counterbalance cables.  The electric opener provides only a small amount of force to control how far the door opens and closes. In most cases, the garage door opener also holds the door closed in place of a lock.

The typical electric garage door opener consists of a power unit that contains the electric motor. The power unit attaches to a track. A trolley connected to an arm that attaches to the top of the garage door slides back and forth on the track, thus opening and closing the garage door. The trolley is pulled along the track by a [[Roller chain|chain]], [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]], or [[Leadscrew|screw]] that turns when the motor is operated. A quick-release mechanism is attached to the trolley to allow the garage door to be disconnected from the opener for manual operation during a power failure or in case of emergency. Limit switches on the power unit control the distance the garage door opens and closes once the motor receives a signal from the remote control or wall push button to operate the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garage Door Systems, Springs and Openers|url=http://www.bobvila.com/HowTo_Library/Garage_Door_Systems_Springs_and_Openers-Subject_Garage-A2573.html|website=Bob Villa|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524075750/http://www.bobvila.com/HowTo_Library/Garage_Door_Systems_Springs_and_Openers-Subject_Garage-A2573.html|archivedate=24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire assembly hangs above the garage door. The power unit hangs from the ceiling and is located towards the rear of the garage. The end of the track on the opposite end of the power unit attaches to a header bracket that is attached to the header wall above the garage door. The power head is usually supported by punched angle iron.

Recently another type of opener, known as the jackshaft opener, has become more popular. This style of opener was used frequently on commercial doors but in recent years has been adapted for residential use. This style of opener consists of a motor that attaches to the side of the torsion rod and moves the door up and down by simply spinning the rod. These openers need a few extra components to function safely for residential use. These include a cable tension monitor, to detect when a cable is broken, and a separate locking mechanism to lock the door when it is fully closed. These have the advantage that they free up ceiling space that an ordinary opener and rail would occupy. These also have the disadvantage that the door must have a torsion rod to attach the motor to.

==Types==
There are five types of garage door openers:
# Chain drive openers have a chain (similar to a bicycle's) that connects the trolley to the motor.
# Belt drive openers use a rubber belt in place of a chain.
# Screw drive openers have a long screw inside the track. The trolley connects to this screw.
# Direct drive openers have the motor installed inside the trolley and use a gear wheel to guide the trolley along a fixed chain.
# Jackshaft openers mount on the wall at either end of the torsion bar.

==Remote control==
The first wireless garage door openers were invented and developed by two US inventors at the same time, one in Illinois and the other in Washington state. They were unknown to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|title=Widely Separated Inventors Invent Garage Door Openers By Radio Impulses|date=February 1931|journal=Popular Science|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first garage door opener remote controls were simple and consisted of a simple [[transmitter]] (the remote) and [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] which controlled the opener mechanism. The transmitter would transmit on a designated frequency; the receiver would listen for the radio signal, then open or close the garage, depending on the door position. The basic concept of this can be traced back to World War II. This type of system was used to detonate remote [[bomb]]s. While novel at the time, the technology ran its course when garage door openers became popular. While the garage door remote control transmitter is low power and has limited range, its signal can be received by other, nearby, garage door openers. When two neighbors had garage door openers, then opening one garage door might open the neighbor’s garage door as well.

The second stage of the [[wireless]] garage door opener system solved the opening-the-neighbor's-garage-door problem. The remote controls on these systems transmitted a digital code, and the receiver in the garage responded only to that code. The codes were typically set by eight to twelve [[DIP switch]]es on the receiver and transmitter, so they allowed for {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256}} to {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; = 4,096}} different codes. As long as neighbors used different codes, they would not open each other's garage doors. The intent of these systems was to avoid interference with nearby garage doors; the systems were not designed with security in mind. Intruders were able to defeat the security of these systems and gain entry to the garage and the house. The number of codes was small enough that even an unsophisticated intruder with a compatible remote control transmitter could just start transmitting all possible codes until he found one that opened the door. More sophisticated intruders could acquire a black box master key that automatically transmitted every possible code in a short time. An even more sophisticated method is known as a [[replay attack]]. The attacker would use a code grabber, which has a receiver that captures the remote's digital code and can retransmit that digital code at a later time. The attacker with a code grabber would wait nearby for the homeowner to use his remote, capture the code, and then replay the code to open the door when the homeowner was gone. Multicode openers became unpopular in areas where security was important, but due to their ease of programming, such openers are often used to operate such things as the gates in gated apartment complexes.

An intermediate stage of the garage door opener market eliminated the DIP switches and used remotes preprogrammed to one out of roughly 3.5 billion unique codes. The receiver would maintain a security list of remotes to which it would respond; the user could easily add the unique remote's code to the list by pressing a button on the garage door opener while activating the remote control. The large number of codes made the brute force try-all-possible-digital-codes attacks infeasible, but the systems were still vulnerable to code grabbers. For user convenience, these systems were also backward compatible with the older DIP switch remote codes, but adding an old technology remote to the security list made the garage door opener vulnerable to a brute force attack to find the DIP switch code. The larger code space approach was an improvement over the fixed DIP switch codes, but was still vulnerable to the replay attack.

The third stage of garage door opener technology uses a frequency spectrum range between 300-400&amp;nbsp;MHz and [[rolling code]] (code hopping) technology to defeat code grabbers. In addition to transmitting a unique identifier for the remote control, a sequence number and an encrypted message are also sent. Although an intruder could still capture the code used to open a garage door, the sequence number immediately expires, so retransmitting the code later would not open the garage door. The encryption makes it extremely difficult for an intruder to forge a message with the next sequence number that would open the door. Some rolling code systems are more involved than others. Because there is a high probability that someone will push the remote's button while not in range and thus advance the sequence number, the receiver does not insist the sequence number increase by exactly one; it will accept a sequence number that falls within a narrow window or two successive sequence numbers in a much wider window. Rolling code technology is also used on car remote controls and with some internet protocols for secure sites.

The fourth stage of garage door opener systems is similar to third stage, but it is limited to the 315&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency.  The 315&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range avoids interference from the [[Land Mobile Radio System|Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS)]] used by the U.S. military.

The following standards are used by units manufactured by [[Chamberlain Group|Chamberlain]] (including LiftMaster and [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman]]):

== Cloning garage door opener remotes ==
[[File:Garage-door-opener-remote-control.png|thumb|A typical photo of both the outer case and inner circuit of a garage door opener remote control.]]

Many garage door opener remote controls use fixed-code encoding which use DIP switches or soldering to do the address pins coding process, and they usually use pt2262/pt2272 or compatible ICs. For these fixed-code garage door opener remotes, one can easily clone the existing remote using a self-learning remote control duplicator (copy remote) which can make a copy of the remote using face-to-face copying.

==Additional features==
Additional features that have been added over the years have included:
* Automatic courtesy lights that turn on when the door opens (or via motion sensors) and automatically turn off after a preset delay
* A remote lockout feature, which turns off the radio receiver while one is on vacation or away for an extended time.
* The availability of accessories has increased, including such features as wireless keypads, key chain remotes, and solenoid-operated deadbolts to lock the door itself.

More sophisticated features are also available, such as an integrated carbon monoxide sensor to open the door in case of the garage being flooded with exhaust fumes. Other systems allow door activation over the Internet to allow home owners to open their garage door from their office for deliveries.

Another recent innovation in the garage door opener is a fingerprint-based wireless keypad. This unit attaches to the outside of the garage door on the jamb and allows users to open and close their doors with the press of a finger, rather than creating a [[personal identification number]] (PIN). This is especially helpful for families with children who may forget a code and are [[Latchkey kid|latchkey kids]].

==Safety==
The garage door is generally the largest moving object in a home. An improperly adjusted garage door opener can exert strong and deadly forces and might not reverse the garage door in an emergency. The manufacturer's instructions provide guidance to the user on the proper adjustment and maintenance of the opener.  

Garage door openers manufactured and installed in the United States since 1982 are required to provide a quick-release mechanism on the trolley that allows for the garage door to be disconnected from the garage door opener in the event of entrapment.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garagedoorchildsafety.com/solutions_falling.html|title=Falling Garage Doors — A Crushing Concern|publisher=Garage Door Child Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garage door openers manufactured since 1982 are also required to reverse the garage door if it strikes a solid object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/garage.pdf | title=Non Reversing Garage Door Openers a Hazard | publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dasma.com/safetygdguide.asp |title=Garage Door System Safety Guidelines |publisher=Door &amp; Access Systems Manufacturers Association International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223091511/http://www.dasma.com/safetygdguide.asp |archivedate=2008-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 required that automatic residential garage door operators manufactured on or after 1 January 1991 conform to the entrapment protection requirements of the 1988 version of [[ANSI]]/[[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] standard 325.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/Regulations-Laws--Standards/Voluntary-Standards/Topics/Garage-Door-OperatorsGate-Operators Garage Door Operators • CPSC]&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement for redundant entrapment-prevention devices was added in 1993; such a system can use an [[electric eye]], a door edge sensor, or any other device that provides equivalent protection by reversing the travel of the closing door if an object is detected in its path. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/blk_pdf_523.pdf Non-Reversing Automatic Garage Door Openers Are a Hazard • CPSC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2012-title16-vol2/CFR-2012-title16-vol2-part1211 16CFR1211]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gas burner''' is a device that produces a controlled [[flame]] by mixing a [[fuel gas]] such as [[acetylene]], [[natural gas]], or [[propane]] with an oxidizer such as the ambient [[air]] or supplied [[oxygen]], and allowing for [[wikt:ignition|ignition]] and [[combustion]].

The flame is generally used for the heat, infrared radiation, or visible light it produces. Some burners, such as [[gas flare]]s, dispose of unwanted or uncontainable flammable gases. Some burners are operated to produce [[carbon black]].

The gas burner has many applications such as [[soldering]], [[brazing]], and [[welding]], the latter using [[oxygen]] instead of air for producing a hotter flame, which is required for melting [[steel]]. Chemistry laboratories use natural-gas fueled [[Bunsen burner]]s. In domestic and commercial settings gas burners are commonly used in [[gas stove]]s and [[cooktop]]s. For melting metals with melting points of up to 1100&amp;nbsp;°C (such as [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[gold]]), a propane burner with a natural drag of air can be used. For higher temperatures, acetylene is commonly used in combination with oxygen.

*The surrounding air is at 20°C, 1 bar [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]]
*Complete combustion (no soot, and more blue-like flame is the key) (Stoichiometric)
*Peak Temperature
*Speed of Combustion (has no effect on temperature, but more energy released per second (as adiabatic) compared to normal flame)
*Spectral bands also affect colour of flame, as of what part and elements of combustion
*Blackbody radiation (colour appearance only because of heat)
*Atmosphere - affects temperature of flame and colour due to the atmospheric colour effect

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">The '''high-resolution dynamics limb sounder''' ('''HIRDLS''') is an instrument on board the [[NASA]] [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]]. It follows in the heritage of LRIR (Nimbus-6), LIMS and SAMS (Nimbus-7), ISAMS and CLAES (UARS). It was designed to observe global distribution of temperature and concentrations of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, CFC-11, CFC-12, ClONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and aerosols in the upper troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/|title=Missions &amp; Sensors|last=|first=|website=The World Data Center for Remote Sensing of the Atmosphere|publisher=|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After launch, activation of the HIRDLS instrument revealed that the optical path was blocked so that 20% of the aperture could view the Earth's atmosphere. Engineering studies suggest that a piece of thermal blanketing material ruptured from the back of the instrument during the explosive decompression of launch. Attempts to remove this material mirror failed. However, even with the 80% blockage, measurements at high vertical resolution can be made at one scan angle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4497">A '''hypsometer''' is an instrument for measuring height or [[elevation]]. Two different principles may be used: [[trigonometry]] and [[atmospheric pressure]].

==Scale hypsometer==
A simple scale hypsometer allows the height of a building or tree to be measured by sighting across a ruler to the base and top of the object being measured, when the distance from the object to the observer is known. Modern hypsometers use a combination of [[laser rangefinder]] and [[clinometer]] to measure distances to the top and bottom of objects, and the angle between the lines from the observer to each to calculate height.

[[Image:HypsometerGeometry.png|right|300px]]An example of such a scale hypsometer is illustrated here, and can be seen to consist of a sighting tube, a fixed horizontal scale, and an adjustable vertical scale with attached plumb line.  The principle of operation of such a scale hypsometer is based on the idea of similar triangles in geometry.  First the adjustable vertical scale is set at a suitable height.  Then as in step 1 in the illustration, a sighting is taken on the top of the object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, h', recorded.  Calculation from this value will eventually give the height h, from the eye-line of the observer to the top of the object whose height is to be determined.  Similarly as in step 2 of the illustration, a sighting is taken on the base of the object whose height is to be determined, and the reading on the horizontal scale, d', recorded.  Calculation from this value will eventually give the distance from the base of the object to the eye-line of the observer.  Finally the distance x from the observer to the object needs to be measured.

Looking at the geometry involved in step 1 results in sketch a: two right angled triangles, shown here with the identical small angles in yellow.  Next in sketch b we see that the two triangles have identical angles - each has a right angle, the same small angle shown in yellow, and the same larger angle shown in orange.  Therefore in sketch c we see that using the principle of similar triangles, given that each triangle has identical angles, the sides will be in proportion:  x the distance to the object in proportion to x', the height set on the vertical scale of the hypsometer, and h the height of the object above the observers eye-line in proportion to h', the reading from the horizontal scale of the hypsometer.

Given that Tan (small yellow angle) = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side, therefore Tan (small yellow angle) = h / x = h' / x'.  Therefore h = h'x / x'.

Likewise the geometry involved in step 2 results in sketch d: two right angled triangles.  Next in sketch e we see that the two triangles again have identical angles - each has a right angle, the same small angle shown in yellow, and the same larger angle shown in orange.  Therefore in sketch f we see that using the principle of similar triangles, given that each triangle has identical angles, the sides will be in proportion:  x the distance to the object in proportion to x', the height set on the vertical scale of the hypsometer, and d the depth of the object below the observers eye-line in proportion to d', the reading from the horizontal scale of the hypsometer.

Given that Tan (small angle) = Opposite Side / Adjacent Side, therefore Tan (small angle) = d / x = d' / x'.  Therefore d = d'x / x'.

Thus the overall height of the object is x (d' + h') / x'

==Pressure hypsometer==

[[Image:Hypsometer (by Koehne).png|right|100px]]A pressure hypsometer as shown in the drawing (right) employs the principle that the [[boiling point]] of a liquid is lowered by diminishing the [[barometric pressure]], and that the barometric pressure varies with the height of the point of observation. 

The instrument consists of a cylindrical vessel in which the liquid, usually water, is boiled, surmounted by a jacketed column, in the outer partitions of which the vapour circulates, while in the central one a [[thermometer]] is placed. To deduce the height of the station from the observed boiling point, it is necessary to know the relation existing between the boiling point and pressure, and also between the pressure and height of the atmosphere.

An '''ice screw''' is a threaded tubular [[Screw fastener|screw]] used as a [[running belay]] or anchor by [[climbing|climbers]] on steep ice surface such as steep waterfall ice or alpine ice during [[ice climbing]] or [[crevasse rescue]], to hold the climber in the event of a fall, and at belays as anchor points.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book

==Design==
[[File:EishakenSchrauben.JPG|thumb|left|Development of ice screws for the period 1924-2000]]
Ice screws may come with one or more of the following: an in-built or separate ratchet mechanism to speed up placement, conical centre-hole to aid removal of ice cores, different lengths, different numbers of cutting teeth, different cutting angles, different surface finishes, and different size clip holes. Price and durability are usually design considerations too, as a usable rack of ice screws will be a significant financial investment for many climbers. Many [[Titanium]] ice screws were initially made in the former Soviet Union using [[Cold War]]-era missile technology, but were generally too brittle and so the majority of ice screws are now made of [[41xx steel|chromoly steel]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The strongest and most reliable type of ice screws currently available are the modern tubular ice screws which range in lengths from 10 to 23&amp;nbsp;cm. The approximate strength rating on a modern tubular ice screw is around 7&amp;nbsp;[[Kilonewton|kN]], and it has been found that short ice screws in good ice hold about 7-8&amp;nbsp;kN, no matter what the [[fall factor]] or configuration is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beverlymountainguides.com/research/45/research Beverly and Attaway]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation]] drop test specifies that when multi-pitch lead climbing and the leader has only placed one screw (typically merely clipping one of the anchor screws) before climbing up a couple of meters and falling (a [[fall factor]] of 2), the screw must hold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theuiaa.org/upload_area/cert_files/UIAA101_DynamicRopes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamic ropes used in climbing can mitigate failure of an ice screw by keeping the impact forces low, especially if using a new rope that has not had any previous falls. It is rare that an ice screw fails in fall factors of 1 or less, if placed in good ice.

An older type of screw that is rarely used today is a pound-in ice screw, such as the 'snarg' and the 'warthog'. Instead of screwing these into the ice one would pound them in with a hammer from the ice tool, and then screw them out with the pick of an [[ice axe]]. The pound-ins have been largely replaced by modern tubular ice screws that are stronger and easier to use, although warthogs are being manufactured in Britain again for use in creating an anchor in frozen turf when no alternative anchor or placement is available, although it is now recommended only as 'marginal' equipment for when no other [[CE marking|CE-tested]] equipment can be placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Mick|title=The Warthog Rises Like A Phoenix From The Ashes|url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/news/item.php?id=41649|website=www.ukclimbing.com|accessdate=5 December 2015|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountain Technology Warthog Turf Screw|url=http://www.needlesports.com/4131/products/mountain-technology-warthog-turf-screw.aspx|website=www.needlesports.com|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snarg ice piton/screw|url=http://www.smhc.co.uk/objects_item.asp?item_id=32706|website=www.smhc.co.uk|publisher=Scottish Mountain Heritage Collection|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest ice screws incorporate replaceable tips, thereby increasing the useful life of the screw and enhancing placements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-climb.com/includes/resize.aspx?img=/fotos/3120092005164131.jpg&amp;width=450 E-Climb: Ice Screw Replaceable Tips]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Placement==
It was once thought necessary or beneficial for ice-screws to be placed horizontally or with the hanger up for optimum hold.  However, it has since been found experimentally that a screw placed with the tip angled up often holds as well or better.  This surprising result is thought to be due to the previously underestimated role of the threads in holding the screw in place.  However, horizontal placements are usually recommended.

Some climbers use tape slings to "tie-off" long ice-screws that have not been fully screwed into the ice, to reduce the leverage of a fall, which might bend or break the screw. There is some risk that such slings may move or be slice by the screw's hanger.  Some novel ice screws include a hanger that can be moved down the shaft, instead of using a sling. Placing a shorter screw is usually the preferred option, hence various lengths are available.

==Other uses==
Long ice-screws are now often used to create [[Abalakov thread|V-threads]] (a type of thread-hole /ice-bollard).  By making two ice-holes that intersect, an inexpensive but strong cord (typically static climbing accessory cord or tape, made of perlon, Dyneema or Specta) than be threaded through, making a relatively safe and cheap anchor.  This can be an attractive option at belays and when ice screws are in short supply. V-threads can be particular useful as [[rappel]] or [[abseil]] points where it is often necessary to leave the final anchor behind. A piece of wire - typically a piece of old coat hanger shaped for the purpose - or a stiff flexible purpose built tool with a small hook at one end and a hanging loop at the other end, is often used to aid threading of the cord.

In the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|"Rosetta" project]], the [[European Space Agency]] equipped its lander with multiple ice screws to obtain stability on comet surface, but they failed to hold, and the lander bounced a significant distance from the initial landing site.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

''' Inotera Memories, Inc. ''' (Traditional Chinese: '''華亞科技''', Hanyu Pinyin: huā yǎ kē jì) was a company incorporated as a joint venture between [[Nanya Technology Corporation]] and [[Infineon]] (later [[Qimonda]]) in  Taiwan in January 2003.
The company was acquired by [[Micron Technology]] in 2016. It was renamed to Micron Technology Taiwan, Inc. and became one of Micron's manufacturing locations.

==History==

In 2008, Micron Technology acquired a 35.5% stake in Inotera from Qimonda.
The Company reached full conversion to 70&amp;nbsp;nm shrink technology at the end of June 2008 and started pilot production of Micron’s 50&amp;nbsp;nm stack process technology from the third quarter of 2009 in order to further improve the productivity and to reduce manufacturing unit cost.

In January 2013, Micron announced an amendment to the joint development agreement with Nanya that gave Micron access to all of Inotera's manufacturing output based on market pricing.

In December 2016, Micron completed the acquisition at a transaction value of approximately US$4.0 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=StreetInsider |title=Micron Technology (MU) Completes $4B Acquisition of Inotera Memories |url=http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Micron+Technology+MU)+Completes+$4B+Acquisition+of+Inotera+Memories/12313879.html|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelligence-based design''' is the purposeful manipulation of the built-environment to effectively engage humans in an essential manner through complex organized information. Intelligence-Based Theory evidences the conterminous relationship between mind and matter, i.e. the direct neurological evaluations of surface, structure, pattern, texture and form. Intelligence-Based Theory maintains that our sense of well-being is established through neuro-engagement with the physical world at the deepest level common to all people i.e. "Innate Intelligence."

These precursory readings of the physical environment represent an evolved set of information processing skills that the human mind has developed over millennia through direct lived experience. This physiological engagement with the world operates in a more immediate sense than the summary events of applied meaning or intellectual speculation. It is through this direct neurological engagement that humans connect more fully with the world. Many of mankind's early religious associations with physical structures were informed by an intuitive understanding that structure and materials speak to our deeper self, i.e. the human spirit, the soul.  Intelligence Based Theory reveals this effectual dimension of the built-environment and its relationship to human cognitive development, mental acuity, perceptual awareness, spirituality, and sense of well-being. It is within this realm that the mind's eye connects, or fails to connect, with the world outside. The degree of neuro-connectivity which occurs at these intervals serves to render the built-environment either intelligible or un-intelligible. The study and theory of this occurrence is known as "Intelligence-Based Design."

==Antecedents==
Several distinct strands of design thinking, in parallel development, lead towards Intelligence-Based Design. [[Christopher Alexander]] contributed early on to the scientific approach to design, by proposing a theory of design in his book [[Notes on the synthesis of form]]. Those were the years when [[Artificial Intelligence]] was being developed by [[Herbert A. Simon]], and Alexander was part of that movement. His later work [[A Pattern Language]], although written for architects and urbanists, was picked up by the software community and used as a combinatorial and organizational rubric for software complexity, especially [[Design patterns (computer science)]]. Alexander's most recent work [[The Nature of Order]] continues by building up a framework for design that relies upon natural and biological structures. Entirely separate from this, [[E. O. Wilson]] introduced the [[Biophilia hypothesis]] to describe the affinity of humans to other living structures, and to conjecture our innate need for such a connection. This topic was later investigated by Stephen R. Kellert and others, and applied to the design of the artificial environment. The third and independent component of the theory is the recent developments in mobile robotics by [[Rodney Brooks]], where a breakthrough occurred by largely dispensing with internal memory. The practical concept of "Intelligence without representation" otherwise known as the [[Subsumption architecture]] and [[Behavior-based robotics]] introduced by Brooks suggests a parallel with the way human beings interact with, and design their own environment. These notions are brought together in Intelligence-Based Design, which is a topic currently under investigation for design applications in both architecture and urbanism.

'''Keil''' was founded in 1982 by Günter and Reinhard Keil, initially as a German [[List of business entities#Germany|GbR]]. In April 1985 the company was converted to ''Keil Elektronik [[GmbH]]'' to market add-on products for the development tools provided by many of the silicon vendors. Keil implemented the first [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]] designed from the ground-up specifically for the [[Intel 8051|8051]] [[microcontroller]].

Keil provides a broad range of development tools like [[ANSI]] [[C (programming language)|C]] [[compiler]], [[Assembly language#Assembler|macro assemblers]], [[debuggers]] and simulators, [[linker (computing)|linker]]s, [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], library managers, [[real-time operating systems]] and [[evaluation boards]] for Intel 8051, [[Intel MCS-251]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], and [[XC16x]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/channel.html?channel=ff80808112ab681d0112ab6b3ae30781&lt;/ref&gt;/[[C16x]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/channel.html?channel=ff80808112ab681d0112ab6b2f42075b&lt;/ref&gt;/[[ST10]]&lt;ref&gt;http://mcu.st.com/mcu/inchtml.php?fdir=pages&amp;fnam=st10&lt;/ref&gt; families.

A '''message-waiting indicator''' (MWI) in [[telephony]], is a [[Telcordia Technologies]] (formerly [[Bellcore]]) term for an [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]]-based [[telephone]] calling feature that illuminates an [[LED]] on selected [[telephones]] to notify a telephone user of waiting [[voicemail]] messages on most North American public telephone networks and [[Private branch exchange|PBXs]].

As described in Telcordia Generic Requirements document [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-283&amp; GR-283-CORE], a Message_Waiting_Indicator (MWI) is a mechanism that informs the subscriber about the status of recorded messages.{{Verify source|date=June 2011}} The subscriber may subscribe to a notification feature that makes use of the status of this MWI.

==Difference to audible message waiting indicators==
This feature is also frequently called (and abbreviated) as '''visual message waiting indicator''' (VMWI).  A VMWI, as defined in [http://telecom-info.telcordia.com/site-cgi/ido/docs.cgi?ID=SEARCH&amp;DOCUMENT=GR-1401&amp; Telcordia GR-1401-CORE], is a stored program controlled switching (SPCS) system feature that activates and deactivates a visual indicator on [[customer-premises equipment]] (CPE) to notify the customer that new messages are waiting.  VMWI differs from existing features that use other message indicators, such as audible stuttered [[dial tone]], in that it activates a visual indicator on the CPE.  The visual indicator may be as simple as lighting or flashing a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), or as advanced as displaying a special message on a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD).

This technology was invented by Jerome (Jerry) Schull and Wayne Howe at BellSouth's Advanced Technology R&amp;D group in 1992 and was issued as US Patents [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=12&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=howe-wayne$.INNM.&amp;OS=in/howe-wayne$&amp;RS=IN/howe-wayne$ #5,363,431] and  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=10&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=howe-wayne$.INNM.&amp;OS=in/howe-wayne$&amp;RS=IN/howe-wayne$ #5,521,964].  It was introduced in 1995, with the introduction of [[CLASS-based calling]] features and [[Analog Display Services Interface|ADSI]].  It was at one time only compatible with [[Analog Display Services Interface|ADSI]]-compliant telephones but is now compatible with any customer premises equipment ([[Customer-premises equipment|CPE]]) that simply responds visually to visual [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]].

==Use of similar indicator on standalone Caller ID set-top boxes==
This service is often erroneously associated with the abilities of most [[Caller ID]] standalone set-top boxes.  Caller ID boxes manufactured after 1998 feature an [[LED]] that blinks green to notify that new calls have been recorded and red to indicate that a subscriber has new voicemail messages waiting.  Some units also display the text "MESSAGE WAITING" (similar to [[Analog Display Services Interface|ADSI]]-compliant telephones).  These units do not use visual FSK to activate their red LEDs, but instead, they briefly "[[off hook|pick-up]]" the line at certain intervals (normally, within two minutes of a new call) to check for a "stuttered" [[dial tone]].  The presence of a stutter dial tone activates a red LED; while absence deactivates it.

==Mobile telephony==
For [[mobile phone]]s, the message-waiting indicator is sent via a [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) message — the same system used for [[texting]]. (SMS was actually invented for utilitarian uses like this, not for user conversation.)  It not only indicates that a message is waiting, but also how many unheard messages there are on the voicemail [[server (computing)|server]] for that [[MSISDN|telephone number]].  In the event that a phone is deactivated, out of range, or otherwise removed from the network, there is often no way to clear this indicator until another message is recorded to the system, causing the MWI message to be sent again once the phone reconnects.  The [[customer service]] [[call center]] for the [[mobile network operator]] may also be able to provide simple [[technical support]] to reset this by resending the MWI message manually.

'''Modified Active Gas Sampling''' (MAGS) is an [[environmental engineering]] assessment technique which rapidly detects unsaturated [[soil]] source areas impacted by [[volatile organic compounds]]. The technique was developed by [[HSA Engineers &amp; Scientists]] in [[Fort Myers, Florida]] in 2002, led by Richard Lewis, Steven Folsom, and Brian Moore. It is being used all over the [[United States]], and has been adopted by the state of [[Florida]] in its Dry-cleaning Solvent Cleanup Program.&lt;ref name="ebiusa.com"&gt;[http://www.ebiusa.com/EBJAwards.html 2007 EBJ Business Achievement Awards – Winners, Environmental Business Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
MAGS involves the extraction and analysis of soil vapor from a piezometer screened through the unsaturated soil column for the purpose of locating unsaturated zone source material.  According to the MAGS Manual, written by HSA and adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, MAGS is performed "by utilizing a typical regenerative blower fitted to a temporary [[soil vapor extraction]] well, [such that]a large volume of soil can be assessed with a limited number of samples.  While lacking the resolution of traditional soil sampling methods (e.g., discrete soil sampling, low flow active gas sampling, etc.), the statistical representativeness (in the sense of sample coverage) of MAGS results versus traditional methods is much greater.  Moreover, the results of the assessment provide useful transport and exposure assessment information over traditional techniques.  Lastly, MAGS is effective as both an initial site assessment and remedial assessment tool, in that, MAGS directly yields data required for remedial design."&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.dep.state.fl.us/pub/reports/wc/hsa/mags.pdf Modified Active Gas Sampling Manual, Florida Department of Environmental Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

MAGS is an alternative to discrete and composite [[soil test|soil sampling]]. MAGS, while it does not describe the sample with as much precision as the previously mentioned sampling methods, is more powerful statistically: it represents a larger area of a site which is more useful in determining the presence of a compound. Besides increasing the accuracy in identifying the presence compounds in the soil, MAGS also can quickly and accurately narrow down the location and spread of the compounds after a few trials. Once the location has been determined, more thorough and traditional soil borings can be done in the identified location, instead of sampling a whole site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broward.org/PollutionPrevention/ContaminatedSites/Documents/RemediationTimesArchive/NovemberDecember2002.pdf Broward Environmental Remediation Times, November/December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

HSA found particular success using the technique at solvent-impacted sites that were showing signs of rebound after initial remediation efforts. These rebounds are commonly the result of multiple (relatively small) release areas that had not been previously discovered with discrete soil sampling. MAGS can be useful in detecting how effectively the site had been cleaned up post-remediation.&lt;ref name="Poison Detective"&gt;[http://www.review.net/section/detail/poison-detective/ "Poison Detective," Gulf Coast Business Review, 2009 December 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding==
HSA Engineers &amp; Scientists considered patenting MAGS technology, but decided to trademark MAGS instead, asking that those who use the technique credit the firm.&lt;ref name="Poison Detective"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2009, HSA was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal with a Technology Merit Award in the category of remediation for the invention of MAGS technology.&lt;ref name="ebiusa.com"/&gt;

'''Motion control''' is a sub-field of [[automation]], encompassing the systems or sub-systems involved in moving parts of machines in a controlled manner. The main components involved typically include a [[motion controller]], an energy amplifier, and one or more [[Prime mover (disambiguation)|prime movers]] or [[actuator]]s. Motion control may be [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] or [[Closed-loop controller|closed loop]]. In open loop systems, the controller sends a command through the amplifier to the prime mover or actuator, and does not know if the desired motion was actually achieved. Typical systems include [[stepper motor]] or fan control. For tighter control with more precision, a measuring device may be added to the system (usually near the end motion). When the measurement is converted to a signal that is sent back to the controller, and the controller compensates for any error, it becomes a Closed loop System.

Typically the position or velocity of machines are controlled using some type of device such as a [[hydraulic pump]], [[linear actuator]], or [[electric motor]], generally a [[servomechanism|servo]]. Motion control is an important part of [[robotics]] and [[CNC]] [[machine tools]], however in these instances it is more complex than when used with specialized machines, where the [[kinematics]] are usually simpler. The latter is often called [[General Motion Control]] (GMC). Motion control is widely used in the packaging, printing, textile, [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor production]], and assembly industries.
Motion Control encompasses every technology related to the movement of objects. It covers every motion system from micro-sized systems such as silicon-type micro induction actuators to micro-siml systems such as a space platform. But, these days, the focus of motion control is the special control technology of motion systems with electric actuators such as dc/ac servo motors. Control of robotic manipulators is also included in the field of motion control because most of robotic manipulators are driven by electrical servo motors and the key objective is the control of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=548386&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The basic architecture of a motion control system contains:
*A motion controller to generate set points (the desired output or motion profile) and (in closed loop systems) close a position or velocity [[feedback]] loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motioncontrolresource.com/info-center/category/terminology.html |title=Motion Control Resource Info Center |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A drive or [[amplifier]] to transform the control signal from the motion controller into energy that is presented to the actuator. Newer "intelligent" drives can close the position and velocity loops internally, resulting in much more accurate control.
*A [[Prime mover (disambiguation)|prime mover]] or [[actuator]] such as a hydraulic pump, pneumatic cylinder, linear actuator, or electric motor for output motion.
*In closed loop systems, one or more feedback sensors such as absolute and [[incremental encoder]]s, [[resolver (electrical)|resolvers]] or [[Hall effect]] devices to return the position or velocity of the actuator to the motion controller in order to close the position or velocity control loops.
*Mechanical components to transform the motion of the actuator into the desired motion, including: [[gear]]s, shafting, [[ball screw]], [[belt (mechanical)|belts]], [[linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], and linear and rotational [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]].

The interface between the motion controller and drives it controls is very critical when coordinated motion is required, as it must provide tight [[synchronization]].  Historically the only open interface was an analog signal, until open interfaces were developed that satisfied the requirements of coordinated motion control, the first being [[SERCOS interface|SERCOS]] in 1991 which is now enhanced to [[SERCOS III]]. Later interfaces capable of motion control include [[Ethernet/IP]], [[Profinet| Profinet IRT]], [[Ethernet Powerlink]], and [[EtherCAT]].

Common control functions include:
*Velocity control.
*Position (point-to-point) control: There are several methods for computing a motion trajectory. These are often based on the velocity profiles of a move such as a triangular profile, trapezoidal profile, or an S-curve profile.
*Pressure or Force control.
*[[Impedance control]]: This type of control is suitable for environment interaction and object manipulation, such as in robotics.
*Electronic gearing (or cam profiling): The position of a slave axis is mathematically linked to the position of a master axis. A good example of this would be in a system where two rotating drums turn at a given ratio to each other. A more advanced case of electronic gearing is electronic camming. With electronic camming, a slave axis follows a profile that is a function of the master position. This profile need not be salted, but it must be an animated [[function (mathematics)|function]]

[[File:Multi-function indicator example1.svg|thumb|right|A schematic example of a multi-function display]]

A '''multifunction display''' ('''MFD''') is a small-screen ([[cathode ray tube|CRT]] or [[LCD]]) surrounded by multiple [[soft key]]s (configurable buttons) that can be used to display information to the user in numerous configurable ways. MFDs originated in aviation, first in military aircraft, and later were adopted by commercial aircraft, [[general aviation]], automotive use, and shipboard use.

== MFDs in aviation ==
Often, an MFD will be used in concert with a [[primary flight display]], and forms a component of a [[glass cockpit]]. MFDs are part of the digital era of modern planes or helicopter. The first MFDs were introduced by air forces in the late 1960s and early 1970s; an early example is the [[F-111D]] (first ordered in 1967, delivered from 1970–73). The advantage of an MFD over analog display is that an MFD does not consume much space in the cockpit, as data can be presented in multiple pages, rather than always being present at once. For example, the cockpit of [[RAH-66]] "Comanche" does not have analog dials or gauges at all. All information is displayed on the MFD pages. The possible MFD pages could differ for every plane, complementing their abilities (in combat).

Many MFDs allow pilots to display their navigation route, moving map, weather radar, [[NEXRAD]], [[ground proximity warning system]], [[traffic collision avoidance system]], and airport information all on the same screen.

MFDs were added to the [[Space Shuttle]] (as the glass cockpit) starting in 1998, replacing the analog instruments and CRTs. The information being displayed is similar, and the glass cockpit was first flown on the [[STS-101]] mission. Although many corporate business jets had them in years prior, the piston-powered [[Cirrus SR20]] became the first [[type certificate|part-23 certified]] aircraft to be delivered with an MFD in 1999 (and one of the first general aviation aircraft with a 10-in, flat-panel screen), followed closely by the [[Columbia 300 (aircraft)|Columbia 300]] in 2000 and many others in the ensuing years.

In modern automotive technology, MFDs are used in cars to display navigation, entertainment, and vehicle status information.

==Preparation==
NHN can be synthesized by reacting [[nickel nitrate]] with a dilute [[aqueous solution]] of hydrazine at 65&amp;nbsp;C.&lt;ref name="Chhabra et al 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-3894(02)00247-9 |pmid=12758009 |title=Synthesis, characterization and thermal studies of (Ni/Co) metal salts of hydrazine: Potential initiatory compounds |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=225–39 |year=2003 |last1=Chhabra |first1=J.S |last2=Talawar |first2=M.B |last3=Makashir |first3=P.S |last4=Asthana |first4=S.N |last5=Singh |first5=Haridwar }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help speed the drying of the product after filtration from the hot water, it can be rinsed with alcohol. The product is a fluffy powder (density=0.9&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). To increase its bulk density ( 1.2&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[dextrin]] can be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/5478 |title=NOPR: Studies on nickel hydrazinium nitrate (NHN) and bis-(5-nitro-2H tetrazolato-N2)tetraamino cobalt(III) perchlorate (BNCP): Potential lead-free advanced primary explosives |website=Nopr.niscair.res.in |date= |accessdate=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-primary explosive detonator (NPED)==

NHN needs minimal confinement to properly make the [[deflagration]] to [[detonation]] transition (DDT). Thin steel / aluminum tubing with dimensions 5/16" OD, 0.273" ID (a 0.020" wall thickness) is sufficient for NHN to make the DDT.&lt;ref name="Hariharanath et al 2006"/&gt; Properly made NHN will even detonate in a plastic tube with a sensitive secondary like powdered [[Erythritol tetranitrate|ETN]] to set off melt-cast ETN or materials such as [[PETN]], or [[RDX]].  Using powdered ETN as a transition explosive completely eliminates the need to use a primary explosive in the detonator thus making an NHN based detonator a true [https://issuu.com/sharmapd1/docs/non-primary_explosive_detonator NPED].

==Safety==
NHN straddles the line between primary and secondary.  Because of this it is a relatively safe explosive to work with having much less sensitivity to shock and friction (16.0 N) than Lead Azide (0.1N) as shown in table 2.

Friction sensitivities of some traditional explosives (lead azide – 0.1N; lead trinitroresorcinate – 1.5 N; mercury fulminate (white) – 5,0 N;
tetrazene – 8.0 N; PETN – 60 N; hexogen – 120 N; octogen – 120 N, show that NHN is not very sensitive, and is thereby not exceedingly hazardous in handling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chemikinternational.com/pdf/2011/01_2011/chemik_2011_65_1_24-27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Assorted_Nuts_and_Nut_Tool.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Two sets of nuts with a removal tool between them]]
[[File:Organ Pipes, Mt Wellington - Lyle Closs, Pulpit Chimney - 4412574656.jpg|thumb|left|Climber with climbing rack made up only of '''nuts''' and [[Hexes (climbing)|hexes]]]]

In [[rock climbing]], a '''nut''' (or ''chock'' or ''chockstone'') is a metal wedge threaded on a wire and is used for [[protection (climbing)|protection]] by wedging it into a crack in the rock. [[Quickdraws]] are clipped to the nut wire by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts come in a variety of sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of [[aluminum]]. Larger nuts may be threaded on [[Dyneema]] cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual. &lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book | edition = 7 | editor = Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas | title = [[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] | publisher = The Mountaineers | isbn = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | year = 2003&lt;!-- 2003-09 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very smallest nuts are known as ''micronuts'' and may be made of [[brass]] or other metal, and typically have their wires [[solder]]ed into them, instead of looped through drilled holes.  They are mostly used in [[aid climbing]], and their value as protection, arresting a climber's fall, is marginal due to their low breaking strength, and the tiny surface area (the HB 0 measures about 4 x 7 x 2.5 mm) in contact with the rock, though this can be offset by placing several micronuts at a time. Other names used include ''RPs'' (the brand name of the first commercially available micronuts) and ''brassies''. They are available from several manufacturers in a variety of styles. 

British climbers in the 1950s and 1960s were the first to use nuts as climbing protection. In addition to using [[piton]]s, they picked up machine nuts from the side of railway tracks, climbed with them in their pockets, and used them as artificial chocks. This developed to the point where they drilled the thread from the middle, threaded them with slings, and used them in cracks.

In 1972, when [[clean climbing]] became an issue in the US, [[Yvon Chouinard]] began manufacturing chocks made specifically for rock climbing, with the familiar wedge shape still in use today. With [[Tom Frost]], Chouinard invented a larger, six-sided nut called a [[Hexes (climbing)|Hexentric]] or hex. Prominent climbers like [[Henry Barber (rock climber)|Henry Barber]] and [[John Stannard]] helped popularize the use of nuts, especially after it was discovered that a nut was lighter and easier to place and remove while climbing, as well as being at least as secure as a well-placed piton, and less damaging to the rock.

Nuts are available in different shapes to help the climber find the best fit for a given crack. Curved nuts have a concave face on one side and a convex face on the other. Larger nuts can be placed in either of two aspects (hexes in three aspects) to suit different-width cracks, with either the main faces or the sides in contact with the rock.

[[File:Climbing nut in use.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Climbing nut in use]]

Nuts may be generically referred to as ''wires'' or ''stoppers'', though "Stopper" is a brand name of a nut made by [[Black Diamond Equipment]].

The '''Open Handset Alliance''' ('''OHA''') is a [[consortium]] of 84&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_faq.html Alliance FAQ | Open Handset Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; firms to develop [[open standard]]s for [[mobile device]]s. Member firms include [[HTC]], [[Sony]], [[Dell]], [[Intel]], [[Motorola]], [[Qualcomm]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Google]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[LG Electronics]], [[T-Mobile]], [[Sprint Corporation]], [[Nvidia]], and [[Wind River Systems]].&lt;ref name="AndroidAnnouce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html|title=Industry Leaders Announce Open Platform for  Mobile Devices|accessdate=2007-11-05|date=2007-11-05|publisher=Open Handset Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OHA was established on 5 November 2007, led by [[Google]] with 34 members,&lt;ref name="AndroidAnnouce"/&gt; including mobile handset makers, [[application software|application]] developers, some mobile carriers and chip makers.&lt;ref name="companies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_members.html|title=Open Handset Alliance members page|date=2007-11-05|accessdate=2007-11-05|publisher=Open Handset Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Android (operating system)|Android]], the flagship software of the alliance (first developed by Google in 2007), is based on an open-source license and has competed against mobile platforms from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]] ([[Symbian]]), [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] (formerly [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]]), [[Samsung Electronics]] / [[Intel]] ([[Tizen]], [[bada]]), and [[BlackBerry Ltd|BlackBerry]].

As part of its efforts to promote a unified Android platform, OHA members are contractually forbidden from producing devices that are based on incompatible [[Fork (software development)|forks]] of Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alibaba: Google just plain wrong about our OS|author=|date=September 15, 2012|work=CNET News|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57513651-94/alibaba-google-just-plain-wrong-about-our-os/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ars-amadeo&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/|title=Google’s iron grip on Android: Controlling open source by any means necessary|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=21 October 2013|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=1 December 2013|location=p.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the announcement of the formation of the Open Handset Alliance on November 5, 2007, the OHA also unveiled  [[Android (operating system)|Android]], an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[mobile phone]] [[platform (computing)|platform]] based on the [[Linux]] kernel.&lt;ref name=AndroidAnnouce/&gt; An early look at the [[Android software development#Android SDK|SDK]] was released to developers on 12 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/developers.html|title=Developers|date=2007-11-05|accessdate=2007-11-05|publisher=Open Handset Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially available phone running Android was the [[HTC Dream]] (also known as the T-Mobile G1).  It was approved by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) on 18 August 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/08/18/htc-dream-fcc-approved-android-clear-for-launch/|title=FCC Approved HTC Dream|date=2008-08-18|publisher=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became available on 22 October of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94982690|title=Google Is Calling.

'''Paris-Saclay''' is a [[research-intensive cluster|research-intensive]] and [[business cluster]] currently under construction south of [[Paris]], [[France]]. It encompasses research facilities, universities, French higher education institutions (''[[grandes écoles]]'') and also research centers of private companies. In 2013, the [[Technology Review]] put Paris-Saclay in the top 8 world research clusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/517626/infographic-the-worlds-technology-hubs/|title=Infographic: The World's Technology Hubs|first=Antonio|last=Regalado|website=Technologyreview.com|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it comprised almost 15% of French scientific research capacity.

The earliest settlements are from the 1950s, and this area was subsequently extended several times during the 1970s and [[2000s (decade)|2000s]]. Several projects are underway to continue the development of the campus, including the relocation of some facilities. The goal is to strengthen the cluster in order to build an international scientific and technological hub that can compete with other high-technology business districts, such as [[Silicon Valley]] or [[Cambridge, MA]]. This project started in 2006 and is likely to end in 2020. The main part is the construction of the ''[[campus]] du [[plateau de Saclay]]'' (in English plateau de Saclay campus), in order to launch the [[Université Paris-Saclay]].

== History ==

=== First post-war settlement ===
Several French national institutions settled on the plateau after the end of World War II. The [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]] is the first to settle there, headed by [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], who bought the estate Button at [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090828014917/http://www.dr4.cnrs.fr/delegation/laboratoires/campus_gif_histoire.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the newly created [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|CEA]] (the High Commissioner is also Joliot-Curie) to purchase land. The same year, [[Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales|ONERA]] settles on the plateau in [[Palaiseau]]. The Saclay center was inaugurated in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/fr/Histoire-du-centre-de-Saclay |title=Histoire du centre de Saclay / Présentation générale / CEA Saclay - CEA Saclay |language=fr|website=Centre-saclay.cea.fr |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=778254 |title=Abonnement Le Monde |website=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, higher education institutions settled nearby. The [[University of Paris]] is also up in the region in 1955 with the purchase of 50 hectares in the communes of [[Orsay]] and [[Bures-sur-Yvette|Bures]]. This Orsay campus brings laboratories of the Paris Faculty of Sciences (later the [[University of Paris-Sud]]) and moved to 1956. Other institutions followed with the installation of [[HEC Paris|HEC]] in 1964 with its move to the town of [[Jouy-en-Josas]], then with the arrival of the ''[[École supérieure d'optique]]'' in 1965 on the Orsay campus.&lt;ref name="historique"/&gt;

Research centers related to private companies also settled at that time in 1968 with the arrival of the Central Research Laboratory of [[Thomson-CSF]].&lt;ref name="historique"/&gt;

=== Second wave of settlement in the 1970s ===
[[File:Ecole Polytechnique France seen from lake DSC03389.JPG|thumb|Ecole Polytechnique France seen from lake]]

In the 1970s, the [[École polytechnique]] and [[Supélec]] settled on the plateau,&lt;ref name="historique"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091218173311/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-Campus/Un-peu-d-histoire ]&lt;/ref&gt; the first in 1976 in the Palaiseau area, the other in 1975 in the Moulon area. The project had a scheduled time to install other schools soon after. The Moulon farm which currently houses the genetics and plant breeding was restored in 1978.&lt;ref name="historique"/&gt;

Institutions on the plateau at this time begin to join together in an ''association d’établissements scientifiques'' (association of scientific institutions, AES) to reflect future developments of the area.&lt;ref name="historique"/&gt;

=== Third wave of the 2000s ===
At the beginning of the twenty-first century, research centers of private companies settled on the campus. In 2000, [[Groupe Danone|Danone]] chooses to establish a center for [[Research and Development]] in the area of [[Palaiseau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=100197 |title=Abonnement Le Monde |website=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; joined in 2006 by [[Thales Group|Thales]] laboratories, and in 2009 by [[Kraft Foods]] which invests €15 million to install one of its expertise global centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challenges.fr/magazine/?xtmc=saclay&amp;xtcr=16 |title=Magazine |website=Challenges.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects removal were also studied, including a research center of [[Électricité de France|EDF]], studied in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparisien.fr/saclay-91400/edf-envisage-de-demenager-sur-le-campus-18-05-2010-925962.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Two thematic advanced research are also on the campus, with the creation of ''Digiteo'' and ''Triangle de la physique'' in 2006. [[SOLEIL]], which creation was decided in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=189757 |title=Abonnement Le Monde |website=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; after three years of opposition of [[Claude Allègre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.liberation.fr/sciences/010169696-soleil-a-enfin-rendez-vous-avec-chirac |title=Soleil a (enfin) rendez-vous avec Chirac - Libération |website=Liberation.fr |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated the same year, built with a budget of 313 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.liberation.fr/sciences/010151846-soleil-va-bientot-voir-le-jour |title=Soleil va bientôt voir le jour - Libération |website=Liberation.fr |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project of [[neuroimaging]] center NeuroSpin is launched in 2006 also on the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20061124.OBS0326/coup-d-envoi-vendredidu-projet-neurospin.html |title=Coup d'envoi vendredidu projet NeuroSpin - 24 novembre 2006 - L'Obs |website=Tempsreel.nouvelobs.com |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first building constructed specifically for the campus is the ''Pôle commun de recherche en informatique'' (Joint Research Cluster Computing), which was inaugurated in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le-republicain.fr/component/flexicontent/items/item/5114-inauguration-gif-sur-yvette-plateau-de-saclay-pcri-laurent-wauquiez-ministre-de-lenseignement-superieur-de-la-recherche?format=pdf%7CLauren |title=Journal Le Républicain - Hebdomadaire de l'Essonne |website=Le-republicain.fr |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development projects ===
The proposed new construction and renovation of campus was launched by President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] who wants to create a "French [[Silicon Valley]]". The entire project is estimated to three billion euros funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribune.fr/journal/archives/edition-du-2402/politique-france/149969/saclay-22.000-etudiants-9.500-chercheurs.html |title=Saclay, 22.000 étudiants, 9.500 chercheurs |website=Latribune.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siege HP courtaboeuf.JPG|thumb|The research center of [[Hewlett-Packard]] in the Paris-Saclay [[Business cluster|cluster]], France.]]

The different steps to set up the campus are part of several government operations.&lt;ref name="historique"/&gt;
* The ''opération d'intérêt national de Massy Palaiseau Saclay Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines'' is established in 2006. Larger than the campus, it provides for the creation of a science and technology [[Business cluster|cluster]] on the Saclay plateau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=2874 ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by "[[Grand Paris]]" project which also provides that the campus is accessible by the ''Ligne verte du Grand Paris Express''.
* The "plan campus" permits an investment of 850 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/cid51349/investissements-d-avenir-operation-du-plateau-de-saclay.html |title=Opération du plateau de Saclay - ESR |website=enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* With the debt, a billion is invested. Saclay campus is one of the winners of the « ''initiatives d'excellence'' » project so was awarded another grant of 950 million of euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Philippe |url=http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/idex-les-dotations-des-cinq-laureats-de-la-seconde-vague-de-l-initiative-d-excellence.html |title=Idex : Les dotations des cinq lauréats de la seconde vague - Educpros |website=Letudiant.fr |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 October 2012, [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] confirmed for the future operation of the project Campus Paris-Saclay staffing a billion for real estate transactions designed to bring together institutions, 850 million from ''plan campus'' and additional billion for investments for the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121102132232/http://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/les-news/actu/detail/article/universite-ayrault-reaffirme-le-projet-paris-saclay-322/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several institutions of higher education will be moved on the campus, such as:
* the [[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/val-de-marne-94/sarkozy-veut-delocaliser-normale-sup-15-12-2009-744683.php |title=Sarkozy veut délocaliser Normale sup - le Parisien |website=Leparisien.fr |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ENSTA ParisTech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Catherine Gaudenz |url=http://www.latribune.fr/carrieres/jeunes-diplomes/20090619trib000390007/l-ecole-high-tech-du-ministere-de-la-defense-rejoindra-saclay-en-2010.html |title=L'école high tech du ministère de la Défense rejoindra Saclay en 2010 |website=Latribune.fr |date=2009-06-19 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Agro ParisTech]]. Particularly, AgroParisTech and [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]] have a project for the construction of a common building in [[Palaiseau]]. It will include all activities INRA Île-de-France unlocated in Jouy-en-Josas or Versailles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120923151207/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Idex-Paris-Saclay/L-organisation ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[École Centrale Paris]]
* [[ENSAE ParisTech]]
* [[Télécom ParisTech]] which moves was confirmed in September 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-politique/sarkozy-annonce-l-arrivee-d-ecoles-de-prestige-sur-le-campus-paris-saclay-24-09-2010-1081156.php |title=Sarkozy annonce l'arrivée d'écoles de prestige sur le campus Paris-Saclay - le Parisien |website=Leparisien.fr |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* and all or part of the [[University of Paris-Sud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Philippe |url=http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/saclay-christian-blanc-avance-son-cluster.html |title=Saclay : Christian Blanc avance son cluster - Educpros |website=Letudiant.fr |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with other institutions already located in the cluster, these education institutions are to be merged in [[University of Paris-Saclay]]. This university is to enter the [[Shanghai ranking]] between the 10th and 20th position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/France/Avec-Paris-Saclay-l-universite-francaise-veut-prendre-du-galon-2014-01-07-1085642|title=Avec Paris-Saclay, l’université française veut prendre du galon|date=7 January 2014|website=La-croix.com|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, the [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University]] became a founding member of the scientific cooperation foundation foreshadowing the future campus on the Saclay plateau.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110902215418/http://www.20ans.uvsq.fr/uvsq-une-universite-a-l-age-de-tous-les-possibles-132425.kjsp ]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the [[Mines ParisTech]] finally withdrew the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Philippe |url=http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/les-mines-de-paris-jugent-incompatible-lidex-de-saclay-avec-le-projet-paristech.html |title=Les mines de Paris jugent incompatible l’Idex de Saclay avec le projet ParisTech - Educpros |website=Letudiant.fr |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three administratives structures have been created for this project:
* The ''Établissement Public Paris-Saclay'', chaired by [[Pierre Veltz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sylvain Allemand |url=http://www.media-paris-saclay.fr |title=Media Paris Saclay |language=fr|website=Media-paris-saclay.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Fondation de coopération scientifique Plateau de Saclay'' is the structure that carries the project. It must unite the various institutions at the university and scientific level. It is successively chaired by [[Alain Bravo]], Paul Vialle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.slideshare.net/GL/cpcampussaclaynominationpaulvialle |title=Communiqué de presse - Campus Saclay Nomination Paul Vialle |website=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (28 April 2009 to his resignation on 30 March 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Philippe AMMEUX |url=http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/actualite/demission-de-paul-vialle-le-president-du-campus-de-saclay-1.html |title=Démission de Paul Vialle, le président du campus de Saclay - Educpros |website=Letudiant.fr |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Dominique Vernay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111106202340/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/content/download/1549/7810/version/1/file/110419+CP+DV.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''consortium des établissements du Plateau de Saclay'', which brings together 23 institutions.

=== Areas of the campus ===
[[File:Saclay map.png|thumb|Saclay map]]
[[File:SOLEIL le 01 juin 2005.jpg|thumb|SOLEIL on 1 June 2005]]

The campus has currently seven areas:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091219205620/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-projet/Les-zones-et-les-projets ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Gif-sur-Yvette" area ====
The [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] is located at [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] since 1946. The area has a dozen research units and service, and also 1,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100214010348/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-projet/Les-zones-et-les-projets/Gif-sur-Yvette ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Jouy-en-Josas" area ====
[[HEC Paris]] has been located at [[Jouy-en-Josas]] since 1964. [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique|INRA]] has 1,400 people in the area, and facilities for experimentation on livestock and [[microbiology]]. An extension of these activities provided for the arrival of more than 300 people in 2012, with the construction of [[Biosafety level|Biosafety P3]] facilities for [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-projet/Les-zones-et-les-projets/Jouy-en-Josa ]{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Martinière" area ====
The « Martinière area » is at the center of the whole, between the areas of Palaiseau and Moulon. It should accommodate several components of the [[University of Paris-Sud]] (earth sciences, economics and management, law and sport) as part of the development in the 2010s, but also several facilities pooled projected by the campus operation (conference center, students and international doctoral students accommodation centers, home business, documentation, logistics).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100213142114/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-projet/Les-zones-et-les-projets/Martiniere ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Moulon" area ====
The area includes ''[[Supélec]]'' and a part of the [[University of Paris-Sud]], which has 1,160 people in the area including 860 students.
The ''[[École Centrale Paris]]'', the ''[[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay]]'' and part of the University of Paris-Sud should relocate there. There should then be around 8,100 staff, 5,000 students for engineering schools and 5000 students in the University of Paris-Sud.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100214010522/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-projet/Les-zones-et-les-projets/Moulon ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Orme/Saclay" area ====
It includes the [[Saclay Nuclear Research Centre]], the Orphée reactor and [[SOLEIL]] in [[Saint-Aubin, Essonne|Saint-Aubin]].

==== "Palaiseau" area ====
[[File:Campus Polytechnique.svg|thumb|Map of the Palaiseau area]]
The area includes the ''[[École Polytechnique]]'', the [[ENSTA ParisTech]], the ''[[Office National d'Études et de Recherches Aérospatiales]]'' and the ''[[École supérieure d'optique]]''.
It would bring together [[ParisTech]] ''[[grandes écoles]]'' in the project developed in the early 2000s : [[Agro ParisTech]], the [[ENSAE ParisTech]] and [[Telecom ParisTech]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100214010527/http://www.campus-paris-saclay.fr/Le-projet/Les-zones-et-les-projets/Palaiseau ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Nozay" area ====
It includes [[Nokia]],  in [[Nozay, Essonne|Nozay]].

=== Projects critics ===
Various extensions of the campus were criticized by environmental movements in the early 1990s who accuse it of reducing the size of the agricultural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=324037 |title=Abonnement Le Monde |website=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=491362 |title=Abonnement Le Monde |website=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms are reformulated in the expansion projects of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2012/05/28/plateau-de-saclay-les-derniers-paysans-de-paris_1706980_3244.html |title=Sur le plateau de Saclay, les derniers paysans de Paris |website=Lemonde.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also criticize a project that promotes the ''[[Grandes Ecoles]]'' too much, especially with regard to the governance of the Campus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101127062737/http://sciences.blogs.liberation.fr/home/2010/11/campus-de-saclay-luniversit%C3%A9-paris-sud-se-rebiffe.html] &lt;/ref&gt; The Snesup (''Syndicat national de l'enseignement supérieur'') denounces "a project based on an elitist vision of higher education" and the exclusion of many institutions from the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snesup.fr/Le-Snesup/L-actualite-du-SUP?aid=5346&amp;ptid=5 |title=Plateau de Saclay : en force, sans consultation &amp;#124; SNESUP |language=fr|website=Snesup.fr |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The management project initiated by the "campus plan" has also been criticized by local politicians who criticize the state for being the sole leader of the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/0101564370-saclay-un-projet-critique |title=Saclay : un projet critiqué - Libération |website=Liberation.fr |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other project stakeholders who criticize the state of exercising too much intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2010/04/12/plateau-de-saclay-un-territoire-d-exception-merite-un-projet-d-exception-par-thomas-lamarche-et-olivier-rechauchere_1332174_3232.html |title=Plateau de Saclay : un territoire d'exception mérite un projet d'exception, par Thomas Lamarche et Olivier Réchauchère |website=Lemonde.fr |date=2016-10-14 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization referred to as a [[business cluster]] is also criticized by the actors who doubt its effectiveness or fear that its development would be detrimental to other geographical areas, as in the case of the [[University of Paris-Sud]] and the ''[[École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay]]'' leaving towns in the Paris region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/fontaine-la-riviere-91690/cecile-duflot-se-prononce-contre-la-silicon-valley-10-02-2010-810256.php |title=Cécile Duflot se prononce contre la " Silicon Valley " - le Parisien |website=Leparisien.fr |date= |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of ''[[grandes écoles]]'' leaving [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/nicolas-sarkozy-confirme-le-transfert-de-grandes-ecoles-a-saclay-24-09-2010-1240888_19.php |title=Nicolas Sarkozy confirme le transfert de grandes écoles à Saclay - Le Point |website=Lepoint.fr |date=2010-09-24 |accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sheep Fold.jpg|Sheep near a dry stone sheepfold, one of the oldest types of livestock enclosure|thumb]]
A '''pen''' is an enclosure for holding animals such as [[livestock]] or [[pet]]s that are unwanted inside the house.&lt;!--sometimes large wild animals in captivity too, zebras, etc; as in zoos --&gt; The term describes types of enclosures that may confine one or many animals. Construction and terminology vary depending on the region of the world, purpose, animal species to be confined, local materials used and tradition. ''Pen'' or ''penning'' as a verb refers to the act of confining animals in an enclosure.

==Australia and New Zealand==
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] a ''pen'' is a small enclosure for livestock (especially sheep or [[cattle]]), which is part of a larger construction, e.g. ''calf pen'', ''forcing pen'' (or yard) in sheep or cattle [[Yard (land)|yards]], or a ''sweating pen'' or ''catching pen'' in a [[shearing shed]]. In Australia, a [[paddock]] may encompass a large, fenced grazing area of many acres, not to be confused with the American English use of ''paddock'' as interchangeable with ''corral'' or ''pen'', describing smaller, confined areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Britain==
In British English, a sheep pen is also called a ''folding'', ''sheepfold'' or ''sheepcote''. Modern [[shepherd]]s more commonly use terms such as ''closing or confinement pen'' for small sheep pens. Most structures today referred to as ''sheepfolds'' are ancient [[dry stone]] semicircles.

==United States==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:CurvedRaceCattleCorral.jpg|Curved cattle corrals|thumb|right]] --&gt;
In the [[United States]], the term ''pen'' usually describes outdoor small enclosures for holding animals. These may be for encasing livestock or pets that cannot be kept indoors. Pens may be named by their purpose, such as a ''holding pen'', used for short-term confinement. A pen for cattle may also be called a ''corral'', a term borrowed from the [[Spanish language]]. Groups of pens that are part of a larger complex may be called a ''stockyard'', where a series of pens holds a large number of animals, or a ''feedlot'', which is type of stockyard used to confine animals that are being fattened. A large pen for horses is called a ''paddock'' (Eastern USA) or a ''corral'' (Western USA). In some places an exhibition arena may be called a ''show pen''. A small pen for horses (no more than 15–20 feet on any side) is only known as a pen if it lacks any roof or shelter, otherwise it is called a ''stall'' and is part of a [[stable]]. A large fenced grazing area of many acres is called a ''pasture'', or, in some cases, ''rangeland''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Other regions==
Primitive pens in [[South Africa]] are called ''[[kraal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Richard|date=June 1986|title=The Prehistory of Stone Age Herders in the Cape Province of South Africa|url=|journal=Prehistoric Pastoralism|publisher=South African Archaeological Society|volume=5|pages=5–12|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise pen==
[[File:Exercise pen for dogs.jpg|thumb|Folding portable wire exercise pen]]
For pets, specialized folding fencing referred to as an '''exercise pen''', '''x-pen''', or '''ex pen''', is used to surround an area, usually outdoors but not always, in which the animals can freely move around. They are commonly used for dogs, such as to give puppies or adult dogs more space than [[dog crate]]s, but can also be used for rabbits and other animals. Exercise pens are usually made of sturdy wire, but can also be plastic or wood. 

Horses, during training, are often exercised in a [[round pen]], sometimes referred to as an exercise pen.

'''Philip Mayne Woodward''' (6 September 1919 – 30 January 2018) was a British mathematician, [[radar]] engineer and [[horologist]].  He has achieved notable success in all three fields. Before retirement, he was a Deputy Chief Scientific Officer at the [[Royal Radar Establishment|Royal Signals and Radar Establishment]] (RSRE) of the British Ministry of Defence in  [[Malvern, Worcestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;Lars Falk: ”Dedication: P. M. Woodward and the Ambiguity Function” (pp. xiii-xx in "Principles of Waveform Diversity and Design", edited by Michael Wicks, Eric Mokole, Shannon Blunt, Richard Schneible, Vincent Amuso, SciTech Publishing, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements in mathematics and engineering ==

Philip Woodward's career in the Scientific Civil Service spanned four decades. He was responsible for the software of one of the UK's first electronic computers ([[TREAC]])&lt;ref name=mraths-2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mraths.org.uk/?page_id=633 |title=1952 - TRE Automatic Computer, "TREAC" |publisher=Malvern Radar and Technology History Society |year=2016 |accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the UK's first solid state computer ([[Royal Radar Establishment Automatic Computer|RREAC]]). He is the author of the book ''Probability and Information Theory, with Applications to Radar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=P. M.|title=Probability and information theory with applications to radar|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=London|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, Philip Woodward developed a mathematical beam-shaping technique for radar antennae, which was later to become standard in the analysis of communication signals. His principal achievement in radar was to evaluate the ambiguities inherent in all radar signals and to show how [[Bayesian probability]] can be used as part of the design process to eliminate all but the wanted information the echoes might contain.

In 1956, Woodward’s work on radar [[information theory]] led Nobel Prize winning physicist [[John H. Van Vleck]] to invite him to give a postgraduate course on random processes at Harvard University. Professor [[E. T. Jaynes]] in  his posthumously  published book &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaynes|first=E. T.|title=Probability theory: The logic of science|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  recognized Woodward as having been "many years ahead of his time" and as having shown "prophetic insight into what was to come" in the application of probability and statistics to the recovery of data from noisy samples. In the 1960s Philip Woodward's computer software team in Malvern provided the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] with the [[ALGOL 68R]] compiler, the world's first implementation of the programming language [[ALGOL 68]], and provided the armed services with their first standard high-level programming language, [[Coral 66]], for the small military computers of the day.

His academic posts have included Honorary Professor in Electrical Engineering at the University of Birmingham and Visiting Professor in [[Cybernetics]] at the University of Reading. When in 2000 the Woodward Building was opened by [[Sir John Chisholm]] at [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency|DERA]] (now privatized as [[QinetiQ]]), guests were given complimentary clocks as souvenirs of the occasion and of Philip Woodward's horological interests.

In June 2005, the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] gave Woodward its first Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing him as an outstanding pioneer of Radar and for his work in precision mechanical [[horology]].&lt;ref name="raeng_award" /&gt; In 2009 he received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Dennis J. Picard Medal for Radar Technologies and Applications: “for pioneering work of fundamental importance in radar waveform design, including the [[ambiguity function|Woodward ambiguity function]], the standard tool for waveform and [[matched filter]] analysis.”&lt;ref name="ieee_award" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retired scientist given award|newspaper=Malvern Gazette|date=2 July 2009|url=http://www.malverngazette.co.uk/news/4470476.Retired_scientist_given_award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements in horology ==

In retirement Philip Woodward wrote another classic book, ''My Own Right Time'' &lt;ref name="MORT"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Philip|year=2006|title=My own right time: an exploration of clockwork design|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  fondly known as MORT, a record of his passion for horology.  Along with many other topics, MORT describes in detail the design of his clocks, including his masterpiece "W5".

Woodward contributed dozens of articles to horological periodicals over more than 30 years.  From his experience as a mathematician and analyst of complex systems, he has made major contributions to scientific horology, including the definitive analysis of balance springs and much work on the properties of pendulums.  In 2006 the [[British Horological Institute]] published a hard-cover collection of 63 articles with new notes by Dr. Woodward. The collection, ''Woodward on Time'',&lt;ref name="WOT"&gt;{{cite book|title=Woodward on time. A compilation of Philip Woodward’s horological writings|editor-last=Taylor|editor-first=Bill|publisher=[[British Horological Institute]] (BHI)|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally compiled by Bill Taylor, ASC. became instantly known as "WOT". It was very well received.

== W5 clock ==

"W5" was built in a small workshop with the simplest of tools, but displays an elegance of concept and design rarely seen in the history of the science.   It was acclaimed by [[Jonathan Betts]], the Senior Curator of Horology at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] as "the nearest approach to perfection by any mechanical timekeeper not employing a vacuum chamber".  Woodward built even the case, assembling it with intricate but invisible secret mitre joints.

The eminent horologist Anthony Randall carried on a long series of timekeeping trials of W5,  showing unprecedented accuracy over periods of more than 100 days.&lt;ref name="WOT" /&gt; Although the clock was widely celebrated, and Dr. Woodward published a series of ever-more-detailed articles on its construction to encourage others to carry its ideas forward,&lt;ref name="WOT" /&gt; no one completed another clock like it for more than twenty years.  Finally, in 2006 the Australian clockmaker David Walter (now of Buellton, California) succeeded in making a highly skeletonized version that while quite different in details, closely followed the basic Woodward design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(D)W5 free pendulum clock|url=http://www.davidwalter.com/dw5-free-pendulum-clock/|publisher=David Walter Timepieces|place=Buelltown, CA|website=davidwalter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal ==

Woodward was born on 6 September 1919 and educated at [[Blundell's School]] in [[Tiverton, Devon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blundells.org/obclub/obclub/where-are-they-now/military_woodward-p.htm|title=OBs in the Military: Philip Woodward|publisher=Old Blundellian Club|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Malvern, Worcestershire]], England, where he died on 30 January 2018 at the age of 98.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malverngazette.co.uk/announcements/deaths/deaths/15998574.Dr_Philip_Mayne_Woodward/ Dr Philip Mayne Woodward - Malvern Gavette]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gangnaengi.jpg|thumb|Puffed corn]]
'''Puffed grains''' have been made for centuries with the simplest methods like popping [[popcorn]]. Modern puffed grains are often created using high temperature, pressure, or [[Food extrusion|extrusion]].

People eat puffed grains in many ways, but it can be as simple as puffed grain alone and with sugar or salt for taste. Commercial products such as [[corn flakes]] and [[Corn Pops]] mix many ingredients into a homogeneous [[batter (cooking)|batter]]. The batter is then formed into shapes then toasted and/or extruded. This causes them to rise, but not puff or pop. Puffed grains are very healthful if plain, but when other ingredients are mixed with them they lose some of their previous health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;"Puffed Rice Nutrition." LIVESTRONG.COM. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puffed grains are popular as [[breakfast cereal]]s and in the form of [[rice cake]]s. While it is easy to recognize that cereals came from whole grains, the expansion factor for rice cakes is even greater, and the final product is somewhat more [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]].

==History==
The oldest puffed grain was found in west central New Mexico in 1948 and 1950. Ears of popcorn were found that were up to 4,000 years old. These pieces of puffed grain were smaller than a penny to two inches in size and can be made in a similar way to popping popcorn.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Popcorn." History of Popcorn. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern process of making puffed grains was invented by [[Alexander P. Anderson|Dr. Alexander P. Anderson]] in 1901. He was doing an experiment dealing with the effect of heat and pressure on corn starch granules where he put them in six glass tubes, sealed them, and put them in an oven until they changed color. When Dr. Anderson took them out and cracked them open an explosion happened, he had made the corn starch turn into a puffed, white mass.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Alexander P. Anderson - 1982 Inductee." Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame -. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr. Alexander’s invention of puffed grain was first introduced at the World’s Fair in St. Louis in 1904. The puffed grain was shot from a battery of eight guns and on a poster it was called “The Eighth Wonder of the World.”

High pressure puffed grain is created by placing whole grains under [[high pressure]] with [[steam]] in a containment vessel. When the vessel's seal is suddenly broken, the entrained steam then [[Flash evaporation|flash]]es and bloats the [[endosperm]] of the [[seed|kernel]], increasing its volume to many times its original size.

Puffed rice or other grains are occasionally found as street food in [[China]], [[Korea]] (called ''"ppeong twigi"'' 뻥튀기), and [[Japan]] (called ''"pon gashi"'' [[:ja:ポン菓子|ポン菓子]]), where hawkers implement the puffing process using an integrated pushcart/puffer featuring a rotating steel [[pressure chamber]] heated over an open flame. The great booming sound produced by the release of pressure serves as advertising.

Manufacturing puffed grain by venting a pressure chamber is essentially a batch process.  To achieve large-scale efficiencies, continuous-process equipment has been developed whereby the pre-cooked cereal is injected into a high pressure steam chamber.  It then exits the steam chamber via a [[Venturi effect#Venturi tubes|Venturi tube]] to an expansion chamber, where the puffed cereal is collected and conveyed to the next process step.  These devices, generally called stream puffing machines, were perfected in the latter half of the 20th century in Switzerland and Italy, but are now available from manufacturers in China as well.

A '''radar tracker''' is a component of a [[radar]] system, or an associated command and control (C2) system, that associates consecutive radar observations of the same target into [[Track (navigation)|tracks]].  It is particularly useful when the radar system is reporting data from several different targets or when it is necessary to combine the data from several different radars or other sensors.

== Role of the radar tracker ==
A classical rotating air surveillance radar system detects target echoes against a background of noise.  It reports these detections (known as "plots") in [[polar coordinates]] representing the range and bearing of the target.  In addition, noise in the radar receiver will occasionally exceed the detection threshold of the radar's [[Constant false alarm rate]] detector and be incorrectly reported as targets (known as [[false alarms]]).  The role of the radar tracker is to monitor consecutive updates from the radar system (which typically occur once every few seconds, as the antenna rotates) and to determine those sequences of plots belonging to the same target, whilst rejecting any plots believed to be false alarms. In addition, the radar tracker is able to use the sequence of plots to estimate the current speed and heading of the target.  When several targets are present, the radar tracker aims to provide one track for each target, with the track history often being used to indicate where the target has come from.

When multiple radar systems are connected to a single reporting post, a '''multiradar tracker''' is often used to monitor the updates from all of the radars and form tracks from the combination of detections.  In this configuration, the tracks are often more accurate than those formed from single radars, as a greater number of detections can be used to estimate the tracks.
In addition to associating plots, rejecting false alarms and estimating heading and speed, the radar tracker also acts as a filter, in which errors in the individual radar measurements are smoothed out.  In essence, the radar tracker fits a smooth curve to the reported plots and, if done correctly, can increase the overall accuracy of the radar system.
A '''multisensor tracker''' extends the concept of the multiradar tracker to allow the combination of reports from different types of sensor - typically [[radars]], [[secondary surveillance radar]]s (SSR), [[Identification Friend or Foe|identification friend or foe (IFF) systems]] and [[electronic support measures]] (ESM) data.

A radar track will typically contain the following information:

* Position (in two or three dimensions)
* Heading
* Speed
* Unique track number

In addition, and depending on the application or tracker sophistication, the track will also include:

* Civilian [[Secondary surveillance radar|SSR]] Modes A, C, S information
* Military [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]] Modes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 information
* Call sign information
* Track reliability or uncertainty information

== General approach ==
There are many different mathematical algorithms used for implementing a radar tracker, of varying levels of sophistication.  However, they all perform steps similar to the following every time the radar updates:

* Associate a radar plot with an existing track ([[#Plot to track association|plot to track association]])
* Update the track with this latest plot ([[#Track smoothing|track smoothing]])
* Spawn new tracks with any plots that are not associated with existing tracks ([[#Track initiation|track initiation]])
* Delete any tracks that have not been updated, or predict their new location based on the previous heading and speed ([[#Track maintenance|track maintenance]])

Perhaps the most important step is the updating of tracks with new plots.  All trackers will implicitly or explicitly take account of a number of factors during this stage, including:

* a model for how the radar measurements are related to the target coordinates
* the errors on the radar measurements
* a model of the target movement
* errors in the model of the target movement

Using these information, the radar tracker attempts to update the track by forming a weighted average of the current reported position from the radar (which has unknown errors) and the last predicted position of the target from the tracker (which also has unknown errors).  The tracking problem is made particularly difficult for targets with unpredictable movements (i.e. unknown target movement models), non-Gaussian measurement or model errors, non-linear relationships between the measured quantities and the desired target coordinates, detection in the presence of non-uniformly distributed clutter, missed detections or false alarms.  In the real world, a radar tracker typically faces a combination of all of these effects; this has led to the development of an increasingly sophisticated set of algorithms to resolve the problem.  Due to the need to form radar tracks in real time, usually for several hundred targets at once, the deployment of radar tracking algorithms has typically been limited by the available computational power.

== Plot to track association ==
In this step of the processing, the radar tracker seeks to determine which plots should be used to update which tracks.  In many approaches, a given plot can only be used to update one track.  However, in other approaches a plot can be used to update several tracks, recognising the uncertainty in knowing to which track the plot belongs.  Either way, the first step in the process is to update all of the existing tracks to the current time by predicting their new position based on the most recent state estimate (e.g. position, heading, speed, acceleration, etc.) and the assumed target motion model (e.g. constant velocity, constant acceleration, etc.).  Having updated the estimates, it is possible to try to associate the plots to tracks.

This can be done in a number of ways:

* By defining an "acceptance gate" around the current track location and then selecting:
** the closest plot in the gate to the predicted position, or
** the strongest plot in the gate
* By a statistical approach, such as the [[Probabilistic Data Association Filter]] (PDAF) or the [[Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter]] (JPDAF) that choose the most probable location of plot through a statistical combination of all the likely plots.  This approach has been shown to be good in situations of high [[Clutter (radar)|radar clutter]].

Once a track has been associated with a plot, it moves to the '''track smoothing''' stage, where the track prediction and associated plot are combined to provide a new, smoothed estimate of the target location.

Having completed this process, a number of plots will remain unassociated to existing tracks and a number of tracks will remain without updates.  This leads to the steps of '''track initiation''' and '''track maintenance'''.

== Track initiation ==
Track initiation is the process of creating a new radar track from an unassociated radar plot.  When the tracker is first switched on, all the initial radar plots are used to create new tracks, but once the tracker is running, only those plots that couldn't be used to update an existing track are used to spawn new tracks.  Typically a new track is given the status of '''tentative''' until plots from subsequent radar updates have been successfully associated with the new track.  Tentative tracks are not shown to the operator and so they provide a means of preventing false tracks from appearing on the screen - at the expense of some delay in the first reporting of a track.  Once several updates have been received, the track is '''confirmed''' and displayed to the operator.  The most common criterion for promoting a tentative track to a confirmed track is the "M-of-N rule", which states that during the last N radar updates, at least M plots must have been associated with the tentative track - with M=3 and N=5 being typical values.  More sophisticated approaches may use a statistical approach in which a track becomes confirmed when, for instance, its covariance matrix falls to a given size.

== Track maintenance ==
Track maintenance is the process in which a decision is made about whether to end the life of a track.  If a track was not associated with a plot during the plot to track association phase, then there is a chance that the target may no longer exist (for instance, an aircraft may have landed or flown out of radar cover).  Alternatively, however, there is a chance that the radar may have just failed to see the target at that update, but will find it again on the next update.  Common approaches to deciding on whether to terminate a track include:

* If the target was not seen for the past M consecutive update opportunities (typically M=3 or so)
* If the target was not seen for the past M out of N most recent update opportunities
* If the target's track uncertainty (covariance matrix) has grown beyond a certain threshold

== Track smoothing ==
In this important step, the latest track prediction is combined with the associated plot to provide a new, improved estimate of the target state as well as a revised estimate of the errors in this prediction.  There is a wide variety of algorithms, of differing complexity and computational load, that can be used for this process.

===Alpha-beta tracker===
An early tracking approach, using an [[alpha beta filter]], that assumed fixed covariance errors and a constant-speed, non-maneuvering target model to update tracks.

===Kalman filter===
The role of the [[Kalman Filter]] is to take the current known state (i.e. position, heading, speed and possibly acceleration) of the target and predict the new state of the target at the time of the most recent radar measurement.  In making this prediction, it also updates its estimate of its own uncertainty (i.e. errors) in this prediction.  It then forms a weighted average of this prediction of state and the latest measurement of state, taking account of the known measurement errors of the radar and its own uncertainty in the target motion models. Finally, it updates its estimate of its uncertainty of the state estimate.  A key assumption in the mathematics of the Kalman filter is that measurement equations (i.e. the relationship between the radar measurements and the target state) and the state equations (i.e. the equations for predicting a future state based on the current state) are [[linear]].

The Kalman filter assumes that the measurement errors of the radar, and the errors in its target motion model, and the errors in its state estimate are all zero-mean with known covariance.  This means that all of these sources of errors can be represented by a [[covariance matrix]].  The mathematics of the Kalman filter is therefore concerned with propagating these covariance matrices and using them to form the weighted sum of prediction and measurement.

In situations where the target motion conforms well to the underlying model, there is a tendency of the Kalman filter to become "overconfident" of its own predictions and to start to ignore the radar measurements.  If the target then manoeuvres, the filter will fail to follow the manoeuvre.  It is therefore common practice when implementing the filter to arbitrarily increase the magnitude of the state estimate covariance matrix slightly at each update to prevent this.

===Multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT)===
The MHT allows a track to be updated by more than one plot at each update, spawning multiple possible tracks.  As each radar update is received every possible track can be potentially updated with every new update.  Over time, the track branches into many possible directions.  The MHT calculates the probability of each potential track and typically only reports the most probable of all the tracks. For reasons of finite computer memory and computational power, the MHT typically includes some approach for deleting the most unlikely potential track updates.  The MHT is designed for situations in which the target motion model is very unpredictable, as all potential track updates are considered.  For this reason, it is popular for problems of ground target tracking in [[Airborne Ground Surveillance]] (AGS) systems.

===Interacting multiple model (IMM)===
The IMM is an estimator which can either be used by MHT or JPDAF. IMM uses two or more Kalman filters which run in parallel, each using a different model for target motion or errors.  The IMM forms an optimal weighted sum of the output of all the filters and is able to rapidly adjust to target maneuvers.
While MHT or JPDAF handles the association and track maintenance, an IMM helps MHT or JPDAF in obtaining a filtered estimate of the target position.

== Nonlinear tracking algorithms ==
Non-linear tracking algorithms use a [[Non-linear filter]] to cope with the situation where the measurements have a non-linear relationship to the final track coordinates, where the errors are non-Gaussian, or where the motion update model is non-linear.  The most common non-linear filters are:

*the Extended Kalman filter
*the Unscented Kalman filter
*the Particle filter

===Extended Kalman filter (EKF)===
The [[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]] is an extension of the Kalman filter to cope with cases where the relationship between the radar measurements and the track coordinates, or the track coordinates and the motion model, is non-linear.  In this case, the relationship between the measurements and the state is of the form h = f(x) (where h is the vector of measurements, x is the target state and f(.) is the function relating the two).  Similarly, the relationship between the future state and the current state is of the form x(t+1) = g(x(t)) (where x(t) is the state at time t and g(.) is the function that predicts the future state).  To handle these non-linearities, the EKF linearises the two non-linear equations using the first term of the [[Taylor series]] and then treats the problem as the standard linear Kalman filter problem.  Although conceptually simple, the filter can easily diverge (i.e. gradually perform more and more badly) if the state estimate about which the equations are linearised is poor.

The unscented Kalman filter and particle filters are attempts to overcome the problem of linearising the equations.

===Unscented Kalman filter (UKF)===
The [[Kalman_filter#Unscented_Kalman_filter|UKF]] attempts to improve on the EKF by removing the need to linearise the measurement and state equations. It avoids linearization by representing the mean and covariance information in the form of a set of points, called sigma points.  These points, which represent a distribution with specified mean and covariance, are then propagated directly through the non-linear equations, and the resulting five updated samples are then used to calculate a new mean and variance.  This approach then suffers none of the problems of divergence due to poor linearisation and yet retains the overall computational simplicity of the EKF.

===Particle filter===
The [[particle filter]] could be considered as a generalisation of the UKF.  It makes no assumptions about the distributions of the errors in the filter and neither does it require the equations to be linear.  Instead it generates a large number of random potential states ("particles") and then propagates this "cloud of particles" through the equations, resulting in a different distribution of particles at the output.  The resulting distribution of particles can then be used to calculate a mean or variance, or whatever other statistical measure is required.  The resulting statistics are used to generate the random sample of particles for the next iteration.  The particle filter is notable in its ability to handle multi-modal distributions (i.e. distributions where the [[Probability density function|PDF]] has more than one peak).  However, it is computationally very intensive and is currently unsuitable for most real-world, real-time applications.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim is often made, but I would like to see it substantiated by a published study with empirical results.|date=May 2010}}

== Early life ==
Born on September 24, 1937, to Milton and Pauline Zinn, Ray Zinn grew up on a cattle ranch in the farming community of El Centro, CA. The eldest of 11 children, including six sisters and four brothers, Zinn was raised Mormon, and a strong work ethic was instilled at an early age by his parents. When he was four, his mother sent him to the store to lug home heavy bottles of milk. He had a driver's license at 13 to chauffeur his siblings in a Ford pickup and work with water management officials in the dead of night to assure the family ranch received their allocation. "Work becomes instilled in you from an early age. So if somebody asks me how 'success' is spelled, I tell them it's spelled W-O-R-K."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.investors.com/management-leaders-and-success/080900-351718-entrepreneur-raymond-zinn-his-hard-work-and-independence-built-chip-empire.htm|title=Entrepreneur Raymond Zinn His Hard Work And Independence Built Chip Empire|date=2000|accessdate=|website=Investors Business Daily|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ray Zinn - Youth Gymnast.JPG|thumb|Ray Zinn, high school, gymnastics pose]]Throughout his high school and college years, Zinn was an accomplished gymnast, hurdler and member of the track and field team.

During his junior year in college, he told his father he was quitting school and his father locked him naked, wrapped in a paper towel diaper, in the ranch office restroom for six hours. Zinn's father was giving his son a lesson about what it meant to cut short his education. "He was saying, 'Well, if you're going to quit school, you're going out in the world the way you came in.' He wanted me to think about living with decisions," Zinn said. Ray Zinn changed his mind and finished college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tough Things First: Leadership Lessons from Silicon Valley's Longest Serving CEO|last=Zinn|first=Ray|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2015|isbn=1259584186|location=United States|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1960 with a BS in Industrial Management, and an MS in Business Administration from [[San Jose State University]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.micrel.com/index.php/corporate/governancedirectors.html#board_dir|title=Micrel Corporation|date=2015|accessdate=|website=Micrel Corporate Governance|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
Before College, Zinn started at a janitorial business, working through sewage and waste on his spare time. He started out with a few years of experience, and quickly learned the way of maintaining hygiene. Although he started out with these humble beginnings, he wanted to be less like his father. His father and family had a long line of doing sanitation &lt;ref&gt;https://www.howardzinn.org/about/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; services throughout the bay area.

After college, Zinn moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where high-tech companies were gaining traction. His interest in the space program and the desire to become an astronaut landed him a position at rocket motor manufacturing, United Technologies. Later, Zinn became interested in semiconductors through his father-in-law, who worked at [[Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation]] and joined the company as an engineer in 1963.

He left Fairchild in 1968 and subsequently held various executive management positions at several semiconductor-related companies, including [[Teledyne Inc.]] (1966–69), Nortek Inc. (1971-73) and Electromask TRE (1973–76). During this period, and later through Micrel, Zinn worked nearly every aspect of semiconductor management; sales, marketing, finance, accounting, wafer fab operations, assembly, packaging, test, quality assurance, and design.

While working as a sales representative at Electromask, Zinn conceptualized the [[Stepper|Wafer Stepper]] and sold it, before it had been designed or engineered, to Texas Instruments. According to Zinn, this unauthorized selling of equipment that had not yet been designed caused his boss at Electromask to tell him "You really shouldn’t work for anybody else." Due to Electromask's partnership with IBM and that company's commitment to e-beam technology, Electromask never sought or acquired the patents for the Wafer Stepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough Things First: Leadership Lessons from Silicon Valley's Longest Serving CEO|url=http://www.ecomtechnology.com/2015/10/23/tough-things-first-leadership-lessons-ray-zinn/|website=eComtechnology|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his friend Warren Muller, Zinn founded semiconductor company Micrel in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.investors.com/management-leaders-and-success/080900-351718-entrepreneur-raymond-zinn-his-hard-work-and-independence-built-chip-empire.htm|title=Investor's Business Daily|last=Tsuruoka|first=Doug|date=August 9, 2000|work=Entrepreneur Raymond Zinn His Hard Work And Independence Built Chip Empire|access-date=November 12, 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair used $300,000 in savings and bank loans to found the company, eschewing the financial support of venture capitalists. "I wanted control of my destiny and to do it my way." Zinn's desire to remain independent led him at one time to personally guarantee $4 million in bank loans to keep Micrel afloat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Zinn and Micrel - Interesting Character|url=http://analogfootsteps.blogspot.com/2014/10/ray-zinn-and-micrel-interesting.html|website=Analog Footsteps|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Zinn's leadership, Micrel was profitable in its first year, and for 36 of its 37 years. Zinn credits this success to the company's disciplined focus on profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McKeown|first=Greg|date=Apr 15, 2014|title=Essentialism|url=http://gregmckeown.com/essentialism-the-disciplined-pursuit-of-less/|publisher=Crown Business|isbn=0804137382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micrel was also credited with having the lowest employee turn-over in the semiconductor industry and, though it is an unofficial measure, the highest "boomerang" employee rate, the rate at which employees who leave the company return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Like To Do The Tough Things First|url=http://www.anupartha.com/insights/transformationalleadersstories/i-like-to-do-the-tough-things-first/|website=AnuPartha, Discovering Leaders|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an investor "roadshow" promoting Micrel's [[Initial Public Offering|initial public offering]] in London, England, Zinn suffered a [[Central retinal vein occlusion|retinal vein occlusion]] which reduced his vision to 20/400, making Zinn legally blind. Zinn resisted turning control of Micrel over to another CEO. Instead, Zinn took advantage of every technology he could to compensate for his limited eyesight. Zinn continued to lead Micrel for another 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough Things First: Leadership Lessons from Silicon Valley's Longest Serving CEO|url=http://www.ecomtechnology.com/2015/10/23/tough-things-first-leadership-lessons-ray-zinn/|website=eComtechnology|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinn established a unique corporate culture at Micrel, which included unusual guidelines such as his "no swearing" policy. Swearing or using condescending language at the company was banned. Workers were also urged to be honest, show integrity and respect others at the company. "We believe that work should be an extension of the home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Zinn and Micrel - Interesting Character|url=http://analogfootsteps.blogspot.com/2014/10/ray-zinn-and-micrel-interesting.html|website=Analog Footsteps|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micrel's humanistic corporate culture has been referred "an almost spiritual approach to doing business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I Like To Do The Tough Things First|url=http://www.anupartha.com/insights/transformationalleadersstories/i-like-to-do-the-tough-things-first/|website=Any Partha, Discovering Leaders|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Micrel was sold to [[Microchip Technology]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micrel, one of Silicon Valley's oldest chip firms, agrees to sell to Microchip Technology|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_28071844/micrel-one-silicon-valleys-oldest-chip-firms-agrees|website=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn was profiled in Sand Hill's leadership series because of the leadership ability demonstrated throughout his tenure as founder and CEO of Micrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goolsby|first1=Kathleen|title=Leadership Advice of Micrel CEO Ray Zinn, a "Man for all Seasons" in Business|url=http://sandhill.com/article/leadership-advice-of-micrel-ceo-ray-zinn-a-man-for-all-seasons-in-business|website=Sand Hill|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions and patents==
One of Zinn's most significant inventions includes a method allowing radio devices to operate without the need to synchronize a [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] with a [[Transmitter]]. Using [[Frequency hopping]]  (an idea originally co-created by [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[George Antheil]]) and sweep modes, this method is primarily applied in low data rate wireless applications such as utility metering, machine and equipment monitoring and metering, and [[remote control]]. In 2006 Zinn received {{US patent| 6,996,399}} for his "''Wireless device and method using frequency hopping and sweep modes''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wireless device and method using frequency hopping and sweep mode, US Patent 6,996,399|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,996,399.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,996,399&amp;RS=PN/6,996,399|website=USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinn also invented a method to quickly [[Encoder|encode]] and/or decode RF signals. This technology forms the core of a number of devices, including (but not limited to) garage door openers and accompanying remote access; security or alarm systems and a remote access to activate and deactivate the security system; and low power, [[two-way radio]] communication devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apparatus and method for encoding signals, US Patent 7,224,727|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7,224,727.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7,224,727&amp;RS=PN/7,224,727|website=USPTO Patent Full-Text and Image Database|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response to works==

[[T.J. Rodgers]], President &amp; CEO, [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress Semiconductor Corp]]
"Tough Things First is not a typical business book about a market success or effective business methods. It is about the success of one Silicon Valley startup company, Micrel, which has been run profitably by the same CEO/founder for 36 years. It is about how a founder's dedication to basic principles is required to make any startup successful. The precise recipe for success may change—for example, my 32-year-old company, Cypress Semiconductor, used venture funding, while Zinn preached and achieved financial independence—but Zinn shows how startups must have and truly practice their core values to succeed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough Things First: Leadership Lessons from Silicon Valley's Longest Serving CEO|url=http://www.ecomtechnology.com/2015/10/23/tough-things-first-leadership-lessons-ray-zinn/|website=eComtechnology|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The disciplined pursuit of what is essential is ten times harder than the undisciplined pursuit of the nonessential but it is a hundred times more valuable. This is brilliantly illustrated in Tough Things First."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tough Things First: Leadership Lessons from Silicon Valley's Longest Serving CEO|url=http://www.ecomtechnology.com/2015/10/23/tough-things-first-leadership-lessons-ray-zinn/|website=eComtechnology|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed Wilcox, President of [[Southern Virginia University]] said of ''Tough Things First'' "Many business self-help books are by experts who study and talk to the people who actually do it, but have not lived it themselves. It's not in their blood. This is very different. I have not seen a better, more practical, more realistic, more helpful, or more engaging invitation to entrepreneurship."

}}

'''Scandiobabingtonite''' was first discovered in the Montecatini granite quarry near [[Baveno]], Italy in a [[pegmatite]] cavity. Though found in pegmatites, the crystals of scandiobabingtonite are sub-millimeter sized, and are tabular shaped. Scandiobabingtonite was the sixth naturally occurring mineral discovered with the rare earth element [[scandium]], and grows around [[babingtonite]], with which it is [[isostructural]], hence the namesake. It is also referred to as scandian babingtonite. The ideal chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH).&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scandiobabingtonite is found in association with [[orthoclase]], [[quartz]], light blue [[albite]], [[stilbite]], [[fluorite]], and [[mica]]. When found with these minerals, the scandiobabingtonite crystals are emplanted on the surface of the other minerals. It also occurs as growth around green-black prismatic crystals of babingtonite. The samples of scandiobabingtonite that have been discovered have shown that they start out growing from a seed of babingtonite crystal. This is how scandiobabingtonite gets its chemical structure. The starting seed of babingtonite is still present in the center of the resulting crystal and can be detected with optical and chemical studies.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt; Scandiobabingtonite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in very small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; It is one of thirteen naturally occurring minerals where scandium is a dominant member. The other scandium minerals are [[bazzite]], [[cascandite]], [[hetftetjernite]], [[jervisite]], [[juonniite]], [[kolbeckite]], [[kristiansenite]], [[magbasite]], [[oftedalite]], [[pretulite]], [[thortveitite]], and [[titanowodginite]].&lt;ref name=scandium /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmineral&gt;webmineral.com, 2015, Mineral species Containing Scandium (Sc): http://webmineral.com/chem/Chem-Sc.shtml#.VmCC6s6przL (accessed December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Scandium can also concentrate in other minerals, such as in [[Mafic|ferromagnesian]] minerals, [[aluminum phosphate]] minerals, [[meteor]]ic minerals, and other minerals containing rare earth elements, but it occurs in trace amounts.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is a colorless or lightly gray-green colored transparent mineral with a glassy or [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous luster]]. It exhibits a hardness of 6 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. Scandiobabingtonite occurs as short, prismatic crystals that are slightly elongated on the [001] [[Miller index|axis]] which gives it a tabular or platy shape. Its crystals are characterized by the {010}, {001}, {110}, {1-10}, and {101} [[Miller Index|faces]].  Scandiobabingtonite is brittle and shows perfect cleavage along the {001} and {1-10} planes. The measured density is 3.24 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. It exhibits a 2V&lt;sub&gt;(measured)&lt;/sub&gt;=64(2)°, strong dispersion with r&gt;v, and displays strong [[pleochroism]] with colors ranging from pink (γ') to green(α'). The extinction angle along the (110) is 6°. Z:Φ=-250°, ρ=47°; Y:Φ=146°, ρ=75°; X:Φ=42°, ρ=47°.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[isostructural]] with babingtonite, and has the same chemical properties as well. It is an [[inosilicate]] with 5-periodic single chains.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scandium replaces the [[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in babingtonite in six-fold coordination. The empirical chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is (Ca&lt;sub&gt;1.71&lt;/sub&gt;,Na&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;,Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;,Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.98&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;5.09&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14.00&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;1.00&lt;/sub&gt;. Simplified, the formula is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==X-ray crystallography==
Scandiobabingtonite is in the triclinic crystal system, with space group P1. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.536(2) Å, b=11.734(2) Å, c=6.748(2) Å, α=91.70(2)°, β=93.86(2)°, γ=104.53(2)°. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. The difference in dimensions is caused by the replacement of iron with scandium in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-centered octahedra. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-O distance measures as 2.048 Å, while the Sc-O distance is 2.092 Å. This equates to a slightly larger octahedra in scandiobabingtonite than babingtonite.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">A '''smart bullet''' is a bullet that is able to do something other than simply follow its given trajectory, such as turning, changing speed or sending data.

==Types of smart bullets==
First efforts in this area were the 1980 NATO 'Copperhead' 155mm artillery shell project using mid flight adjustment onto target reflected laser guidance. This was shelved.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

In 2008 the [[EXACTO]] program began under [[DARPA]] to develop a "fire and forget" smart sniper rifle system including a guided smart bullet and improved scope.  The exact technologies of this smart bullet have not been released.  EXACTO was test fired in 2014 and 2015 and results showing the bullet alter course to correct its path to its target were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EXACTO Guided Bullet Demonstrates Repeatable Performance against Moving Targets|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2015-04-27|accessdate=4 May 2018|work=www.darpa.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Sandia National Laboratories]] announced a self-guided bullet prototype that could track a target illuminated with a [[laser designator]]. The bullet is capable of updating its position 30 times a second and hitting targets over a mile away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/bullet Sandia’s self-guided bullet prototype can hit target a mile away]&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2016, Russia revealed it was developing a similar "smart bullet" weapon designed to hit targets at a distance of up to {{convert|10|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kitup.military.com/2016/07/russians-launch-smart-bullet-effort-in-the-wake-of-u-s-program.html Russians Launch Smart Bullet Effort in the Wake of U.S. Program] - Kitup.Military.com, 20 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tass.com/defense/889242 Russia launches ‘smart bullet’ testing in guided flight regime]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing trajectory==
One kind of smart bullet is a projectile that is capable of changing its course during flight. One use of this would be to enable soldiers to stay behind protective cover and shoot around corners. One implementation uses a [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]] and micro [[gyroscope|gyro]] to control the bullet.&lt;ref name="patent6422507"&gt;"[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6422507.html Smart Bullet Patent #6422507]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navigating==
Honeywell Aerospace has produced [[inertial measurement unit]]s based on [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] and microelectronics technologies that it claims can survive the shock of being fired out of a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honeywell.com/sites/portal?smap=aerospace&amp;page=Missles_Munitions3&amp;theme=T5&amp;catID=C47E27B3A-58A6-A2E2-09FE-769AD775C886&amp;id=H5AA6B1BD-95B2-AEA7-C62E-C28BC3E3EF73&amp;sel=5&amp;c=n |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708154627/http://www.honeywell.com/sites/portal?smap=aerospace&amp;page=Missles_Munitions3&amp;theme=T5&amp;catID=C47E27B3A-58A6-A2E2-09FE-769AD775C886&amp;id=H5AA6B1BD-95B2-AEA7-C62E-C28BC3E3EF73&amp;sel=5&amp;c=n |archivedate=2009-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Transmitting data==
Another smart bullet is one that can transmit data about the location into which it has been fired. A prototype has been created by researchers at the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], [[United States|USA]] with funding from [[Lockheed Martin]].&lt;ref name="newsci"&gt;"[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn5054-smart-bullet-reports-back-wirelessly.html Smart bullet reports back wirelessly]" by Will Knight in NewScientist, May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The bullet (projectile) has a sensor inside of it that can send wireless data up to 70 meters.

==Limiting range==
Another smart bullet is one that self-destructs within a limited range.  This would be used to minimize collateral damage of a bullet in case of a miss.  For example, hunting near a populated area.  This would involve either change in course into the ground, or near vaporization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13055">A '''software map''' represents static, dynamic, and evolutionary information of [[software system]]s and their [[software development process]]es by means of 2D or 3D map-oriented [[information visualization]]. It constitutes a fundamental concept and tool in [[software visualization]], [[software analytics]], and [[software diagnosis]]. Its primary applications include risk analysis for and monitoring of [[code quality]], team activity, or software development progress &lt;ref&gt;Monitoring Code Quality and Development Activity by Software Maps Johannes Bohnet and Döllner, Jürgen. In: Proceedings of the IEEE ACM ICSE Workshop on Managing Technical Debt, pp. 9-16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and, generally, improving effectiveness of software engineering with respect to all related artifacts, processes, and stakeholders throughout the [[software engineering]] process and [[software maintenance]].

== Motivation and concepts ==
Software maps are applied in the context of [[software engineering]]: Complex, long-term [[software development]] projects are commonly faced by manifold difficulties such as the friction between completing system features and, at the same time, obtaining a high degree of [[code quality]] and [[software quality]] to ensure [[software maintenance]] of the system in the future. 
In particular, "Maintaining complex software systems tends to be costly because developers spend a significant part of their time with trying to understand the system’s structure and behavior."&lt;ref&gt;J. Bohnet: ''Visualization of Execution Traces and its Application to Software Maintenance''. PhD thesis, Hasso-Plattner-Institut, University of Potsdam, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The key idea of software maps is to cope with that challenge and optimization problems by providing effective communication means to close the communication gap among the various stakeholders and information domains within software development projects and obtaining insights in the sense of [[information visualization]].

Software maps take advantage of well-defined cartographic [[map]] techniques using the virtual [[3D city models|3D city model]] metaphor&lt;ref&gt;R. Wettel, M. Lanza: ''Visualizing Software Systems as Cities''. 4th IEEE international Workshop on Visualizing Software for Understanding and Analysis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to express the underlying complex, abstract information space. The metaphor is required "since software has no physical shape, there is no natural mapping of software to a two-dimensional space".&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuhn , P. Loretan , O. Nierstrasz: ''Consistent Layout for Thematic Software Maps'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Software maps are non-spatial [[map]]s that have to convert the hierarchy data and its attributes into a spatial representation.

== Applications ==
Software maps generally allow for comprehensible and effective communication of course, risks, and costs of software development projects to various stakeholders such as management and development teams. 
They communicate the status of applications and systems currently being developed or further developed to project leaders and management at a glance. "A key aspect for this decision making is that software maps provide the structural context required for correct interpretation of these performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;''D. Limberger et al.: ''Interactive Software Maps for Web-Based Source Code Analysis''. Proceedings of the International Web3D Conference, ACM, pp. 8, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As an instrument of communication, software maps act as open, transparent information spaces which enable priorities of code quality and the creation of new functions to be balanced against one another and to decide upon and implement necessary measures to improve the [[software development process]].

For example, they facilitate decisions as to where in the code an increase of quality would be beneficial both for speeding up current development activities and for reducing risks of future maintenance problems.

Due to their high degree of expressiveness (e.g., information density) and their instantaneous, automated generation, the maps additionally serve to reflect the current status of system and development processes, bridging an essential information gap between management and development teams, improve awareness about the status, and serve as early risk detection instrument.

== Contents ==
Software maps are based on objective information as determined by the [[KPI driven code analysis]] as well as by imported information from [[software repository]] systems, information from the [[source code]]s, or [[software development tool]]s and [[programming tool]]s. In particular, software maps are not bound to a specific [[programming language]], [[modeling language]], or [[software development process]] model.

Software maps use the hierarchy of the software implementation artifacts such as [[source code]] files as base to build a [[tree mapping]], i.e., a rectangular area that represents the whole hierarchy, subdividing the area into rectangular sub-areas. A software map, informally speaking, looks similar to a virtual [[3D city model]], whereby artifacts of the software system appear as virtual, rectangular 3D buildings or towers, which are placed according to their position in the software implementation hierarchy.

Software maps can express and combine information about software development, software quality, and system dynamics by mapping that information onto visual variables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/innovis/uploads/Publications/Publications/Carpendale_visual_variables.pdf |title=Considering Visual Variables as a Basis for Information Visualization}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the tree map elements such as footprint size, height, color or texture. They can systematically be specified, automatically generated, and organized by templates.

== Mapping software system example ==
Software maps "combine thematic information about software development processes (evolution), software quality, structure, and dynamics and display that information in a cartographic manner".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: ''Extending Recommendation Systems with Software Maps''. Proceedings of the 3rd International ICSE Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE), IEEE Computer Society, pp. 92-96, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 
* The height of a virtual building can be proportional to the complexity of the code unit (e.g., single or combined [[software metric]]s).
* The ground area of a virtual 3D building can be proportional to the number of lines of code in the module or (e.g., non-comment lines-of-code NCLOC).
* The color can express the current development status, i.e., how many developers are changing/editing the code unit.

With this exemplary configuration, the software map shows crucial points in the source code with relations to aspects of the software development process. For example, it becomes obvious at a glance what to change in order to:
* implement changes quickly;
* evaluate quickly the impact of changes in one place on functionality elsewhere;
* reduce entanglements that lead to uncontrolled processes in the application;
* find errors faster;
* discover and eliminate bad programming style.

Software maps represent key tools in the scope of automated software diagnosis [http://www.softwarediagnostics.com software diagnostics].

== As business intelligence tools and recommendation systems ==
Software maps can be used, in particular, as analysis and presentation tool of [[business intelligence]] systems, specialized in the analysis of software related data. Furthermore, software maps "serve as recommendation systems for software engineering".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Trümper, Jürgen Döllner: ''Extending Recommendation Systems with Software Maps''. Proceedings of the 3rd International ICSE Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE), IEEE Computer Society, pp. 92-96, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software maps are not limited by software-related information: They can include any hierarchical system information as well, for example, maintenance information about complex technical artifacts.

== Visualization techniques ==
Software maps are investigated in the domain of [[software visualization]]. The visualization of software maps is commonly based on [[tree mapping]], "a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures"&lt;ref&gt;B. Johnson, B. Sneiderman: ''Tree-maps: a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures''. Proc. of IEEE VIS, 284–291, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; or other hierarchy mapping approaches.

=== Layout algorithms ===
To construct software maps, different layout approaches are used to generate the basic spatial mapping of components such as: 
* Tree-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy into a recursively nested rectangular area.
* Voronoi-map algorithms that initially map the software hierarchy by generating a [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi]] map.

=== Layout stability ===
The spatial arrangement computed by layouts such as defined by tree maps strictly depends on the hierarchy. If software maps have to be generated frequently for an evolving or changing system, the usability of software maps is affected by non-stable layouts, that is, minor changes to the hierarchy may cause significant changes to the layout.

In contrast to regular Voronoi treemap algorithms, which do not provide deterministic layouts, layout algorithm for Voronoi treemaps can be extended to provides a high degree of layout similarity for varying hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Schmechel et al.: ''Visualization of Varying Hierarchies by Stable Layout of Voronoi Treemaps''. Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications (IVAPP 2014), SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, pp. 50-58, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar approaches exist for the tree-map based case.

== History ==
Software maps methods and techniques belong the scientific displine of [[Software visualization]] and [[information visualization]]. They form a key concept and technique within the fields of [[software diagnosis]]. They have applications also in [[software mining]] and [[software analytics]]. Software maps have been extensively developed and researched by, e.g., at the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] for IT systems engineering, in particular for large-scale, complex IT systems and applications.

[[Image:Spallation.gif|thumb|Spallation as a result of impact can occur with or without penetration of the impacting object. Click on image for animation.]]  
{{Nuclear physics}}

'''Spallation''' is a process in which fragments of material ([[spall]]) are ejected from a body due to impact or stress. In the context of [[impact (mechanics)|impact mechanics]] it describes ejection or vaporization of material from a target during impact by a [[projectile]]. In [[Planetary science|planetary physics]], spallation describes [[meteor]]itic impacts on a planetary surface and the effects of a [[stellar wind]] on a [[planetary atmosphere]]. In the context of [[mining]] or [[geology]], spallation can refer to pieces of rock breaking off a [[rock face]] due to the internal stresses in the rock; it commonly occurs on [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] walls. In the context of [[anthropology]], spallation is a process used to make stone tools such as [[arrowhead]]s by [[knapping]]. In [[nuclear physics]], spallation is the process in which a heavy nucleus emits a large number of [[nucleon]]s as a result of being hit by a high-energy [[subatomic particle|particle]], thus greatly reducing its [[atomic weight]].

==Spallation in solid mechanics==
Spallation can occur when a tensile stress wave propagates through a material and can be observed in flat plate impact tests. It is caused by an internal [[cavitation]] due to stresses, which are generated by the interaction of stress waves, exceeding the local [[tensile strength]] of materials. A fragment or multiple fragments will be created on the free end of the plate. This fragment known as "[[spall]]" acts as a secondary projectile with velocities that can be as high as one third of the stress wave speed on the material. This type of failure is typically an effect of high explosive squash head ([[High-explosive squash head|HESH]]) charges.

==Laser spallation==
Laser induced spallation is a recent experimental technique developed to understand the [[adhesion]] of [[thin films]] with [[wafer (electronics)|substrate]]s. A high energy pulsed [[laser]] (typically [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]]) is used to create a [[compressive stress]] pulse in the [[wafer (electronics)|substrate]] wherein it propagates and reflects as a tensile wave at the free boundary. This tensile pulse spalls/peels the thin film while propagating towards the substrate. Using theory of [[wave propagation]] in solids it is possible to extract the interface strength. The stress pulse created in this example is usually around 3-8 [[nanoseconds]] in duration while its magnitude varies as a function of [[laser]] fluence. Due to the non-contact application of load, this technique is very well suited to spall ultra-[[thin films]] (1 micrometre in thickness or less). It is also possible to mode convert a longitudinal stress wave into a [[shear stress]] using a pulse shaping prism and achieve shear spallation.

==Nuclear spallation==
:''See also [[Cosmic ray spallation]]''
Nuclear spallation occurs naturally in [[Earth's atmosphere]] owing to the impacts of [[cosmic ray]]s, and also on the surfaces of bodies in space such as [[meteorite]]s and the [[Moon]]. Evidence of cosmic ray spallation (also known as "spoliation") is seen on outer surfaces of bodies, and gives a means of measuring the length of time of exposure. The composition of the cosmic rays themselves also indicates that they have suffered spallation before reaching Earth, because the proportion of light elements such as Li, B, and Be in them exceeds average cosmic abundances; these elements in the cosmic rays were evidently formed from spallation of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and perhaps silicon in the cosmic ray sources or during their lengthy travel here. ''Cosmogenic'' [[isotopes]] of [[aluminium]], [[beryllium]], [[chlorine]], [[iodine]] and [[neon]], formed by spallation of terrestrial elements under cosmic ray bombardment, have been detected on Earth.

Nuclear spallation is one of the processes by which a [[particle accelerator]] may be used to produce a beam of [[neutron]]s. A particle beam consisting of protons at around 1 GeV are shot into a target consisting of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[tantalum]], [[lead]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psi.ch/bsq/spallation-target |title=Spallation Target &amp;#124; Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) |website=Psi.ch |date= |accessdate=2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or another heavy metal. The target nucleii are excited and upon deexcitation, 20 to 30 neutrons are expelled per nucleus. Although this is a far more expensive way of producing neutron beams than by a [[chain reaction]] of [[nuclear fission]] in a [[nuclear reactor]], it has the advantage that the beam can be pulsed with relative ease. Furthermore the energetic cost of one spallation neutron is six times lower than that of a neutron gained via nuclear fission. In contrast to nuclear fission, the spallation neutrons cannot trigger further spallation or fission processes to produce further neutrons. Therefore, there is no chain-reaction, which makes the process non-critical. The concept of nuclear spallation was first coined by [[Nobel Prize|Nobelist]] [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] in his doctoral thesis on the [[Inelastic neutron scattering|inelastic scattering of neutrons]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000929093047/http://www.khwarzimic.org/takveen/seaborg.pdf "A Man Beyond Elements: Glenn T. Seaborg" Iqbal 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}

===Production of neutrons at a spallation neutron source===
{{Science with neutrons}}  
Generally the production of neutrons at a spallation source begins with a high-powered proton [[Particle accelerator|accelerator]]. The accelerator may consist of a linac only (as in the [[European Spallation Source]]) or a combination of linac and synchrotron (e.g. [[ISIS neutron source]]) or a cyclotron (e.g. [[Paul Scherrer Institute|PSI]]) . As an example, the [[ISIS neutron source]] is based on some components of the former [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod synchrotron]]. Nimrod was uncompetitive for [[particle physics]] so it was replaced with a new synchrotron, initially using the original [[injector]]s, but which produces a highly intense pulsed beam of protons. Whereas Nimrod would produce around 2 µA at 7 GeV, ISIS produces 200 µA at 0.8 GeV. This is pulsed at the rate of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, and this intense beam of protons is focused onto a target. Experiments have been done with [[depleted uranium]] targets but although these produce the most intense neutron beams, they also have the shortest lives. Generally, therefore, [[tantalum]]  or [[tungsten]] targets have been used. Spallation processes in the target produce the neutrons, initially at [[fast neutron|very high energies]]—a good fraction of the proton energy. These neutrons are then slowed in [[neutron moderation|moderators]] filled with [[liquid hydrogen]] or liquid [[methane]] to the energies that are needed for the scattering instruments. Whilst protons can be focused since they have charge, chargeless neutrons cannot be, so in this arrangement the instruments are arranged around the moderators.

A '''telecommunication circuit''' is any line, conductor, or other conduit by which [[information]] is [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.ie.itcr.ac.cr/acotoc/Maestria_en_Computacion/Sistemas_de_Comunicacion_II/Material/Biblio5.pdf|title=Fundamentals of Telecommunications|last=Freeman|first=Roger L.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=1999|isbn=0471296996|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, this was [[analog (signal)|analog]], and was often used by [[radio station]]s as a [[studio/transmitter link]] (STL) or [[remote pickup unit]] (RPU) for their [[sound reproduction|audio]], sometimes as a [[backup]] to other means.  Later lines were [[Digital data|digital]], and used for private [[corporation|corporate]] [[data network]]s.

A [[leased line]] is a circuit that is dedicated to only one use.  The opposite of a dedicated circuit is a '''switched circuit''', which can be connected to different paths.  A [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] or [[ISDN]] [[telephone]] line is a switched circuit, because it can connect to any other [[telephone number]].

On digital lines, a [[virtual circuit]] can be created to serve either purpose, while [[sharing]] a single physical circuit.

==Definitions==
A telecommunication circuit may be defined as follows: 

* The complete path between two terminals over which one-way or two-way communications may be provided.  See [[communications protocol]].
* An electronic path between two or more points, capable of providing a number of [[channel (communications)|channels]].
* A number of conductors connected for the purpose of carrying an [[Current (electricity)|electric current]].
* An electronic closed-loop path among two or more points used for [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] transfer.
* A number of electrical components, such as resistors, inductances, capacitors, transistors, and [[Electric power|power]] sources connected in one or more closed loops.

'''''The Codebreakers – The Story of Secret Writing''''' ({{ISBN|0-684-83130-9}}) is a book by [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]], published in 1967, comprehensively chronicling the [[history of cryptography]] from ancient [[Egypt]] to the time of its writing. The [[United States government]] attempted to have the book altered before publication, and it succeeded in part.&lt;ref name="cia1996"&gt;Pineau, Roger (1996). The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing by David Kahn, internal CIA  book review by Roger Pineau, ca. 1967, released to public 1996. Retrieved from https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol12i3/html/v12i3a09p_0001.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Bradford Hardie III, an American cryptographer during World War II, contributed insider information, German translations from original documents, and intimate real-time operational explanations to ''The Codebreakers''.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

''The Codebreakers'' is widely regarded as the best account of the [[history of cryptography]] up to its publication. [[William P. Crowell|William Crowell]], the former deputy director of the [[National Security Agency]], was quoted in ''[[Newsday]]'' magazine: "Before he (Kahn) came along, the best you could do was buy an explanatory book that usually was too technical and terribly dull."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/7460.html David Kahn: Historian of Secret Codes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050913030949/http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/7460.html |date=2005-09-13 }} by Arnold Abrams, in ''Newsday'' 2004-09-19 (no more available online (2013.02.27))&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahn, then a journalist, was contracted to write a book on cryptology in 1961. He began writing it part-time, and then he quit his job to work on it full-time.&lt;ref name=bamford&gt;{{cite book|last=Bamford|first=James|title=[[The Puzzle Palace]]|year=1982|pages=126–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was to include information on the [[NSA]], and according to the author [[James Bamford]], in 1982, the agency attempted to stop its publication. The NSA considered various options, including writing a negative review of Kahn's work to be published in the press to discredit him.&lt;ref name=bamford /&gt;

A committee of the United States Intelligence Board concluded that the book was "a possibly valuable support to foreign [[COMSEC]] authorities" and recommended "further low-key actions as possible, but short of legal action, to discourage Mr. Kahn or his prospective publishers".&lt;ref name=bamford /&gt; Kahn's publisher, [[Daniel MacMillan|Macmillan and Sons]], handed over the manuscript to the government for review without Kahn's permission on 4 March 1966.&lt;ref name=bamford /&gt; Kahn and Macmillan eventually agreed to remove some material from the manuscript, particularly concerning the relationship between the NSA and its counterpart in the United Kingdom, [[GCHQ]].&lt;ref name=bamford /&gt;

The book finishes with a chapter on [[SETI]]. Because of the year of its publication, the book did not cover most of the history concerning the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|breaking]] of the German [[Enigma machine]], which became public knowledge during the 1970s. Hence, not much was said of [[Alan Turing]]. It also did not cover the advent of strong cryptography in the public domain, beginning with the invention of [[public key cryptography]] and the specification of the [[Data Encryption Standard]] in the mid-1970s. The book was republished in 1996, and this new edition included an additional chapter briefly covering the events since the original publication.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

'''Thin filament pyrometry''' ('''TFP''') is an optical method used to measure temperatures. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are typically [[silicon carbide]] ([[SiC]]) fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometres. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.

==History==
TFP was first used by V. Vilimpoc and L.P. Goss (1988). A recent paper using TFP is Maun et al. (2007).

==Technique==
The typical TFP apparatus consists of a [[flame]] or other hot gas stream, a filament, and a camera. 

==Advantages==
TFP has several advantages, including the ability to simultaneously measure temperatures along a line and minimal intrusiveness. Most other forms of [[pyrometry]] are not capable of providing gas-phase temperatures.

==Drawbacks==
Calibration is required. Calibration typically is performed with a [[thermocouple]]. Both thermocouples and filaments require corrections in estimating gas temperatures from probe temperatures. Also, filaments are fragile and typically break after about an hour in a flame.

==Applications==
The primary application is to [[combustion]] and [[fire]] research.

'''Tire Uniformity''' refers to the dynamic [[mechanical properties]] of [[pneumatic tires]] as strictly defined by a set of measurement standards and test conditions accepted by global tire and car makers. These standards include the parameters of radial force variation, lateral force variation, conicity, plysteer, radial [[run-out]], lateral [[run-out]], and sidewall bulge. Tire makers worldwide employ tire uniformity measurement as a way to identify poorly performing tires so they are not sold to the marketplace. Both tire and vehicle manufacturers seek to improve tire uniformity in order to improve vehicle ride comfort.

==Force variation background==
The circumference of the tire can be modeled as a series of very small spring elements whose spring constants vary according to manufacturing conditions. These spring elements are compressed as they enter the road contact area, and recover as they exit the footprint. Variation in the spring constants in both radial and lateral directions cause variations in the compressive and restorative forces as the tire rotates. Given a perfect tire, running on a perfectly smooth roadway, the force exerted between the car and the tire will be constant. However, a normally manufactured tire running on a perfectly smooth roadway will exert a varying force into the vehicle that will repeat every rotation of the tire. This variation is the source of various ride disturbances. Both tire and car makers seek to reduce such disturbances in order to improve the dynamic performance of the vehicle.

==Tire uniformity parameters==
===Axes of measurement===
[[File:Tire Force Variation1.jpg|thumb|200px|Force Variation Axes]]
Tire forces are divided into three axes: radial, lateral, and tangential (or fore-aft). The radial axis runs from the tire center toward the tread, and is the vertical axis running from the roadway through the tire center toward the vehicle. This axis supports the vehicle’s weight. The lateral axis runs sideways across the tread. This axis is parallel to the tire mounting axle on the vehicle. The tangential axis is the one in the direction of the tire travel.

===Radial Force Variation===
{{main|Radial force variation}}

In so far as the radial force is the one acting upward to support the vehicle, radial force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the force will change. Consider a tire supporting a 1,000 pound load running on a perfectly smooth roadway. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 995 pounds and 1003 pounds would be characterized as an 8-pound radial force variation (RFV). RFV can be expressed as a peak-to-peak value, which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described below.

Some tire manufactures mark the sidewall with a red dot to indicate the location of maximal radial force and runout, the high spot. A yellow dot indicates the point of least weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tire Match Mounting and Custom Wheel Handling |author=Mike Marvigian |publisher=[[Hearst Communications]] |work=Motor |date=April 2008 |url=https://www.motor.com/magazinepdfs/042008_09.pdf |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the dots is specified in [[American Trucking Associations#Technology Maintenance Council|Technology Maintenance Council]]'s performance standard RP243. To compensate for this variation, tires are supposed to be installed with the red dot near the valve stem, assuming the valve stem is at the low point, or with the yellow dot near the valve stem, assuming the valve stem is at the heavy point.&lt;ref name="TB"&gt;{{cite web |title=Are you seeing dots? Those color-coded sidewall markings serve a purpose |publisher=[[Crain Communications]] |work=Tire Business |url=http://www.tirebusiness.com/article/20070813/ISSUE/308139967/are-you-seeing-dots-those-color-coded-sidewall-markings-serve-a-purpose |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harmonic analysis===
[[File:Force Variation Waveform.JPG|thumb|400px|Harmonic Waveform Analysis]]
RFV, as well as all other force variation measurements, can be shown as a complex waveform. This waveform can be expressed according to its harmonics by applying [[Fourier Transform]] (FT). FT permits one to parameterize various aspects of the tire dynamic behavior. The first harmonic, expressed as RF1H (radial force first harmonic) describes the force variation magnitude that exerts a pulse into the vehicle one time for each rotation. RF2H expresses the magnitude of the radial force that exerts a pulse twice per revolution, and so on. Often, these harmonics have known causes, and can be used to diagnose production problems. For example, a tire mold installed with 8 bolts may thermally deform as to induce an eighth harmonic, so the presence of a high RF8H would point to a mold bolting problem. RF1H is the primary source of ride disturbances, followed by RF2H. High harmonics are less problematic because the rotating speed of the tire at highway speeds times the harmonic value makes disturbances at such high frequencies that they are damped or overcome by other vehicle dynamic conditions.

===Lateral Force Variation===
{{main|Lateral Force Variation}}

Insofar as the lateral force is the one acting side-to-side along the tire axle, lateral force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the lateral force will change. As the tire rotates it may exert a lateral force on the order of 25 pounds, causing steering pull in one direction. It would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. A variation between 22 pounds and 26 pounds would be characterized as a 4-pound lateral force variation, or LFV. LFV can be expressed as a peak-to-peak value, which is the maximum minus minimum value, or any harmonic value as described above. Lateral force is signed, such that when mounted on the vehicle, the lateral force may be positive, making the vehicle pull to the left, or negative, pulling to the right.

===Tangential force variation===
Insofar as the tangential force is the one acting in the direction of travel, tangential force variation describes the change in this force as the tire rotates under load. As the tire rotates and spring elements with different spring constants enter and exit the contact area, the tangential force will change. As the tire rotates it exerts a high traction force to accelerate the vehicle and maintain its speed under constant velocity. Under steady-state conditions it would be typical for the force to vary up and down from this value. This variation would be characterized as TFV. In a constant velocity test condition, TFV would be manifested as a small speed fluctuation occurring every rotation due to the change in rolling radius of the tire.

===Conicity===
Conicity is a parameter based on lateral force behavior. It is the characteristic that describes the tire’s tendency to roll like a cone. This tendency affects the steering performance of the vehicle.&lt;ref name="AGCO Automotive Repair Service"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/181|title=AGCO Automotive Repair Service - Baton Rouge, LA - Detailed  Auto Topics - Tire Conicity and  Radial Pull|website=www.agcoauto.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine Conicity, lateral force must be measured in both clockwise (LFCW) and counterclockwise direction (LFCCW). Conicity is calculated as one-half the difference of the values, keeping in mind that CW and CCW values have opposite signs. Conicity is an important parameter in production testing. In many high-performance cars, tires with equal conicity are mounted on left and right sides of the car in order that their conicity effects will cancel each other and generate a smoother ride performance, with little steering effect. This necessitates the tire maker measuring conicity and sorting tires into groups of like-values.

===Ply steer===
Ply steer describes the lateral force a tire generates due to asymmetries in its carcass as is rolls forward with zero [[slip angle]] and may be called pseudo side slip.&lt;ref name="Pacejka"&gt;{{cite book

This tendency affects the steering performance of the vehicle. In order to determine ply steer, the lateral force generated is measured as the tire rolls both forward and back, and ply steer is then calculated as one-half the sum of the values, keeping in mind that values have opposite signs.

===Radial run-out===
Radial [[run-out]] (RRO) describes the deviation of the tire’s roundness from a perfect circle. RRO can be expressed as the peak-to-peak value as well as harmonic values. RRO imparts an excitation into the vehicle in a manner similar to radial force variation. RRO is most often measured near the tire’s centerline, although some tire makers have adopted measurement of RRO at three positions: left shoulder, center, and right shoulder.

Some tire manufactures mark the sidewall with a red dot to indicate the location of maximal radial force and runout.&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt;

===Lateral run-out===
Lateral [[run-out]] (LRO) describes the deviation of the tire’s sidewall from a perfect plane. LRO can be expressed as the peak-to-peak value as well as harmonic values. LRO imparts an excitation into the vehicle in a manner similar to lateral force variation. LRO is most often measured in the upper sidewall, near the tread shoulder.

===Sidewall bulge and depression===
Given that the tire is an assembly of multiple components that are cured in a mold, there are many process variations that cause cured tires to be classified as rejects. Bulges and depressions in the sidewall are such defects. A bulge is a weak spot in the sidewall that expands when the tire is inflated. A depression is a strong spot that does not expand in equal measure as the surrounding area. Both are deemed visual defects. Tires are measured in production to identify those with excessive visual defects. Bulges may also indicate defective construction conditions such as missing cords, which pose a safety hazard. As a result, tire makers impose stringent inspection standards to identify tires with bulges. Sidewall Bulge and Depression is also referred to as bulge and dent, and bumpy sidewall.

==Tire uniformity measurement machines==
Tire Uniformity Machines are special-purpose machines that automatically inspect tires for the tire uniformity parameters described above. They consist of several subsystems, including tire handling, chucking, measurement rims, bead lubrication, inflation, load wheel, spindle drive, force measurement, and geometry measurement.

The tire is first centered, and the bead areas are lubricated to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. The tire is indexed into the test station and placed on the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers to make contact with the upper bead. The tire is inflated to the set point pressure. The load wheel advances to contact the tire and apply the set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates the tire to the test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the load wheel by the tire. The force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract the measurement parameters. Tires are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.

===Other types of uniformity machines===
There are numerous variations and innovations among several tire uniformity machine makers. The standard test speed for tire uniformity machines is 60 rpm of a standard load wheel that approximates 5 miles per hour. High speed uniformity machines are used in research and development environments that reach 250&amp;nbsp;km/h and higher. High speed uniformity machines have also been introduced for production testing. Machines that combine force variation measurement with dynamic balance measurement are also in use.

==Tire uniformity correction==
Radial and Lateral Force Variation can be reduced at the Tire Uniformity Machine via grinding operations. In the Center Grind operation, a grinder is applied to the tread center to remove rubber at the high point of RFV. On the top and bottom tread shoulder grinders are applied to reduce the size of the road contact area, or footprint, and the resulting force variation. Top and bottom grinders can be controlled independently to reduce conicity values. Grinders are also employed to correct excessive radial [[run-out]].

Effects of tire variations can also be reduced by mounting the tire in such a way that unbalanced rims and valve stems helps compensate for imperfect tires.&lt;ref name="TB"/&gt;

==Geometry measurement systems==
Radial [[run-out]], Lateral [[run-out]], Conicity, and Bulge measurements are also performed on the tire uniformity machine. There are several generations of measurement technologies in use. These include Contact Stylus, Capacitive Sensors, Fixed-Point Laser Sensors, and Sheet-of-Light Laser Sensors.

===Contact stylus===
Contact Stylus technology utilizes a touch-probe to ride along the tire surface as it rotates. Analog instrumentation senses the movement of the probe, and records the [[run-out]] waveform. When used to measure radial runout, the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance. The small area-of-interest in the sidewall area limits the effectiveness in discerning sidewall bulges and depressions elsewhere on the sidewall.

===Capacitive sensors===
Capacitive Sensors generate a dielectric field between the tire and sensor. As the distance between the tire and the sensor varies, the voltage and/or current properties of the dielectric field change. Analog circuitry is employed to measure the field changes and record the [[run-out]] waveform. Capacitive sensors have a larger area-of-interest, on the order of 10mm compared to the very narrow contact stylus method. The capacitive sensor method is one of the earliest technologies, and has proven highly reliable; however, the sensor must be positioned very close to the tire surface during measurement, so collisions between tire and sensor have led to long-term maintenance problems. In addition, some sensors are very sensitive to moisture/humidity and ended with erroneous readings. The 10mm area-of-interest also means that bulge measurement is limited to a small portion of the tire. Capacitive sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in radial runout measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.

===Fixed-point laser sensors===
Fixed-Point Laser Sensors were developed as an alternative to the above methods. Lasers combine the narrow-track area-of-interest with a large stand off distance from the tire. In order to cover a larger area-of-interest, mechanical positioning systems have been employed to take readings at multiple positions in the sidewall. Fixed-Point Laser sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in radial [[run-out]] measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.

===Sheet-of-light laser systems===
[[File:Sheet-of-Light Laser.png|thumb|200px|Sheet-of-Light Laser Sensor]]

Sheet-of-Light Laser (SL) Systems were introduced in 2003, and have emerged as the most capable and reliable [[run-out]], bulge and depression measurement methods. SL sensors project a laser line instead of a laser point, and thereby create a very large area-of-interest. Sidewall sensors can easily span an area from the bead area to the tread shoulder, and inspect the complete sidewall for bulge and depression defects. Large radial sensors can span 300mm or more to cover the entire tread width. This enables characterization of RRO in multiple tracks. SL sensors also feature stand off distances large enough to assure no collisions with the tire. Two-dimensional tread void filtering and sidewall letter filtering are also employed to eliminate these characteristics from the runout measurements.

'''Trans Europe Halles''' (TEH) is a European-based network of cultural centres initiated by citizens and artists.

== History ==
In 1983 the independent [[Cultural center|cultural centre]] "Les Halles de Schaerbeek" ([[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]]) organised a weekend of discussions in Brussels to enable [[Europe]]an independent [[Cultural center|cultural centres]] to exchange experiences and participate in events under the theme of  "Adventures of the rediscovered ark". This three-day forum focused on an [[alternative culture]] emerging in rehabilitated [[Industrial architecture|industrial buildings]], and asserting its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] despite the reservations of [[political authorities]]. Seven centres from seven European cities took part in this initial meeting.

That first [[international]] meeting in 1983 was the seed of what nowadays is Trans Europe Halles (TEH), the European-based network of cultural centres initiated by citizens and artists, that currently gathers together around eighty members and associated organisations in almost thirty countries.

TEH members are cultural centres emerged from [[civil society]] initiatives that have a multidisciplinary artistic policy encouraging interaction between art forms, with an emphasis on contemporary art. One of the common and most defining characteristics of these centres is that they are based on [[Industrial architecture|industrial or commercial buildings]] that have been adapted to artistic and cultural uses. Besides this, they are very diverse in terms of geographical location, size, inspirational backgrounds, funding models, artistic programmes, etc.

== Organization &amp; Structure ==

=== Members ===
Trans Europe Halles has currently almost 60 members and 17 associate organisations in 29 European countries. Most of Trans Europe Halles centres are established in buildings from [[industrial heritage]], from factories and warehouses to dairies and army barracks.
All Trans Europe Halles centres are multidisciplinary, but their main artistic disciplines as well as their regular activities vary a lot.
To become a TEH Member, applicant cultural centres must fulfil the following membership criteria:

#To be an independent and not-for-profit centre arising from a citizen’s initiative with a legal structure.
#To have a multidisciplinary artistic policy encouraging interaction between art forms, with an emphasis on contemporary art. 
#To be based in user-friendly buildings preferably originating from a commercial or industrial heritage. 
#To have a high-quality artistic programme of at least regional significance with an awareness of contemporary culture, ranging from local to international art. 
#To be aware of the social and political aspects of cultural actions with an Equal Opportunities Policy or commitment.

=== Governance and Management ===
TEH is run in a decentralised way; the member centres participate in the decision-making of the network during the network meetings. Each centre has one vote regardless of its size or economic status. The [[Committee#Executive committee|Executive Committee]], selected biannually, is the governing and policy making body of the network.

The members of Trans Europe Halles meet twice a year during TEH Meetings. Decisions are made at the [[General assembly|General Assembly]] of each meeting. During the Spring meeting a formal General Assembly is held with the approval of [[final accounts]], election of Executive Committee and approval of the yearly [[budget]]. Each member has one vote regardless of the size of the centre.

Trans Europe Halles’ Executive Committee is the governing and policy making body of the network. It consists of a minimum of five and a maximum of eight people and is elected for two years at a time.

The Trans Europe Halles Coordination Office is located at the cultural centre [[Mejeriet]] in [[Lund|Lund, Sweden]]. With a broad and multi-lingual membership and an intense flow of information and ideas, the Trans Europe Halles Coordination Office is a crucial hub. The Coordination Office is responsible for internal and external communication of the network and publishes the monthly TEH [[Newsletter]]. The Coordination Office also supports project-planning and [[fundraising]] activities for the network and has become a focal point of expertise within the network.

== Activities ==

=== Meetings ===
Organised twice a year and hosted by a different member centre each time, the TEH meetings are a source of inspiration and a birthplace for new collaborations. It is also the opportunity for our members to meet and discover new countries and new cultural centres.

The activities and programme are all of interest of the participants, with a strong focus on [[capacity building]]. During three days, participants are invited to take part to workshops, seminars, lectures, and networking sessions. On the last day of each meeting, an outing is organised for the participants to get to know more about the local culture.

=== Projects ===
The network coordinates several bilateral and multilateral projects:

* 2015–2019 Creative Lenses: Business Models For Culture
* 2015–2017 Europe Grand Central
* 2014–2015 Independent Cultural Centres In South America
* 2015-2019 Engine Room Europe (ERE)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18063">[[Image:ExpansionTurbine.png|right|thumb|272px|Schematic diagram of a turboexpander driving a compressor]]

A '''turboexpander''', also referred to as a '''turbo-expander''' or an '''expansion turbine''', is a centrifugal or axial-flow [[turbine]], through which a high-[[pressure]] [[gas]] is expanded to produce work that is often used to drive a [[Gas compressor|compressor]] or [[electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinz Bloch and Claire Soares|title=Turboexpanders and Process Applications|edition=|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|year=2001|isbn=0-88415-509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerry&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank G. Kerry|title=Industrial Gas Handbook:Gas Separation and Purification|edition=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2007|isbn=0-8493-9005-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flynn&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Flynn|title=Cryogenics Engineering|edition=Second|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=0-8247-5367-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because work is extracted from the expanding high-pressure gas, the expansion is approximated by an [[isentropic]] process (i.e., a constant-[[entropy]] process), and the low-pressure [[exhaust gas]] from the turbine is at a very low [[temperature]], −150&amp;nbsp;°C or less, depending upon the operating pressure and gas properties.  Partial liquefaction of the expanded gas is not uncommon.

Turboexpanders are very widely used as sources of [[refrigeration]] in industrial processes such as the extraction of [[ethane]] and [[Natural-gas processing|natural-gas liquids]] (NGLs) from [[natural gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepatentsonline.com/US6915662.html Demethanzer].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[liquefaction of gases]] (such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], [[argon]] and [[krypton]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/production/1K.pdf BOC (NZ) publication]: use search function for keyword "expansion".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress05/v_e_1_shimko.pdf US Department of Energy Hydrogen Program].&lt;/ref&gt; and other low-temperature processes.

Turboexpanders currently in operation range in size from about 750 [[Watt|W]] to about 7.5 MW (1 [[Horsepower|hp]] to about 10,000&amp;nbsp;hp).

==Applications==

Although turboexpanders are very commonly used in low-temperature processes, they are used in many other applications as well. This section discusses one of the low-temperature processes, as well as some of the other applications.

===Extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas===
[[Image:Demethanizer.PNG|right|thumb|340px|A schematic diagram of a demethanizer extracting hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas]]
 
Raw natural gas consists primarily of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the shortest and lightest [[hydrocarbon]] molecule, as well as various amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases such as [[ethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[propane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Butane|normal butane]] (''n''-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[isobutane]] (''i''-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pentane]]s and even higher-[[molecular-mass]] hydrocarbons. The raw gas also contains various amounts of [[acid gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) and [[mercaptan]]s such as [[methanethiol]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SH) and [[ethanethiol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;SH).

When processed into finished by-products (see [[Natural-gas processing]]), these heavier hydrocarbons are collectively referred to as NGL (natural-gas liquids). The extraction of the NGL often involves a turboexpander&lt;ref&gt;''Gas Processes 2002'', Hydrocarbon Processing, pages 83–84, May 2002 (schematic flow diagrams and descriptions of the NGL-Pro and NGL recovery processes).&lt;/ref&gt; and a low-temperature [[distillation column]] (called a ''demethanizer'') as shown in the figure. The inlet gas to the demethanizer is first cooled to about −51&amp;nbsp;°C in a [[heat exchanger]] (referred to as a ''cold box''), which partially [[Condensation|condenses]] the inlet gas. The resultant gas–liquid mixture is then separated into a gas stream and a liquid stream.

The liquid stream from the [[Vapor–liquid separator|gas–liquid separator]] flows through a valve and undergoes a [[Flash evaporation#Flash evaporation of a single-component liquid|''throttling expansion'']] from an absolute pressure of 62 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] to 21 bar (6.2 to 2.1 MPa), which is an [[isenthalpic]] process (i.e., a constant-enthalpy process) that results in lowering the temperature of the stream from about −51&amp;nbsp;°C to about −81&amp;nbsp;°C as the stream enters the demethanizer.

The gas stream from the gas–liquid separator enters the turboexpander, where it undergoes an [[Isentropic process|isentropic]] expansion from an absolute pressure of 62 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] to 21 bar (6.2 to 2.1 MPa) that lowers the gas stream temperature from about −51&amp;nbsp;°C to about −91&amp;nbsp;°C as it enters the demethanizer to serve as distillation [[reflux]].

Liquid from the top [[tray]] of the demethanizer (at about −90&amp;nbsp;°C) is routed through the cold box, where it is warmed to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C as it cools the inlet gas, and is then returned to the lower section of the demethanizer. Another liquid stream from the lower section of the demethanizer (at about 2&amp;nbsp;°C) is routed through the cold box and returned to the demethanizer at about 12&amp;nbsp;°C. In effect, the inlet gas provides the [[heat]] required to "reboil" the bottom of the demethanizer, and the turboexpander removes the heat required to provide reflux in the top of the demethanizer.

The overhead gas product from the demethanizer at about −90&amp;nbsp;°C is processed natural gas that is of suitable quality for distribution to end-use consumers by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]. It is routed through the cold box, where it is warmed as it cools the inlet gas. It is then compressed in the gas compressor driven by the turboexpander and further compressed in a second-stage gas compressor driven by an [[electric motor]] before entering the distribution pipeline.

The bottom product from the demethanizer is also warmed in the cold box, as it cools the inlet gas, before it leaves the system as NGL.

=== Power generation ===

[[Image:Expansion turbine power generation.png|right|thumb|222px|Schematic diagram of power-generation system using a turboexpander]]
The figure depicts an electric power-generation system that uses a heat source, a cooling medium (air, water or other), a circulating working fluid and a turboexpander. The system can accommodate a wide variety of heat sources such as:
* geothermal hot water,
* exhaust gas from internal combustion engines burning a variety of fuels ([[natural gas]], [[landfill gas]], [[diesel oil]], or [[fuel oil]]),
* a variety of [[waste heat]] sources (in the form of either gas or liquid).

The circulating working fluid (usually an [[Organic chemistry|organic compound]] such as R-134a) is pumped to a high pressure and then vaporized in the evaporator by [[Heat exchanger|heat exchange]] with the available heat source. The resulting high-pressure vapor flows to the turboexpander, where it undergoes an isentropic expansion and exits as a vapor–liquid mixture, which is then condensed into a liquid by heat exchange with the available cooling medium. The condensed liquid is pumped back to the evaporator to complete the cycle.

The system in the figure implements a [[Rankine cycle]] as it is used in [[fossil-fuel power plant]]s, where water is the working fluid and the heat source is derived from the [[combustion]] of natural gas, [[fuel oil]] or [[coal]] used to generate high-pressure steam. The high-pressure steam then undergoes an isentropic expansion in a conventional [[steam turbine]]. The steam turbine exhaust steam is next condensed into liquid water, which is then pumped back to steam generator to complete the cycle.

When an organic working fluid such as R-134a is used in the Rankine cycle, the cycle is sometimes referred to as an [[organic Rankine cycle]] (ORC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akenergyauthority.org/PDF%20files/ArchiveConferenceMaterial/ORC_Waste_Heat-Holdmann.pdf ORC Technology for Waste Heat Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/science/ps4q.html The Integrated Rankine Cycle Project].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geothermie.de/gte/gte36-37/altheim_gaia.htm The Rankine Cycle Turbogenerator at Altheim, Austria].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigeration system ===

[[Image:Expansion turbine+compressor refrigeration system.png|right|thumb|256px|Schematic diagram of a refrigeration system using a turboexpander, compressor and a motor]]
A refrigeration system utilizes a compressor, a turboexpander and an electric motor.

Depending on the operating conditions, the turboexpander reduces the load on the electric motor by 6–15% compared to a conventional [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] system that uses a [[Flash evaporation#Flash evaporation of a single-component liquid|''throttling expansion'']]  valve rather than a turboexpander.&lt;ref name=Brasz&gt;''Refrigeration apparatus with expansion turbine'', European patent EP 0 676 600 B1, September 6, 2000, Joost J. Brasz, Carrier Corporation [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP0676600.pdf EP 0 676 600 B1] (this website requires registration).&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, this can be seen as a form of [[turbo-compound engine|turbo compounding]].

The system employs a high-pressure refrigerant (i.e., one with a low [[Boiling point#Relation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids|normal boiling point]]) such as:&lt;ref name=Brasz/&gt;
* [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (CHClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) known as R-22, with a normal boiling point of −47&amp;nbsp;°C;
* [[1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) known as R-134a, with a normal boiling point of −26&amp;nbsp;°C.

As shown in the figure, refrigerant vapor is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed vapor is then [[condensation|condensed]] into a liquid. The [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] is where heat is expelled from the circulating refrigerant and is carried away by whatever cooling medium is used in the condenser (air, water, etc.).

The refrigerant liquid flows through the turboexpander, where it is vaporized, and the vapor undergoes an isentropic expansion, which results in a low-temperature mixture of vapor and liquid. The vapor–liquid mixture is then routed through the evaporator, where it is vaporized by heat absorbed from the space being cooled. The vaporized refrigerant flows to the compressor inlet to complete the cycle.

=== Power recovery in fluid catalytic cracker ===

[[Image:Fluid catalytic cracker power recovery.png|right|thumb|225px|A schematic diagram of the power recovery system in a fluid catalytic cracking unit]]

The [[combustion]] [[flue gas]] from the catalyst regenerator of a [[fluid catalytic cracker]] is at a temperature of about 715&amp;nbsp;°C and at a pressure of about 2.4 [[bar (unit)#Absolute pressure and gauge pressure|barg]] (240 kPa gauge). Its gaseous components are mostly [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Although the flue gas has been through two stages of [[Cyclonic separation|cyclones]] (located within the regenerator) to remove entrained catalyst fines, it still contains some residual catalyst fines.

The figure depicts how power is recovered and utilized by routing the regenerator flue gas through a turboexpander. After the flue gas exits the regenerator, it is routed through a secondary catalyst separator containing ''[[swirl tubes]]'' designed to remove 70–90% of the residual catalyst fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex C. Hoffnab and Lewis E. Stein|title=Gas Cyclones and Swirl Tubes:Principles , Design and Operation|edition=1st|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=3-540-43326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is required to prevent erosion damage to the turboexpander.

As shown in the figure, expansion of the flue gas through a turboexpander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor. The electrical [[motor-generator]] in the power-recovery system can consume or produce electrical power. If the expansion of the flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor, the electric motor-generator provides the needed additional power. If the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor, then the electric motor-generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinery's electrical system.&lt;ref name=Reza&gt;{{cite book|author=Reza Sadeghbeigi|title=Fluid Catalytic Cracking Handbook|edition=2nd|publisher=Gulf Publishing|year=2000|isbn=0-88415-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam turbine]] is used to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor during start-ups of the fluid catalytic cracker until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task.

The expanded flue gas is then routed through a steam-generating [[boiler]] (referred to as a ''[[Condensing boiler|CO boiler]]''), where the carbon monoxide in the flue gas is burned as fuel to provide steam for use in the refinery.&lt;ref name=Reza/&gt;

The flue gas from the CO boiler is processed through an [[electrostatic precipitator]] (ESP) to remove residual [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]]. The ESP removes particulates in the size range of 2 to 20 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] from the flue gas.&lt;ref name=Reza/&gt;

==History==

The possible use of an expansion machine for isentropically creating low temperatures was suggested by [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] ([[Siemens cycle]]), a [[Germany|German]] engineer in 1857. About three decades later, in 1885,  Ernest Solvay of [[Belgium]] attempted to use a reciprocating expander machine, but could not attain any temperatures lower than −98&amp;nbsp;°C because of problems with lubrication of the machine at such temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;

In 1902, [[Georges Claude]], a [[France|French]] engineer, successfully used a reciprocating expansion machine to liquefy air. He used a degreased, burnt leather packing as a piston seal without any lubrication. With an air pressure of only 40 bar (4 MPa), Claude achieved an almost isentropic expansion resulting in a lower temperature than had before been possible.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;

The first turboexpanders seem to have been designed in about 1934 or 1935 by Guido Zerkowitz, an Italian engineer working for the German firm of [[Linde AG]].&lt;ref&gt;''Turbine for Low Temperature Gas Separation'', U.S. Patent 2,165,994, July 1939 (Continuation of an application in March 1934), Guido Zerkowitz, Linde AG [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2165994.pdf United States Patent US2165994] (this website requires registration).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Almqvist&gt;{{cite book|author=Ebbe Almqvist|title=History of Industrial Gases|edition=First|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-306-47277-5|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, the [[Russians|Russian]] physicist [[Pyotr Kapitsa]] perfected the design of centrifugal turboexpanders. His first practical prototype was made of [[Monel]] metal, had an outside diameter of only 8&amp;nbsp;cm (3.1&amp;nbsp;in), operated at 40,000 revolutions per minute and expanded 1,000 cubic metres of air per hour. It used a water pump as a brake and had an efficiency of 79–83%.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Almqvist/&gt; Most turboexpanders in industrial use since then have been based on Kapitsa's design, and centrifugal turboexpanders have taken over almost 100% of the industrial gas liquefaction and low-temperature process requirements.&lt;ref name=Kerry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Almqvist/&gt; The availability of liquid [[oxygen]] revolutionized the production of steel using the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] process.

In 1978, Pyotr Kapitsa was awarded a Nobel physics prize for his body of work in the area of low-temperature physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/kapitsa-bio.html Pyotr Kapitsa, The Nobel Prize in Physics 1978].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, San Diego Gas and Electric was among the first to install a turboexpander in a natural-gas letdown station for [[energy recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jacobrheuban.com/2009/03/09/turboexpanders-harnessing-the-hidden-potential-of-our-natural-gas-distribution-system/ Turboexpanders: Harnessing the Hidden Potential of Our Natural Gas Distribution System].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Turboexpanders can be classified by loading device or bearings.

Three main loading devices used in turboexpanders are [[centrifugal compressors]], electrical generators or hydraulic brakes. With centrifugal compressors and electrical generators the shaft power from the turboexpander is recouped either to recompress the process gas or to generate electrical energy, lowering utility bills.

Hydraulic brakes are used when the turboexpander is very small and harvesting the shaft power is not economically justifiable.

Bearings used are either oil bearings or [[magnetic bearing]]s.

One should also notice the new [[Quasiturbine]] technology &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quasiturbine.com/ Quasiturbine Expander: Harnessing mechanical energy from pressured gas and steam system].&lt;/ref&gt;, which is a positive displacement rotary turbine type.

[[File:U-matic.jpg|thumb|250px|A U-matic tape]]
[[File:AssortedENGTapeFormats.jpg|thumb|250px|U-matic (back row, left) compared to other formats of the era]]
'''U-matic''' is an [[analogue recording]] [[Videocassette#Cassette formats|videocassette]] format first shown by [[Sony]] in prototype in October 1969, and introduced to the market in September 1971. It was among the first video formats to contain the videotape inside a cassette, as opposed to the various [[reel-to-reel]] or open-reel formats of the time. Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the supply and take-up reels in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape cover door protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.

== Development ==

As part of its development, in March 1970, Sony, [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.]] (Panasonic), [[JVC|Victor Co. of Japan]] (JVC), and five non-Japanese companies reached agreement on unified standards.

The videotape was {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide, so the format is often known as "three-quarter-inch" or simply "three-quarter", compared to open reel videotape formats in use during the decade, such as {{convert|1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[type C videotape]] and {{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[quadruplex videotape]].

The first generation of U-matic VCRs were large devices, approximately {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|24|in|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} high, requiring special shelving, and had mechanical controls limited to Record, Play, Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop and Pause (with muted video on early models). Later models sported improvements such as chassis sized for EIA [[19-inch rack]] mounting, with sliding rack rails for compressed storage in broadcast environments, solenoid control mechanics, jog-shuttle knob, remote controls, Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC), longitudinal time code, internal cuts-only editing controls, "Slo-Mo" slow-motion playback, and [[Dolby Laboratories|Dolby]] [[audio noise reduction]].

U-matic was named after the shape of the tape path when it was threaded around the [[helical scan]] video head drum, which resembled the letter U.&lt;ref&gt;"After exhaustive research, the development team was confident it had devised a mechanism that could be used for cassette tape VCRs, the U-loading system. The name was derived from the U-shaped figure the tape followed when seen from above." Sony History, [Sony: Freedom of Thought and Creation—the Kihara Method].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betamax]] used a similar type of "B-load" as well. Recording time was limited to one hour.

==Introduction==

At the 1971 introduction of U-Matic, Sony originally intended it to be a videocassette format oriented at the consumer market. This proved to be something of a failure, because of the high manufacturing cost and resulting retail price of the format's first VCRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBKTF9PdgFMC&amp;pg=PT56&amp;lpg=PT56&amp;dq=umatic%20a%20consumer%20format&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uNRPC3O7E2&amp;sig=PhRp7iMTi-q_-jXP4x8e4z3PTNM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3pt9ToC_LdPegQfYwvxF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CGsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Filmmaker's Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide for the Digital Age|first1=Steven|last1=Ascher|first2=Edward|last2=Pincus|date=4 September 2007|publisher=Penguin|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the cost was affordable enough for industrial and institutional customers, where the format was very successful for such applications as business communication and educational television. As a result, Sony shifted U-Matic's marketing to the industrial, professional, and educational sectors.

U-Matic saw even more success from the television broadcast industry in the mid-1970s, when a number of local TV stations and national TV networks used the format when its first portable model, the Sony VO-3800, was released in 1974. This model ushered in the era of ENG, or [[Electronic News Gathering]], which eventually made obsolete the previous [[16mm film]] cameras normally used for on-location television news gathering. Film required developing which took time, compared to the instantly available playback of videotape, making faster breaking news possible.

== Models ==

U-matic is also available in a smaller cassette size, officially known as U-Matic S. Much like [[VHS-C]], U-Matic S was developed as a more portable version of U-Matic, to be used in smaller-sized S-format recorders such as the aforementioned Sony VO-3800, as well as the later VO-4800, VO-6800, VO-8800, BVU-50, BVU-100 and BVU-150 models from Sony, among others from Sony, Panasonic, JVC and other manufacturers. To minimise weight and bulk in the field, portable recorders had an external AC power supply, or could be operated from rechargeable [[nickel cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]].

The price point of the VO series was oriented toward educational, corporate and industrial fields, featured unbalanced audio connectors, and did not typically include [[SMPTE time code]] (although one or two companies offered after-market modification services to install longitudinal time code). The VO-3800 was largely metal, which made the unit heavy, but still technically portable. The VO-4800 had the same functionality as the VO-3800, but at a greatly reduced weight and size, by replacing many components with plastic. The VO-6800 added the improvement of a long, thin battery standard ("candy bars") that permitted storage of the batteries in a trouser pocket.  Common model numbers for these batteries were NP-1, NP-1A and NP-1B. The [http://www.broadcaststore.com/store/model_detail.cfm?id=7524 VO-8800] was the last of the portable VO series to be produced by Sony, and featured solenoid-controlled transport.

The Sony BVU series added longitudinal and vertical interval [[SMPTE time code]], balanced audio [[XLR connector]]s, and heavier-duty transport features. The BVU-50 enabled recording in the field but not playback, and the BVU-100 permitted both recording and playback in the field. Portable recorders were connected to the camera with a multi-conductor cable terminated with multi-pin connectors on each end. The cable carried bi-directional audio, video, synchronisation, record on/off control, and power. Early studio and all portable U-Matic VCRs had a drawer-type mechanism which required the tape to be inserted, followed by manual closure of the drawer (a "top-loading" mechanism). Later studio VCRs accepted the cassette from a port opening and the cassette was pulled into and seated in the transport (a "front-loading" mechanism).

S-format tapes could be played back in older top-loading standard U-Matic decks with the aid of an adapter (the KCA-1 from Sony) which fitted around an S-sized tape; newer front-loading machines can accept S-format tapes directly, as the tapes have a slot on the underside that rides along a tab. U-Matic S tapes had a maximum recording time of 20 minutes, and large ones 1-hour, although some tape manufacturers such as [[3M]] came out with 30-minute S-tapes and 75-minute large cassettes (and [[DuPont]] even managed 90-minute tapes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard - July 16, 1977|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1977/Billboard%201977-07-16.pdf|website=American Radio History}}&lt;/ref&gt; by using a thinner tape. It was the U-Matic S-format decks that ushered in the beginning of ENG, or [[Electronic News Gathering]].

Some U-Matic VCRs could be controlled by external [[video editing]] controllers, such as the cuts-only Sony RM-440 for [[linear video editing]] systems. Sony and other manufacturers such as Convergence, Calaway, and [[CMX Systems]] produced A/B roll systems, which permitted two or more VCRs to be controlled and synchronised for video dissolves and other motion effects, integration of the [[character generator]], audio controllers and [[digital video effect]]s (DVE).

In 1976, Sony introduced the semi backwards-compatible ''high-band'' [[Broadcast Video U-matic]] (BVU) format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7241018 |format=PDF |title=SMPTE Journal, Volume 85, September 1976 |website=IEEE Xplore | page=3 |access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original U-matic format became known as ''low-band''. The BVU format had an improved colour recording system and lower noise levels. BVU gained immense popularity in ENG and location programme-making, spelling the end of [[16 mm film]] in everyday production. By the early 1990s, Sony's {{convert|1/2|in|cm|1|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Betacam]] SP format had all but replaced BVU outside of corporate and budget programme making. With BVU 800 series, Sony made a final improvement to BVU, by further improving the recording system and giving it the same "SP" suffix as Betacam. SP had a horizontal resolution of 330 lines,. The BVU 800 series Y-FM [[carrier frequency]] was upped to 1.2&amp;nbsp;MHz giving it wider bandwidth. BVU 800 series also added [[Dolby]] audio noise reduction. Sony's BVU 900 series was the last U-matic VTR made by Sony.&lt;ref name="derose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derose.net/steve/resources/video-resolution.html |title=Video resolution comparison chart |publisher=Derose.net |date=23 April 2003 |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; First-generation BVU-SP and Beta-SP recordings were hard to tell apart, but despite this the writing was on the wall for the U-matic family, due to intrinsic problems with the format.

== Problems ==
A recurring problem with the format was damage to the videotape caused by prolonged friction of the spinning video drum heads against a paused videotape. The drum would rub oxide off the tape or the tape would wrinkle; when the damaged tape was played back, a horizontal line of distorted visual image would ascend in the frame, and audio would drop out. Manufacturers attempted to minimise this issue with schemes in which the tape would loosen around the spinning head or the head would stop spinning after resting in pause mode for a pre-determined period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=Jeff |year=2007 |title=Curriculum Module 3/4" U-matic Videotape |url=http://www.nyu.edu/tisch/preservation/program/modules/Martin_UmaticTape.pdf |publisher=New York University’s Moving Image Archiving &amp; Preservation Program |accessdate=22 August 2015 |type=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format video image also suffered from head-switching noise, a distortion of the image in which a section of video at the bottom of the video frame would be horizontally askew from the larger portion.

The format also had difficulty reproducing the colour [[red]], and red images would be noisier than other colours in the spectrum. For this reason, on-camera talent was discouraged from wearing red clothing that would call attention to the technical shortcoming.

Copying video from one U-matic VCR to another compromised playback reliability, and levels of head-switching noise, [[chrominance|chroma]] smearing, and chroma noise compounded with every generation. These issues motivated videotape editors and engineers to use work-arounds to minimise this degradation. A time-base corrector (TBC) could be used to regenerate the sync tip portion of the video signal sent to the "recording" VCR, improving playback reliability. The "dub" cable, more formally called "demodulated" (or "demod" for short), was a multi-conductor cable that circumvented a portion of the video circuitry, minimising amplification noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/vcrfaq.htm|title=Notes on the Troubleshooting and Repair of Video Cassette Recorders |author=Samuel M. Goldwasser |date=7 October 2010 |work=repairfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

For synchronisation to broadcast or [[post-production]] editing house [[genlock]] systems, U-Matic VCRs required a [[Time Base Corrector|time base corrector]] (TBC). Some TBCs had a drop-out compensation (DOC) circuit which would hold lines of video in temporary digital memory to compensate for oxide drop-out or wrinkle flaws in the videotape, however the DOC circuits required several cables and expert calibration for use.

U-matic tapes were also used for easy transport of filmed scenes for [[dailies]] in the days before VHS, DVD, and portable hard drives. Several movies have surviving copies in this form. The first [[rough cut]] of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', for example (the raw version of what became ''Apocalypse Now Redux''), survived on three U-Matic cassettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_apocalypse_redux/ film buff article] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CKCsvwOA?url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_apocalypse_redux/ |date=20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio quality was compromised due the use of longitudinal audio tape heads in combination with slow tape speed. Sony eventually implemented [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby noise reduction]] circuitry (using [[Dolby C]]) to improve audio fidelity.

The 2012 film ''[[No (2012 film)|No]]'', set in 1980s Chile, used U-matic tape for filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelo|first=Tim|title=OCT 9 2 MOS Latin America's Frontrunner in Foreign Oscar Race is 'No,' With Gael Garcia Bernal|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/gael-garcia-bernal-no-lead-377644|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital audio==
{{see also|44.1 kHz}}
U-matic was also used for the storage of [[digital audio]] data. Most digital audio recordings from the 1980s were recorded on U-matic tape via a Sony PCM-1600, -1610, or -1630 [[PCM adaptor]]. These devices accepted stereo analogue audio, digitised it, and generated "pseudo video" from the bits, storing 48 bits—three 16-bit samples—as bright and dark regions along each scan line. (On a monitor the "video" looked like vibrating checkerboard patterns.) This could be recorded on a U-matic recorder. This was the first system used for mastering audio [[compact disc]]s in the early 1980s. The famous [[Compact Disc|compact disc]] [[44.1 kHz]] [[sampling rate]] was based on a best-fit calculation for NTSC and PAL's video's horizontal line period and rate and U-matic's luminance bandwidth. On playback the PCM adapter converted the light and dark regions back to bits. [[Compact Disc manufacturing#Mastering|Glass masters]] for audio CDs were made via laser from the PCM-1600's digital output to a [[photoresist]]- or dye-polymer-coated disc. This method was common until the mid-1990s.

== Decline of use ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
U-matic is no longer used as a mainstream [[television production]] format, but it has found lasting appeal as a cheap, well specified, and hard-wearing format. The format permitted many broadcast and non-broadcast institutions to produce [[television program]]ming on an accessible budget, spawning programming distribution, classroom playback, etc. At its peak popularity, U-matic recording and playback equipment was manufactured by Sony, Panasonic, JVC and Sharp, with many spin-off product manufacturers, such as video edit controllers, time base correctors, video production furniture, playback monitors and carts, etc.

Many television facilities the world over still have a U-matic recorder for archive playback of material recorded in the 1980s. For example, the Library of Congress facility in [[Culpeper, Virginia]] holds thousands of titles on U-matic video as a means of providing access copies and proof for copyright deposit of old television broadcasts and films.

More than four decades after it was introduced, the format is still used for the menial tasks of the industry, being more highly specialised and suited to the needs of production staff than the domestic [[VHS]], although as time passes it has been replaced at the bottom of the tree of tape-based production formats by [[Betacam]] and [[Betacam SP]] as these in turn are replaced by [[Digital Betacam]] and [[HDCAM]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2003">'''Vehicle-to-device''' (V2D) communication is a particular type of [[Vehicular communication systems|vehicular communication system]] that consists in the exchange of information between a vehicle and any electronic device that may be connected to the vehicle itself. 

The ever-increasing tendency of developing mobile applications for our everyday use has ultimately entered also the automotive sector. Vehicle connectivity with mobile apps have the great potential to offer a better driving experience, by providing information regarding the surrounding vehicles and infrastructure and making the interaction between the car and its driver much simpler.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21615060-way-cars-are-made-bought-and-driven-changing-mobile-communications&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that apps may significantly improve driving safety has attracted the attention of car users and caused a rise in the number of new apps developed specifically for the car industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2014/03/top-10-mobile-apps-car-owners.html&lt;/ref&gt; This trend has such a great influence that now manufacturers are beginning to design cars taking care of their interaction with mobile phones. For example, starting from 2017 [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] is going to sell keyless cars, thanks to an app that makes it possible to open and start the vehicle remotely.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/173880/volvo-cars-the-first-carmaker-to-launch-a-car-without-a-key&lt;/ref&gt;
Another sector that could coherently benefit from this technology is [[Carsharing|car sharing]].

A '''water timer''' is an [[Machine|electromechanical]] device that, when placed on a water line, increases or decreases the water flow through the use of an embedded (solenoid) [[Solenoid valve|valve]]. It is used in conjunction with [[irrigation sprinkler]]s to form an [[Automation|automated]] or non-automated [[irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler system]], capable of administering precise amounts of water, at a regular basis.

==Alternatives to water timers==
An alternative to a water timer to administer precise amounts of water at a regular basis, is to precisely calculate the needed waterflow and arrange a system composed by a [[Time switch]] and an electric [[pump]] that. The electric pump is to be arranged to be turned on and off at regular intervals by the time switch to administer (fairly) precise and regular water quantities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berserk.org/ois/ Time switch with electric pump and flow calculation replacing water timer]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach, used frequently in [[DIY]] watering systems, allows financial savings as the water timer can be discarded. For high-end applications however, water timers sometimes allow more flexibility and more options.
