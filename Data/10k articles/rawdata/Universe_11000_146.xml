'''''An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power: Your Action Handbook to Learn the Science, Find Your Voice, and Help Solve the Climate Crisis''''' is a book by former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and [[environmental activist]] [[Al Gore]], written in conjunction with his 2017 documentary film, ''[[An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power]].'' The book is a sequel to his 2006 book ''[[An Inconvenient Truth (book)|An Inconvenient Truth]]'', published concurrently with his [[An Inconvenient Truth|documentary of the same name]]. It was published on July 25, 2017 by [[Rodale Books]].&lt;ref name=Rodale&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rodalebooks.com/inconvenient-sequel/|title=An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=2017|website=rodalebooks.com|publisher=Rodale, Inc.|access-date=2018-02-27|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is intended to encourage and inform readers on how they can help fight [[global warming|anthropogenic global warming]] and [[climate change]], and is a more in-depth analysis than the film. The book describes how humans have further damaged the environment since the release of ''An Inconvenient Truth'', and makes more predictions about what will happen in the near future if humans fail to act. The book also describes advancements that have been made so far in the effort against global warming, such as developments in [[alternative energy]] sources. The book explores other aspects of the climate crisis, such as [[climate change denial]] and the [[campaign finance in the United States|corporate influence of money in politics]], and ends by reasoning that it is not too late to solve the crisis.

An '''automatic waste container''' is a [[waste container]] which is automatic. This helps prevent the bin lids becoming clogged with trash.

It has an [[Infrared|infrared system]] that allows it to detect human presence and open or close the waste container.

The waste container also comes with its own ability to neutralize odors.

These wastes containers are mostly made of [[stainless steel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">'''Avoided burden''' is an approach used in [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA), especially in the context of allocating environmental burden in the presence of [[recycling]] or [[reuse]]. When determining the overall [[environmental impact]] of a product, the product is given "credit" for the potential recycled material included. For instance, [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] bottles may be given environmental credit for the PET they contain, as this material will eventually be recycled back into further PET products.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicholson|first=Anna|title=LCA allocation methods in open-loop recycling: incentivizing recycled material sourcing and creation of recyclable products|url=http://www.lcacenter.org/LCAX/presentations-final/212.pdf|accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This credit is termed "avoided burden" because it refers to the impact of virgin material production that is avoided by the use of recycled material.

==Material displacement==
The extent to which recycled material displaces production of virgin material of a similar or different type is the subject of current research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blomberg|author2=Hellmer|title=Short-run demand and supply elasticities in the West European market for secondary aluminium|journal=Resources Policy|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case studies, practitioners typically utilize [[heuristic]], arbitrary rules, such as assigning 100%, 50%, or 0% displacement of virgin material by recycled material.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geyer1&gt;{{cite web|last=Geyer |first=Roland |title=Life Cycle Inventory Analysis |url=http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709231634/https://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/courses/282/Lectures/5-IE-14-Oct-08.ppt |archivedate=9 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, accurate information on the displacement rates of various materials is largely unknown. This information is important to LCA practitioners, as it can often tip the balance between two compared alternative products or materials.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Calculation==
Although the calculation of avoided burden is not without some degree of subjectivity, it is usually calculated as follows:&lt;ref name=geyer1 /&gt; 
:''Avoided Burden = (Material Recycling Rate) × ([[Life cycle assessment#Life cycle inventory|Functional Unit]]) × [(Impact of Virgin Production) − (Impact of Recycling)]''

[[Image:Bevel and chamfer.svg|thumb|200px|Side views of a bevel (above) and a [[chamfer]] (below)]]
A '''bevelled edge''' (UK) or '''beveled edge''' (US) refers to an edge of a structure that is not perpendicular to the faces of the piece.  The words '''bevel''' and '''[[chamfer]]''' overlap in usage; in general usage they are often interchanged, while in technical usage they may sometimes be differentiated as shown in the image at right.  A bevel is typically used to soften the edge of a piece for the sake of safety, wear resistance, or [[aesthetics]]; or to facilitate [[engineering fit|mating]] with another piece.

==Applications==
===Cutting tools===
Most cutting tools have a bevelled edge which is apparent when one examines the [[grind]].

Bevel angles can be duplicated using a [[sliding T bevel]].

===Graphic design===
[[File:Inkscape filters Bevels.png|thumb|200px|Bevel filters in [[Inkscape]]]]
Typographic bevels are shading and artificial shadows that emulate the appearance of a [[three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] letter. The bevel is a relatively common effect in graphic editors such as [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]. As such, it is in widespread use in mainstream logos and other design elements.

==Glass and mirrors==
Bevelled edges are a common aesthetic nicety added to window panes and mirrors.

==Geology==
Geologists refer to any slope of land into a stratum of different elevation as a bevel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~imw/Anvil-Point-Blackers-Hole.htm Anvil Point] &amp;ndash; ''Some examples of bevels in landscape''. Retrieved January 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In waterskiing, a bevel is the transition area between the side of the ski and the bottom of the ski. Beginners tend to prefer sharp bevels, which allow the ski to glide on the water surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waterski.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-bevel.htm About.com] or [http://www.goode.com/wsterminology.html Goode Water Skis]. Retrieved January 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Disc Golf]], the 'beveled edge' was patented in 1983 by Dave Dunipace who founded Innova Champion Discs. This element transformed the Frisbee into the farther flying golf discs the sport uses today.

==Modeling==
In modeling, a bevel is a classic modeling pose (e.g., used by the [https://www.rockettes.com/blog/rockettes-dance-moves-bevel/ Rockettes]). Bevels are part of  choreography and transitions. Beveling is done off the stage quite often—it’s a more formal pose used in photo shoots and during on-camera interviews.  Bevels can be open or closed depending on leg position.

==Cards==
With a deck of cards, you can slide the top portion back so that the back of the deck is at an angle. This can be used in [[card manipulation|card tricks]].

==Semiconductor wafers==
In the [[semiconductor industry]], wafers have two typical edge types: a slanted beveled shape or a rounded bullet shape.  The edges on the beveled types are called the bevel region, and they are typically ground at a 22 degree angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prostek.com/ch_data/Semiconductor%20Wafer%20Edge%20Analysis.pdf |title=Semiconductor Wafer Edge Analysis |publisher=prostek.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002242/http://www.prostek.com/ch_data/Semiconductor%20Wafer%20Edge%20Analysis.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welding==
Beveling and chamfering (along with other profiles) are applied to thicker pieces of metal prior to welding, see [[Welding_joint#V-joints]]. The bevel provides a smooth clean edge to the plate or pipe and allows a weld of the correct shape (to prevent center-line cracking) to join the separate pieces of metal. 

Simple bevels can be used with a backup strip (thin removable sheet behind the plate joint) with chamfers (and a small land) being used on open root welds. Particularly thick plate will have a "J" shaped chamfer or "U" shaped groove to reduce the amount of welding filler metal used.

[[Welding_joint#Cruciform|Cruciform joint]] preparation can involve a double bevel to permit full penetration of each weld to the other, removing a possible void space in the center.

{{listen|filename=Margie on JBS steam calliope.ogg |title='Margie'|description=Performed on the steam calliope of the &lt;br&gt; Str. [[Julia Belle Swain]] |format=[[ogg]]}}

A '''calliope''' (see [[#Pronunciation|below]] for pronunciation) is a [[musical instrument]] that produces sound by sending a gas, originally [[steam]] or more recently [[compressed air]], through large [[whistle]]s—originally locomotive whistles.

A calliope is typically very loud. Even some small calliopes are audible for miles. There is no way to vary [[timbre (music)|tone]] or [[dynamics (music)|loudness]]. Musically, the only [[musical expression|expression]] possible is the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], and [[duration (music)|duration]] of the notes.

The steam calliope is also known as a '''steam [[Pipe organ|organ]]''' or '''steam piano'''. The air-driven calliope is sometimes called a '''calliaphone''', the name given to it by [[Norman Baker (inventor)|Norman Baker]], but the "Calliaphone" name is registered by the Miner Company for instruments produced under the Tangley name.

In the [[Steam power during the Industrial Revolution|age of steam]], the steam calliope was particularly used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a steam supply was already available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied steam from their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-drive [[carousel]]s, or supplied with steam from a [[traction engine]]. The traction engine could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but the presence of other steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.

Calliopes can be played by a player at a [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] or mechanically. Mechanical operation may be by a drum similar to a [[music box]] drum, or by a [[Piano roll|roll]] similar to that of a [[player piano]]. Some instruments have both a keyboard and a mechanism for automated operation, others only one or the other.  Some calliopes can also be played via a [[MIDI]] interface.

The whistles of a calliope are tuned to a [[chromatic scale]], although this process is difficult and must be repeated often to maintain quality sound.  Since the pitch of each note is largely affected by the temperature of the steam, accurate tuning is nearly impossible; however, the off-pitch notes (particularly in the upper register) have become something of a trademark of the steam calliope.  A calliope may have anywhere from 25 to 67 whistles, but 32 is traditional for a steam calliope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/neworleans/music/musichistory/natchezcalliope.html |title=The Steam Calliope on Steamboat Natchez |publisher=Neworleansonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kratz Steam Calliope.jpg|thumbnail|Steam calliope (c. 1901) built by George Kratz and used on the showboat French's ''New Sensation'' at The [[Mariners' Museum]]]]

[[Joshua C. Stoddard]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] patented the calliope on October 9, 1855,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent US 13668: Apparatus for producing music by steam or compressed air.|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/US13668.pdf|publisher=United States Patent Office|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bopp|first1=Ron|title=Whistling By The Numbers (A Survey of the Calliope in the U.S. Patents)|journal=Carousel Organ|date=April 2004|issue=19|page=2|url=http://www.coaa.us/index_archive/Issues_11_to_20/Whistling%20By%20The%20Numbers%20-%20Survey%20of%20Calliope%20Patents_%20Ron%20Bopp__19.pdf|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; though his design echos previous concepts, such as an 1832 instrument called a ''steam trumpet,'' later known as a [[train whistle]]. In 1851, William Hoyt of Dupont, Indiana claimed to have conceived of a device similar to Stoddard's calliope, but he never patented it. Later, an employee of Stoddard's American Music, Arthur S. Denny, attempted to market an "Improved Kalliope" in Europe, but it did not catch on. In 1859, he demonstrated this instrument in [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], London. Unlike other calliopes before or since, Denny's Improved Kalliope let the player control the steam pressure, and therefore the volume of the music, while playing.

While Stoddard originally intended the calliope to replace bells at churches, it found its way onto riverboats during the [[Paddle steamer|paddlewheel]] era. While only a small number of working steamboats still exist, each has a steam calliope. These boats include the ''[[Delta Queen]]'', the ''Belle of Louisville'', and ''[[President (1924 steamboat)|President]]''. Their calliopes are played regularly on river excursions. Many surviving calliopes were built by '''Thomas J. Nichol''', [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], who built calliopes from 1890 until 1932. The Thomas J. Nichol calliopes featured rolled sheet copper (as used in roofing) for the resonant tube (the bell) of the whistle, lending a sweeter tone than cast bronze or brass, which were the usual materials for steam whistles of the day. David Morecraft pioneered a resurgence in the building of authentic steam calliopes of the Thomas J. Nichol style beginning in 1985 in [[Peru, Indiana]]. These calliopes are featured in Peru's annual Circus City Parade.  Morecraft passed away on December 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahlinger |first1=Fred |title=Passing of Dave Morecraft, Steam Calliope Builder |url=https://www.mmdigest.com/Archives/Digests/201612/2016.12.06.01.html |website=Mechanical Music Archives |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoddard's original calliope was attached to a metal roller set with pins in the manner familiar to Stoddard from the contemporary clockwork [[music box]]. The pins on the roller opened valves that admitted steam into the whistles.  Later, Stoddard replaced the cylinder with a keyboard, so that the calliope could be played like an organ.

Starting in the 1900s, calliopes began using [[music roll]]s instead of a live musician. The music roll operated in a similar manner to a [[piano roll]] in a [[player piano]], mechanically operating the keys. Many of these mechanical calliopes retained keyboards, allowing a live musician to play them if needed. During this period, compressed air began to replace steam as the vehicle of producing sound.

Most calliopes disappeared in the mid-20th century, as steam power was replaced with other power sources. Without the demand for technicians that mines and railroads supplied, no support was available to keep boilers running. Only a few calliopes have survived, and these are rarely played.

=={{anchor|Pronunciation}}Pronunciation==

The pronunciation of the word has long been disputed, and often it is pronounced differently inside and outside the groups that use it. The [[Calliope|Greek muse]] by the same name is pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|ə|p|i}} {{respell|kə|LY|ə|pee}}, but the instrument was usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|l|i|oʊ|p}} {{respell|KAL|ee|ohp}} by people who played it. A nineteenth century magazine, ''[[Reedy's Mirror]]'', attempted to settle the dispute by publishing this rhyme:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Pyrophone===
The calliope is similar to the [[pyrophone]]. The difference between the two is that the calliope is an external combustion instrument and the pyrophone is an internal combustion instrument.

At 1998's [[Burning Man]], a pyrophone referred to as ''Satan's Calliope'' was powered by ignition of propane inside resonant cavities.  This device was incorrectly referred to as a "calliope", since a calliope is an external combustion instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hell's Bells: An engineer's devilish art car produces great balls of fire at Burning Man|author=Sarah Phelan|work= Metroactive|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/08.22.01/burningman-0134.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''lustre chantant'' (literally "singing chandelier") or musical lamp, invented by Frederik Kastner, was a large chandelier with glass pipes of varying lengths each illuminated and heated by an individual gas jet. A keyboard allowed the player to turn down individual jets; as the glass tube cooled, a note was produced. Kastner installed several such instruments in Paris.

==Popular culture==
[[The Beatles]], in recording "[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]" from the album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]],'' used tapes of calliope music to create the atmosphere of a circus. Beatles producer [[George Martin]] recalled, "When we first worked on 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' John had said that he wanted to 'smell the sawdust on the floor', wanted to taste the atmosphere of the circus.  I said to him, 'What we need is a calliope.' 'A what?' 'Steam whistles, played by a keyboard.{{'"}} Unable to find an authentic calliope, Martin resorted to tapes of calliopes playing [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]] marches. "[I] chopped the tapes up into small sections and had [[Geoff Emerick]] throw them up into the air, re-assembling them at random."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Additionally, a generalized circus theme was played with a calliope sound through part of the song.

In the web series ''[[Bravest Warriors]]'', there is a theoretical system (similar to [[string theory]]) humorously dubbed the "Space Time Calliope" in which an infinite number of universes and timelines exist. The name is possibly referencing the mechanical complexity of calliopes.

[[File:warman centrifugal pump.jpg|thumb|Warman centrifugal pump in a [[coal preparation plant]] application|300px]]

'''Centrifugal pumps''' are a sub-class of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing [[turbomachinery]].&lt;ref name="Shepard"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shepard, Dennis G.|title=Principles of Turbomachinery |year=1956 |publisher=McMillan |isbn=0-471-85546-4 |lccn=56002849}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centrifugal pumps are used to transport fluids by the conversion of rotational kinetic energy to the hydrodynamic energy of the fluid flow. The rotational energy typically comes from an engine or electric motor. The fluid enters the pump impeller along or near to the rotating axis and is accelerated by the impeller, flowing radially outward into a diffuser or [[Volute (pump)|volute]] chamber (casing), from where it exits.

Common uses include water, sewage, agriculture, petroleum and petrochemical pumping. Centrifugal pumps are often chosen for their high flow rate capabilities, abrasive solution compatibility, mixing potential, as well as their relatively simple engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sprayersupplies.com/sprayer-pump-guide|title=Sprayer Pump Types, Costs, and Specifications|date=2018-10-13|work=Sprayer Supplies|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[centrifugal&amp;nbsp;fan]] is commonly used to implement a [[vacuum&amp;nbsp;cleaner]]. The reverse function of the centrifugal pump is a [[water turbine]] converting potential energy of water pressure into mechanical rotational energy.

==History==

According to Reti, the first machine that could be characterized as a centrifugal pump was a mud lifting machine which appeared as early as 1475 in a treatise by the Italian Renaissance engineer [[Francesco di Giorgio Martini]].&lt;ref name="Ladislao Reti 290"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reti |first=Ladislao |title=Francesco di Giorgio (Armani) Martini's Treatise on Engineering and Its Plagiarists |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=Summer 1963 |pages=287–298 (290) |doi=10.2307/3100858 |last2=Di Giorgio Martini |first2=Francesco}}&lt;/ref&gt; True centrifugal pumps were not developed until the late 17th century, when [[Denis Papin]] built one using straight vanes. The curved vane was introduced by British inventor [[John Appold]] in 1851.

==How it works==
[[File:Centrifugal Pump.png|thumb|right|Cutaway view of centrifugal pump]]

Like most pumps, a centrifugal pump converts rotational energy, often from a motor, to energy in a moving fluid. A portion of the energy goes into kinetic energy of the fluid.  Fluid enters axially through eye of the casing, is caught up in the impeller blades, and is whirled tangentially and radially outward until it leaves through all circumferential parts of the impeller into the diffuser part of the casing. The fluid gains both velocity and pressure while passing through the impeller. The doughnut-shaped diffuser, or scroll, section of the casing decelerates the flow and further increases the pressure. It is important to note that the water is not pushed radially outward by centrifugal force (non-existent force), but rather by inertia, the natural tendency of an object to continue in a straight line (tangent to the radius) when traveling around circle. This can be compared to the way a spin-cycle works in a washing machine.

===Description by Euler===
A consequence of Newton’s second law of mechanics is the conservation of the angular momentum (or the “moment of momentum”) which is of fundamental significance to all turbomachines. Accordingly, the change of the angular momentum is equal to the sum of the external moments. Angular momentums ρ×Q×r×cu at inlet and outlet, an external torque M and friction moments due to shear stresses Mτ are acting on an impeller or a diffuser.

Since no pressure forces are created on cylindrical surfaces in the circumferential direction, it is possible to write Eq. (1.10) as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;\rho Q(c_2 u .r_2 - c_1 u .r_1) = M + M_\tau&lt;/math&gt;   (1.13)

====Euler's pump equation====

Based on Eq.(1.13) Euler developed the head pressure equation created by the impeller see Fig.2.2

:::&lt;math&gt;Yth.g=H_t= c_2u.u_2 - c_1u.u_1 &lt;/math&gt;     (1)

:::&lt;math&gt;Yth=1/2(u_2^2-u_1^2+w_1^2-w_2^2+c_2^2-c_1^2)&lt;/math&gt;        (2)

In Eq. (2) the sum of 4 front element number call static pressure,the sum of last 2 element number call velocity pressure look carefully on the Fig 2.2 and the detail equation.

H&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; theory head pressure  ;    g = between 9.78 and 9.82 m/s2 depending on latitude, [[conventional]] standard value of exactly 9.80665 m/s2    [[barycentre|barycentric]] gravitational acceleration

c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;    inlet absolute velocity vector

c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;    outlet absolute velocity vector

====Velocity Triangle====

The color triangle formed by velocity vector u,c,w called "velocity triangle".  This rule was helpful to detail Eq.(1) become Eq.(2) and wide explained how the pump works.

Fig 2.3 (a) shows triangle velocity of forward curved vanes impeller ; Fig 2.3 (b) shows triangle velocity of radial straight vanes impeller. It illustrates rather clearly energy added to the flow (shown in vector c) inversely change upon flow rate Q (shown in vector c&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Efficiency factor===

&lt;math&gt;\eta = \frac{\rho.gQH}{P_m}&lt;/math&gt;,

where:
:&lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; is the mechanics input power required (W)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the standard acceleration of gravity (9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the energy Head added to the flow (m)
:&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the flow rate (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency of the pump plant as a decimal
The head added by the pump (&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) is a sum of the static lift, the head loss due to friction and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; W, kW) or horsepower (hp*0.746 = kW). The value for the pump efficiency, &lt;math&gt;\eta_{pump}&lt;/math&gt;, may be stated for the pump itself or as a combined efficiency of the pump and motor system.

==Vertical centrifugal pumps==

Vertical centrifugal pumps are also referred to as cantilever pumps. They utilize a unique shaft and bearing support configuration that allows the volute to hang in the sump while the bearings are outside the sump.  This style of pump uses no [[stuffing box]] to seal the shaft but instead utilizes a "throttle bushing".  A common application for this style of pump is in a [[parts washer]].

==Froth pumps==

In the mineral industry, or in the extraction of oilsand, [[froth]] is generated to separate the rich minerals or bitumen from the sand and clays. Froth contains air that tends to block conventional pumps and cause loss of prime. Over history, industry has developed different ways to deal with this problem. In the pulp and paper industry holes are drilled in the impeller. Air escapes to the back of the impeller and a special expeller discharges the air back to the suction tank. The impeller may also feature special small vanes between the primary vanes called split vanes or secondary vanes. Some pumps may feature a large eye, an inducer or recirculation of pressurized froth from the pump discharge back to the suction to break the bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pumping Oilsand Froth |author=Baha Abulnaga |publisher=21st International Pump Users Symposium, Baltimore, Maryland. Published by Texas A&amp;M University, Texas, USA |year=2004 |url=http://turbolab.tamu.edu/proc/pumpproc/P21/01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multistage centrifugal pumps==
[[File:Multistage centrifugal pump.jpg|thumb|Multistage centrifugal pump&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moniz|first1=Paresh Girdhar, Octo|title=Practical centrifugal pumps design, operation and maintenance|date=2004|publisher=Newnes|location=Oxford|isbn=0750662735|page=13|edition=1. publ.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RjnmvQSFvcC&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A centrifugal pump containing two or more impellers is called a multistage centrifugal pump. The impellers may be mounted on the same shaft or on different shafts. At each stage, the fluid is directed to the center before making its way to the discharge on the outer diameter.

For higher pressures at the outlet, impellers can be connected in series. For higher flow output, impellers can be connected in parallel.

A common application of the multistage centrifugal pump is the [[boiler feedwater pump]]. For example, a 350 MW unit would require two feedpumps in parallel. Each feedpump is a multistage centrifugal pump producing 150 l/s at 21 MPa.

All energy transferred to the fluid is derived from the mechanical energy driving the impeller. This can be measured at [[isentropic]] compression, resulting in a slight temperature increase (in addition to the pressure increase).

==Energy usage==
The energy usage in a pumping installation is determined by the flow required, the height lifted and the length and [[Darcy friction factor formulae|friction characteristics]] of the pipeline.
The power required to drive a pump (&lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;), is defined simply using SI units by:

[[File:Centrifugal Pump-mod.jpg|thumb|Single-stage radial-flow centrifugal pump]]

:&lt;math&gt;
P_i= \cfrac{\rho\ g\ H\ Q}{\eta}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; is the input power required (W)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the standard acceleration of gravity (9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the energy Head added to the flow (m)
:&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the flow rate (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s)
:&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the efficiency of the pump plant as a decimal
The head added by the pump (&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) is a sum of the static lift, the head loss due to friction and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; W, kW) or horsepower ('''hp = kW/0.746'''). The value for the pump efficiency, &lt;math&gt;\eta_{pump}&lt;/math&gt;, may be stated for the pump itself or as a combined efficiency of the pump and motor system.

The '''energy usage''' is determined by multiplying the power requirement by the length of time the pump is operating.

[[File:Major causes of pump damage.jpg|thumb|Pie chart showing what causes damage to pumps.]]

==Centrifugal pumps for solids control==
An oilfield solids control system needs many centrifugal pumps to sit on or in mud tanks. The types of centrifugal pumps used are sand pumps, submersible slurry pumps, shear pumps, and charging pumps. They are defined for their different functions, but their working principle is the same.

==Magnetically coupled pumps==
{{main | magnetic coupling}}

Magnetically coupled pumps, or magnetic drive pumps, vary from the traditional pumping style, as the motor is coupled to the pump by magnetic means rather than by a direct mechanical shaft. The pump works via a drive magnet, 'driving' the pump rotor, which is magnetically coupled to the primary shaft driven by the motor.[7] They are often used where leakage of the fluid pumped poses a great risk (e.g., aggressive fluid in the chemical or nuclear industry, or electric shock - garden fountains). They have no direct connection between the motor shaft and the impeller, so no gland is needed. There is no risk of leakage, unless the casing is broken. Since the pump shaft is not supported by bearings outside the pump's [[housing (mechanical)|housing]], support inside the pump is provided by bushings. The pump size of a magnetic drive pumps can go from few Watts power to a giant 1MW.

==Priming==
Most centrifugal pumps are not self-priming. In other words, the pump casing must be filled with liquid before the pump is started, or the pump will not be able to function. If the pump casing becomes filled with vapors or gases, the pump impeller becomes gas-bound and incapable of pumping. To ensure that a centrifugal pump remains primed and does not become gas-bound, most centrifugal pumps are located below the level of the source from which the pump is to take its suction. The same effect can be gained by supplying liquid to the pump suction under pressure supplied by another pump placed in the suction line.

===Self priming centrifugal pump===
In normal conditions, common centrifugal pumps are unable to evacuate the air from an inlet line leading to a fluid level whose geodetic altitude is below that of the pump. Self-priming pumps have to be capable of evacuating air (see Venting) from the pump suction line without any external auxiliary devices.

Centrifugal pumps with an internal suction stage such as water jet pumps or side channel pumps are also classified as self-priming pumps.

Centrifugal pumps which are not designed with an internal or external self-priming stage can only start to pump the fluid after the pump has initially been primed with the fluid. Sturdier but slower, their impellers are designed to move water which is far denser than air, leaving them unable to operate when air is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pumpsalesdirect.co.uk/blog/how-do-self-priming-pumps-work/|title=How do self-priming pumps work?|date=2018-05-11|work=Pump Sales Direct Blog|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a suction-side swing check valve or a vent valve must be fitted to prevent any siphon action and ensure that the fluid remains in the casing when the pump has been stopped. In self-priming centrifugal pumps with a separation chamber the fluid pumped and the entrained air bubbles are pumped into the separation chamber by the impeller action.

The air escapes through the pump discharge nozzle whilst the fluid drops back down and is once more entrained by the impeller. The suction line is thus continuously evacuated. The design required for such a self-priming feature has an adverse effect on pump efficiency. Also, the dimensions of the separating chamber are relatively large. For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and water ring pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.

This pump type operates without a foot valve and without an evacuation device on the suction side. The pump has to be primed with the fluid to be handled prior to commissioning. 
Two-phase mixture is pumped until the suction line has been evacuated and the fluid level has been pushed into the front suction intake chamber by atmospheric pressure. During normal pumping operation this pump works like an ordinary centrifugal pump.

'''Cherrapunji''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Cherrapunji.ogg|ˌ|tʃ|ɛ|r|ə|ˈ|p|ʌ|n|dʒ|i|,_|-|ˈ|p|ʊ|n|-}}; with the native name '''[[Sohra]]''' being more commonly used, and can also be spelled '''Cherrapunjee''' or '''Cherrapunji''') is a subdivisional town in the [[East Khasi Hills district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Meghalaya]]. It is the traditional capital of aNongkhlaw ''hima'' (Khasi tribal chieftainship constituting a petty state), both known as [[Sohra]] or Churra.

Cherrapunji has often been credited as being the wettest place on Earth, but for now nearby [[Mawsynram]] currently holds that distinction. Cherrapunji still holds the all-time record for the most rainfall in a calendar month and in a year, however: it received {{convert|9300|mm|in ft}} in July 1861 and {{convert|26461|mm|in ft}} between 1 August 1860 and 31 July 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/10000/greatest-monthly-rainfall- |title=Most annual rainfall |accessdate=2012-05-07 |work=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of the [[Khasi people]] – native inhabitants of Cherrapunji – may be traced from the early part of the 16th century. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, these people were ruled by their tribal 'Syiems (rajas or chiefs) of Khyriem' in the [[Khasi Hills]]. The Khasis hills came under British authority in 1883 with the submission of the last of the important Syiems, Tirot Sing.

The main pivot on which the entire superstructure of Khasi society rests is the matrilineal system.{{fact|date=December 2012}}

The original name for this town was Sohra (soh-ra), which was pronounced "Churra" by the British. This name eventually evolved into the current name, Cherrapunji, meaning 'land of oranges', which was first used by tourists from other parts of India.
[[File:1947-Khasi states.png|thumb|450px]]
Despite abundant rainfall, Cherrapunji faces an acute water shortage and the inhabitants often have to trek very long distances to obtain potable water.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news

The Meghalaya state government has renamed Cherrapunji back to its original name, "Sohra". There is a monument to David Scott (British Administrator in NE India, 1802–31) in the Cherrapunji cemetery.

Cherrapunji is located at {{Coord|25.30|N|91.70|E|}}. It has an average elevation of {{convert|1484|m|ft}} and sits on a plateau in the southern part of the [[Khasi Hills]], facing the plains of [[Bangladesh]]. The plateau rises 660 meters above the surrounding valleys.

Soils on the plateau are poor owing to [[deforestation]] and [[Washout (erosion)|washout]] caused by heavy rainfall. Owing to winter droughts, the vegetation in this location is even [[xerophytic]] in spite of the fame of Cherrapunji as an extremely wet place. Additional pressure on local [[ecosystem]]s is created by the rapid increase of the population — from a Sohra-area population of 7,000 in 1960, it grew to over 100,000 by 2000.&lt;ref name="wondermondo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/As/India/Meghalaya/Cherrapunji.htm |title=Cherrapunji (Sohra) |accessdate=2010-08-29 |date=2010-08-28 |publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valleys around Cherrapunji, however, are covered with lush and very diverse vegetation, containing numerous endemic species of plants, including [[Meghalaya subtropical forests]]. Although there is heavy rainfall in Cherrapunji, there is a high [[water scarcity|scarcity]] of clean water.

There are some interesting living root bridges in Cherrapunjee like the Umshiang root bridge, Mawsaw root bridge, Ritymmen root bridge etc. 

The [[Shillong Plateau]] is an uplifted horst-like feature, bounded by the E-W Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) to the North, the N-S Jamuna fault in the west, and the NW-SE kopilli fracture zone in the east.

Sohra or Cherrapunji has a mild [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwb''), with [[monsoon]]al influences typical of India. The city's annual rainfall average stands at {{convert|11777|mm|in}}.&lt;ref name="weather1"&gt;{{cite web
 | url =http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/i/IN42515.php
 | title =Average Conditions Cherrapunji, India
 | accessdate = March 2010
 | publisher =Climate Charts }}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure places it behind only nearby [[Mawsynram]], Meghalaya, whose average is {{convert|11873|mm|in}}. Cherrapunji receives both the southwest and northeast [[monsoon]]al winds, giving it a single monsoon season. It lies on the [[windward]] side of the [[Khasi Hills]], so the resulting [[orographic lift]] enhances precipitation. In the winter months it receives the northeast monsoon showers that travel down the [[Brahmaputra]] valley. The driest months are November, December, January and February. 

Temperatures average {{convert|11.5|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|20.6|°C|1}} in August, and the annual mean is {{convert|17.3|°C|1}}

Cherrapunji holds two [[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness]] world records for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single year: {{convert|26,471|mm|in}} of rainfall between August 1860 and July 1861 and for receiving the maximum amount of rainfall in a single month: {{convert|9300|mm|in}} in July 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness World Records 2005; pg-51 {{ISBN|0-85112-192-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of high rainfall===
{{norefs|section|date = December 2014}}
[[File:Nohkalikai Falls.JPG|thumb|Nohkalikai falls]]
[[File:Nohkalikai falls.jpg|thumb|Seven Sisters' falls]]
Cherrapunji receives rains from the [[Bay of Bengal]] arm of the [[Monsoon#Southwest monsoon|Indian summer monsoon]]. The monsoon clouds fly unhindered over the plains of [[Bangladesh]] for about 400&amp;nbsp;km. Thereafter, they hit the [[Khasi Hills]] which rise abruptly from the plains to a height of about 1,370&amp;nbsp;m above [[mean sea level]] within 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;km. The geography of the hills with many deep valley channels encompassing the low-flying (150–300&amp;nbsp;m) moisture-laden clouds from a wide area converges over Cherrapunji. The winds push the rain clouds through these gorges and up the steep slopes. The rapid ascent of the clouds into the upper atmosphere hastens the cooling and helps vapours to condense. Most of Cherrapunji's rain is the result of air being lifted as a large body of water vapour. The extreme amount of rainfall at Cherrapunji is perhaps the best-known feature of [[Orographic precipitation#Orographic|orographic rain]] in northeast India.

Occasionally, cloudbursts can occur in one part of Cherrapunji while other areas may be totally or relatively dry, reflecting the high spatial variability of the rainfall. Atmospheric humidity is extremely high during the peak monsoon period.

The major part of the rainfall at Cherrapunji can be attributed to the orographic features. When the clouds are blown over the hills from the south, they are funneled through the valley. The clouds strike Cherrapunjee perpendicularly and the low flying clouds are pushed up the steep slopes. It is not surprising to find that the heaviest rainfalls occur when the winds blow directly on the Khasi Hills.

A notable feature of monsoon rain at Cherrapunji is that most of it falls in the morning. This could be partly due to two air masses coming together. During the monsoon months, the prevailing winds along the [[Brahmaputra]] valley generally blow from the east or the northeast, but the winds over [[Meghalaya]] are from the south. These two winds systems usually come together in the vicinity of the Khasi Hills. Apparently, the winds that are trapped in the valley at night begin their upward ascent only after they are warmed during the day. This partially explains the frequency of morning rainfall. Apart from orographic features, atmospheric convection plays an important role during the monsoon and the period just preceding it.

'''Christi Leigh Craddick''' (born July 1, 1970) is one of three members of the [[Railroad Commission of Texas|Texas Railroad Commission]], the elected regulatory body over [[oil]], [[natural gas]], utilities, and surface mining first established in 1891. She is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. The commission ended all controls over railroads in 2005 but is still known as the "Railroad Commission"  for historical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/it-time-call-texas-railroad-commission-what-it-actually|title=Jason Cohen, "Is It Time to Call the Texas Railroad Commission What It Actually Is?" December 20, 2012|publisher=texasmonthly.com|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A native of [[Midland, Texas]], Craddick won her seat in the [[general election]] held on [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|November 6, 2012]], in conjunction with the [[U.S. President|presidential]] contest.

==Background==

Craddick's father is [[Texas House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Tom Craddick]], a Midland [[business]]man who was the [[Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the Texas House from 2003 to 2009. Her mother is the former Nadine Nayfa, of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] descent and originally from [[Sweetwater, Texas|Sweetwater]] in [[Nolan County, Texas|Nolan County]] in [[West Texas]]. She has a brother, Thomas Russell Craddick, Jr. (born 1973). Craddick has a daughter, Catherine. The Craddicks are [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christicraddick.com/about-christi-craddick|title=About Christi Craddick|publisher=christicraddick.com|accessdate=August 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515150141/http://www.christicraddick.com/about-christi-craddick|archivedate=May 15, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craddick graduated from [[Midland High School (Midland, Texas)|Midland High School]], obtained her undergraduate degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and received her [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/137832/christi-craddick|title=Christi Craddick|publisher=votesmart.org|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election as Railroad Commissioner==
===2012 primary===
Craddick's path to victory surged in the Republican [[runoff election]] held on July 31, 2012, when she easily defeated then State Representative [[Warren Chisum]] of [[Pampa, Texas|Pampa]] in [[Gray County, Texas|Gray County]] in the [[Texas Panhandle]]. Chisum is a former state legislative lieutenant of Tom Craddick. In that same election, most of the attention had focused not on the Craddick-Chisum race but on [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[Ted Cruz]], who defeated [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|Lieutenant Governor]] [[David Dewhurst]] for the Republican nomination to succeed [[U.S. Senator]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]]. Craddick raised triple the campaign contributions of Chisum, more than $1 million compared to $375,000, but Chisum had access to another $600,000 that he had accumulated earlier as a legislator. Craddick enjoyed the support of such wealthy donors as the entrepreneur [[James R. Leininger]] of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] and the late homebuilder [[Bob J. Perry]] of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].&lt;ref name=rangel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2012-06-03/chisum-faces-uphill-battle-new-seat|title=Enrique Rangel, "Chisum faces uphill battle for new seat"|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', June 3, 2012|accessdate=June 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craddick polled 589,211 votes (60 percent); Chisum, 396,858 ballots (40 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/july31_162_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=1397&amp;id=463|title=Republican runoff election results, July 31, 2012|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===2012 general election===
Craddick thereafter defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[nominee]], Dale P. Henry (born 1930), a retired [[Petroleum engineering|petroleum engineer]] from [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]] in [[Central Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c3.thevoterguide.org/v/dallas12/race-detail.do?id=10254359|title=Voter Guide|publisher=c3.thevoterguide.org|accessdate=December 31, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233453/http://c3.thevoterguide.org/v/dallas12/race-detail.do?id=10254359|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry had also lost two earlier races for the railroad commission, in 2006 to Republican [[Elizabeth Ames Jones]] and in the Democratic primary for that same office in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Craddick polled 4,336,499 votes (56 percent); Henry,  3,057,733  (40 percent). The remaining 4 percent was cast for two minor-party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=Texas general election returns, November 6, 2012 |publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109062336/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=January 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craddick succeeded [[Elizabeth Ames Jones]] of San Antonio, who vacated the seat in February 2012. Jones ran for the [[Texas Senate, District 25|District 25]] seat in the [[Texas State Senate]], which was ultimately won by the Republican physician [[Donna Campbell]] of [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]], who unseated incumbent Senator [[Jeff Wentworth]], a [[Moderate Republican]] from San Antonio, in the party runoff on July 31. Interim commissioner [[Buddy Garcia]], an appointee of [[governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasroyaltycouncil.com/2012/04/gov-rick-perry-has-appointed-h-s-buddy-garcia-of-austin-to-the-railroad-commission-of-texas-for-a-term-to-expire-at-the-next-general-election/ |title=Gov.

Craddick's two Republican colleagues on the railroad commission were [[David J. Porter]] of [[Giddings, Texas|Giddings]] in [[Lee County, Texas|Lee County]], formerly of Midland, and the former chairman, [[Barry Smitherman]], formerly of Houston. Smitherman, elected to a two-year unexpired term in 2012, did not seek a full six-year term in 2014; he instead ran for [[Attorney General of Texas|Texas attorney general]] to succeed [[Greg Abbott]], but came in third place in the Republican primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/24/smitherman-announces-run-attorney-general/|title=Reeve Hamilton, Smitherman to Announce Run for Attorney General, June 24, 2013|publisher=texastribune.org|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=electionresults&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=3948&amp;id=969|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307051116/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=3948&amp;id=969|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 7, 2014|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=team1.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, when veteran Democratic member [[James E. Nugent]] was unseated by [[Charles Matthews (Texas politician)|Charles R. Matthews]], all railroad commissioners have been Republicans. Both Craddick and Porter have ties to the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] of Midland/[[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]].&lt;ref name=midland/&gt;

===Political analysis===
Mark Jones, a [[political scientist]] at [[Rice University]], attributed  Craddick's victory over Chisum to the "respect" within the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] for her father. Tom Craddick is the longest-serving Republican legislator in Austin, having first been elected in 1968. He lost the Speakership in 2009 to [[Joe Straus]], a moderate Republican from San Antonio, who initially prevailed through a coalition of mostly Democrats and sixteen maverick Republicans.&lt;ref name=midland&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mywesttexas.com/top_stories/article_e5132631-9b4c-580f-b2da-815daec739f1.html|title=Christi Craddick's ascension puts family in elite company, December 23, 2012|publisher=mywesttexas.com|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Midland Mayor [[Ernest Angelo]], a one-time [[Texas Republican Party|Texas Republican National Committeeman]], said that Craddick succeeded because she gained credibility with large Republican donors and traveled by highway to meet with the [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[grassroots]] and women's groups. According to Angelo, Tom Craddick's neighbor of many years, Christi Craddick "showed she will do what it takes to win a state primary. She earned it."&lt;ref name=midland/&gt;

From the start of her term as commissioner, Craddick has been critical of federal intervention into the energy industries: "Texas knows how energy regulation is done. People ought to be modeling themselves after us, instead of ... the [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]," she told an energy policy group in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasobserver.org/anti-federal-sentiment-dominates-discussion-of-texas-oil-and-gas-industr/|title=Beth Cortez-Neavel, "Anti-Federal Sentiment Dominates Discussion of Texas Oil and Gas Industry", January 10, 2013|publisher=texasobserver.org|accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, she was unanimously elected as the chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/about-us/commissioners/craddick/news/081214/|title=Christi Craddick Elected Chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission, August 12, 2014|publisher=www.rrc.state.tx.us/|accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 reelection===
On March 16, 2018, Craddick with nearly 76 percent of the vote defeated her Republican primary opponent, Weston Martinez of [[San Antonio]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/mar06_325_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=6584&amp;id=856 2018 Republican Party Primary Election: Election Night Returns].

''American Statesman.'' March 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Craddick polled 4,356,658 votes (53.2 percent) to McAllen's 3,588,625 ballots (43.9 percent). Another 236,720 votes (2.9 percent) went to the Libertarian Party nominee, Mike Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/nov06_331_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=8370&amp;id=374|title=Election Returns|date=November 6, 2018|publisher=[[Texas Secretary of State]]|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victor Tatin aeroplane 1879.jpg|thumb|The [[Victor Tatin]]  airplane of 1879 used a compressed-air engine for propulsion. Original craft, at [[Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace]].]]
[[File:Plongeur Rochefort top and side views.jpg|thumb|The first mechanically powered [[submarine]], the 1863 ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'', used a compressed-air engine. [[Musée de la Marine (Rochefort)]].]]

A '''compressed-air vehicle''' ('''CAV''') is a transport mechanism fueled by tanks of pressurized [[atmospheric]] [[gas]] and propelled by the release and expansion of the gas within a [[Pneumatic motor]].  CAV's have found application in [[torpedoes]], locomotives used in digging tunnels, and early prototype [[submarines]]. Potential environmental advantages have generated public interest in CAV's as passenger cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/10/what_about_comp.php |title=What About Compressed Air Cars? |publisher=TreeHugger |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have not been competitive due to the low energy density of [[compressed air]] and inefficiency of the compression / expansion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioamatore.info/attachments/article/1600/Thermodynamic%20Analysis%20of.pdf |title=Thermodynamic Analysis of Compressed Air Vehicle Propulsion |author=Ulf Bossel |year=2004 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compressed-air propulsion may also be incorporated in hybrid systems, such as with [[battery electric propulsion]]. This kind of system is called a hybrid-pneumatic electric propulsion. Additionally, [[regenerative braking]] can also be used in conjunction with this system.

== Tanks ==

{{Main|Compressed air tank}}
The tanks must be designed to safety standards appropriate for a [[pressure vessel]], such as [[ISO 11439]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=33298 |title=Gas cylinders – High pressure cylinders for the on-board storage of natural gas as a fuel for automotive vehicles |publisher=Iso.org |date=2006-07-18 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage tank may be made of metal or composite materials. The fiber materials are considerably lighter than metals but generally more expensive. Metal tanks can withstand a large number of pressure cycles, but must be checked for corrosion periodically.

One company stores air in tanks at 4,500 [[pounds per square inch]] (about 30 MPa) and hold nearly 3,200 cubic feet (around 90 cubic metres) of air.&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/20071/page2/ |title=The Air Car Preps for Market |publisher=Technology Review |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tanks may be refilled at a service station equipped with heat exchangers, or in a few hours at home or in [[parking lot]]s, plugging the car into the [[electrical grid]] via an on-board [[Gas compressor|compressor]]. The cost of driving such a car is typically projected to be around €0.75 per 100&amp;nbsp;km, with a complete refill at the "tank-station" at about US$3.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Compressed air ==

[[Compressed air]] has a low [[energy density]]. In 300 bar containers, about 0.1 MJ/L and 0.1 MJ/kg is achievable, comparable to the values of electrochemical lead-acid batteries. While batteries can somewhat maintain their voltage throughout their discharge and chemical fuel tanks provide the same power densities from the first to the last litre, the pressure of compressed air tanks falls as air is drawn off. A consumer-automobile of conventional size and shape typically consumes 0.3–0.5 kWh (1.1–1.8 MJ) at the drive shaft&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedace.info/electric_cars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; per mile of use, though unconventional sizes may perform with significantly less.

== Emission output ==

Like other non-combustion energy storage technologies, an air vehicle displaces the emission source from the vehicle's tail pipe to the central electrical generating plant. Where low emissions sources are available, net production of pollutants can be reduced. Emission control measures at a central generating plant may be more effective and less costly than treating the emissions of widely dispersed vehicles.

Since the compressed air is filtered to protect the compressor machinery, the air discharged has less suspended dust in it, though there may be carry-over of lubricants used in the engine. The car works when gas expands.

== History ==

Compressed air has been used since the 19th century to power [[mining|mine]] [[locomotives]] and trams in cities such as Paris (via a central, city-level, [[Compressed air energy storage#History|compressed air energy distribution system]]), and was previously the basis of naval [[torpedo]] propulsion.

During the construction of the [[Gotthardbahn]] from 1872 to 1882, pneumatic locomotives were used in the construction of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]] and other tunnels of the Gotthardbahn.

In 1903, the Liquid Air Company located in London England manufactured a number of compressed-air and liquified-air cars. The major problem with these cars and all compressed-air cars is the lack of torque produced by the "engines" and the cost of compressing the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.didik.com/ev_hist.htm |title=History and Directory of Electric Cars from 1834 to 1987 |publisher=Didik.com |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, several companies have started to develop [[compressed air car#Developers and manufacturers|compressed air cars]] including hybrid types that also include a petrol driven engine; none has been released to the public, or have been tested by third parties.

== Advantages ==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2010|reason=every claim needs a reliable source}}
Compressed-air vehicles are comparable in many ways to [[electric vehicle]]s, but use compressed air to store the energy instead of batteries. Their potential advantages over other vehicles include:
* Much like electrical vehicles, air powered vehicles would ultimately be powered through the electrical grid. Which makes it easier to focus on reducing pollution from one source, as opposed to the millions of vehicles on the road.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* Transportation of the fuel would not be required due to drawing power off the electrical grid. This presents significant cost benefits. Pollution created during fuel transportation would be eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* Compressed-air technology reduces the cost of vehicle production by about 20%, because there is no need to build a [[Radiator|cooling]] system, fuel tank, Ignition Systems or [[Muffler|silencers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/10/what_about_comp.php |title=What About Compressed Air Cars? |publisher=TreeHugger |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The engine can be massively reduced in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineair.com.au/airmotor.htm |title=Engineair |publisher=Engineair |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The engine runs on cold or warm air, so can be made of lower strength light weight material such as [[aluminium]], plastic, low friction [[teflon]] or a combination.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* Low manufacture and maintenance costs as well as easy maintenance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* Compressed-air tanks can be disposed of or recycled with less pollution than batteries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* Compressed-air vehicles are unconstrained by the degradation problems associated with current battery systems.&lt;ref name="technologyreview.com"/&gt;
* The air tank may be refilled more often and in less time than batteries can be recharged, with re-filling rates comparable to liquid fuels.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
* Lighter vehicles cause less damage to roads, resulting in lower maintenance cost.
* The price of filling air powered vehicles is significantly cheaper than petrol, diesel or biofuel. If electricity is cheap, then compressing air will also be relatively cheap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

== Disadvantages ==
[[File:2013-03-05 Geneva Motor Show 8120.JPG|thumb|PSA Peugeot Citroën Hybrid Air concept exhibited at the 2013 [[Geneva Motor Show]].]]
The principal disadvantage is the indirect use of energy. Energy is used to compress air, which – in turn – provides the energy to run the motor. Any conversion of energy between forms results in loss. For conventional combustion motor cars, the energy is lost when oil is converted to usable fuel – including drilling, refinement, labor, storage, eventually transportation to the end-user. For compressed-air cars, energy is lost when electrical energy is converted to compressed air, and when fuel, whether coal, natural gas or nuclear, is burned to drive the electrical generators.
* When air expands, as it would in the engine, it cools dramatically ([[Charles's law]]) and must be heated to ambient temperature using a heat exchanger similar to the [[Intercooler]] used for internal combustion engines. The heating is necessary in order to obtain a significant fraction of the theoretical energy output. The heat exchanger can be problematic. While it performs a similar task to the [[Intercooler]], the temperature difference between the incoming air and the working gas is smaller. In heating the stored air, the device gets very cold and may ice up in cool, moist climates.
* Refueling the compressed-air container using a home or low-end conventional air compressor may take as long as 4 hours, while the specialized equipment at service stations may fill the tanks in only 3 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeropollutionmotors.us/gallery/faq/|title=FAQ for the Airpod {{!}} Zero Pollution Motors|website=zeropollutionmotors.us|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tanks get very hot when filled rapidly. SCUBA tanks are sometimes immersed in water to cool them down when they are being filled. That would not be possible with tanks in  a car and thus it would either take a long time to fill the tanks, or they would have to take less than a full charge, since heat drives up the pressure. However, if well insulated, such as Dewar (vacuum) flask design, the heat would not have to be lost but put to use when the car was running.
* Early tests have demonstrated the limited storage capacity of the tanks; the only published test of a vehicle running on compressed air alone was limited to a range of {{convert|7.22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070321053002/http://www.theaircar.com/tests.html MDI refilling stations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2005 study demonstrated that cars running on [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] out-perform both compressed-air and [[fuel cell vehicle]]s more than threefold at same speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wind-to-Wheel Energy Assessment |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E18.pdf |format=PDF |author=Patrick Mazza |author2=Roel Hammerschlag |publisher=Institute for Lifecycle Environmental Assessment |accessdate=2008-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911042043/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E18.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AIRPod|MDI]] has recently claimed that an air car will be able to travel {{convert|140|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in urban driving, and have a range of {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} with a top speed of {{convert|110|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} on highways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdi.lu/eng/affiche_eng.php?page=minicats |title=MDI Enterprises S.A |publisher=Mdi.lu |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; when operating on compressed air alone.

== Possible improvements ==

Compressed-air vehicles operate according to a [[thermodynamic process]] because air cools down when expanding and heats up when being compressed. Since it is not practical to use a theoretically ideal process, losses occur and improvements may involve reducing these, e.g., by using large heat exchangers in order to use heat from the ambient air and at the same time provide air cooling in the passenger compartment. At the other end, the heat produced during compression can be stored in water systems, physical or chemical systems and reused later.

It may be possible to store compressed air at lower pressure using an absorption material within the tank. Absorption materials like [[Activated carbon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=108390 |title=National Science Foundation (NSF) News – From Farm Waste to Fuel Tanks – US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[metal organic framework]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0771639 | volume=130 | title=Metal-Organic Framework from an Anthracene Derivative Containing Nanoscopic Cages Exhibiting High Methane Uptake | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=1012–1016 | author=Ma Shengqian}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for storing [[compressed natural gas]] at 500 psi instead of 4500 psi, which amounts to a large energy saving.

=== Production cars ===
{{Main|Compressed air car}}
Several companies are investigating and producing [[prototype]]s including hybrid compressed-air/gasoline-combustion vehicles.  As of August 2017, none of the [[Compressed air car#Developers and manufacturers|developers]] have yet gone into production, although Tata has indicated they will begin selling vehicles from 2020&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tata Motors' air-powered car project still on, to be launch ready in 3 years|url=http://www.autocarpro.in/news-national/tata-motors-air-powered-car-project-launch-23659|website=Auto Car Professional|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Motor Development International|MDI]]'s US distributor Zero Pollution Motors says production of the [[AIRPod]] will commence in Europe in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeropollutionmotors.us/|website=Zero Pollution Motors|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experimental cars and bikes ===
In 2008, a compressed air and [[natural gas]] powered vehicle designed by engineering students at [[Deakin University]] in Australia was joint winner of the [[Ford Motor Company]] T2 competition to produce a car with a 200&amp;nbsp;km range and a cost of less than $7,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deakin Green Car Showcased in Ford Global Challenge|url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/media-releases/articles/2008/deakin-green-car-showcased-in-ford-global-challenge|website=Deakin University|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Model T Design Challenge: the winners|url=http://www.carbodydesign.com/archive/2008/10/03-ford-model-t-design-challenge-winners/|website=Car Body Design|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian company Engineair has produced a number of vehicle types - moped, small car, small carrier, go-cart - around the rotary compressed air engine created by [[Angelo Di Pietro (inventor)|Angelo Di Pietro]].  The company is seeking partners to utilise its engine.[http://www.engineair.com.au/]

A compressed-air powered motorcycle, called the Green Speed Air Powered Motorcycle was made by Edwin Yi Yuan, based on the Suzuki GP100 and using the Angelo Di Pietro compressed-air engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-bikes-green-speed-air-powered-motorcycle-aims-to-smash-land-speed-record/ Green Speed Air Powered Motorcycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218141158/http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-bikes-green-speed-air-powered-motorcycle-aims-to-smash-land-speed-record/ |date=2011-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three mechanical engineering students from [[San Jose State University]]; Daniel Mekis, Dennis Schaaf and Andrew Merovich, designed and built a bike that runs on compressed air.  The total cost of the prototype was under $1000 and was sponsored by Sunshops (on the Boardwalk in [[Santa Cruz, California]]) and NO DIG NO RIDE (from [[Aptos, California]].). The top speed of the maiden voyage in May 2009 was 23&amp;nbsp;mph https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBeky4EuyBc.
While their design was simple (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBeky4EuyBc), these three pioneers of compressed air powered vehicles helped pave the way{{cn|date=April 2018}} for French automaker Peugeot Citreon to invent a brand new air-powered hybrid. The 'Hybrid Air' system uses compressed air to move the car's wheels when driving under 43&amp;nbsp;mph. Peugeot says the new hybrid system should get up to 141 miles per gallon of gas. Models should roll out as early as 2016. http://screen.yahoo.com/hybrid-car-runs-air-001013615.html. The head of the project left Peugeot in 2014 and in 2015 the company said it had been unable to find a partner to share the development costs, effectively ending the project. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.lesechos.fr/11/01/2015/lesechos.fr/0204071426759_psa---la-revolution-de-l-hybrid-air-n-aura-pas-lieu.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

"Ku:Rin" named air-compressed three-wheeler vehicle was created by [[Toyota]] in 2011. The speciality about this vehicle is it has registered a record-breaking highest speed 129.2&amp;nbsp;km/h (80&amp;nbsp;mph) even if it has engine which uses only compressed air. This car was developed by the companies "Dream car workshop". This car is nicknamed as "sleek rocket", or "pencil shaped rocket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-09-toyota-three-wheeler-mph-compressed-air.html |title=Toyota three-wheeler does 80.3 mph on compressed air |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the TV-show [[Planet Mechanics]], [[Jem Stansfield]] and [[Dick Strawbridge]] converted a regular scooter to a compressed air moped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/watch/program_details.aspx?id_program=2096 Compressed air moped conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401235339/http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/watch/program_details.aspx?id_program=2096 |date=April 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been done by equipping the scooter with a compressed-air engine and air tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1549/69/ |title=Compressed air moped being built by Jem Stansfield |publisher=Ecogeek.org |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Honda presented the Honda Air concept car at the LA Auto Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenoptimistic.com/2010/10/22/honda-air-compressed-air-car/ |title=Honda Air concept car |publisher=Greenoptimistic.com |date=2010-10-22 |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trains, Trams, Boats and Planes ===
Compressed-air locomotives are a kind of [[fireless locomotive]] and have been used in mining&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/comprair/comprair.htm Compressed-Air Propulsion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and tunnel boring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific American]] cover 1916-11-25 [http://www.magazineart.org/main.php/v/technical/scientificamerican/ScientificAmerican1916-11-25.jpg.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various compressed-air-powered trams were trialled, starting in 1876.  In [[Nantes]] and [[Paris]] such trams ran in regular service for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tramwayinfo.com/Defair.htm |title=Tramway Information |publisher=Tramwayinfo.com |accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, no water or air vehicles exist that make use of the compressed air engine. Historically certain [[torpedo]]es were propelled by compressed-air engines.

'''Cotton production in China''' pertains to [[cotton]] which is the prime cash crop of China. Its production is the highest in the world (in excess of 20 percent of world production) since 1982 until recently overtaken by India. Twenty four of the 35 provinces of China grow cotton with nearly 300 million people involved in its production. It is the main input for textile industry of the country with cotton textiles now accounting for 80% use vis-a-vis 95% in the 1950s. The cotton textile industry employs over 10 million people.&lt;ref name=Zhuto&gt;{{Cite web|last=Zhuo|first=Zhu|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02664509|title=A study on rational location of the cotton production in China|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sector&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.ch/etu/publications/Synth_China.PDF|format=pdf|title=The Cotton Sector in China|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher= United Nations Environment Programme|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its production in 2012–13 was 7.6 million tons but in 2013–14 it dropped to 7 million tons.{{Sfn|Meador| Xinping|2013|p=3}} Historically, its introduction in China is considered a  'southernization', crop which originated from southern Asia (India) during the "proto-globalization" period.&lt;ref name=Zurndorfer&gt;{{Cite web|last= Zurndorfer |first= Harriet T.

==History==
Cotton, which is called ''mian'' ({{lang|zh|棉}}) or ''mumian'' ({{lang|zh|木棉}}) in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] was first reported from an area now known as [[Yunnan]], some time around 200 BC.&lt;ref name=Zurndorfer/&gt; Lao-ai tribe in the southwest border region is reported to have produced quality cotton cloth around 25–220 CE. In the [[Tarim Basin]] archaeological finds of cotton cloth on [[mummies]] dated around 1,000 BC have also been reported. In the early [[Han dynasty]] period in [[Siachen]] in Western China, around 100 BC, quality cotton cloth has been noted. From all these documented and archaeological evidences, a historian has called the introduction of cotton in the country as "southernization" during which period the cotton species introduced were ''[[Gossypium herbaceum]]'' (an Afro-Asian species) and ''[[Gossypium arboreum]]'' and ''[[Gossypium hardense]]'' from India; the latter species were grown in [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian province]]s during the ninth century AD but were blocked for introduction into [[Sichuan]] province due to a strong silk lobby.&lt;ref name=Zurndorfer/&gt; However, adoption of scientific methods of cultivation came into practice only from 1949.&lt;ref name=Dai/&gt;

==Area under cotton==
[[File:Yangxin-County-cotton-field-0049.jpg|right|thumb| Cotton cultivation in Yangxin County]]
The cotton sown area accounts for about 30 percent of the total sown area of all the various cash crops. The major regions, according where cotton is a prime crop are the [[Xinjiang Autonomous Region]], the [[Yangtze River Basin]] (including provinces of [[Jiangxi]] and [[Hubei]]), and the [[Yellow River|Huang]]-[[Huai River|Huai]] Region (mainly in provinces of Hebei, [[Henan]], and [[Shandong]]).&lt;ref name=Sector/&gt;{{Rp|60}} However, according to agroclimatic regions they are under three zones of the northwest inland cotton region, the [[Yellow River]] valley region and the [[Yangtze River]] valley region, which together account for 99.5% area under cotton with a total yield of 99.7%. The area planted in 2012 was 5.3 million hectares and the average lint yield was {{Convert|1438|kg}} per ha.&lt;ref name=Dai&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Dai|first1= Jianlong|last2=Dong|first2= Hezhong |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378429013003237|title=Intensive cotton farming technologies in China: Achievements, challenges and countermeasures|date=January 2014|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Science Direct Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties of cotton==
Both [[Bt cotton]] and non Bt cotton varieties are used in China. Bt cotton is a major [[Genetically modified crop]], which is adopted for commercial production. This was introduced after several field trials in cotton growing provinces and found to be economically profitable in terms of not only production but also revenue. It was introduced in 2002 in about 45% of country’s total area under cotton as it also proved to have better pest resistance. The Hybrid (F1) Bt cotton, developed after crossing with a non-Bt line, has found favour in southern China because of higher yield due to better methods of farming such as seedling transplantation and planting at lower population density. Now Bollgard Bt cotton is adopted in 55% of cropped area while 45% area is planted with China’s own Bt cotton.&lt;ref name=Dong&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dong|first= Hezhong |url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/mar252004/778.pdf|format=pdf|title=Development of hybrid Bt cotton in China– A successful integration of transgenic technology and conventional techniques|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to the [[FAO]] statistics for 2012, cotton production was 6.84 million tonnes with cotton seed production of 13.68 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/desktopdefault.aspx#ancor|title=Final 2012 Data and Preliminary 2013 Data for 5 major commodity aggregates|accessdate=15 November 2015|publisher=Food And Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crops grown are under intensive cotton cultivation practices, typically with Chinese adaptations covering special seedling transplanting (since 1950's), plastic mulching since 1979, plant training and double cropping of the cotton–wheat (''Triticum aestivum'') system (from 1980s to 1990s). Another practice introduced extensively since 1980 is the adoption of high-yielding cultivation pattern known as "short-dense-early" in the northwestern inland areas which is stated to have contributed to China achieving the status of world number one in cotton production.&lt;ref name=Dai/&gt;

'''Crookwell Wind Farm''', located at [[Crookwell]] west of [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[New South Wales]], consists of eight 600&amp;nbsp;kW [[wind turbines]] giving a total capacity of 4.8&amp;nbsp;MW. It was the first grid-connected [[wind farm]] in Australia when built by [[Pacific Power (Australia)|Pacific Power]] in 1998. It is now owned by [[Tilt Renewables]].

The farm was the largest wind farm in Australia when built, with the energy produced bought and on-sold to customers by then energy retailer Great Southern Energy.

Phase two of the Crookwell Wind Farm, planned to have an installed capacity of 92&amp;nbsp;MW, is under construction since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Copeland.

[[File:Quad-flare.ogv|thumb|380px|The evolution of a current sheet during a [[solar flare]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhu et al., 2016, ApJ, 821, L29, http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/821/2/L29&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''current sheet''' is an [[electric current]] that is confined to a surface, rather than being spread through a volume of space.  Current sheets feature in [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD), the study of the behavior of electrically conductive fluids: if there is an electric current through part of the volume of such a fluid, magnetic forces tend to expel it from the fluid, compressing the current into thin layers that pass through the volume.

The largest occurring current sheet in the [[Solar System]] is the so-called [[Heliospheric current sheet]], which is about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km thick, and extends from the [[Sun]] and out beyond the orbit of [[Pluto]].

In [[astrophysical]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] such as the [[sun|solar]] [[corona]], current sheets theoretically might have an aspect ratio (breadth divided by thickness) as high as 100,000:1.&lt;ref&gt;Biskamp, Dieter (1997) ''Nonlinear Magnetohydrodynamics'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OzFNhaVKA48C&amp;pg=PA130 page 130], {{ISBN|0-521-59918-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By contrast, the pages of most [[books]] have an aspect ratio close to 2000:1.  Because current sheets are so thin in comparison to their size, they are often treated as if they have zero thickness; this is a result of the simplifying assumptions of [[magnetohydrodynamics|ideal MHD]].  In reality, no current sheet may be infinitely thin because that would require infinitely fast motion of the [[charge carriers]] whose motion causes the current.

Current sheets in plasmas store energy by increasing the energy density of the [[magnetic field]].  Many plasma [[instability|instabilities]] arise near strong current sheets, which are prone to collapse, causing [[magnetic reconnection]] and rapidly releasing the stored energy.&lt;ref&gt;Biskamp, Dieter (May 1986) "Magnetic reconnection via current sheets" ''Physics of Fluids'' 29: pp. 1520-1531, {{doi|10.1063/1.865670}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This process is the cause of [[solar flares]]&lt;ref&gt;Low, B. C. and Wolfson, R. (1988) "Spontaneous formation of electric current sheets and the origin of solar flares" ''Astrophysical Journal'' 324(11): pp. 574-581&lt;/ref&gt; and is one reason for the difficulty of [[magnetic confinement fusion]], which requires strong electric currents in a hot plasma.

==Magnetic field of an infinite current sheet==
An infinite current sheet can be modelled as an infinite number of parallel wires all carrying the same current. Assuming each wire carries current ''I'', and there are ''N'' wires per unit length, the magnetic field can be derived using [[Ampère's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{R} \mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{ds} = \mu_0 I_{enc}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{R} B ds \cos{\theta} = \mu_0 I_{enc}&lt;/math&gt;

R is a rectangular loop surrounding the current sheet, perpendicular to the plane and perpendicular to the wires. In the two sides perpendicular to the sheet, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{ds} = 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\cos (90) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In the other two sides, &lt;math&gt;\cos (0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so if S is one parallel side of the rectangular loop of dimensions L x W, the integral simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;2\int_{S} B ds = \mu_0 I_{enc}&lt;/math&gt;
Since ''B'' is constant due to the chosen path, it can be pulled out of the integral:
:&lt;math&gt;2B \int_{S} ds = \mu_0 I_{enc}&lt;/math&gt;
The integral is evaluated:
:&lt;math&gt;2BL = \mu_0 I_{enc}&lt;/math&gt;
Solving for ''B'', plugging in for ''I&lt;sub&gt;enc&lt;/sub&gt;'' (total current enclosed in path ''R'') as ''I''*''N''*''L'', and simplifying:
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 I_{enc}}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 INL}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{\mu_0 IN}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Notably, the magnetic field strength of an infinite current sheet does not depend on the distance from it.

The direction of '''B''' can be found via the [[right-hand rule]].

== Harris current sheet ==
A well-known one-dimensional current sheet equilibrium is Harris current sheet, which is a stationary solution to the Maxwell-Vlasov system.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, W. J. (1990) "The Magnetopause, Magnetotail, and Magnetic Reconnection" (from the "Rubey Colloquium" held in March 1990 at U.C.L.A.) pp. 227-287 ''In'' Kivelson, Margaret Galland and Russell, Christopher T.

[[File:Molecular Sieve5.jpg|thumb|Canisters are commonly filled with [[silica gel]] and other [[molecular sieves]] used as desiccant in drug containers to keep contents dry.|350x350px]]
[[File:Silica gel bag open with beads.jpg|thumb|[[Silica gel]] in a [[sachet]] or porous [[packet (container)|packet]]]]
A '''desiccant''' is a [[hygroscopic]] substance that induces or sustains a state of dryness ([[desiccation]]) in its vicinity; it is the opposite of a [[humectant]].  Commonly encountered pre-packaged desiccants are solids that [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorb]] [[water]]. Desiccants for specialized purposes may be in forms other than solid, and may work through other principles, such as chemical bonding of water molecules.  They are commonly encountered in foods to retain crispness.  Industrially, desiccants are widely used to control the level of water in gas streams.

==Types of desiccants==
{{main article|List of desiccants}}

Although some desiccants are chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]], others are extremely reactive and require specialized handling techniques.  The most common desiccant is [[silica]], an otherwise inert, nontoxic, water-insoluble white solid.  Tens of thousands of tons are produced annually for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Otto W. Flörke, et al. "Silica" in  Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2008, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, . {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a23_583.pub3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   Other common desiccants include [[activated charcoal]], [[Drierite|calcium sulfate (Drierite)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drierite.com|title=Drierite - Drierite Overview|first=Curt|last=Cosenza|date=|website=www.drierite.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[calcium chloride]], and [[molecular sieve]]s (typically, [[zeolite]]s).

=== Performance efficiency ===
One measure of desiccant efficiency is the ratio (or [[percentage]]) of water storable in the desiccant relative to the [[mass]] of desiccant.

Another measure is the residual [[relative humidity]] of the air or other fluid being dried.

The performance of any desiccant varies with [[temperature]] and both [[relative humidity]] and [[absolute humidity]]. To some extent, desiccant performance can be precisely described, but most commonly, the final choice of which desiccant best suits a given situation, how much of it to use, and in what form, is made based on testing and practical experience.

===Colored saturation indicators===
[[Image:Indicating-silica-gel.png|thumb|Indicating silica gel]] 
Sometimes a [[humidity indicator]] is included in the desiccant to show, by color changes, the degree of water-saturation of the desiccant. One commonly used indicator is [[Cobalt(II) chloride|cobalt chloride]] (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  [[Anhydrous]] cobalt chloride is blue.  When it bonds with two water molecules, (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), it turns purple. Further hydration results in the pink hexaaquacobalt(II) chloride complex [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Applications==
One example of desiccant usage is in the manufacture of [[Insulated glazing|insulated windows]] where zeolite spheroids fill a rectangular spacer tube at the perimeter of the panes of glass. The desiccant helps to prevent the condensation of moisture between the panes. Another use of zeolites is in the dryer component of air conditioning systems to help maintain the efficacy of the refrigerant. Desiccants are also commonly used to protect goods in shipping containers against moisture damage. Hygroscopic cargo, such as cocoa, coffee, and various nuts and grains, are particularly susceptible to mold and rot when exposed to condensation and humidity. Because of this, shippers often take precautionary measures to protect against cargo loss.

Desiccants induce dryness in any environment and reduce the amount of moisture present in air. Desiccants come in various forms and have found widespread use in the food, pharmaceuticals, packing, electronics and many manufacturing industries.

Air conditioning systems can be made based on desiccants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desiccants are used in different kinds of livestock farming to dry newborn animals, such as piglets. The use of a good desiccant can help them dry quicker and save energy, which can be crucial for the animal's development. Another use is to reduce bacteria and pathogens that thrive in wet surfaces, reducing bacteria pressure. However, some desiccants have a very high pH-level, which can be harmful for an animal's skin.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Drying of solvents==
[[Image:Toluene with sodium-benzophenone.jpg|right|thumb|[[Toluene]] is heated under reflux with [[sodium]] and [[benzophenone]] to produce dry, oxygen-free toluene. The toluene is dry and oxygen free when the intense blue coloration from the benzophenone ketyl radical is observed.]]
{{main article|Air-free technique}}
Desiccants are also used to remove water from [[solvents]], typically required by chemical reactions that do not tolerate water, e.g., the [[Grignard reaction]]. The method generally, though not always, involves mixing the solvent with the solid desiccant.  Studies show that molecular sieves are superior as desiccants relative to chemical drying reagents such as sodium-benzophenone.  Sieves offer the advantages of being safe in air and recyclable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chai, Christina Li Lin |author2=Armarego, W. L.

'''Ecocho''' was a [[search engine]] with the aim of offsetting [[carbon emissions]] by donating 70% of revenues to '[[Carbon offset|carbon offset credits]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itwire.com/content/view/17683/53/ iTWire - Plant trees as you search the net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The site launched on 14 April 2008.

It is owned by the Found Agency, a search engine optimisation company.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/technology/google-puts-kybosh-on-eco-search-engine-20080424-gdsas1.html|title=Google puts kybosh on 'eco' search engine|last=Moses|first=Asher|date=2008-04-23|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecocho search is powered by [[Yahoo!]] after a termination of their account with [[Google]].

For every 1,000 searches, Ecocho claims that 1 ton of greenhouse gases are offset through the planting of trees. However, the precise amount is not given, nor are the number of searches performed on the site. Rather, the website maintains a tally of trees planted and of kilograms of {{CO2}} offset.

==Google Violations==
On 22 April 2008, Ecocho was informed by Google that they would be denied the use of Google's search technologies for multiple past violations of Google's policies.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2008/04/24/ecocho-must-leaf-out-adsense&lt;/ref&gt; The issue has been discussed on the Ecocho blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecocho.us/blog.php Read the Ecocho team's blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The mixed reactions from users can be seen in the blog comments, some taking further action by complaining to Google, and others agreeing with Google.

'''Film capacitors''', '''plastic film capacitors''', '''film dielectric capacitors''', or '''polymer film capacitors''', generically called “film caps” as well as power film capacitors, are electrical [[capacitor]]s with an insulating [[plastic film]] as the [[dielectric]], sometimes combined with paper as carrier of the [[electrode]]s.

The dielectric films, depending on the desired dielectric strength, are drawn in a special process to an extremely thin thickness, and are then provided with electrodes. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized [[aluminum]] or [[zinc]] applied directly to the surface of the plastic film, or a separate metallic foil. Two of these conductive layers are wound into a cylinder shaped winding, usually flattened to reduce mounting space requirements on a [[printed circuit board]], or layered as multiple single layers stacked together, to form a capacitor body. Film capacitors, together with [[ceramic capacitor]]s and [[electrolytic capacitor]]s, are the most common capacitor types for use in electronic equipment, and are used in many [[Alternating current|AC]] and [[Direct current|DC]] [[microelectronics]] and [[electronics]] circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://my.execpc.com/~endlr/film.html |title=Film Capacitors |work=my.execpc.com |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related component type is the '''power (film) capacitor'''. Although the materials and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors are very similar to those used for ordinary film capacitors, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. As modern electronic equipment gained the capacity to handle power levels that were previously the exclusive domain of "electrical power" components, the distinction between the "electronic" and "electrical" power ratings has become less distinct.  In the past, the boundary between these two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200&amp;nbsp;[[volt-ampere]]s,  but modern power electronics can handle increasing amounts of power.

&lt;/center&gt;

Film capacitors are made out of two pieces of [[plastic film]] covered with metallic electrodes, wound into a cylindrical shaped winding, with terminals attached, and then encapsulated. In general, film capacitors are not polarized, so the two terminals are interchangeable. There are two different types of plastic film capacitors, made with two different electrode configurations:

* Film/foil capacitors or metal foil capacitors are made with two plastic films as the [[dielectric]]. Each is layered with a thin metal foil, usually aluminum, as the electrodes. Advantages of this construction type are easy electrical connection to the metal foil electrodes, and its ability to handle high current surges.
* Metallized film capacitors are made of two metallized films with plastic film as the dielectric. A very thin (~ 0.03&amp;nbsp;µm&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/EN/metallized.htm |title=WIMA, metallization |publisher=Wima.de |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Vacuum deposition|vacuum-deposited]] aluminum metallization is applied to one or both sides to serve as electrodes. This configuration can have "self-healing" properties, in that dielectric breakdowns or [[short circuit]]s between the electrodes do not necessarily lead to the destruction of the component. With this basic design, it is possible to make high quality products such as "zero defect" capacitors and to produce wound capacitors with larger [[capacitance]] values (up to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Farad|µF]] and larger) in smaller cases (high [[volumetric efficiency]]) compared to film/foil construction. However, a disadvantage of metallized construction is its limited current surge rating.

A key advantage of modern film capacitor internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes on both ends of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths to the entire electrode very short. The setup behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]], thus reducing the internal [[ohm]]ic losses ([[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]]) and the [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitic inductance]] ([[Equivalent series inductance|ESL]]). The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in very low ohmic losses and a very low parasitic inductance, which makes them especially suitable for applications with very high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.

Another feature of film capacitors is the possibility of choosing different film materials for the dielectric layer to select for desirable electrical characteristics, such as stability, wide temperature range, or ability to withstand very high voltages. Polypropylene film capacitors are specified because of their low electrical losses and their nearly linear behavior over a very wide frequency range, for stability Class 1 applications in [[resonant circuit]]s, comparable only with [[ceramic capacitor]]s. For simple high frequency [[electronic filter|filter circuits]], polyester capacitors offer low-cost solutions with excellent long-term stability, allowing replacement of more expensive [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitors]].  The film/foil variants of plastic film capacitors are especially capable of handling high and very high current surges.

Typical capacitance values of smaller film capacitors used in electronics start around 100 picofarads and extend upwards to microfarads.

Unique mechanical properties of plastic and paper films in some special configurations allow them to be used in capacitors of very large dimensions. The larger film capacitors are used as power capacitors in electrical power installations and plants, capable of withstanding very high power or very high applied voltages. The dielectric strength of these capacitors can reach into the four-digit voltage range.

== Internal structure ==
The formula for capacitance (''C'') of a plate capacitor is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C=\varepsilon \cdot { {A} \over {d} }&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
(''ε'' stands for dielectric [[permittivity]];  ''A'' for electrode surface area; and ''d'' for the distance between the electrodes).

According to the equation, a thinner dielectric or a larger electrode area both will increase the [[Electrical capacitance|capacitance value]], as will a dielectric material of higher permittivity.&lt;ref name=serway&gt;{{cite book|last=Serway|first=Raymond A., Jerry S.

=== Example manufacturing process ===
The following example describes a typical manufacturing process flow for wound metallized plastic film capacitors.

# Film stretching and metallization — To increase the capacitance value of the capacitor, the plastic film is drawn using a special extrusion process of bi-axial stretching in longitudinal and transverse directions, as thin as is technically possible and as allowed by the desired [[breakdown voltage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA08/5_3a%20Winsor-Aerovox.pdf |author1=P.

In a suitable evaporation system and under high vacuum conditions (about 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of air per cubic meter) the plastic film is metallized with [[aluminum]] or [[zinc]]. It is then wound onto a so-called "mother roll" with a width of about 1 meter.
# Film slitting — Next, the mother rolls are slit into small strips of plastic film in the required width according to the size of the capacitors being manufactured.
# Winding — Two films are rolled together into a cylindrical winding. The two metallized films that make up a capacitor are wound slightly offset from each other, so that by the arrangement of the electrodes one edge of the metallization on each end of the winding extends out laterally.
# Flattening — The winding is usually flattened into an oval shape by applying mechanical pressure. Because the cost of a [[printed circuit board]] is calculated per square millimeter, a smaller capacitor footprint reduces the overall cost of the circuit.
# Application of metallic contact layer ("schoopage") — The projecting end electrodes are covered with a liquefied contact metal such as ([[tin]], zinc or aluminum), which is sprayed with compressed air on both lateral ends of the winding. This metallizing process is named ''schoopage'' after Swiss engineer [[Max Schoop]], who invented a combustion spray application for tin and lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=15th International Thermal Spray Conference, 25–29 May 1998 |location=Nice, France |volume=2 |editor=Christian Coddet |book-title=Thermal spray: meeting the challenges of the 21st century |type=Proceedings |year=1998 |publisher=ASM International |isbn=978-0-87170-659-1 |page=1103}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Healing — The windings which are now electrically connected by the schoopage have to be "healed". This is done by applying a precisely calibrated voltage across the electrodes of the winding so that any existing defects will be "burned away" (see also "self-healing" below).
# Impregnation — For increased protection of the capacitor against environmental influences, especially moisture, the winding is impregnated with an insulating fluid, such as [[silicone]] oil.
# Attachment of terminals — The terminals of the capacitor are soldered or welded on the end metal contact layers of the schoopage.
# Coating — After attaching the terminals, the capacitor body is potted into an external casing, or is dipped into a protective coating. For lowest production costs some film capacitors can be used "naked", without further coating of the winding.
# Electrical final test — All capacitors (100%) should be tested for the most important electrical parameters, capacitance (C), dissipation factor (tan δ) and impedance (Z).

[[File:Film cap-manufacturing.png|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Process flow diagram for production of metallized film capacitors with dipped lacquered coating]]
The production of wound film/metal foil capacitors with metal foil instead of metallized films is done in a very similar way.

As an alternative to the traditional wound construction of film capacitors, they can also be manufactured in a “stacked” configuration. For this version, the two metallized films representing the electrodes are wound on a much larger core with a diameter of more than 1&amp;nbsp;m. So-called multi-layer capacitors (MLP, Multilayer Polymer Capacitors) can be produced by sawing this large winding into many smaller single segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paktron.com/images/interleaf_machine.gif |title=Paktron Capacitors, Interleaf Technology |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paktron.com/pdf/Advantages.pdf |title=Paktron, "MLP Capacitor Advantages over Ceramics" |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sawing causes defects on the collateral sides of the capacitors which are later burned out (self-healing) during the manufacturing process. Low-cost metallized plastic film capacitors for general purpose applications are produced in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=Paktron Capacitors |title=Capacitor Guide for Critical Mission Applications |page=4 |url=http://www.paktron.com/pdf/Mission_Critical_Applications.pdf |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is also used to produce capacitor "dice" for [[surface-mount technology|Surface Mount Device]] (SMD) packaged components.

=== Self-healing of metallized film capacitors ===
[[File:Folko-Foliendurchschlag.svg|thumb|right|Highly simplified cross-section diagram of self-healing, after a point-defect short-circuit between the metallized electrodes is burned out. Lower diagram shows top view of foil after burn-out of a point defect.]]
[[File:T-segment-metallization.svg|thumb|right|"T metallization" segmentation to isolate and reduce damage during the self-healing process]]

Metallized film capacitors have "self-healing" properties, which are not available from film/foil configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/EN/selfhealing.htm |title=Wima, Self-healing Process in Metallized Capacitors |publisher=Wima.de |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When sufficient voltage is applied, a point-defect short-circuit between the metallized electrodes vaporizes due to high arc temperature, since both the dielectric plastic material at the breakdown point and the metallized electrodes around the breakdown point are very thin (about 0.02 to 0.05&amp;nbsp;µm). The point-defect cause of the short-circuit is burned out, and the resulting vapor pressure blows the arc away, too. This process can complete in less than 10 μs, often without interrupting the useful operation of the afflicted capacitor.&lt;ref name=Gebbia&gt;{{cite web|last=Gebbia|first=Mark|title=Introduction to film capacitors|url=http://www.illinoiscapacitor.com/pdf/Papers/introduction_to_film.pdf|work=illinoiscapacitor.com|publisher=Illinois Capacitor, Inc.|accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This property of self-healing allows the use of a single-layer winding of metallized films without any additional protection against defects, and thereby leads to a reduction in the amount of the physical space required to achieve a given performance specification.  In other words, the so-called "volumetric efficiency" of the capacitor is increased.

The self-healing capability of metallized films is used multiple times during the manufacturing process of metallized film capacitors. Typically, after slitting the metallized film to the desired width, any resulting defects can be burned out (healed) by applying a suitable voltage before winding. The same method is also used after the metallization of the contact surfaces ("schoopage") to remove any defects in the capacitor caused by the secondary metallization process.

The "pinholes" in the metallization caused by the self-healing arcs reduce the capacitance of the capacitor very slightly. However, the magnitude of this reduction is quite low; even with several thousand defects to be burned out, this reduction usually is much smaller than 1% of the total capacitance of the capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/en_index.php |title=WIMA, Self Healing |publisher=Wima.de |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For larger film capacitors with very high standards for stability and long lifetime, such as [[snubber]] capacitors, the metallization can be made with a special fault isolation pattern. In the picture on the right hand side, such a metallization formed into a “T” pattern is shown.  Each of these “T” patterns produces a deliberately narrowed cross-section in the conductive metallization. These restrictions work like microscopic [[Electrical safety|fuses]] so that if a point-defect short-circuit between the electrodes occurs, the high current of the short only burns out the fuses around the fault. The affected sections are thus disconnected and isolated in a controlled manner, without any explosions surrounding a larger short-circuit arc. Therefore, the area affected is limited and the fault is gently controlled, significantly reducing internal damage to the capacitor, which can thus remain in service with only an infinitesimal reduction in capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newarkinone.thinkhost.com/brands/promos/leading_edge/ILL_Cap_Motor_run_capacitors.pdf |title=IC Illinois Capacitor, Inc. Motor Run Capacitors Selection Guidelines |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In field installations of electrical power distribution equipment, [[capacitor bank]] [[fault-tolerant design|fault tolerance]] is often improved by connecting multiple capacitors in parallel, each protected with an internal or external fuse.  Should an individual capacitor develop an internal short, the resulting fault current (augmented by capacitive discharge from neighboring capacitors) blows the fuse, thus isolating the failed capacitor from the remaining devices.  This technique is analogous to the "T metallization" technique described above, but operating at a larger physical scale. More-complex series and parallel arrangements of capacitor banks are also used to allow continuity of service despite individual capacitor failures at this larger scale.&lt;ref name=Brunello&gt;{{cite web|title=Shunt Capacitor Bank Fundamentals and Protection|url=http://store.gedigitalenergy.com/faq/documents/general/shunt.pdf|work=2003 Conference for Protective Relay Engineers|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|accessdate=2012-03-27|author=Gustavo Brunello|author2=Bogdan Kasztenny |author3=Craig Wester |date=April 8–10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal structure to increase voltage ratings ===
[[File:Folko-Spannungsfestigkeit.svg|thumb|center|upright=2|Examples of partial metallization on one side of the metallized insulating film, to increase the voltage rating of film capacitors. This technique effectively forms multiple small capacitors, connected in series, to raise the effective [[breakdown voltage]]]]

The rated voltage of different film materials depends on factors such as the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the [[breakdown voltage]] (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a film capacitor depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available film thickness of polyester film capacitors (about 0.7&amp;nbsp;µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400&amp;nbsp;VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used.  But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually ''nonlinear''. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the ''square-root'' of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance ''decreases'' linearly with increased film thickness.  For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.

The breakdown voltage can be increased by using one-sided partially metallized films, or the breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be increased by using double-sided metallized films. Double-sided metallized films also can be combined with internal series-connected capacitors by partial metallization. These multiple technique designs are especially used for high-reliability applications with polypropylene films.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Internal structure to increase surge ratings ===
An important property of film capacitors is their ability to withstand high peak voltage or peak current surge pulses. This capability depends on all internal connections of the film capacitor withstanding the peak current loads up to the maximum specified temperature. The collateral contact layers (schoopage) with the electrodes can be a potential limitation of peak current carrying capacity.

The electrode layers are wound slightly offset from each other, so that the edges of the electrodes can be contacted using a face contacting method “schoopage” at the collateral end faces of the winding. This internal connection is ultimately made by multiple point-shaped contacts at the edge of the electrode, and can be modeled as a large number of individual capacitors all connected in parallel. The many individual resistance ([[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]]) and inductance ([[Equivalent series inductance|ESL]]) losses are connected ''in parallel'', so that these total undesirable parasitic losses are minimized.

However, ohmic contact resistance heating is generated when peak current flows through these individual microscopic contacting points, which are critical areas for the overall internal resistance of the capacitor. If the current gets too high, "hot spots" can develop and cause burning of the contact areas.

A second limitation of the current-carrying capacity is caused by the ohmic bulk resistance of the electrodes themselves. For metallized film capacitors, which have layer thicknesses from 0.02 to 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; the current-carrying capacity is limited by these thin layers.

[[File:Shape optimised electrode.svg|thumb|center|upright=1.5| Shape-optimized metallization to increase the surge current rating]]
The surge current rating of film capacitors can be enhanced by various internal configurations. Because metallization is the cheapest way of producing electrodes, optimizing the shape of the electrodes is one way to minimize the internal resistance and to increase the current-carrying capacity. A slightly thicker metallization layer at the schoopage contact sides of the electrodes results in a lower overall contact resistance and increased surge current handling, without losing the self-healing properties throughout the remainder of the metallization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Y. Vuillermet |title=Optimizing of Low-Voltage Metallized Film Capacitor Geometries |work=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics |date=4 April 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-02 |url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/28/33/20/PDF/04137826.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technique to increase the surge current rating for film capacitors is a double-sided metallization. This can double the peak current rating. This design also halves the total self-inductance of the capacitor, because in effect, two inductors are connected in parallel, which allows less-unimpeded passage of faster pulses (higher so-called "dV/dt" rating). &lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm dV}{\mathrm dt}&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

The double-sided metallized film is electrostatically field-free because the electrodes have the same voltage potential on both sides of the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.

The highest surge-current rated film capacitors are film/foil capacitors with a metal foil construction. These capacitors use thin metal foils, usually aluminum, as the electrodes overlying the polymer film. The advantage of this construction is the easy and robust connection of the metal foil electrodes. In this design, the contact resistance in the area of the schoopage is the lowest.

However, metal foil capacitors ''do not have self-healing properties''. A breakdown in the dielectric film of a film/foil capacitor leads to an irreversible short circuit. To avoid breakdowns caused by weak spots in the dielectric, the insulating film chosen is always thicker than theoretically required by the specific breakdown voltage of the material. Films of less than 4&amp;nbsp;µm generally are not used for film/foil capacitors because of their excessively high numbers of point defects. Also. the metallic foils only can be produced down to about 25&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness. These tradeoffs make the film/foil capacitor the most robust but also the most expensive method for increasing surge current handling.

== Styles of film capacitors ==
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="Available styles of film capacitors" class="centered"&gt;
File:Polyester film capacitor.jpg|Axial style for point-to-point and through-hole mounting

&lt;/center&gt;

Film capacitors for use in electronic equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for [[point-to-point construction|point-to-point wiring]] and some traditional [[through-hole technology|through-hole]] printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals on one side of the capacitor body. To facilitate [[through-hole technology|automated insertion]], radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm pitch and increasing in 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of [[reflow soldering]] induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;urface &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;ounted &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;evice“ ([[Surface-mount technology|SMD]]) packages.

== Historical development ==
Before the introduction of plastic films, capacitors made by sandwiching a strip of [[Electronic packaging#Porosity sealing or impregnation|impregnated]] paper between strips of metal, and rolling the result into a cylinder–[[Types of capacitor|paper capacitors]]–were commonly used; their manufacture started in 1876,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=J. Ho |author2=T. R. Jow |author3=S. Boggs |title=Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology |url=http://www.ifre.re.kr/board/filedown.php?seq=179 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were used from the early 20th century as decoupling capacitors in telecommunications (telephony).

With the development of plastic materials by organic chemists during the [[Second World War]], the capacitor industry began to replace paper with thinner polymer films. One very early development in film capacitors was described in British Patent 587,953 in 1944. The introduction of plastics in plastic film capacitors was approximately in the following historic order: [[polystyrene]] (PS)  in 1949, [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET/"polyester") and [[cellulose acetate]] (CA) in 1951, [[polycarbonate]] (PC/Lexan) in 1953, [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (PTFE/Teflon) in 1954, [[polyparylene]] in 1954, [[polypropylene]] (PP) in 1954, [[polyethylene]] (PE) in 1958, and [[polyphenylene sulphide]] (PPS) in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Filmkondensatoren |work=Verlag moderne Industrie |year=1990 |ISBN=3-478-93046-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s there was a wide range of different plastic film capacitors offered by many, mostly European and US manufacturers.  German manufacturers such as WIMA, [[Roederstein]], [[Siemens]] and [[Philips]] were trend-setters and leaders in a world market driven by consumer electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cyril Bateman |title=Understanding capacitors |date=May 1998 |work=Electronics World |url=http://techdoc.kvindesland.no/radio/passivecomp/20061223155212518.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the great advantages of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in paper capacitors. This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas paper capacitors need a double layer of paper{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. Plastic film capacitors were significantly smaller in physical size (better [[volumetric efficiency]]), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable paper capacitors. Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less [[hygroscopic]] than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.

An early special type of plastic film capacitors were the [[cellulose acetate]] film capacitors, also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin that could be made for metallized capacitors in paint film thickness down to about 3&amp;nbsp;µm.  A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63&amp;nbsp;V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other film capacitors of the time. MKU film capacitors are no longer manufactured, because polyester film capacitors can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Otto Zinke |author2=Hans Seither |title=Widerstände, Kondensatoren, Spulen und ihre Werkstoffe |work=Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg/New York |year=1982 |ISBN=3-540-11334-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film capacitors have become much smaller since the beginning of the technology. Through development of thinner plastic films, for example, the dimensions of metallized polyester film capacitors were decreased by a factor of approximately 3 to 4.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}{{Clarify|date=March 2014|post-text=Presumably volume?}}

The most important advantages of film capacitors are the stability of their electrical values over long durations, their reliability, and lower cost than some other types for the same applications. Especially for applications with high current pulse loads or high AC loads in electrical systems, heavy-duty film capacitors, here called "power capacitors", are available with dielectric ratings of several kilovolts.

But the manufacture of film capacitors does have a critical dependency on the materials supply chain. Each of the plastic film materials used for film capacitors worldwide is produced by only two or three large suppliers. The reason for this is that the mass quantities required by the market for film caps are quite small compared to typical chemical company production runs. This leads to a great dependency of the capacitor manufacturers on relatively few chemical companies as raw material suppliers. For example, in the year 2000 [[Bayer AG]] stopped their production of polycarbonate films, due to unprofitably low sales volumes. Most of the producers of polycarbonate film capacitors had to quickly change their product offerings to another type of capacitor, and a lot of expensive testing approvals for new designs were required.

As of 2012, only five plastic materials continued to be widely used in the capacitor industry as films for capacitors: PET, PEN, PP, PPS and PTFE. Other plastic materials are no longer in common use, either because they are no longer manufactured, or they have been replaced with better materials. Even the long-time manufactured polystyrene (PS) and polycarbonate (PC) film capacitors have been largely replaced by the previously-mentioned film types, though at least one PC capacitor manufacturer retains the ability to make its own films from raw polycarbonate feedstock.&lt;ref name=ECI&gt;{{cite web|title=Your long-term source for polycarbonate film capacitors|url=http://polycarbonatecapacitors.com/|work=Polycarbonate Capacitors|publisher=Electronic Concepts, Inc.|accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The less-common plastic films are described briefly here, since they are still encountered in older designs, and are still available from some suppliers.

From simple beginnings film capacitors developed into a very broad and highly specialized range of different types. By the end of the 20th century mass production of most film capacitors had shifted to the Far East. A few large companies still produce highly specialized film capacitors in Europe and in the US, for power and AC applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/EN/WIMA_Filmcapacitors.pdf |title=W.

Also, different film materials can be mixed to produce capacitors with particular properties.

The most used film materials are polypropylene, with a market share of 50%, followed by polyester, with a 40% share. The remaining 10% share is accounted for by the other dielectric materials, including polyphenylene sulfide and paper, with roughly 3% each.&lt;ref&gt;Passive component magazine, Nov./Dec. 2005,  F.

Polycarbonate film capacitors are no longer manufactured because the dielectric material is no longer available.&lt;ref&gt;Power Electronics, April 2002, A.

=== Polypropylene (PP) film capacitors ===
[[File:Nedap ESD1 - power supply board 1 - WIMA FKP 1-91667.jpg|thumb|FKP 1 polypropylene (PP) capacitor for pulse applications with metal foil manufactured by WIMA]]
[[Polypropylene]] film capacitors have a dielectric made of the thermoplastic, non-polar, organic and partially crystalline polymer material Polypropylene (PP), trade name Treofan, from the family of [[polyolefin]]s. They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. Polypropylene film is the most-used dielectric film in industrial capacitors and also in power capacitor types. The polypropylene film material absorbs less moisture than polyester film and is therefore also suitable for "naked" designs without any coating or further packaging. But the maximum temperature of 105&amp;nbsp;°C hinders use of PP films in SMD packaging.

The temperature and frequency dependencies of electrical parameters for polypropylene film capacitors are very low. Polypropylene film capacitors have a linear, negative temperature coefficient of capacitance of ±2,5 % within their temperature range. Therefore, polypropylene film capacitors are suitable for applications in Class 1 frequency-determining circuits, filters, oscillator circuits, audio circuits, and timers. They are also useful for compensation of inductive coils in precision filter applications, and for high-frequency applications.

In addition to the application class qualification for the film/foil version of PP film capacitors, the standard IEC/EN 60384-13 specifies three “stability classes”. These stability classes specify the tolerance on temperature coefficients together with the permissible change of capacitance after defined tests. They are divided into different temperature coefficient grades (α) with associated tolerances and preferred values of permissible change of capacitance after mechanical, ambient (moisture) and life time tests.

&lt;/center&gt;

The table is not valid for capacitance values smaller than 50&amp;nbsp;pF.

In addition, PP film capacitors have the lowest [[dielectric absorption]], which makes them suitable for applications such as [[Voltage-controlled oscillator|VCO]] timing capacitors, [[sample-and-hold]] applications, and audio circuits. They are available for these precision applications in very narrow capacitance tolerances.

The dissipation factor of PP film capacitors is smaller than that of other film capacitors. Due to the low and very stable dissipation factor over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650&amp;nbsp;V/µm, PP film capacitors can be used in metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called "[[snubber]]" capacitors, or in [[IGBT]] applications. In addition, polypropylene film capacitors are used in AC power applications, such as motor run capacitors or [[Power Factor Correction|PFC]] capacitors.

Polypropylene film capacitors are widely used for [[Electromagnetic compatibility#Emissions suppression|EMI suppression]], including direct connection to the power supply mains.  In this latter application, they must meet special testing and certification requirements concerning safety and non-flammability.

Most power capacitors, the largest capacitors made, generally use polypropylene film as the dielectric. PP film capacitors are used for high-frequency high-power applications such as [[induction heating]], for pulsed power energy discharge applications, and as AC capacitors for electrical distribution. The AC voltage ratings of these capacitors can range up to 400&amp;nbsp;kV.

The relatively low permittivity of 2.2 is a slight disadvantage, and PP film capacitors tend to be somewhat physically larger than other film caps.

The capacitor grade films are produced up to 20&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness with width of roll up to 140&amp;nbsp;mm. Rolls are carefully vacuum packed in pairs according to the specifications required for the capacitor.

=== Polyester (PET) film capacitors ===
Polyester film capacitors are film capacitors using a dielectric made of the thermoplastic polar polymer material [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET), trade names Hostaphan or [[Mylar®]], from the polyester family.  They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. The polyester film adsorbs very little moisture, and this feature makes it suitable for "naked" designs without any further coating needed. They are the low-cost mass-produced capacitors in modern electronics, featuring relatively small dimensions with relatively high capacitance values.  PET capacitors are mainly used as general purpose capacitors for DC applications, or for semi-critical circuits with operating temperatures up to 125 &amp;nbsp;°C. The maximum temperature rating of 125&amp;nbsp;°C also allows [[Surface-mount technology|SMD]] film capacitors to be made with PET films.&lt;ref&gt;I. Clelland, R. Price, ITW Paktron, "Evaluation of SMT Polymer Film Capacitors Using Newly Developed, Low Shrinkage PET" [http://www.paktron.com/pdf/tech/Tech3_98.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The low cost of polyester and the relatively compact dimensions are the main reasons for the high prevalence of PET film capacitors in modern designs.

The small physical dimensions of PET film capacitors are the result of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high [[volumetric efficiency]]. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100&amp;nbsp;Hz to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the [[dissipation factor]] are higher for polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.

Polyester film capacitors are mainly used for general purpose applications or semi-critical circuits with operating temperatures up to 125&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) film capacitors ===
[[Polyethylene naphthalate]] film capacitors are film capacitors using a dielectric made of the thermoplastic biaxial polymer material polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), trade names Kaladex®, Teonex®.  They are produced only as metallized types. PEN, like PET, belongs to the polyester family, but has better stability at high temperatures. Therefore, PEN film capacitors are more suitable for high temperature applications and for SMD packaging.

The temperature and frequency dependence of the electrical characteristics for capacitance and dissipation factor of PEN film capacitors are similar to the PET film capacitors. Because of the smaller relative permittivity and lower dielectric strength of the PEN polymer, PEN film capacitors are physically larger for a given capacitance and rated voltage value. In spite of this, PEN film capacitors are preferred over PET when the ambient temperature during operation of the capacitors is permanently above 125&amp;nbsp;°C. The special PEN "high voltage" (HV) dielectric offers excellent electrical properties during the life tests at high voltages and high temperatures (175&amp;nbsp;°C). PEN capacitors are mainly used for non-critical filtering, coupling and decoupling in electronic circuits, when the temperature dependencies do not matter.

=== Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) film capacitors ===
Polyphenylene sulfide film capacitors are film capacitors with dielectric made of the thermoplastic, organic, and partially crystalline polymer material [[Poly(p-phenylene sulfide)]] (PPS), trade name Torelina. They are only produced as metallized types.

The temperature dependence of the capacitance of PPS film capacitors over the entire temperature range is very small (±&amp;nbsp;1.5%) compared with other film capacitors. Also the frequency dependence in the range from 100&amp;nbsp;Hz to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz of the capacitance of the PPS film capacitors is ±&amp;nbsp;0.5%, very low compared with other film capacitors. The dissipation factor of PPS film capacitors is quite small, and the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor over a wide range is very stable. Only at temperatures above 100&amp;nbsp;°C does the dissipation factor increase to larger values. The [[dielectric absorption]] performance is excellent, behind only PTFE and PS dielectric capacitors.

Polyphenylene sulfide film capacitors are well-suited for applications in frequency-determining circuits and for high-temperature applications. Because of their good electrical properties, PPS film capacitors are an ideal replacement for polycarbonate film capacitors, whose production since 2000 has been largely discontinued.

In addition to their excellent electrical properties, PPS film capacitors can withstand temperatures up to 270&amp;nbsp;°C without damaging the film quality, so that PPS film capacitors are suitable for surface mount devices (SMD), and can tolerate the increased reflow soldering temperatures for lead-free soldering mandated by the [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS 2002/95/EC directive]].

Cost of a PPS film capacitor is usually higher compared to a PP film capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;TTI Insights, Mary Ellen Bauchman; 01/11/2012, A Look at Film Capacitors, Mary Ellen Bauchman [http://www.ttiinc.com/object/me-tti-20120111.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film capacitors ===
[[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] film capacitors are made with a dielectric of the synthetic fluoropolymer polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a hydrophobic solid fluorocarbon. They are manufactured both as metallized and as film/foil types, although poor adherence to the film makes metallization difficult. PTFE is often known by the [[DuPont]] trademark [[Teflon]].

Polytetrafluoroethylene film capacitors feature a very high temperature resistance up to 200&amp;nbsp;°C, and even further up to 260&amp;nbsp;°C, with a voltage derating. The dissipation factor 2 • 10 &lt;sup&gt;−4 &lt;/sup&gt;  is quite small. The change in capacitance over the entire temperature range of +1% to -3% is a little bit higher than for polypropylene film capacitors. However, since the smallest available film thickness for PTFE films is 5.5&amp;nbsp;µm,&lt;ref name="solen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solen.ca/ |title=Solen Electronique Inc |publisher=Solen.ca |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately twice of the thickness of polypropylene films, the PTFE film capacitors are physically bulkier than PP film capacitors. It added that the film thickness on the surface is not constant, so that Teflon films are difficult to produce.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.execpc.com/~endlr/film.html |title=CapSite 2009, Introduction To Capacitors, Film Capacitors, Teflon |publisher=My.execpc.com |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PTFE film capacitors are available with rated voltages of 100&amp;nbsp;V to 630&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;DC. They are used in military equipment, in aerospace, in geological probes, in burn-in circuits and in high-quality audio circuits. Main producers of PTFE film capacitors are located in the USA.&lt;ref name="solen1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancapacitor.com/|title=American Capacitor|publisher=American Capacitor|date=2009-03-12|accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.customelec.com/ |title=Custom Electronics |publisher=Customelec.com |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dei2000.com/ |title=Dearborne |publisher=Dei2000.com |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eci-capacitors.com |title=/ Electronic Concepts Inc |publisher=Eci-capacitors.com |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v- cap.com / V-Cap]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polystyrene (PS) film capacitors ===
[[Polystyrene]] film capacitors, sometimes known as "Styroflex Capacitors", were well known for many years as inexpensive film capacitors for general purpose applications, in which high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor and low leakage currents were needed. But because the film thickness could be not made thinner than 10&amp;nbsp;µm, and the maximum temperature ratings reached only 85&amp;nbsp;°C, the PS film capacitors have mostly been replaced by polyester film capacitors as of 2012. However, some manufacturers may still offer PS film capacitors in their production program, backed by large amounts of polystyrene film stocked in their warehouse.
Polystyrene capacitors have an important advantage - they have a temperature coefficient near zero and so are useful in tuned circuits where drift with temperature must be avoided.

=== Polycarbonate (PC) film capacitors ===
[[Polycarbonate]] film capacitors are film capacitors with a dielectric made of the polymerized esters of carbonic acid and dihydric alcohols polycarbonate (PC), sometimes given the trademarked name Makrofol. They are manufactured as wound metallized as well as film/foil types.

These capacitors have a low dissipation factor and because of their relatively temperature-independent electrical properties of about ±80&amp;nbsp;ppm over the entire temperature range, they had many applications for low-loss and temperature-stable applications such as timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions. PC film capacitors had been manufactured since the mid-1950s, but the main supplier of polycarbonate film for capacitors had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000. As a result, most of the manufacturers of polycarbonate film capacitors worldwide had to stop their production of PC film capacitors and changed to polypropylene film capacitors instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wima.de/EN/polycarbonate.htm] Wima, "Substitution of Obsolete Polycarbonate (PC) Capacitors"&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the former PC capacitor applications have found satisfactory substitutes with PP film capacitors.

However, there are exceptions. The manufacturer Electronic Concepts Inc, (New Jersey, US) claims to be an in-house producer of its own polycarbonate film,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polycarbonatecapacitors.com/] Statement by Electronic Concepts, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to produce PC film capacitors. In addition to this manufacturer of polycarbonate film capacitors, there are other mostly US-based specialty manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcapacitors.com/ |title=EFC |publisher=Filmcapacitors.com |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrocube.com/ |title=Electrocube |publisher=Electrocube |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurofarad.com/ |title=Eurofarad |publisher=Eurofarad |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tscgroup.com/ |title=TSC Electronics Inc |publisher=Tscgroup.com |accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paper (film) capacitors (MP) and mixed film capacitors ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery widths="280" heights="160" caption="Power film capacitors using metallized paper as carrier of the electrodes, their different configurations and their usual abbreviated designations"&gt;
File:MP-Power-Capacitor-Construction.svg|MP capacitor, single-sided metallized paper (additional layer of paper to cover pinhole defects), windings impregnated with insulating oil

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Historically, the first “film” type capacitors were paper capacitors of film/foil configuration. They were fairly bulky, and not particularly reliable. As of 2012, paper is used in the form of metallized paper for MP capacitors with self-healing properties used for EMI suppression.  Paper is also used as an insulating mechanical carrier of metallized-layer electrodes, and combined with polypropylene dielectric, mostly in power capacitors rated for high current AC and high voltage DC applications.

Paper as carrier of the electrodes has the advantages of lower cost and somewhat better adherence of metallization to paper than to polymer films. But paper alone as dielectric in capacitors is not reliable enough for the growing quality requirements of modern applications. The combination of paper together with polypropylene film dielectric is a cost-effective way to improve quality and performance. The better adhering of metallization on paper is advantageous especially at high current pulse loads, and the polypropylene film dielectric increases the voltage rating.

However, the roughness of a metallized paper surface can cause many small air-filled bubbles between the dielectric and the metallization, decreasing the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. For this reason, larger film capacitors or power capacitors using paper as carrier of the electrodes usually are filled with an insulating oil or gas, to displace the air bubbles for a higher breakdown voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/Publications/PDF/MKV,property=Data__en.pdf;/MKV.pdf |title=Epcos, MKV Power Electronic Capacitors |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since almost every major manufacturer offers its own proprietary film capacitors with mixed film materials, it is difficult to give a universal and general overview of the specific properties of mixed film capacitors.

=== Other plastic film capacitors ===
Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), some other plastic materials may be used as the dielectric in film capacitors.&lt;ref name="americancapacitor1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancapacitor.com/PDF/Brochure.pdf |title=American Capacitor Corporation, Technical information Brochure |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermoplastic polymers such as [[Polyimide]] (PI), [[Polyamide]] (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF), [[Siloxane]], [[Polysulfone]] (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low [[permittivity]] of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.

In 1984, a new film capacitor technology that makes use of vacuum-deposited electron-beam cross-linked [[acrylate]] materials as dielectric in film capacitors was announced as a patent in the press.&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Olson,  "Capacitors containing polyfunctional acrylate polymers as dielectrics", patent 4490774 [http://www.google.com/patents/US4490774] and [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/46062022/Capacitors-Containing-Polyfunctional-Acrylate-Polymers-As-Dielectrics---Patent-4490774]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A new high temperature multilayer capacitor with acrylate dielectrics" [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=122201]&lt;/ref&gt; But as of 2012, only one manufacturer markets a specific acrylate SMD film capacitor, as an X7R MLCC replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cde.com/catalogs/FCA.pdf |title=CDE, "Acrylic Surface Mount Film Capacitors" |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyimide (PI), a thermoplastic polymer of [[imide]] monomers, is proposed for film capacitors called Polyimide-, PI- or Kapton capacitors.&lt;ref name="americancapacitor1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semectech.com/Film-capacitors/] Semec company&lt;/ref&gt; Kapton is the trade name of polyimide from [[DuPont]]. This material is of interest because its high temperature resistance up to 400&amp;nbsp;°C. But as of 2012, no specific PI capacitor series '''film''' capacitors have been announced. The offered film capacitor, Kapton CapacitorCL11, announced from “dhgate” is a “Type: Polypropylene Film Capacitor”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factory.dhgate.com/capacitors/film-capacitor-kapton-capacitorcl11-p40604318.html |title=dhgate |publisher=Factory.dhgate.com |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another very strange Kapton capacitor can be found at YEC, a Chinese producer of capacitors.  Here the announced “Kapton capacitors” are in reality [[supercapacitor]]s, a completely different technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yec.com.tw/dir-energy/energys-product-factory-list/energys-product-factory-list-1/] YEC, China&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the Kapton film in these supercapacitors is used as a separator between the electrodes of this [[double-layer capacitor]].  Kapton films are often offered as an adhesive film for the outer insulation of capacitor packages.

[[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) has a very high permittivity of 18 to 20, which allows large amounts of energy to be stored in a small space ([[volumetric efficiency]]). However, it has a [[Curie temperature]] of only 60&amp;nbsp;°C, which limits its usability. Film capacitors with PVDF are described for one very special application, in portable [[defibrillator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;S. Zhang, B. Zellers, D. Anderson, P. Rehrig, X. Zhou, D. Kushner, R.

For all the other previously named plastic materials such as PA, PVDF, Siloxane, PEx or FPE, specific series of film capacitors with these plastic films are not known to be produced in commercial quantities, as of 2012.

== Standardization of film capacitors ==
The standardization for all [[electrical]], [[electronics|electronic]] components and related technologies follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/ IEC Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu IEC Webstore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt; The IEC standards are harmonized with European standards EN.

The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the generic specification:
* IEC/EN 60384-1, Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 1: Generic specification

The tests and requirements to be met by film capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following sectional specifications:

The text above is directly extracted from the relevant IEC standards, which use the abbreviations "d.c." for Direct Current (DC) and "a.c." for Alternating Current (AC).

=== Film capacitors type abbreviations ===
During the early development of film capacitors, some large manufacturers have tried to standardize the names of different film materials. This resulted in a former German standard (DIN 41 379), since withdrawn, in which an abbreviated code for each material and configuration type were prescribed. Many manufacturers continue to use these de facto standard abbreviations.

However, with the relocation of mass-market business in the passive components industry, which includes film capacitors, many of the new manufacturers in the Far East use their own abbreviations that differ from the previously established abbreviations.

== Electrical characteristics ==
The manufacturers Wima, Vishay and TDK Epcos specify the electrical parameters of their film capacitors in a general technical information sheet.&lt;ref name="characteristics1"&gt;WIMA, "Characteristics of Metallized Film Capacitors in Comparison with Other Dielectrics" {{cite web |url=http://www.wima.de/EN/characteristics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105021659/http://www.wima.de/EN/characteristics.htm |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epcos1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vishay1"/&gt;

=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Film capacitor Ersatzschaltbild.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of a film capacitor]]

The electrical characteristics of capacitors are harmonized by the international generic specification IEC/EN 60384-1. In this standard, the electrical characteristics of capacitors are described by an idealized series-equivalent circuit with electrical components which model all ohmic losses, capacitive and inductive parameters of a film capacitor:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor,
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;isol&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation resistance]] of the dielectric,
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as “ESR”.
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as “ESL”.

The two reactive resistances have following relations with the angular frequency “ω”:

* [[Electrical reactance#Capacitive reactance|Capacitance]] (Capacitive reactance) : &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Inductive reactance|Inductance]](Inductive reactance): &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Capacitance standard values and tolerances ===
The rated capacitance is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. The actual capacitance of film capacitors depends on the measuring frequency and the ambient temperature. Standardized conditions for film capacitors are a measuring frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz and a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C. The percentage of allowed deviation of the capacitance from the rated value is called capacitance tolerance. The actual capacitance value of a capacitor should be within the tolerance limits, or the capacitor is out of specification.

Film capacitors are available in different tolerance series, whose values are specified in the [[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]] standards specified in IEC/EN 60063. For abbreviated marking in tight spaces, a letter code for each tolerance is specified in IEC/EN 60062.

* rated capacitance, [[E96 series]], tolerance ±1%, letter code "F“
* rated capacitance, [[E48 series]], tolerance ±2%, letter code "G“
* rated capacitance, [[E24 series]], tolerance ±5%, letter code "J“
* rated capacitance, [[E12 series]], tolerance ±10%, letter code "K“
* rated capacitance, [[E-series of preferred numbers|E6 series]], tolerance ±20%, letter code "M“

The required capacitance tolerance is determined by the particular application. The narrow tolerances of E24 to E96 will be used for high-quality circuits like precision oscillators and timers. On the other hand, for general applications such as non-critical filtering or coupling circuits, the tolerance series E12 or E6 are sufficient.

==== Frequency and temperature changes in capacitance ====
The different film materials have temperature- and frequency-dependent differences in their characteristics. The graphs below show typical temperature and frequency behavior of the capacitance for different film materials.

[[File:Folko-Kurven-Cap-3.png|thumb|center|upright=3| Capacitance as a function of temperature and frequency, for film capacitors with different film materials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vishay.com/docs/26033/gentecin.pdf Vishay, General Technical Information, film capacitors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111184229/http://www.vishay.com/docs/26033/gentecin.pdf |date=November 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Voltage ratings ===

==== DC voltage ====
[[File:Folko-U-von-T-Normung.svg|thumb|right|Voltage derating between upper rated temperature (85&amp;nbsp;°C for PP, PET and 105&amp;nbsp;°C for PEN, PPS), and upper category temperature]]

The rated DC voltage V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum DC voltage, or peak value of pulse voltage, or the sum of an applied DC voltage and the peak value of a superimposed AC voltage, which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature between the category temperature and the rated temperature.&lt;ref&gt;IEC/EN 60384-1, Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment - Part 1: Generic specification&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakdown voltage of film capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. When using film capacitors at temperatures between the upper rated temperature and the upper category temperature, only a temperature-derated category voltage V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is allowed. The derating factors apply to both DC and AC voltages. Some manufacturers may have quite different derating curves for their capacitors compared with the generic curves given in the picture at the right.

The allowable peak value of a superimposed alternating voltage, called the "rated ripple voltage", is frequency-dependent. The applicable standards specify the following conditions, regardless of the type of dielectric film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/28169/vproof.pdf |title=Vishay, "Voltage Proof Test for Metalized Film Capacitors" |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

==== AC voltage and current ====
[[File:Folko-U-eff-f-Frequenz.png|thumb|Typical RMS AC voltage curves as a function of frequency, for four different capacitance values of a 63&amp;nbsp;V DC capacitor series]]

Film capacitors are not polarized and are suitable for handling an alternating voltage. Because the rated AC voltage is specified as an [[Root-mean-square|RMS]] value, the nominal AC voltage must be smaller than the rated DC voltage. Typical figures for DC voltages and nominally related AC voltages are given in the table below:

{| class="wikitable centered"
|+Rated DC voltages and nominal 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC voltages
|- class="hintergrundfarbe6"
|-
| Rated DC voltage || 50 V || 63 V || 100 V || 250 V || 400 V || 630 V || 1000 V || 1600 V || 2000 V
|-
| Nominal rated AC voltage || 30 V || 40 V || 63 V || 160 V || 220 V || 250 V || 350 V || 550 V || 700 V 
|}

An AC voltage will cause an AC current (with an applied DC bias this is also called "ripple current"), with cyclic charging and discharging of the capacitor causing oscillating motion of the electric dipoles in the dielectric. This results in [[dielectric losses]], which are the principal component of the [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]] of film capacitors, and which produce heat from the alternating current. The maximum RMS alternating voltage at a given frequency which may be applied continuously to a capacitor (up to the rated temperature) is defined as the rated AC voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R AC&lt;/sub&gt;. Rated AC voltages usually are specified at the mains frequency of a region (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz).

The rated AC voltage is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;°K sets the allowed limit for film capacitors. These losses increase with increasing frequency, and manufacturers specify curves for derating maximum AC voltages permissible at higher frequencies.

Capacitors, including film types, designed for continuous operation at low-frequency (50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) mains voltage, typically between line and neutral or line and ground for interference suppression, are required to meet standard safety ratings; e.g., X2 is designed to operate between line and neutral at 200-240&amp;nbsp;VAC, and Y2 between line and ground. These types are designed for reliability, and, in case of failure, to fail safely (open-, rather than short-circuit).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justradios.com/safetytips.html ABC's of SAFETY (Interference Suppression) Capacitors for Tube Radios]&lt;/ref&gt; A non-catastrophic failure mode in this application is due to the [[corona effect]]: the air enclosed in the winding element becomes ionized and consequently more conductive, allowing partial discharges on the metallized surface of the film, which causes local vaporization of the metallization. This occurs repeatedly, and can cause significant loss of capacitance (C-decay) over one or two years. International standard IEC60384-14 specifies a limit of 10% C-decay per 1,000 test hours (41 days of permanent connection).&lt;ref name=corona&gt;[http://www.capacitorindustry.com/vishay-offers-c-stability-in-x2-capacitors www.capacitorindustry.com: Vishay offers C-stability in X2 capacitors, 14 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect. One method, at the expense of increased size and cost, is for a capacitor operating at 200-240&amp;nbsp;VAC to consist internally of two parts in series, each at a voltage of 100-120&amp;nbsp;VAC, insufficient to cause ionisation. Manufacturers also adopt cheaper and smaller construction intended to avoid corona effect without series-connected sections, for example minimising enclosed air.&lt;ref name=corona/&gt;

=== Surge ratings ===
For metallized film capacitors, the maximum possible pulse voltage is limited because of the limited current-carrying capacity between contact of the electrodes and the electrodes themselves. The rated pulse voltage V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the peak value of the pulse voltage which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at the rated temperature and at a given frequency. The pulse voltage capacity is given as pulse voltage rise time dV/dT in V/µs and also implies the maximum pulse current capacity. The values on the pulse rise time refer to the rated voltage.  For lower operating voltages, the permissible pulse rise times may decrease. The permissible pulse load capacity of a film capacitor is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;°K is acceptable.

The maximum permissible pulse rise time of film capacitors which may be applied within the rated temperature range is specified in the relevant data sheets. Exceeding the maximum specified pulse load can lead to the destruction of the capacitor.

For each individual application, the pulse load must be calculated. A general rule for calculating the power handling of film capacitors is not available because of vendor-related differences stemming from the internal construction details of different capacitors. Therefore, the calculation procedure of the manufacturer WIMA is referenced as an example of the generally applicable principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wima.de/en/service/knowledge-base/basic-technical-data-of-capacitors/|title=WIMA, Pulse stressing |publisher=Wima.de |accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impedance, dissipation factor, and ESR ===

==== Impedance ====
[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|upright=0.6| Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a film capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances and resistance ESR and for illustration the impedance and dissipation factor tan&amp;nbsp;δ]]

The [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\ Z = |Z| e^{j\theta} \quad&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Complex number|complex]] ratio of the voltage to the current in an alternating current (AC) circuit at a given frequency.

In data sheets of film capacitors, only the ''magnitude'' of the impedance |Z| will be specified, and simply written as “Z”.  The ''phase'' of the impedance is specified as dissipation factor &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta&lt;/math&gt;.

If the series-equivalent values of a capacitor &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{ESR}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the frequency are known, then the impedance can be calculated with these values. The impedance &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is then the sum of the geometric (complex) addition of the real and the reactive resistances.

:&lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{R_{\mathrm{ESR}}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + X_\mathrm{L})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{R_{\mathrm{ESR}}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt; have the same value (&lt;math&gt;X_C=X_L&lt;/math&gt;), then the impedance will only be determined by &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{ESR}}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Folko-Impedanzverläufe.png|thumb|Typical curves of impedances for film capacitors with different capacitance values]]

The impedance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor to pass alternating currents. The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can be passed through the capacitor. Film capacitors are characterized by very small impedance values and very high resonant frequencies, especially when compared to [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.

==== Dissipation factor (tan δ) and ESR ====
The [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. These are the supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes and the [[dielectric losses]] in the dielectric film. The largest share of these losses is usually the dissipative losses in the dielectric.

For film capacitors, the dissipation factor tan&amp;nbsp;''δ'' will be specified in the relevant data sheets, instead of the ESR. The dissipation factor is determined by the tangent of the phase angle between the capacitive reactance ''X''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; minus the inductive reactance ''X''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and the ''ESR''.

If the inductance ''ESL'' is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = \mbox{ESR} \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

This reason for using the dissipation factor instead of the ESR is, that film capacitors were originally used mainly in frequency-determining [[resonant]] circuits.  The reciprocal value of the dissipation factor is defined as the [[Q factor|quality factor “Q”]].  A high Q value is for resonant circuits a mark of the quality of the resonance.

The dissipation factor for film/foil capacitors is lower than for metallized film capacitors, due to lower contact resistance to the foil electrode compared to the metallized film electrode.

The dissipation factor of film capacitors is frequency-, temperature- and time-dependent. While the frequency- and temperature-dependencies arise directly from physical laws, the time dependence is related to aging and moisture adsorption processes.

File:Folko-Kurve-tand-f-Frequenz-3.png|Dissipation factor of different film materials as a function of frequency
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Insulation resistance ===
[[File:Folko-Kurven-Isolationswiderstand.png|thumb|Typical graphs of insulation resistance &lt;math&gt;R_{isol}&lt;/math&gt; of different film capacitor types as a function of the temperature]]

A charged capacitor discharges over time through its own internal [[insulator (electrical)|insulation]] resistance R&lt;sub&gt;isol&lt;/sub&gt;. The multiplication of the insulation resistance together with the capacitance of the capacitor results in a [[RC circuit|time constant]] which is called the “self-discharge time constant”: (τ&lt;sub&gt;isol&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;isol&lt;/sub&gt;•C). This is a measure of the quality of the dielectric with respect to its insulating properties, and is dimensioned in seconds. Usual values for film capacitors range from 1000&amp;nbsp;s up to 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;s. These time constants are always relevant if capacitors are used as time-determining elements (such as timing delay), or for storing a voltage value as in [[sample-and-hold]] circuits or integrators.

=== Dielectric absorption (soakage) ===
[[Dielectric absorption]] is the name given to the effect by which a capacitor that has been charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. It is a form of [[hysteresis]] in capacitor voltages. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small residual voltage, a phenomenon that is also called "soakage".

The following table lists typical values of the dielectric absorption for common film materials&lt;ref name="characteristics1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="epcos1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holystone"/&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable centered"
|- style="background:#abcdef;"
! Dielectric film material
! Dielectric absorption 
|-
| Polyester (PET) || 0.2 to 0.5%
|-
| Polypropylene (PP) || 0.01 to 0.1%
|-
| Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) || 1.0 to 1.2%
|-
| Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) || 0.05 to 0.1%
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Polypropylene film capacitors have the lowest voltage values generated by dielectric absorption. Therefore, they are ideally suited for precision analog circuits, or for integrators and [[sample-and-hold]] circuits.

=== Aging ===
Film capacitors are subject to certain very small but measurable aging processes. The primary degradation process is a small amount of plastic film shrinkage, which occurs mainly during the soldering process, but also during operation at high ambient temperatures or at high current load.  Additionally, some moisture absorption in the windings of the capacitor may take place under operating conditions in humid climates.

Thermal stress during the soldering process can change the capacitance value of leaded film capacitors by 1% to 5% from initial value, for example. For surface mount devices, the soldering process may change the capacitance value by as much as 10%. The dissipation factor and insulation resistance of film capacitors may also be changed by the above-described external factors, particularly by moisture absorption in high humidity climates.

The manufacturers of film capacitors can slow the aging process caused by moisture absorption, by using better encapsulation.  This more expensive fabrication processing may account for the fact that film capacitors with the same basic body design can be supplied in different life time stability ratings called '''Performance grades'''. '''Performance grade 1 capacitors''' are "longlife", '''Performance grade 2 capacitors''' are "general purpose" capacitors. The specifications behind this grades are defined in the relevant standard of IEC/EN 60384-x (see standards).

The permissible changes of capacitance, dissipation factor and insulation resistance vary with the film material, and are specified in the relevant data sheet.  Variations over the course of time which exceed the specified values are considered as a degradation failure.

=== Failure rate and life expectancy ===
Film capacitors generally are very reliable components with very low failure rates, with predicted life expectancies of decades under normal conditions. The life expectancy for film capacitors is usually specified in terms of applied voltage, current load, and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.com/catalogs/filmAPPguide.pdf] Cornell-Dubilier, ''Power Film Capacitor Application Guide''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Markings ===
Color-coded film capacitors have been produced, but it is usual to print more detailed information on the body. According to the IEC standard 60384.1, capacitors should be marked with imprints of the following information:

*rated capacitance
*rated voltage
*tolerance
*category voltage
*year and month (or week) of manufacture
*manufacturer's name or trade mark
*climatic category
*manufacturer's type designation

Mains-voltage RFI suppression capacitors must also be marked with the appropriate safety agency approvals.

Capacitance, tolerance, and date of manufacture can be marked with short codes. Capacitance is often indicated with the sub-multiple indicator replacing an easily erased decimal point, as: n47&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.47&amp;nbsp;nF, 4n7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.7&amp;nbsp;nF, 47n&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;47&amp;nbsp;nF

== Applications ==
[[File:Capacitors-Overlapping-Applications.png|500px|center|Film capacitors, ceramic capacitors and electrolytic capacitors do have a lot of common applications, which leads to overlapping use]]

In comparison with the other two main capacitor technologies, [[ceramic capacitor|ceramic]] and [[electrolytic capacitor]]s, film capacitors have properties that make them particularly well suited for many general-purpose and industrial applications in electronic equipment.

Two main advantages of film capacitors are very low ESR and ESL values. Film capacitors are physically larger and more expensive than aluminum electrolytic capacitors (e-caps),  but have much higher surge and pulse load capabilities. As film capacitors are not polarized, they can be used in AC voltage applications without DC bias, and they have much more stable electrical parameters. Polypropylene film capacitors have relatively little temperature dependence of capacitance and dissipation factor, so that they can be applied in frequency-stable Class 1 applications, replacing Class 1 ceramic capacitors.

Polypropylene film capacitors meet the criteria for stability Class 1 capacitors, and have low electrical losses and nearly linear behavior over a very wide temperature and frequency range. They are used for [[oscillator]]s and [[RLC circuit|resonant circuits]]; for [[electronic filter]] applications with high [[Q factor|quality factor]] (Q) such as [[high-pass filter]]s, [[low-pass filter]]s and [[band-pass filter]]s as well as for tuning circuits; for [[audio crossover]]s in [[loudspeaker]]s; in [[sample and hold]] A/D converters and in peak voltage detectors. Tight capacitance tolerances are required for timing applications in signal lights or pulse width generators to control the speed of motors, PP film capacitors are also well-suited because of their very low leakage current.

Class 1 PP film capacitors are able to handle higher current than stability Class 1 ceramic capacitors. The precise negative temperature characteristics of polypropylene make PP capacitors useful to compensate for temperature-induced changes in other components.

Fast pulse rise time rating, high dielectric strength ([[breakdown voltage]]), and low dissipation factor (high Q) are the reasons for the use of polypropylene film capacitors in fly-back tuning and S-correction applications in older CRT tube television and display equipment. For similar reasons, PP film capacitors, often in versions with special terminals for high peak currents, work well as [[snubber]]s for power electronic circuits. Because of their high pulse surge capabilities, PP capacitors are suitable for use in applications where high-current pulses are needed, such as in [[time-domain reflectometer]] (TDR) cable fault locators, in [[welding]] machines, [[defibrillator]]s, in high-power pulsed [[laser]]s, or to generate high-energy light or X-ray flashes.

In addition, polypropylene film capacitors are used in many AC applications such as phase shifters for [[power factor correction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upe-inc.com/lighting-motor-capacitors/ |title=UPE, Capacitors for Fluorescent and Gas Discharge Lamps |publisher=Upe-inc.com |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fluorescent lamps, or as a motor-run capacitors.

For simple higher-frequency [[electronic filter|filter circuits]], or in voltage regulator or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized polyester film capacitors provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive [[tantalum capacitor]]s. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, film capacitors with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film capacitors are widely used as [[decoupling capacitor]]s to suppress noise or transients.

Film capacitors made with lower-cost plastics are used for non-critical applications which do not require ultra-stable characteristics over a wide temperature range, such as for smoothing or AC signal coupling.  Polyester film (KT) capacitors of the "stacked" type are often used now instead of polystyrene capacitors (KS), which have become less available.

Metallized film capacitors have self-healing properties, and small imperfections do not lead to the destruction of the component, which makes these capacitors suitable for RFI/EMI suppression capacitors with fault protection against electrical shock and flame propagation, although repeated corona discharges which self-heal can lead to significant loss of capacitance.&lt;ref name=corona/&gt;

PTFE film capacitors are used in applications that must withstand extremely high temperatures. such as in military equipment, in aerospace, in geological probes, or burn-in circuits.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

[[Electromagnetic Interference]] (EMI) or [[Radio Frequency Interference]] (RFI) suppression film capacitors, also known as "AC line filter safety capacitors" or "Safety capacitors", are used as crucial components to reduce or suppress [[electrical noise]] caused by the operation of electrical or electronic equipment, while also limited providing protection against [[electrical shock]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Evox Rifa, "Capacitors for RFI suppression of the AC line: Basic facts"
[http://www.seered.co.uk/sunvic_capacitor_information.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kechome.nsf/file/KEMET%20Kollege%20Presentations/$file/EvoxRifaRFIandSMD.pdf |title=Kemet, "EMI Capacitors on the AC Line" |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/26529/gentecin.pdf |title=Vishay, "Radio Interference Suppression Capacitors Introduction" |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/28153/anaccaps.pdf |title=Vishay, "AC Film Capacitors in Connection with the Mains" |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A suppression capacitor is an effective interference reduction component because its electrical [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] decreases with increasing frequency, so that at higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential interference. On the other hand, Y capacitors are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.

&lt;center&gt;

File:Safety caps-Appliance Class II.svg|Appliance Class II capacitor connection
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

EMI/RFI suppression capacitors are designed and installed so that remaining interference or electrical noise does not exceed the limits of EMC directive EN 50081&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/electrical/documents/emc/legislation/ |title=Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Legislation: Directive 89/336/EC |work=ec.europa.eu |accessdate=2012-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705044039/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/electrical/documents/emc/legislation/ |archivedate=2012-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppression components are connected directly to mains voltage semi-permanently for 10 to 20 years or more, and are therefore exposed to overvoltages and transients which could damage the capacitors. For this reason, suppression capacitors must comply with the safety and inflammability requirements of international safety standards such as the following:

*Europe: EN 60384-14,
*USA: UL 60384-14, UL 1283
*Canada: CAN/CSA-E60384-14, CSA C22.2, No.8
*China: CQC (GB/T 6346.14-2015 or IEC 60384-14)

RFI capacitors which fulfill all specified requirements are imprinted with the [[certification mark]] of various national safety standards agencies. For power line applications, special requirements are placed on the inflammability of the coating and the epoxy resin impregnating or coating the capacitor body.  To receive safety approvals, X and Y powerline-rated capacitors are [[destructive testing|destructively tested]] to the point of failure. Even when exposed to large overvoltage surges, these safety-rated capacitors must fail in a [[fail-safe]] manner that will not endanger personnel or property.

Most EMI/RFI suppression film capacitors are metallized polypropylene film capacitors. However, some types of metallized paper capacitors (MP) are still used for this application, because they still have some advantages in [[flame retardant|flame resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wima.de/EN/flammability.htm |title=Wima, "Flammability of Radio Interference Suppression Capacitors" |publisher=Wima.de |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lighting ballasts ===
[[File:EVG offen-chtaube050410.jpg|thumb|right|An opened electronic lighting ballast device with a "naked" non-encapsulated film capacitor (gray rectangle. mid-photo) for [[Power Factor Correction]]]]

A [[electrical ballast|lighting ballast]] is a device to provide proper starting and operating electrical conditions to light one or more [[fluorescent lamp]]s, while also limiting the amount of current. A familiar and widely used example is the traditional inductive ballast used in [[fluorescent lamps]], to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube's [[negative resistance]] characteristic. A disadvantage of using an inductor is that current is shifted out of phase with the voltage, producing a poor [[power factor]].

Modern electronic ballasts usually change the frequency of the power from a standard [[mains frequency]] of 50 or 60 &amp;nbsp;Hz up to 40 &amp;nbsp;kHz or higher, often using a [[Switched-mode power supply|Switched Mode Power Supply]] (SMPS) circuit topology with [[Power Factor Correction]] (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component in the middle of the ballast circuit is a polyester film capacitor used for PFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightsearch.com/resources/lightguides/ballasts.html |title=Light Guide: Fluorescent Ballasts |publisher=Lightsearch.com |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upe-inc.com/lighting-motor-capacitors/ |title=UPE, Inc., "Capacitors for Fluorescent and Gas Discharge Lamps" |publisher=Upe-inc.com |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Snubber / Damping capacitors ===
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="Snubber film capacitors" class="centered"&gt;
File:Snubber.jpg|[[RC snubber]]s, a simple RC circuit with a small resistor (R) in series with a small film capacitor (C) in a common case
File:Snubber-Film Caps-P1040951.JPG|Snubber film capacitors with heavy-duty terminals for higher-power electronic applications
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Snubber capacitors are designed for the high peak current operation required for protection against transient voltages. Such voltages are caused by the high "di/dt" [[slew rate|current slew rate]] generated in switching power electronics applications.

[[Snubber]]s are energy-absorbing circuits used to eliminate voltage spikes caused by circuit [[inductance]] when a switch opens. The purpose of the snubber is to improve [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive [[ignition coil]] with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the [[slew rate|voltage slew rate]] of semiconductor switches like [[thyristor]]s, [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTO thyristor]]s, [[Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor|IGBT]]s and [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]]s. Snubber capacitors (or higher power "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction.  These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.

Snubber circuits usually incorporate film capacitors, mostly polypropylene film caps. The most important criteria for this application are a low self-inductance, low [[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]], and very high peak current capability. The so-called "snubber” capacitors sometimes have some additional special construction features. The self-inductance is reduced by slimmer designs with narrower width of the electrodes. By double-sided metallization or the film/foil construction of the electrodes, the ESR also can be reduced, increasing the peak current capability. Specially widened terminals which can be mounted directly beneath semiconductor packages can help to increase current handling and decrease inductance.

The most popular simple snubber circuit consists out of a film capacitor and a resistor in series, connected in parallel with a semiconductor component to suppress or damp undesirable voltage spikes.&lt;ref&gt;CDE, "Application Guide Snubber Capacitors, Designing RC Snubber Networks" [http://www.cde.com/catalogs/igbtAPPguide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The capacitor absorbs the inductive turn-off peak current temporarily, so that the resulting voltage spike is limited. But the trend in modern semiconductor technology is towards higher power applications, which increases the peak currents and switching speeds. In this case, the boundary between a standard electronic film capacitor and a power capacitor is blurred, so that larger snubber capacitors belong more in the area of power systems, electrical installations and plants.

The overlapping categories of film and power capacitors are visible when they are applied as snubber capacitors in the growing market for high power electronics with IGBT’s and thyristors. Although the power capacitors use polypropylene film, like the smaller snubber film capacitors, they belong to the family of power capacitors, and are called “damping” capacitors.

=== Power film capacitors ===

[[File:Leistungskondensatoren-DESY-P1040621.JPG|thumb|right|One of several energy storage power film capacitor banks, for magnetic field generation at the Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator ([[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]]), located on the [[DESY]] site in [[Hamburg]] ]]
[[File:Condensor bank 150kV - 75MVAR.jpg|thumb|Capacitor bank with 75&amp;nbsp;MVA for power factor correction of 150&amp;nbsp;kV transmission lines]]

The relatively simple fabrication technique of winding gives film capacitors the possibility of attaining even very large sizes for applications in the high power range, as so-called "power capacitors". Although the materials and the construction of power capacitors are mostly similar to the smaller film capacitors, they are specified and marketed differently for historical reasons.

The "film capacitors" were developed together with the growing market of broadcast and electronic equipment technology in the mid-20th century. These capacitors are standardized under the rules of IEC/EN 60384-1 “Capacitors for use in electronic equipment” and different "film materials" have their own sub standards, the IEC/EN 60384-''n'' series. The "power capacitors" begin at a power handling capacity of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;volt-amps, such as for ballast capacitors in fluorescent lamps. The standardization of power capacitors follows the rules of IEC/EN 61071 and IEC/EN 60143-1, and have for various different applications their own sub standards, such as for railway applications.

Power capacitors can be used for a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called charge carrier storage effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.

The scope of application for DC capacitors is similarly diverse. Smoothing capacitors are used to reduce the AC component of fluctuating DC voltage (such as in power supplies for radio and television transmitters), and for high voltage testing equipment, DC controllers, measurement and control technology and cascaded circuits for generation of high DC voltage. Supporting capacitors, DC-filter or buffer circuit capacitors are used for energy storage in intermediate DC circuits, such as in frequency converters for poly-phase drives, and transistor and thyristor power converters. They must be able to absorb and release very high currents within short periods, the peak values of currents being substantially greater than the [[Root-mean-square|RMS]] values.

Surge (pulse) discharge capacitors are also capable of supplying or absorbing extreme short-duration current surges. They are usually operated in discharge applications with non-reversing voltages, and at low repetition frequencies, such as in laser technology and lighting generators.

Power capacitors can reach quite large physical dimensions. Rectangular housings with internally interconnected individual capacitors can reach sizes of L×W×H = (350×200×1000)&amp;nbsp;mm and above.

The '''ninth generation Ford F-Series''' is a line of full-size and medium-duty commercial trucks that were produced by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] from 1991 to 1997. While still based on the basic design dating from late 1979 (for the 1980 model year), the 1992 F-Series brought a number of minor changes to the exterior and interior (where most enthusiasts consider this a facelift for the [[Ford F-Series seventh generation|same existing truck that first appeared in 1979 as a 1980 model]] instead of a redesign). This is the last generation of the F-Series that was produced as a complete range of trucks from a half-ton pickup (F-150) to a medium-duty [[Truck classification#Class 6|Class 6]] truck (F-250 and above). As this generation was replaced during the 1997–1998 model years, the larger models of the F-Series (F-250 and above) were split from the F-150; these became the [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks, related to the latter with a few powertrain components.

==Design history==
[[File:1994 Ford F-150 Flareside.JPG|thumb|left|alt=1994 F-150 Flareside with an extended cab|1994 F150 FlareSide SuperCab]]
In the interest of aerodynamics, the lines of the hood, front fenders, and grille were rounded off for 1992. Along with the larger grille, the headlights were enlarged (with the turn signals again moving below). Inside, the interior was updated with a redesigned dashboard along with new seats. Extended-cab (SuperCab) models received larger rear side windows. A notable change included the reintroduction of the Flareside bed that returned for production since 1987. Instead of the previous classic-style bed, the Flareside bed was now a narrow-body version of the dual rear-wheel bed; the rear fenders were repositioned to fit the width of the cab.

The 1994 models brought a slightly updated dashboard and the addition of a standard driver's-side [[airbag]] on F150s only, [[Automotive lighting#Centre high mount stop lamp .28CHMSL.29|Center high mount stop lamp]] (CHMSL) third brake light/cargo light, brake-shift interlock and CFC-free air conditioning. New options for 1994 included [[remote keyless entry]] with alarm, a [[car audio|compact disc player]] fitted into the regular stereo system, and a [[power seat|power driver's seat]]; an [[Rear-view mirror#Automatic dimming|electrochromic inside rear view mirror]] was also offered for 1994 and 1995 as part of a luxury light package.

Ford trailed their rival [[General Motors]] in combined truck sales for much of the ninth generation, though sales steadily rose each year. 500,000 F-Series trucks were sold in 1992, but this rose to nearly 800,000 by 1996. Meaning that Ford had overtaken the combined Truck sales of [[Chevrolet]] and [[GMC Truck|GMC]] for the first time in a decade.
In the second half of 1997 The F-250 HD (Heavy Duty) was in the same series as the F-350.

==Trim==
*Custom (1992–1993)
*XL (1992-1997)
*XLT (1992-1997)
*Nite (1990-1992)
*SVT Lightning (1993–1995)
*Eddie Bauer (1995–1996, F-150, only)
*4x4 Offroad (1992-1997)

The monochromatic "Nite" package introduced in 1990 continued, but was dropped at the end of the 1992 model year.  As before, it featured an all-black exterior with either a pink or blue/purple stripe and "Nite" decal on the sides of the cargo box.

For 1993 the Custom model was dropped, as the XL became the new base model. Following the lead of the [[Ford Aerostar|Aerostar]], [[Ford Bronco]], and [[Ford Explorer|Explorer]], the ''Eddie Bauer'' trim line — featuring plusher trim and increased standard features — was reintroduced for 1995.

In 1993, the ''SVT Lightning'' was introduced, slotting itself in between the Chevrolet 454SS and GMC Syclone. [[Ford SVT|Ford Special Vehicles Team]] upgraded the Lightning from the regular F-series with heavy-duty suspension and brakes.  Powertrain upgrades came from heavy-duty trucks, with a 240&amp;nbsp;hp version of the 5.8L V8 and the E4OD overdrive transmission normally paired with the 7.3L diesel and 460 7.5L V8s.

{{-}} 
The F-150, F-250, F-250 HD, F-350, and F-Super Duty were available in many different configurations from chassis cab base models, up to XLT trimmed models with their chrome and plush seating. The trucks came with a variety of gas and diesel engines. The F-150 could be had with one of 4 gas engines, the 4.9L (300 cid) I6, the 5.0L (302 cid) V8, and the 5.8L (351 cid) V8. The same gas engine options were also available for the heavy duty trucks along with the 7.5L (460 cid), or you could opt for the 7.3L (444 cid) diesel. The first version was the 7.3L IDI (Indirect Injected) V8 (1992 - 1993.5), which was produced by [[International Harvester]]. In 1993.5-1994.5 a turbocharged 7.3L IDI V8 with stronger internals was offered as emissions, power, and torque demands were increasing. In the second half of 1994, the new Direct Injected 7.3L Power Stroke V8 Turbodiesel replaced the 7.3L IDI V8. Also built by International Harvester, and used in [[International Trucks]], known as the T444 E Engine. The F-250 HD was available from 1996 to 1997, and differed from the earlier F-250 in the trim that was on it, and it also had a transmission cooler like the later [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks, it also received a heavier rear axle, and heavier springs and shocks. Because of these changes in design, service technicians started to refer to the first powerstrokes as an OBS or Old Body Style to avoid confusion from the similar Super Duty 7.3 Power Stroke parts. As part of the 4x4 offroad package, they were available with several skid plates underneath.  (After 1997, the heavier-duty models were splitting from the Ford F-150. The line of trucks were called the 1999 [[Ford Super Duty]].) The F-150 could be had with either short (6.5') or long (8') beds with either regular or extended cab. The F-250 and F-350 trucks were only available with longbeds (8&amp;nbsp;ft.) except in 1996 and 1997, the F-250 HD could be had in an extended cab/shortbed or crew cab/shortbed model. The crew cab shortbed and extended cab shortbed trucks are very rare, as they were only produced for little over a year. Production of these trucks stopped in Fall of 1997.

==Medium-Duty F-Series==
{{See also|Ford B-Series}}
[[File:Ford F heavy duty.JPG|thumb|left|1994–1998 F600/F700 cargo truck]]

For the 1994.5 model year, the exterior of the medium-duty F-Series was changed for the first time since 1979. Available only as a tilting cowl, the new hood featured a much larger grille. Instead of being mounted on the fenders, the turn signals were now mounted beside the headlights. Instead of the model designation, the cowl badge was replaced by an "F-Series" one. Inside, the interior was largely carried over from 1980.

While still available with a [[Ford 385 engine|7.0L gasoline V8]], many medium-duty F-Series were diesel-powered. Instead of the Navistar T444E V8 engine seen in the F-250/F-350, the medium-duty models offered two inline-6 engines (the [[Caterpillar 3126]] and the Cummins 6BT/ISB). In 1999, these trucks were discontinued, along with the [[Ford B-Series|B-Series]] bus chassis; while the bus chassis was not replaced, Ford re-entered the medium-duty truck market with the [[Ford F-650|Ford F-650/750]]. Built in a joint venture with Navistar, they were integrated into the Super Duty lineup.

==Powertrain==
The 1992 redesign left the powertrain lineup from the previous generation; the gasoline lineup of the 4.9L Inline-6, 5.0L and 5.8L Windsor V8s, and the 7.5L Big Block V8 were all carried over. A 1993 model year option, the 7.3L International [[International Harvester IDI#7.3L|IDI]] diesel V8 gained a turbocharger for the first time. The 1994 model year engine lineup received a retune to increase output. During the 1994 model year, the IDI diesel V8 was replaced by the [[Navistar T444E engine|T444E]] V8. Dubbed the [[Ford Power Stroke engine|Powerstroke]] by Ford, the new diesel was again supplied by [[Navistar International]].  Despite sharing identical displacement with its IDI predecessor, the turbocharged Powerstroke/T444E was an all-new design with direct fuel injection. One thing worth noting is that the 7.3 Powerstroke was the second diesel motor with electronic fuel injection to be put into a light duty truck. The GM 6.5L TurboDiesel with the Stanadyne DS-4 injection pump was the first, appearing in 1992. The Dodge Ram did not offer EFI in its diesel engines until 1998.

As before, the 5.0L V8 was not offered above 8500 GVWR and the F-Superduty was 7.5 and diesel only. The diesels and 7.5 were above 8500 GVWR only (F250HD and heavier.) The 4.9 was available in the F350 through 1996 as a delete option.

The 4wd F150 continued the use of the [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 44 Twin-Traction Beam axle from the 80–91 trucks, and the Ford 8.8" Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 Twin Traction Beam axle, the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the [[Dana 60]] Straight Axle front, and the Sterling 10.25" rear Straight axle.

==Variants==

===SVT Lightning===
The '''SVT Lightning''' is a [[sport car|sports]]/performance version of the F-150, released by Ford's [[Ford SVT|SVT]] (Special Vehicle Team) division.
[[File:1993FordLightning.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Ford SVT Lightning]]

Ford introduced the Lightning in 1992 to compete with primarily the [[Chevrolet C/K#454 SS|Chevrolet 454 SS]], in an effort to enhance the sporty, personal-use image of the Ford F-Series pickup.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} This initial Lightning featured performance handling developed by world-champion driver [[Jackie Stewart]]. The Lightning was powered by a special {{convert|240|hp||0|abbr=on}} version of the {{convert|351|in3|L|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} V8 engine. The Lightning shared its basic platform structure with the regular F-150, but modifications were made to many vehicle systems.  To enhance the Lightning chassis, the thicker frame rails from the 4-wheel drive F-250 used to increase rigidity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The stock Lightning was capable of achieving 0.88 g lateral acceleration, yet it retained almost all the hauling and trailering capabilities of the parent F-Series. A {{convert|351|in3|L|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} ''[[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Windsor]]'' V8 producing {{convert|240|hp||0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|340|ft·lbf|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque replaced the standard F-150 engine. The engine was based on an existing block, but Ford engineers fitted it with high flow rate "GT40" heads and used [[hypereutectic pistons]] to increase response, output and durability.  The engine was also fitted with stainless steel "shorty" headers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

An upgraded Ford E4OD [[automatic transmission]] was the only available transmission. An aluminum [[driveshaft]] connected it to 4.10:1 rear limited slip gears.  The suspension had front and rear anti-rollbars and a special leaf, in the rear, tipped with a rubber snubber, that acted as a ladder bar and controlled rear wheel hop during hard acceleration.  Special 17" aluminum wheels with [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk tires, Lightning badging, a front air dam with [[fog lamp]]s, a {{convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} speedometer and a special [[intake manifold]] all differentiated the Lightning from normal F-150s. Bucket seats with electrically-adjustable side bolsters and [[lumbar]] supports were part of the package. Suspension modifications provided a 1&amp;nbsp;in front and 2.5&amp;nbsp;in rear drop in ride height.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The 1993 Lightning, launched on 15 December 1992 by Ford President Ed Hagenlocker, received more than 150 favorable articles in America's newspapers, magazines, and television outlets, and helped Ford retain leadership in the personal-use truck market.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Three-time World Champion driver [[Jackie Stewart]] was highly involved in fine-tuning of the Lightning's handling. Key Ford engineers, managers, and executives involved in developing the original Lightning Performance Truck were Jim Mason, Robert Burnham, Jim Englehart, Terry DeJonckheere, Rory Carpenter, Bob Hommel, Terrell Edgar, Dick Liljestrand, Deb Neill, Adolfo Mejia, and Fred Gregg.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The '''French National School of Forestry''' (''École nationale des eaux et forêts'', or National School of Water Resources and Forestry), established in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]], in 1824, was the first national training institute for [[foresters]] in France, and a premier early school of forestry in Europe and globally.

In 1964, it was merged into the National School of Rural Engineering, Water Resources and Forestry (''École nationale du génie rural, des eaux et des forêts'', or ENGREF), which in turn became part of [[AgroParisTech]] (''Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l’environnement'', or Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences) in 2006.

'''Glass fiber''' ([[American and British English spelling differences|or]] '''glass fibre''') is a material consisting of numerous extremely fine [[fiber]]s of [[glass]].

Glassmakers throughout history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of glass fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, [[Edward Drummond Libbey]] exhibited a [[dress]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] incorporating glass fibers with the [[diameter]] and texture of [[silk]] fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as [[Pele's hair]].

[[Glass wool]], which is one product called "fiberglass" today, was invented in 1932–1933 by [[Russell Games Slayter]] of [[Owens-Corning]], as a material to be used as thermal [[building insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US2133235?dq=%22G.+Slayter%22 Slayter patent for glass wool].  Application 1933, granted 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; It is marketed under the trade name Fiberglas, which has become a [[genericized trademark]]. Glass fiber when used as a thermal insulating material, is specially manufactured with a bonding agent to trap many small air cells, resulting in the characteristically air-filled low-density "glass wool" family of products.

Glass fiber has roughly comparable mechanical properties to other fibers such as polymers and [[carbon fibers|carbon fiber]]. Although not as rigid as carbon fiber, it is much cheaper and significantly less brittle when used in composites. Glass fibers are therefore used as a reinforcing agent for many [[polymer]] products; to form a very strong and relatively lightweight [[fiber-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced polymer]] (FRP) [[composite material]] called [[glass-reinforced plastic]] (GRP), also popularly known as "fiberglass". This material contains little or no air or gas, is more dense, and is a much poorer thermal insulator than is glass wool.

==Fiber formation==
Glass fiber is formed when thin strands of [[silica]]-based or other formulation glass are [[extrusion|extruded]] into many fibers with small diameters suitable for [[textile]] processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been known for millennia; however, the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. Until this time, all glass fiber had been manufactured as [[Staple (textiles)|staple]] (that is, clusters of short lengths of fiber).

The modern method for producing glass wool is the invention of [[Games Slayter]] working at the [[Owens-Illinois]] Glass Co. ([[Toledo, Ohio]]). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make [[glass wool]] in 1933. The first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] and [[Corning Glass Works]] joined to form the [[Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation]]. When the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber, they introduced continuous [[Filament (textiles)|filament]] glass fibers.&lt;ref name = "Lowenstein"&gt;{{cite book|last = Loewenstein|first = K.L.|year = 1973|title = The Manufacturing Technology of Continuous Glass Fibers|publisher = Elsevier Scientific|location = New York|pages = 2–94|isbn =0-444-41109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/592029 |title= A Market Assessment and Impact Analysis of the Owens Corning Acquisition of Saint-Gobain's Reinforcement and Composites Business |date= August 2007 |accessdate= 2009-07-16 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090815131929/http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/592029 |archivedate= 2009-08-15 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is E-glass, which is [[Borosilicate glass|alumino-borosilicate glass]] with less than 1% [[w/w]] alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are [[A-glass]] ('''A'''lkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide), [[E-CR-glass]] ('''E'''lectrical/'''C'''hemical '''R'''esistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), [[C-glass]] (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), [[D-glass]] (borosilicate glass, named for its low '''D'''ielectric constant), [[R-glass]] (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as '''r'''einforcement), and [[S-glass]] (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).&lt;ref name=ullmann1&gt;

Pure [[silica]] (silicon dioxide), when cooled as [[fused quartz]] into a [[glass]] with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as "fluxing agents" (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass ("A" for "alkali-lime") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called [[cullet]] glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass ("E" because of initial '''e'''lectrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of [[boron]] minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" for "Strength") is used when high tensile strength (modulus) is important, and is thus important in composites for building and aircraft construction. The same substance is known as R-glass ("R" for "reinforcement") in Europe. C-glass ("C" for "chemical resistance") and [[T-glass]] ("T" is for "thermal insulator" – a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.&lt;ref name=redorbit&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/general-2/inventions/2583670/fiberglass Fiberglass].

==Chemistry==
The basis of [[textile]]-grade glass fibers is [[silica]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In its pure form it exists as a [[polymer]], (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  It has no true [[melting point]] but softens up to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, where it starts to [[Chemical decomposition|degrade]].  At 1713&amp;nbsp;°C, most of the [[molecules]] can move about freely.  If the glass is extruded and cooled quickly at this temperature, it will be unable to form an ordered structure.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Gupta  | first = V.B.  |author2=V.K. Kothari  | year = 1997  | title = Manufactured Fibre Technology  | publisher = Chapman and Hall  | location = London  | pages = 544–546  | isbn = 0-412-54030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the polymer it forms SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; groups which are configured as a tetrahedron with the [[silicon]] atom at the center, and four oxygen atoms at the corners. These atoms then form a network bonded at the corners by sharing the [[oxygen]] atoms.

The vitreous and [[crystal]]line states of silica (glass and [[quartz]]) have similar energy levels on a molecular basis, also implying that the glassy form is extremely stable.  In order to induce [[crystallization]], it must be heated to temperatures above 1200&amp;nbsp;°C for long periods of time.&lt;ref name = "Lowenstein" /&gt;

Although pure silica is a perfectly viable glass and glass fiber, it must be worked with at very high temperatures, which is a drawback unless its specific chemical properties are needed. It is usual to introduce impurities into the glass in the form of other materials to lower its working temperature. These materials also impart various other properties to the glass that may be beneficial in different applications. The first type of glass used for fiber was [[soda lime]] glass or A-glass ("A" for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, [[alkali]]-free (&lt;2%) type, E-glass, is an alumino-borosilicate glass.&lt;ref name="Volf"&gt;{{cite book|last = Volf|first = Milos B.|year = 1990|title = Technical Approach to Glass|publisher = Elsevier|location = New York|isbn =0-444-98805-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly [[acid]]s that destroy E-glass.&lt;ref name="Volf" /&gt; T-glass is a North American variant of C-glass. AR-glass is alkali-resistant glass. Most glass fibers have limited [[solubility]] in water but are very dependent on [[pH]]. [[Chloride]] ions will also attack and dissolve E-glass surfaces.

E-glass does not actually melt, but softens instead, the softening point being "the temperature at which a 0.55–0.77 mm diameter fiber 235 mm long, elongates under its own weight at 1 mm/min when suspended vertically and heated at the rate of 5 °C per minute".&lt;ref name="Lubin"&gt;{{cite book|last = Lubin|first = George (Ed.)|year = 1975|title = Handbook of Fiberglass and Advanced Plastic Composites|publisher = Robert E. Krieger|location = Huntingdon NY|id =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain point is reached when the glass has a [[viscosity]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;14.5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Poise (unit)|poise]]. The [[annealing (glass)|annealing]] point, which is the temperature where the internal stresses are reduced to an acceptable commercial limit in 15 minutes, is marked by a viscosity of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;poise.&lt;ref name="Lubin"/&gt;

==Properties==

===Thermal===

Fabrics of woven glass fibers are useful thermal insulators because of their high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good [[thermal insulation]], with a [[thermal conductivity]] of the order of 0.05 [[Watt|W]]/(m·[[Kelvin|K]]).&lt;ref&gt;

The strength of glass is usually tested and reported for "virgin" or pristine fibers—those that have just been manufactured. The freshest, thinnest fibers are the strongest because the thinner fibers are more ductile. The more the surface is scratched, the less the resulting [[wiktionary:tenacity|tenacity]].&lt;ref name="Volf" /&gt; Because glass has an [[amorphous]] structure, its properties are the same along the fiber and across the fiber.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; [[Humidity]] is an important factor in the tensile strength. Moisture is easily [[adsorption|adsorbed]] and can worsen microscopic cracks and surface defects, and lessen tenacity.

In contrast to [[carbon fiber]], glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; Thinner filaments can bend further before they break.&lt;ref&gt;Hillermeier KH, Melliand Textilberichte 1/1969, Dortmund-Mengede, pp. 26–28, "Glass fiber—its properties related to the filament fiber diameter".&lt;/ref&gt; The viscosity of the molten glass is very important for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.

==Manufacturing processes==

=== Melting ===
There are two main types of glass fiber manufacture and two main types of glass fiber product.  First, fiber is made either from a direct melt process or a [[Marbles|marble]] remelt process.  Both start with the raw materials in solid form.  The materials are mixed together and melted in a [[furnace]].  Then, for the marble process, the molten material is [[Shear (fluid)|sheared]] and rolled into marbles which are cooled and packaged.  The marbles are taken to the fiber manufacturing facility where they are inserted into a can and remelted.  The molten glass is extruded to the [[Threaded bushing|bushing]] to be formed into fiber.  In the direct melt process, the molten glass in the furnace goes directly to the bushing for formation.&lt;ref name="Lubin" /&gt;

=== Formation ===
The [[Threaded bushing|bushing]] plate is the most important part of the machinery for making the fiber.  This is a small metal furnace containing [[nozzle]]s for the fiber to be formed through.  It is almost always made of [[platinum]] alloyed with [[rhodium]] for durability.  [[Platinum]] is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for [[wetting]] it.  When [[Threaded bushing|bushing]]s were first used they were 100% platinum, and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside.  Also, due to its cost and the tendency to wear, the platinum was alloyed with rhodium.  In the direct melt process, the bushing serves as a collector for the molten glass.  It is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation.  In the marble melt process, the bushing acts more like a furnace as it melts more of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Loewenstein|first = K.L.|year = 1973|title = The Manufacturing Technology of Continuous Glass Fibers|publisher = Elsevier Scientific|location = New York|page = 91|isbn =0-444-41109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bushings are the major expense in fiber glass production.  The nozzle design is also critical.  The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in multiples of 200.  The important part of the nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region.  It was found that inserting a [[counterbore]] here reduced wetting.  Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit.  As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end.  As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the [[Meniscus (optics)|meniscus]] to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation.  The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Loewenstein|first = K.L.|year = 1973|title = The Manufacturing Technology of Continuous Glass Fibers|publisher = Elsevier Scientific|location = New York|page=94|isbn =0-444-41109-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus.  For E-glass it should be around 400&amp;nbsp;mN/m.&lt;ref name="Volf" /&gt;

The attenuation (drawing) speed is important in the nozzle design.  Although slowing this speed down can make coarser fiber, it is uneconomic to run at speeds for which the nozzles were not designed.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein"/&gt;

=== Continuous filament process ===
In the continuous filament process, after the fiber is drawn, a [[Sizing|size]] is applied.  This size helps protect the fiber as it is wound onto a bobbin.  The particular size applied relates to end-use.  While some sizes are processing aids, others make the fiber have an affinity for a certain resin, if the fiber is to be used in a composite.&lt;ref name="Lubin" /&gt; Size is usually added at 0.5–2.0% by weight. Winding then takes place at around 1 km/min.&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

=== Staple fiber process ===
For staple fiber production, there are a number of ways to manufacture the fiber.  The glass can be blown or blasted with heat or steam after exiting the formation machine.  Usually these fibers are made into some sort of mat.  The most common process used is the rotary process.  Here, the glass enters a rotating spinner, and due to [[centrifugal force]] is thrown out horizontally.  The air jets push it down vertically, and binder is applied.  Then the mat is vacuumed to a screen and the binder is cured in the oven.&lt;ref name = "Mohr 13"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Mohr  | first = J.G.  |author2=W.P. Rowe  | year = 1978  | title = Fiberglass  | publisher = Van Nostrand Reindhold  | location = Atlanta  | page = 13  | isbn =0-442-25447-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Glass fiber has increased in popularity since the discovery that [[asbestos]] causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products. However, the safety of glass fiber is also being called into question, as research shows that the composition of this material (asbestos and glass fiber are both silicate fibers) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos.&lt;ref name="rachel-everywhere"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ejnet.org/rachel/rehw444.htm|title=Fiber Glass: A Carcinogen That's Everywhere|date=1995-05-31|work=Rachel's News|publisher=[[Environmental Research Foundation]]|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/tips/dangerous-insulation1.htm |title=Fiberglass and Asbestos |author=John Fuller |work=Is insulation dangerous?|accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einstein.yu.edu/ehs/Industrial%20Hygiene/Fs_Fibergls.htm |title=Fiberglass |publisher=[[Yeshiva University]] |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16374937 |year=1996 |last1=Infante |first1=PF |last2=Schuman |first2=LD |last3=Huff |first3=J |title=Fibrous glass insulation and cancer: response and rebuttal. |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=113–20 |journal=American journal of industrial medicine |doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199607)30:1&lt;113::aid-ajim21&gt;3.3.co;2-n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1970s studies on rats found that fibrous glass of less than 3 [[Micrometre|μm]] in diameter and greater than 20 μm in length is a "potent carcinogen".&lt;ref name="rachel-everywhere"/&gt; Likewise, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] found it "may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen" in 1990. The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]], on the other hand, says that there is insufficient evidence, and that glass fiber is in [[Carcinogen#American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|group A4: "Not classifiable as a human carcinogen"]].

The [[North American Insulation Manufacturers Association]] (NAIMA) claims that glass fiber is fundamentally different from asbestos, since it is man-made instead of naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naima.org/pages/resources/faq/faq_fiber.html#Anchor-What-32744 |title=What does the research show about the health and safety of fiber glass? |work=FAQs About Fiber Glass Insulation |publisher=NAIMA |accessdate=27 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613074803/http://naima.org/pages/resources/faq/faq_fiber.html |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that glass fiber "dissolves in the lungs", while asbestos remains in the body for life. Although both glass fiber and asbestos are made from silica filaments, NAIMA claims that asbestos is more dangerous because of its crystalline structure, which causes it to [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleave]] into smaller, more dangerous pieces, citing the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]:

{{quote|Synthetic vitreous fibers [fiber glass] differ from asbestos in two ways that may provide at least partial explanations for their lower toxicity. Because most synthetic vitreous fibers are not crystalline like asbestos, they do not split longitudinally to form thinner fibers. They also generally have markedly less [[biopersistence]] in biological tissues than asbestos fibers because they can undergo dissolution and transverse breakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp161-p.pdf Toxicological Profile for Synthetic Vitreous Fibers] (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Services, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry), September 2004, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A 1998 study using rats found that the biopersistence of synthetic fibers after one year was 0.04–10%, but 27% for [[amosite]] asbestos.

== Glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass) ==
{{Main|Fiberglass}}

Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) is a [[composite material]] or [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] made of a [[plastic]] reinforced by fine glass fibers. Like [[graphite-reinforced plastic]], the composite material is commonly referred to as '''fiberglass'''. The glass can be in the form of a chopped strand mat (CSM) or a woven fabric.&lt;ref name=ullmann1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ullmann2&gt;

As with many other composite materials (such as [[reinforced concrete]]), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in [[compression (physical)|compressive]] loading and relatively weak in [[tensile strength]], the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well.&lt;ref name="Gunter"&gt;Erhard, Gunter.

Munich: Hanser Publishers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.&lt;ref name=ullmann1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ullmann2/&gt;

==Uses==
Uses for regular glass fiber include mats and fabrics for [[thermal insulation]], [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulation]], sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It is also used to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, [[pole vault]] poles, [[arrow]]s, [[bow (weapon)|bows]] and [[crossbow]]s, translucent roofing panels, [[automobile]] bodies, [[hockey stick]]s, [[surfboard]]s, boat [[hull (watercraft)|hulls]], and [[paper honeycomb]]. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. Glass fiber is extensively used for making [[FRP tanks and vessels]].&lt;ref name=ullmann1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ullmann2/&gt;

Open-weave glass fiber grids are used to reinforce asphalt pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov/programs/td/publications/documents/ctip-news-2010.pdf |title=Reflective Cracking Treated with GlasGrid |journal= CTIP News |publisher= Federal Highways Administration |year= 2010 |accessdate= 1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-woven glass fiber/polymer blend mats are used saturated with asphalt emulsion and overlaid with asphalt, producing a waterproof, crack-resistant membrane. Use of glass-fiber reinforced polymer [[rebar]] instead of steel rebar shows promise in areas where avoidance of steel corrosion is desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/08sep/01.cfm |title=Steel Versus GFRP Rebars? |journal=Public Roads |publisher=Federal Highways Administration |date=September–October 2005 |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of recycling in glass fiber manufacturing==

Manufacturers of glass-fiber insulation can use [[Glass recycling|recycled glass]]. Recycled glass fiber contains up to 40% recycled glass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/637/story/1509423.html New recycling effort aims to push KC to go green with its glass], Kansas City Star, October 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090311165338/http://www.naima.org/pages/resources/faq/faq_fiber.html FAQs About Fiber Glass Insulation].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20473">{{For|uses of the term "grounding" or "earth" in electricity but not in the context of mains wiring|ground (electricity)}}
As the neutral point of an [[mains electricity|electrical supply]] system is often connected to earth [[ground (electrical)|ground]], '''ground and neutral''' are closely related. Under certain conditions, a [[electrical conduction|conductor]] used to connect to a system neutral is also used for grounding (earthing) of equipment and structures. Current carried on a grounding conductor can result in objectionable or dangerous [[volt]]ages appearing on equipment [[enclosure (electrical)|enclosures]], so the installation of grounding conductors and neutral conductors is carefully defined in electrical regulations. Where a neutral conductor is used also to connect equipment enclosures to earth, care must be taken that the neutral conductor never rises to a high voltage with respect to local ground.

==Definitions==
'''Ground''' or '''earth''' in a [[mains electricity|mains]] ([[alternating current|AC]] power) [[electrical wiring]] system is a conductor that provides a low-[[electrical impedance|impedance]] path to the earth to prevent hazardous voltages from appearing on equipment (high voltage spikes).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=The explanation of how this is achieved is not explained here, nor even in the National Electrical Code, so a solid technical reference is needed.}} The terms {{em|ground}} and {{em|earth}} are used synonymously in this section; {{em|ground}} is more common in North American English, and {{em|earth}} is more common in British English. Under normal conditions, a grounding conductor does not carry current.  Grounding is an integral path for home wiring also because it causes circuit breakers to trip more quickly (ie, GFI), which is safer.  Adding new grounds requires a qualified electrician with information particular to a power company distribution region.

'''Neutral''' is a circuit conductor that normally carries current back to the source.  Neutral is usually connected to ground (earth) at the main electrical panel, street drop, or meter, and also at the final step-down transformer of the supply. That is for simple single panel installations; for multiple panels the situation is more complex.

In the electrical trade, the conductor of a 2-wire circuit connected to the supply neutral point and earth ground is referred to as the {{em|neutral}}. &lt;ref&gt;"Neutral Conductor" in Article 100 - Definitions, NFPA 70 ''National Electrical Code'', 2011 Edition, International Electrical Code Series. The requirement to ground the neutral point begins at Article 250.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a polyphase (usually three-phase) [[alternating current|AC system]], the neutral conductor is intended to have similar voltages to each of the other circuit conductors, but may carry very little current if the phases are balanced.

The United States' [[National Electrical Code]] and Canadian electrical code only define neutral as the grounded, not the polyphase common connection. In [[North American]] use, the polyphase definition is used in less formal language but not in official specifications. In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] defines a neutral conductor as one connected to the supply system neutral point, which includes both these uses.

As per Indian [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations|CEAR]] {{em|neutral conductor}} means that conductor of a multi-wire system, the voltage of which is normally intermediate between the voltages of the other conductors of the system and shall also include return wire of the single phase system.

All neutral wires of the same earthed (grounded) electrical system should have the same electrical potential, because they are all connected through the system ground. Neutral conductors are usually insulated for the same voltage as the line conductors, with interesting exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in North American practice an overhead service-entrance cable has two insulated conductors which are wrapped around and supported by the bare neutral conductor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circuitry==
Neutral wires are usually connected at a neutral [[busbar|bus]] within panelboards or switchboards, and are "bonded" to earth ground at either the electrical service entrance, or at transformers within the system. For electrical installations with [[split-phase electric power|split-phase]] (three-wire single-phase service), the neutral point of the system is at the center-tap on the secondary side of the service transformer. For larger electrical installations, such as those with [[polyphase system|polyphase]] service, the neutral point is usually at the common connection on the secondary side of [[delta-wye transformer|delta/wye connected transformers]]. Other arrangements of polyphase transformers may result in no neutral point, and no neutral conductors.

==Grounding systems==
{{Main|Grounding system}}

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard ([[IEC 60364]]) codifies methods of installing neutral and ground conductors in a building, where these [[earthing systems]] are designated with letter symbols. The letter symbols are common in countries using IEC standards, but North American practices rarely refer to the IEC symbols.  The differences are that the conductors may be separate over their entire run from equipment to earth ground, or may be combined over all or part of their length.  Different systems are used to minimize the voltage difference between neutral and local earth ground. Current flowing in a grounding conductor will produce a voltage drop along the conductor, and grounding systems seek to ensure this voltage does not reach unsafe levels. 

In the TN-S system, separate neutral and protective earth conductors are installed between the equipment and the source of supply (generator or electric utility transformer). Normal circuit currents flow only in the neutral, and the protective earth conductor bonds all equipment cases to earth to intercept any leakage current due to insulation failure. The neutral conductor is connected to earth at the building point of supply, but no common path to ground exists for circuit current and the protective conductor.

In the TN-C system, a common conductor provides both the neutral and protective grounding. The neutral conductor is connected to earth ground at the point of supply, and equipment cases are connected to the neutral. The danger exists that a broken neutral connection will allow all the equipment cases to rise to a dangerous voltage if any leakage or insulation fault exists in any equipment. This can be mitigated with special cables but the cost is then higher. 

In the TN-C-S system, each piece of electrical equipment has both a protective ground connection to its case, and a neutral connection.  These are all brought back to some common point in the building system, and a common connection is then made from that point back to the source of supply and to the earth. 

In a TT system, no lengthy common protective ground conductor is used, instead each article of electrical equipment (or building distribution system) has its own connection to earth ground.

As per Indian [[Central Electricity Authority Regulations|CEAR]] , Rule 41, the grounding system to follow:

-  Neutral conductor of a 3-phase, 4-wire system and the middle conductor of a 2- phase, 3-wire system to have minimum two separate and distinct earth connections with a minimum of two different earth electrodes to have the earth resistance to a satisfactory value. 

- The earth electrodes to be inter-connected to reduce earth resistance.

- Neutral conductor shall also be earthed at one or more points along the distribution system or service line in addition to any connection at user end.

==Combining neutral with ground==

[[Stray voltage]]s created in grounding (earthing) conductors by currents flowing in the supply utility neutral conductors can be troublesome. For example, special measures may be required in barns used for milking dairy cattle. Very small voltages, not usually perceptible to humans, may cause low milk yield, or even [[mastitis]] (inflammation of the udder).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Divers, Simon Francis Peek (ed),''Rebhun's diseases of dairy cattle'', Elsevier Health Sciences, 2008, {{ISBN|1-4160-3137-5}} pp. 389–390&lt;/ref&gt;
So-called "tingle voltage filters" may be required in the electrical distribution system for a milking parlour.

Connecting the neutral to the equipment case provides some protection against faults, but may produce a dangerous voltage on the case if the neutral connection is broken.

Combined neutral and ground conductors are commonly used in [[electricity distribution|electricity supply companies]]' wiring and occasionally for fixed wiring in buildings and for some specialist applications where there is little alternative, such as [[railway electrification system|railways]] and [[tram]]s. Since normal circuit currents in the neutral conductor can lead to objectionable or dangerous differences between local earth potential and the neutral, and to protect against neutral breakages, special precautions such as frequent rodding down to earth (multiple ground rod connections), use of cables where the combined neutral and earth completely surrounds the phase conductor(s), and thicker than normal [[equipotential]] bonding must be considered to ensure the system is safe.

===Fixed appliances on three-wire circuits===
In the United States, the cases of some [[kitchen stove]]s (ranges, ovens), [[cook top]]s, [[clothes dryer]]s and other specifically ''listed'' appliances were grounded through their neutral wires as a measure to conserve copper from [[copper wire and cable|copper cables]] during [[World War II]]. This practice was removed from the [[National Electrical Code|NEC]] in the 1996 edition, but existing installations (called "old work") may still allow the cases of such ''listed'' appliances to be connected to the neutral conductor for grounding.  (Canada did not adopt this system and instead during this time and into the present uses separate neutral and ground wires.)

This practice arose from the [[split-phase electric power|three-wire system]] used to supply both 120 volt and 240 volt loads. Because these ''listed'' appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the protective grounding wire, which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.

===Portable appliances===
In North American and European practice, small portable equipment connected by a cord set is permitted under certain conditions to have merely two conductors in the attachment plug. A [[AC power plugs and sockets#NEMA 1-15 ungrounded (Type A)|polarized plug]] can be used to maintain the identity of the neutral conductor into the appliance but neutral is never used as a chassis/case ground. The small cords to lamps, etc., often have one or more molded ridges or embedded strings to identify the neutral conductor, or may be identified by colour. Portable appliances never use the neutral conductor for case grounding, and often feature "[[appliance classes#Class_II|double-insulated]]" construction.

In places where the design of the [[AC power plugs and sockets|plug and socket]] cannot ensure that a system neutral conductor is connected to particular terminals of the device ("unpolarized" plugs), portable appliances must be designed on the assumption that either pole of each circuit may reach full main voltage with respect to the ground.

===Technical equipment===
In North American practice, equipment connected by a cord set must have three wires, if supplied exclusively by 240 volts, or must have four wires (including neutral and ground), if supplied by 120/240 volts.

There are special provisions in the NEC for so-called technical equipment, mainly professional grade audio and video equipment supplied by so-called "balanced" 120 volt circuits. The center tap of a transformer is connected to ground, and the equipment is supplied by two line wires each 60 volts to ground (and 120 volts between line conductors).  The center tap is not distributed to the equipment and no neutral conductor is used. These cases generally use a grounding conductor which is separated from the safety grounding conductor specifically for the purposes of noise and "hum" reduction.

Another specialized distribution system was formerly specified in patient care areas of hospitals. An isolated power system was furnished, from a special isolation transformer, with the intention of minimizing any leakage current that could pass through equipment directly connected to a patient (for example, an [[electrocardiograph]] for monitoring the heart). The neutral of the circuit was not connected to ground. The leakage current was due to the distributed capacitance of the wiring and capacitance of the supply transformer. &lt;ref&gt; Leslie A. Geddes  ''Handbook of Electrical Hazards and Accidents'', CRC Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0849394317}}, pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; Such distribution systems were monitored by permanently installed instruments to give an alarm when high leakage current was detected.

==Shared neutral==
A '''shared neutral''' is a connection in which a plurality of circuits use the same neutral connection. This is also known as a '''common neutral''', and the circuits and neutral together are sometimes referred to as an '''Edison circuit'''.

===Three-phase circuits===
In a three-phase circuit, a neutral is shared between all three phases. Commonly the system neutral is connected to the star point on the feeding transformer. This is the reason that the secondary side of most three-phase distribution transformers is wye- or star-wound. Three-phase transformers and their associated neutrals are usually found in industrial distribution environments.

A system could be made entirely ungrounded. In this case a fault between one phase and ground would not cause any significant current. In fact, this is not a good scheme. Commonly the neutral is grounded (earthed) through a bond between the neutral bar and the earth bar. It is common on larger systems to monitor any current flowing through the neutral-to-earth link and use this as the basis for neutral fault protection.
 
The connection between neutral and earth allows any phase-to-earth fault to develop enough current flow to "trip" the circuit overcurrent protection device. In some jurisdictions, calculations are required to ensure the fault loop impedance is low enough so that fault current will trip the protection (In Australia, this is referred to in AS3000:2007 Fault loop impedance calculation). This may limit the length of a branch circuit.
 
In the case of two phases sharing one neutral, the worst-case current draw is one side has zero load and the other has full load, or when both sides have full load. The latter case results in 1 + 1@120deg = 1@60deg, i.e. the magnitude of the current in the neutral equals that of the other two wires.

In a three-phase linear circuit with three identical resistive or reactive loads, the neutral carries no current. The neutral carries current if the loads on each phase are not identical. In some jurisdictions, the neutral is allowed to be reduced in size if no unbalanced current flow is expected. If the neutral is smaller than the phase conductors, it can be overloaded if a large unbalanced load occurs.

The current drawn by non-linear loads, such as fluorescent &amp; HID lighting and electronic equipment containing switching power supplies, often contains [[harmonics (electrical power)|harmonics]]. Triplen harmonic currents (odd multiples of the third harmonic) are additive, resulting in more current in the shared neutral conductor than in any of the phase conductors. In the absolute worst case, the current in the shared neutral conductor can be triple that in each phase conductor. Some jurisdictions prohibit the use of shared neutral conductors when feeding single-phase loads from a three-phase source; others require that the neutral conductor be substantially larger than the phase conductors. It is good practice to use four-pole circuit breakers (as opposed to the standard three-pole) where the fourth pole is the neutral phase, and is hence protected against overcurrent on the neutral conductor.

===Split phase===
{{main|Split-phase electric power}}
In split-phase wiring, for example a [[duplex receptacle]] in a North American kitchen, devices may be connected with a cable that has three conductors, in addition to ground. The three conductors are usually coloured red, black, and white. The white serves as a common neutral, while the red and black each feed, separately, the top and bottom hot sides of the receptacle. Typically such receptacles are supplied from two circuit breakers in which the handles of two poles are tied together for a common trip. If two large appliances are used at once, current passes through both and the neutral only carries the difference in current. The advantage is that only three wires are required to serve these loads, instead of four. If one kitchen appliance overloads the circuit, the other side of the duplex receptacle will be shut off as well. This is called a [[multiwire branch circuit]]. Common trip is required when the connected load uses more than one phase simultaneously. The common trip prevents overloading of the shared neutral if one device draws more than rated current.

==Grounding problems==
A ground connection that is missing or of inadequate capacity may not provide the protective functions as intended during a fault in the connected equipment. Extra connections between ground and circuit neutral may result in circulating current in the ground path, stray current introduced in the earth or in a structure,  and [[stray voltage]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} Extra ground connections on a neutral conductor may bypass the protection provided by a ground-fault circuit interrupter. Signal circuits that rely on a ground connection will not function or will have erratic function if the ground connection is missing.

An '''independent power producer''' (IPP) or '''non-utility generator''' (NUG) is an [[entity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/2013/gas-engines-for-ipps/ Gas engines for IPPs], www.clarke-energy.com, accessed 11 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which is not a [[public utility]], but which owns facilities to generate electric [[Electric power|power]] for sale to [[utilities]] and end users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopower.com/glossary/term_view.php?TermID=76 |title=Independent Power Producer (IPP) - Americas Generators |publisher=Gopower.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NUGs may be privately held facilities, corporations, cooperatives such as rural solar or wind energy producers, and non-energy industrial concerns capable of feeding excess energy into the system.&lt;ref name=vortex&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energyvortex.com/energydictionary/independent_power_producer_(ipp)__non_utility_generator_(nug).html |title=independent power producer (IPP), non-utility generator (NUG) |publisher=Energyvortex.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic situation==
For the majority of IPPs, particularly in the [[renewable energy industry]], a [[feed-in Tariff]] or [[Power Purchase Agreement]] provides a long term price guarantee.

===Germany===
Has been uncommon in Germany for decades but since the EEG (for renewable energy) the business model gets more common. It depends on finding a partner for distributing the produced energy to the customer. 

===Canada===
In 2002, the BC government stipulated that new clean renewable energy generation in the province&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcel.org/articles/IPP-QandA.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be developed by "[[Independent Power Producers in British Columbia|independent power producers]]" (IPPs) not [[BC Hydro]], save for large hydro-electric facilities. The role of the private sector in developing BC’s "public" resources is one of the more controversial issues that British Columbians are currently grappling with.

===Taiwan===
The liberalization of Taiwan electricity market was done in January 1995. Currently there are nine IPP companies operating in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.re.org.tw/Eng/overview4.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200555/http://www.re.org.tw/Eng/overview4.aspx |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Prior to the [[United States|US]] [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA) of 1978, NUGs were rare, and the few that existed were seldom able to distribute power, as the cost of building the conveyance infrastructure was prohibitive.  Public utilities generated power and owned  the generating facilities, the transmission lines, and the local delivery systems.
Congress Passed the PURPA in 1978, establishing a class of non‐utility generators, called Qualifying Facilities (QF), which were permitted to produce power for resale. 

PURPA was intended to reduce domestic dependence on foreign energy, to encourage energy conservation, and to reduce the ability of electric utilities to abuse the purchase of power from QFs. A QF is defined as a generating facility that produces electricity and another form of useful thermal energy through the sequential use of energy, and meets certain ownership, operating, and efficiency criteria established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Section 210 of [[PURPA]] now requires [[utilities]] to purchase energy from NUGs which qualify (qualifying facilities) at the utility's avoided cost. This allows NUGs to receive a reasonable to excellent price for the energy they produce and ensures that energy generated by small producers won't be wasted.&lt;ref name=vortex/&gt;

=== Pakistan===
In 1994, [[Government of Pakistan]] announced an investor friendly policy to develop IPPs based on oil, coal and gas, which helped in establishment of 16 IPPS. Later in 1995, a hydro power policy was announced which resulted in development of country's first Hydro IPP. 

In 2002, new government adopted new policy, by which another 12 IPPs started operations. 

In 2015, Pakistan adopted a new power policy by which another 13 IPPs were established, mostly by Chinese companies. A transmission policy for development of [[transmission line]] in private sector was also announced. 

As of 2018, currently more than 40 IPPs are operating in Pakistan.

=== India ===
India also has many IPP's like [[ReNew Power]], Adani, Hero, Mytrah, Ostro, Greenko Etc.

'''Maritime Electric''' is the supplier of electricity in [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Canada]]. Maritime Electric is a [[public utility]], and is regulated the [[Prince Edward Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission|Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission]] (IRAC) under the Electric Power Act and the Renewable Energy Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maritimeelectric.com/about_us/regulation/reg_regulations_on_pei.asp| title=Electricity Regulation on PEI| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503053208/http://www.maritimeelectric.com/about_us/regulation/reg_regulations_on_pei.asp| archivedate=2009-05-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utility operates two generating stations on the island: the [[Charlottetown Thermal Generating Station]] and the [[Borden Generating Station]].

On November 13, 2009, it was announced that the PEI government was in discussion with the province of [[Quebec]], with regard to providing electric power between the two provinces, which could lead to a long-term supply contract with [[Hydro-Québec]], the construction of a submarine transmission line linking PEI and the [[Magdalen Islands]], and, pending Fortis' involvement, the sale of Maritime Electric to Hydro-Québec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quebec, P.E.I. talk power |first=Brent |last=Bundale |work=Telegraph-Journal |location=Saint John, N.B. |date=14 November 2009 |page=C1 |accessdate=2009-11-14 |url=http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/front/article/856990 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001192129/http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/front/article/856990 |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the announcement of Hydro-Québec's proposed purchase of most of [[NB Power]]'s assets two weeks earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Quebec, N.B. strike $4.8B deal for NB Power |work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/10/29/nb-power-sale.html |date=October 29, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031195424/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/10/29/nb-power-sale.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which failed in March 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2010/03/24/nb-nbpower-graham-1027.html |work=CBC News |title=Quebec balked at NB Power sale costs |date=March 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327123508/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2010/03/24/nb-nbpower-graham-1027.html |archivedate=March 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''metal-phenolic network''' is a supramolecular coordination structure which consists of metal [[Ion|ions]] and [[polyphenols]]. These materials were first reported by an Australian group at The [[University of Melbourne]]. MPN materials can be coated on versatile substrates to form [[Nanostructure|nanostructured]] films,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6142/154.short|title = One-Step Assembly of Coordination Complexes for Versatile Film and Particle Engineering|journal = Science|issue = 12|doi = 10.1126/science.1237265|year = 2013|volume = |page = 154|pmid = |author1=Hirotaka Ejima |author2=Joseph J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8402">{{Science with neutrons}}
A '''neutron source''' is any device that emits [[neutron]]s, irrespective of the mechanism used to produce the neutrons. Neutron sources are used in physics, engineering, medicine, nuclear weapons, petroleum exploration, biology, chemistry, and nuclear power.

Neutron source variables include the energy of the neutrons emitted by the source, the rate of neutrons emitted by the source, the size of the source, the cost of owning and maintaining the source, and government regulations related to the source.

==Small devices==

===Radioisotopes which undergo spontaneous fission===
Certain [[isotope]]s undergo [[spontaneous fission]] with emission of neutrons. The most commonly used spontaneous fission source is the radioactive isotope [[californium]]-252. Cf-252 and all other spontaneous fission neutron sources are produced by irradiating [[uranium]] or another [[transuranic element]] in a nuclear reactor, where neutrons are absorbed in the starting material and its subsequent reaction products, transmuting the starting material into the [[spontaneous fission|SF]] isotope. Cf-252 neutron sources are typically 1/4" to 1/2" in diameter and 1" to 2" in length. When purchased new a typical Cf-252 neutron source emits between 1×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; to 1×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second but, with a half life of 2.6 years, this neutron output rate drops to half of this original value in 2.6 years. The price of a typical Cf-252 neutron source is from $15,000 to $20,000.

===Radioisotopes which decay with alpha particles packed in a low-Z elemental matrix===
Neutrons are produced when [[alpha particle]]s impinge upon any of several low-atomic-weight isotopes including isotopes of beryllium, carbon, and oxygen. This nuclear reaction can be used to construct a neutron source by mixing a radioisotope that emits alpha particles such as [[radium]], [[polonium]], or [[americium]] with a low-atomic-weight isotope, usually by blending powders of the two materials. Typical emission rates for alpha reaction neutron sources range from 1×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 1×10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second. As an example, a representative alpha-beryllium neutron source can be expected to produce approximately 30 neutrons for every one million alpha particles. The useful lifetime for these types of sources is highly variable, depending upon the half life of the radioisotope that emits the alpha particles. The size and cost of these neutron sources are comparable to spontaneous fission sources. Usual combinations of materials are [[plutonium]]-[[beryllium]] (PuBe), [[americium]]-beryllium (AmBe), or americium-[[lithium]] (AmLi).

===Radioisotopes which decay with high-energy photons co-located with beryllium or deuterium===
Gamma radiation with an energy exceeding the neutron binding energy of a nucleus can eject a neutron (a  [[photoneutron]]). Two example reactions are:
*&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;[[Beryllium|Be]] + &gt;1.7 Mev photon → 1 neutron + 2 &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He
*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[[H]] ([[deuterium]]) + &gt;2.26 MeV photon → 1 neutron + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H

===Sealed-tube neutron generators===
Some accelerator-based [[neutron generator]]s induce fusion between beams of [[deuterium]] and/or [[tritium]] ions and [[metal hydride]] targets which also contain these isotopes.

==Medium-sized devices==

===Plasma focus and [[Z-pinch|plasma pinch]] devices===
The [[dense plasma focus]] neutron source produces controlled [[nuclear fusion]] by creating a dense plasma within which heats ionized [[deuterium]] and/or [[tritium]] gas to temperatures sufficient for creating fusion.

===Inertial electrostatic confinement===
[[Inertial electrostatic confinement]] devices such as the Farnsworth-Hirsch [[fusor]] use an [[electric field]] to heat a plasma to fusion conditions and produce neutrons. Various applications from a hobby enthusiast scene up to [[Phoenix Nuclear Labs|commercial applications]] have developed, mostly in the US.

===Light ion accelerators===
Traditional particle accelerators with hydrogen (H), deuterium (D), or tritium (T) ion sources may be used to produce neutrons using targets of deuterium, tritium, lithium, beryllium, and other low-Z materials.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Typically these accelerators operate with energies in the &gt; 1 MeV range.

===High-energy [[bremsstrahlung]] photoneutron/photofission systems===
Neutrons are produced when photons above the nuclear binding energy of a substance are incident on that substance, causing it to undergo [[giant dipole resonance]] after which it either emits a neutron ([[photoneutron]]) or undergoes fission ([[photofission]]). The number of neutrons released by each fission event is dependent on the substance. Typically photons begin to produce neutrons on interaction with normal matter at energies of about 7 to 40 [[MeV]], which means that [[radiotherapy]] facilities using [[megavoltage X-rays]] also produce neutrons, and some require neutron shielding.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In addition, electrons of energy over about 50 [[MeV]] may induce giant dipole resonance in nuclides by a mechanism which is the inverse of [[internal conversion]], and thus produce neutrons by a mechanism similar to that of photoneutrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slac.stanford.edu/cgi-wrap/getdoc/slac-pub-6628.pdf Giant Dipole Resonance Neutron Yields Produced by Electrons as a Function of Target Material and Thickness]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Large devices==
===Nuclear fission reactors===
[[Nuclear fission]] which takes place within in a reactor produces very large quantities of neutrons and can be used for a variety of purposes including power generation and experiments.

===Nuclear fusion systems===
[[Nuclear fusion]], the combining of the heavy isotopes of hydrogen, also has the potential to produces large quantities of neutrons. Small scale fusion systems exist for (plasma) research purposes at many universities and laboratories around the world. A small number of large scale nuclear fusion experiments also exist including the [[National Ignition Facility]] in the USA, [[Joint European Torus|JET]] in the UK, and soon the [[ITER]] experiment currently under construction in France. None are yet used as neutron sources.

[[Inertial confinement fusion]] has the potential to produce orders of magnitude more neutrons than [[spallation]].&lt;ref name=taylor2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, Andrew |title=A Route to the Brightest Possible Neutron Source? |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |date=February 2007 |pages=1092–1095 |pmid=17322053 |doi=10.1126/science.1127185 |last2=Dunne |first2=M |last3=Bennington |first3=S |last4=Ansell |first4=S |last5=Gardner |first5=I |last6=Norreys |first6=P |last7=Broome |first7=T |last8=Findlay |first8=D |last9=Nelmes |first9=R |issue=5815|bibcode= 2007Sci...315.1092T}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be useful for [[neutron radiography]] which can be used to locate hydrogen atoms in structures, resolve atomic thermal motion and study collective excitations of nuclei more effectively than [[X-rays]].

===High-energy particle accelerators===
A [[spallation#Production of neutrons at a spallation neutron source|spallation]] source is a high-flux source in which [[proton]]s that have been accelerated to high energies hit a target material, prompting the emission of neutrons.

==Neutron flux==
For most applications, a higher [[neutron flux]] is better (since it reduces the time required to conduct the experiment, acquire the image, etc.). Amateur fusion devices, like the [[fusor]], generate only about 300 000 neutrons per second. Commercial fusor devices can generate on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second, which corresponds to a usable flux of less than 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; n/(cm² s). Large neutron beamlines around the world achieve much greater flux. Reactor-based sources now produce 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; n/(cm² s), and spallation sources generate greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; n/(cm² s).

The  '''ounce''' (abbreviated '''oz'''; [[Apothecaries' system|apothecary symbol]]: '''℥''') is a unit of [[mass]], [[weight]], or [[volume]]  used in most [[imperial units|British derived]] customary [[measurement system|systems of measurement]]. The common [[#International avoirdupois ounce|avoirdupois ounce]] (approximately {{convert|1.000|oz|disp=out}}) is {{frac|1|16}} of a common [[Pound_(mass)#Avoirdupois_pound|avoirdupois pound]]; this is the [[United States customary units|United States customary]] and British [[imperial unit|imperial]] ounce. It is primarily used in the United States to measure packaged foods and food portions, postal items, [[areal density]] of fabric and paper, [[boxing glove]]s, and so on; but sometimes also elsewhere in the [[Anglosphere]].

Besides the common ounce, several other ounces are in current use:
* The [[#International troy ounce|troy ounce]] of about {{convert|1.000|ozt|g|disp=out}} is used for the mass of [[precious metal]]s such as gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium, etc.
* The [[#Ounce-force|ounce-force]] is a measure of [[weight]], that is, [[force]].
* The [[#Fluid ounce|fluid ounce]] is a measure of [[volume]].

Historically, a variety of different ounces measuring mass or volume were used in different jurisdictions by different trades.

== Etymology ==
''Ounce'' derives from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|[[uncia (unit)|uncia]]}}, a unit that was one-twelfth ({{frac|1|12}})&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|uncia|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman]] [[pound (mass)#Roman libra|pound]] ({{lang|la|libra}}). ''Ounce'' was borrowed twice: first into [[Old English]] as {{lang|ang|ynsan}} or {{lang|ang|yndsan}} from an unattested [[Vulgar Latin]] form with ''ts'' for ''c'' before ''i'' ([[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]) and second into [[Middle English]] through [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle French]] ({{lang|enm|unce, once, ounce}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|ounce}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation ''oz'' came later from the [[cognate]] Italian word {{lang|it|onza}} (now spelled {{lang|it|oncia}}).

''[[Inch]]'' comes from the same Latin word, but differs because it was borrowed into Old English and underwent i-mutation or [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] ({{IPA|[u]}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[y]}}) and [[Phonological_history_of_Old_English#Palatalization|palatalization]] ({{IPA|[k]}}&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;{{IPA|[tʃ]}}).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Definitions ==
Historically, in different parts of the world, at different points in time, and for different applications, the ounce (or its translation) has referred to broadly similar but different standards of mass.

=== Currently in use ===

==== International avoirdupois ounce ====
The international avoirdupois ounce is defined as exactly 28.349523125&amp;nbsp;g under the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959, signed by the United States and countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

In the [[avoirdupois]] system, sixteen ounces make up an [[Pound (mass)#Avoirdupois pound|avoirdupois pound]], and the avoirdupois pound is defined as 7000 [[grain (unit)|grains]]; one avoirdupois ounce is therefore equal to 437.5 grains.

The ounce is still a standard unit in the United States. In the [[United Kingdom]] it ceased to be a legal unit of measure in 2000, but is still in general usage on an informal basis. In addition it is the normal measure for portion sizes in British restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

          |date=2000-09-20           |accessdate=2009-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International troy ounce ====
{{main article|Troy ounce}}
A [[troy ounce]] is equal to 480 [[Grain (unit)|grains]].  Consequently, the '''international troy ounce''' is equal to exactly 31.1034768&amp;nbsp;grams.  There are 12 troy ounces in the now obsolete [[Pound (mass)#Troy pound|troy pound]].

Today, the troy ounce is used only to express the mass of precious metals such as [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[palladium]], [[rhodium]] or [[silver]]. [[Bullion coin]]s are the most common products produced and marketed in troy ounces, but precious metal bars also exist in gram and kilogram (kg) sizes. (A kilogram bullion bar contains 32.15074657 troy ounces.)

For historical measurement of gold,
* a '''fine ounce''' is a troy ounce of pure gold content in a gold bar, computed as [[fineness]] multiplied by gross weight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=London Bullion Market Association|title=Market Basics|url=http://www.lbma.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308170239/http://www.lbma.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=17|archivedate=2012-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a '''standard ounce''' is a troy ounce of 22 [[Carat (purity)|carat]] gold, 91.66% pure (an 11 to 1 proportion of gold to [[alloy]] material)

==== Metric ounces ====
Some countries have redefined their ounces in the [[metric system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. A. |last=Wittop Koning |first2=G. M. M. |last2=Houben |title=2000 jaar gewichten in de nederlanden|language=nl |publisher=De Tijdstroom |location=Lochem-Poperinge |year=1980 |isbn=9060879651 }} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the German apothecaries ounce of 30 grams, is very close to the previously widespread Nuremberg ounce, but the divisions and multiples come out in metric.

In 1820, the Dutch redefined their ounce (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''ons'') as 100 [[gram]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outpostthehague.com/relocations/insideguide/wheretoturn.htm |title=Guide to The Hague – Where to turn |accessdate=2008-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316071124/http://www.outpostthehague.com/relocations/insideguide/wheretoturn.htm |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Nederlands metriek stelsel]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch amendments to the metric system, such as an ''ons'' or 100&amp;nbsp;grams, has been inherited, adopted, and taught in [[Indonesia]] beginning in elementary school. It is also listed as [[Standard language|standard usage]] in Indonesia's national dictionary, the ''[[Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia]]'', and the government's official elementary‐school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kbbi.web.id/ons Ons in KBBI]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical ===

==== Apothecaries' ounce ====
The obsolete [[Apothecaries' system|apothecaries']] ounce (abbreviated &amp;#8485;&lt;!--({{U+}}2125)--&gt;) equivalent to the troy ounce, was formerly used by [[apothecary|apothecaries]].

==== Maria Theresa ounce ====
"Maria Theresa ounce" was once introduced in Ethiopia and some European countries, which was equal to the weight of one [[Maria Theresa thaler]], or 28.0668 g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

{{further information|Spanish customary units}}
The Spanish pound ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''libra'') was 460 g.&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Real Academia Española'', 23rd edition, [http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?IDLEMA=45615&amp;NEDIC=Si libra]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish ounce (Spanish ''onza'') was {{frac|1|16}} of a pound, i.e. 28.75 g.&lt;ref&gt;''Diccionario de la Real Academia Española'', 23rd edition, [http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?IDLEMA=82285&amp;NEDIC=Si onza]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tower ounce ==== &lt;!--linked--&gt;
The Tower ounce of 450 grains was used in the English mints, the principal one being in the Tower of London.  It dates back to the Anglo-Saxon coinage weight standard. It was abolished in favour of the Troy ounce by Henry VIII in 1527.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Ounce-force==
{{Main article|Pound-force}}
An ounce-force is {{frac|16}} of a pound-force, or {{convert|1/16|lbf|N|7|abbr=off|lk=out|disp=output only}}.

The "ounce" in "ounce-force" is equivalent to an avoirdupois ounce; ounce-force is a measurement of force using avoirdupois ounces. However, it is not necessary to identify it as such or to differentiate it in that way because there is no equivalent measure of force using troy or any other "ounce".

==Fluid ounce==
{{Main article|Fluid ounce}}
A fluid ounce (abbreviated fl oz, fl. oz. or oz. fl.) is a unit of [[volume]] equal to about 28.4 ml in the imperial system or about 29.6 ml in the US system. The fluid ounce is sometimes referred to simply as an "ounce" in applications where its use is implicit, such as [[bartending]].

== Other uses ==

=== Fabric weight ===
Ounces are also used to express the "weight", or more accurately the [[areal density]], of a textile fabric in North America, Asia or the UK, as in "''16 oz denim''". The number refers to the weight in ounces of a given amount of fabric, either a yard of a given width, or a square yard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashiondex.com/howtos/htstfm4.php|title=How to shop the fabric market |accessdate=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictO.html#ounce|title=How Many?

=== Copper layer thickness of a printed circuit board ===
The most common unit of measure for the copper thickness on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) is ounces (oz). It is the resulting thickness when 1&amp;nbsp;oz of copper is pressed flat and spread evenly over a one-square-foot area. This roughly equals 34.7&amp;nbsp;µm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcbuniverse.com/pcbu-tech-tips.php?a=4|accessdate=2016-11-13 |title=Copper Thickness FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pylon ds.jpg|thumb|172px|Overhead power line in [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]].]]
An '''overhead power line''' is a structure used in [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] to transmit electrical energy along large distances. It consists of one or more [[electrical conductor|conductors]] (commonly multiples of three) suspended by [[Transmission tower|towers]] or [[Utility pole|poles]]. Since most of the [[electrical insulation|insulation]] is provided by air, overhead power lines are generally the lowest-cost method of power transmission for large quantities of electric energy.

==Construction==

[[File:NAURU JULY 2007 (10709113444).jpg|thumb|A man working on powerlines in [[Nauru]] (2007)]]
Towers for support of the lines are made of wood (as-grown or laminated), steel or aluminum (either lattice structures or tubular poles), concrete, and occasionally reinforced plastics.  The bare wire conductors on the line are generally made of aluminum (either plain or [[ACSR|reinforced with steel]], or composite materials such as carbon and glass fiber), though some copper wires are used in medium-voltage distribution and low-voltage connections to customer premises. A major goal of overhead power line design is to maintain adequate clearance between energized conductors and the ground so as to prevent dangerous contact with the line, and to provide reliable support for the conductors, resilience to storms, ice loads, earthquakes and other potential damage causes.&lt;ref name="Fink78"&gt;[[Donald G. Fink]] and H. Wayne Beaty, ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, Chapter 14 ''Overhead Power Transmission''&lt;/ref&gt;
Today overhead lines are routinely operated at voltages exceeding 765,000 volts between conductors, with even higher voltages possible in some cases.

== Classification by operating voltage ==
[[File:Łomża linia elektroenergetyczna napowietrzna.jpg|thumb|173px|High- and medium-voltage power lines in [[Łomża]], Poland]]
Overhead power transmission lines are classified in the electrical power industry by the range of voltages:
* Low voltage (LV) – less than 1000 volts, used for connection between a residential or small commercial customer and the utility.
* Medium voltage (MV; distribution) – between 1000 volts (1 kV) and 69 kV, used for distribution in urban and rural areas.
* High voltage (HV; [[subtransmission]] less than 100&amp;nbsp;kV; subtransmission or transmission at voltages such as 115&amp;nbsp;kV and 138&amp;nbsp;kV), used for sub-transmission and transmission of bulk quantities of electric power and connection to very large consumers.
* Extra high voltage (EHV; transmission) – from 345 kV, up to about 800 kV,&lt;ref name=TGonen&gt;

* Ultra high voltage (UHV) – higher than 800 kV. The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported UHV lines are a "game changer", making a global electricity grid potentially feasible.  [[State Grid Corporation of China|StateGrid]] said that compared to conventional lines, UHV enables the transmission of five time more power, over six times the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Structures==
{{See also|Transmission tower}}
Structures for overhead lines take a variety of shapes depending on the type of line. Structures may be as simple as wood [[Utility pole|poles]] directly set in the earth, carrying one or more cross-arm beams to support conductors, or "armless" construction with conductors supported on insulators attached to the side of the pole.  Tubular steel poles are typically used in urban areas.  High-voltage lines are often carried on lattice-type [[Electricity pylon|steel towers]] or pylons. For remote areas, aluminum towers may be placed by [[helicopter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004113042/http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/PoweringUp|title=Powering Up - Vertical Magazine - The Pulse of the Helicopter Industry|archivedate=4 October 2015|work=verticalmag.com |accessdate=4 October 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|GBWHUdPQCH8|[[Sunrise Powerlink]] Helicopter Operations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete poles have also been used.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt; Poles made of reinforced plastics are also available, but their high cost restricts application.

Each structure must be designed for the loads imposed on it by the conductors.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt; The weight of the conductor must be supported, as well as dynamic loads due to wind and ice accumulation, and effects of vibration. Where conductors are in a straight line, towers need only resist the weight since the tension in the conductors approximately balances with no resultant force on the structure.  Flexible conductors supported at their ends approximate the form of a [[catenary]], and much of the analysis for construction of transmission lines relies on the properties of this form.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt;

A large transmission line project may have several types of towers, with "tangent" ("suspension" or "line" towers, UK) towers intended for most positions and more heavily constructed towers used for turning the line through an angle, dead-ending (terminating) a line, or for important river or road crossings.  Depending on the design criteria for a particular line, semi-flexible type structures may rely on the weight of the conductors to be balanced on both sides of each tower.  More rigid structures may be intended to remain standing even if one or more conductors is broken.  Such structures may be installed at intervals in power lines to limit the scale of cascading tower failures.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt;

Foundations for tower structures may be large and costly, particularly if the ground conditions are poor, such as in wetlands.  Each structure may be stabilized considerably by the use of guy wires to counteract some of the forces applied by the conductors.
[[Image:Einebenenleitung.jpg|thumb|low-profile power lines near an [[airfield]]]]
Power lines and supporting structures can be a form of [[visual pollution]]. In some cases the lines are buried to avoid this, but this "[[undergrounding]]" is more expensive and therefore not common.

For a single wood [[utility pole]] structure, a pole is placed in the ground, then three crossarms extend from this, either staggered or all to one side. The insulators are attached to the crossarms. For an "H"-type wood pole structure, two poles are placed in the ground, then a crossbar is placed on top of these, extending to both sides. The insulators are attached at the ends and in the middle. [[Lattice tower]] structures have two common forms. One has a pyramidal base, then a vertical section, where three crossarms extend out, typically staggered. The [[strain insulator]]s are attached to the crossarms. Another has a pyramidal base, which extends to four support points. On top of this a horizontal truss-like structure is placed.

A grounded wire is sometimes strung along the tops of the towers to provide lightning protection. An [[optical ground wire]] is a more advanced version with embedded [[optical fiber]]s for communication.

Some markers include [[Balisor|flashing lamps]] for night-time warning.

===Circuits===
A ''single-circuit transmission line'' carries conductors for only one circuit. For a [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase]] system, this implies that each tower supports three conductors.

A ''double-circuit transmission line''  has two circuits. For three-phase systems, each tower supports and insulates six conductors. Single phase AC-power lines as used for [[Railway electrification system|traction current]] have four conductors for two circuits. Usually both circuits operate at the same voltage.

In HVDC systems typically two conductors are carried per line, but in rare cases only one pole of the system is carried on a set of towers.

In some countries like Germany most power lines with voltages above 100 kV are implemented as double, quadruple or in rare cases even hextuple power line as [[rights of way]] are rare. Sometimes all conductors are installed with the erection of the pylons; often some circuits are installed later. A disadvantage of double circuit transmission lines is that maintenance can be difficult, as either work in close proximity of high voltage or switch-off of two circuits is required.  In case of failure, both systems can be affected.

The largest double-circuit transmission line is the [[Kita-Iwaki Powerline]].

==Insulators==
[[File:Power line with ceramic insulators.jpg|thumb|Medium-voltage power lines with ceramic insulators in California]]
[[File:Pylon.detail.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|Modular suspension insulators are used for high-voltage lines.]]
[[Electrical insulation#High-voltage insulators|Insulators]] must support the conductors and withstand both the normal operating voltage and surges due to switching and [[lightning]].  Insulators are broadly classified as either pin-type,  which support the conductor above the structure, or suspension type, where the conductor hangs below the structure. The invention of the [[strain insulator]] was a critical factor in allowing higher voltages to be used.

At the end of the 19th century, the limited electrical strength of [[telegraph]]-style [[pin insulator]]s limited the voltage to no more than 69,000 [[volt]]s. Up to about 33 kV (69 kV in North America) both types are commonly used.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt; At higher voltages only suspension-type insulators are common for overhead conductors.

Insulators are usually made of wet-process [[porcelain]] or [[toughened glass]], with increasing use of glass-reinforced polymer insulators. However, with rising voltage levels, polymer insulators ([[silicone rubber]] based) are seeing increasing usage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngk-locke.com/polymer.html NGK-Locke] Polymer insulator manufacturer&lt;/ref&gt; China has already developed polymer insulators having a highest system voltage of 1100 kV and India is currently developing a 1200 kV (highest system voltage) line which will initially be charged with 400 kV to be upgraded to a 1200 kV line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.worldenergynews.com/news/abb-energizes-transformer-record-mln-volts-651995 |title=ABB Energizes Transformer At Record 1.2 Mln Volts|work=World Energy News|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension insulators are made of multiple units, with the number of unit insulator disks increasing at higher voltages.  The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand  requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer creepage distance for leakage current, are required in these cases. Strain insulators must be strong enough mechanically to support the full weight of the span of conductor, as well as loads due to ice accumulation, and wind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arp-hivoltageinsulators.com/suspension-insulators.html Advanced Rubber Products - Suspension Insulators]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porcelain insulators may have a semi-conductive glaze finish, so that a small current (a few milliamperes) passes through the insulator.  This warms the surface slightly and reduces the effect of fog and dirt accumulation.  The semiconducting glaze also ensures a more even distribution of voltage along the length of the chain of insulator units.

Polymer insulators by nature have hydrophobic characteristics providing for improved wet performance. Also, studies have shown that the specific creepage distance required in polymer insulators is much lower than that required in porcelain or glass. Additionally, the mass of polymer insulators (especially in higher voltages) is approximately 50% to 30% less than that of a comparative porcelain or glass string. Better pollution and wet performance is leading to the increased use of such insulators.

Insulators for very high voltages, exceeding 200 kV, may have [[grading ring]]s installed at their terminals.  This improves the electric field distribution around the insulator and makes it more resistant to flash-over during voltage surges.

==Conductors==
[[File:Sample cross-section of high tension power (pylon) line.jpg|thumb|Sample cross-section of ACSR power line]]

The most common conductor in use for transmission today is [[Aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable|aluminum conductor steel reinforced]] (ACSR). Also seeing much use is [[all-aluminum-alloy conductor]] (AAAC). Aluminum is used because it has about half the weight of a comparable resistance copper cable (though larger diameter due to lower [[specific conductivity]]), as well as being cheaper.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt; 
Copper was more popular in the past and is still in use, especially at lower voltages and for grounding.

While larger conductors may lose less energy due to lower [[electrical resistance]], they are more costly than smaller conductors.  An optimization rule called ''[[Lord Kelvin|Kelvin's Law]]'' states that the optimum size of conductor for a line is found when the cost of the energy wasted in the conductor is equal to the annual interest paid on that portion of the line construction cost due to the size of the conductors. The optimization problem is made more complex by additional factors such as varying annual load, varying cost of installation, and the discrete sizes of cable that are commonly made.&lt;ref name=Fink78/&gt;

Since a conductor is a flexible object with uniform weight per unit length, the geometric shape of a conductor strung on towers approximates that of a [[catenary]]. The sag of the conductor (vertical distance between the highest and lowest point of the curve) varies depending on the temperature and additional load such as ice cover. A minimum overhead clearance must be maintained for safety. Since the temperature of the conductor increases with increasing heat produced by the current through it, it is sometimes possible to increase the power handling capacity (uprate) by changing the conductors for a type with a lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] or a higher allowable [[operating temperature]].

[[File:ACSR and ACCC.JPG|thumb|Conventional ACSR (left) and modern carbon core (right) conductors]]

Two such conductors that offer reduced thermal sag are known as composite core conductors (ACCR and [[ACCC conductor]]).  In lieu of steel core strands that are often used to increase overall conductor strength, the ACCC conductor uses a carbon and glass fiber core that offers a coefficient of thermal expansion about 1/10 of that of steel.  While the composite core is nonconductive, it is substantially lighter and stronger than steel, which allows the incorporation of 28% more aluminum (using compact trapezoidal-shaped strands) without any diameter or weight penalty.  The added aluminum content helps reduce line losses by 25 to 40% compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight, depending upon electric current.  The carbon core conductor's reduced thermal sag allows it to carry up to twice the current ("ampacity") compared to all-aluminum conductor (AAC) or ACSR.

The power lines and their surroundings must be [[Live-line working|maintained]] by [[Lineman (technician)|linemen]], sometimes assisted by [[helicopter]]s with [[pressure washer]]s or [[circular saw]]s which may work three times faster. However this work often occurs in the dangerous areas of the [[Helicopter height–velocity diagram]],&lt;ref name=vert2015-04&gt;{{cite news |first=Elan |last=Head |url=http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/82.html |title=High-value cargo |pages=80–90 |work=Vertical Magazine |date=April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419023320/http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/82.html |archivedate=19 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vert2015-04b&gt;{{cite news |first=Guy R. |last=Maher |url=http://www.verticalmag.com/digital_issue/2015/v14i2/files/94.html |title=A cut above |pages=92–98 |work=Vertical Magazine |date=April 2015 |accessdate=11 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512160639/http://www.verticalmag.com/news/article/ACutAbove |archive-date=12 May 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harnesk, Tommy.

===Bundle conductors===
[[File:Pylône électrique détail 2011-2.JPG|thumb|A bundle conductor]]
For transmission of power across long distances, high voltage transmission is employed. Transmission higher than 132&amp;nbsp;kV poses the problem of [[corona discharge]], which causes significant power loss and interference with communication circuits. To reduce this corona effect, it is preferable to use more than one conductor per phase, or bundled conductors.&lt;ref name="Grainger, John J 1994"&gt;Grainger, John J. and W. D. Stevenson Jr. Power System Analysis and Design, 2nd edition. McGraw Hill (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bundle conductors consist of several parallel cables connected at intervals by spacers, often in a cylindrical configuration. The optimum number of conductors depends on the current rating, but typically higher-voltage lines also have higher current. [[American Electric Power]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://tdworld.com/overhead-transmission/six-wire-solution |title=Six Wire Solution] |journal=Transmission &amp; Distribution World |first=Bruce |last=Freimark |date=October 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is building 765&amp;nbsp;kV lines using six conductors per phase in a bundle. Spacers must resist the forces due to wind, and magnetic forces during a short-circuit.

[[File:Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Spacer damper for four-conductor bundles]]
[[File:Pylône_électrique_détail_2011-4.JPG|thumb|Bundle conductor attachment]]

Bundled conductors reduce the voltage gradient in the vicinity of the line. This reduces the possibility of corona discharge. At [[extra high voltage]], the electric field [[gradient]] at the surface of a single conductor is high enough to ionize air, which wastes power, generates unwanted audible noise and [[Electromagnetic interference|interferes]] with [[communication system]]s.  The field surrounding a bundle of conductors is similar to the field that would surround a single, very large conductor—this produces lower gradients which mitigates issues associated with high field strength. The transmission efficiency is improved as loss due to corona effect is countered.

Bundled conductors cool themselves more efficiently due to the increased surface area of the conductors, further reducing line losses. When transmitting alternating current, bundle conductors also avoid the reduction in [[ampacity]] of a single large conductor due to the [[skin effect]]. A bundle conductor also has lower [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]], compared to a single conductor.

While wind resistance is higher, wind-induced oscillation can be damped at bundle spacers. The ice and wind loading of bundled conductors will be greater than a single conductor of the same total cross section, and bundled conductors are more difficult to install than single conductors.

===Ground wires===
[[File:Al OC.jpg|thumb|Aluminum conductor crosslinked polyethylene insulation wire. It is used for 6600V power lines.]]
Overhead power lines are often equipped with a ground conductor (shield wire, static wire, or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) at the top of the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art and Science of Lightning Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KO7fVcqispQC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In circuits with [[earthed neutral]], it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use [[surge arrester]]s every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. Shield wires on transmission lines may include optical fibers ([[optical ground wire]]s/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.

[[File:Fenno-Skan HVDC power line.jpg|thumb|HVDC Fenno-Skan with ground wires used as electrode line]]
At some HVDC converter stations, the ground wire is used also as the electrode line to connect to a distant grounding electrode. This allows the HVDC system to use the earth as one conductor. The ground conductor is mounted on small insulators bridged by lightning arrestors above the phase conductors. The insulation prevents electrochemical corrosion of the pylon.

Medium-voltage distribution lines may also use one or two shield wires, or may have the grounded conductor strung below the phase conductors to provide some measure of protection against tall vehicles or equipment touching the energized line, as well as to provide a neutral line in Wye wired systems.

On some power lines for very high voltages in the former Soviet Union, the ground wire is used for PLC-radio systems and mounted on insulators at the pylons.

===Insulated conductors and cable===
Overhead insulated cables are rarely used, usually for short distances (less than a kilometer). Insulated cables can be directly fastened to structures without insulating supports.  An overhead line with bare conductors insulated by air is typically less costly than a cable with insulated conductors.

A more common approach is "covered" line wire. It is treated as bare cable, but often is safer for wildlife, as the insulation on the cables increases the likelihood of a large-wing-span raptor to survive a brush with the lines, and reduces the overall danger of the lines slightly. These types of lines are often seen in the eastern United States and in heavily wooded areas, where tree-line contact is likely. The only pitfall is cost, as insulated wire is often costlier than its bare counterpart. Many utility companies implement covered line wire as jumper material where the wires are often closer to each other on the pole, such as an underground riser/[[pothead]],&lt;!--not [[Cannabis smoking]]--&gt; and on reclosers, cutouts and the like.

==Compact transmission lines==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2012}}
A compact overhead transmission line requires a smaller right of way than a standard overhead powerline. Conductors must not get too close to each other. This can be achieved either by short span lengths and insulating crossbars, or by separating the conductors in the span with insulators. The first type is easier to build as it does not require insulators in the span, which may be difficult to install and to maintain.

Examples of compact lines are:
* [[Lutsk compact overhead powerline]] {{coord|50.774673|N|25.385215|E|type:landmark|name=Startpoint of Lutsk Compact Overhead Powerline}}
* [[Hilpertsau-Weisenbach compact overhead line]] {{coord|48.737898|N|8.355660|E|type:landmark|name=Startpoint of Hilpertsau-Weisenbach Powerline}}

Compact transmission lines may be designed for voltage upgrade of existing lines to increase the power that can be transmitted on an existing right of way.&lt;ref&gt;Beaty, H. Wayne; Fink, Donald G. , ''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers (15th Edition)''
McGraw-Hill, 2007  978-0-07-144146-9 pages 14-105 through 14-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low voltage==
[[File:ABC TQ3157 064.JPG|thumb|Aerial bundled cable in [[Old Coulsdon]], [[Surrey]]]]
Low voltage overhead lines may use either bare conductors carried on glass or ceramic insulators or an [[aerial bundled cable]] system. The number of conductors may be anywhere between two (most likely a phase and neutral) up to as many as six (three phase conductors, separate neutral and earth plus street lighting supplied by a common switch); a common case is four (three phase and neutral, where the neutral might also serve as a protective earthing conductor).

==Train power==
{{main|Overhead line}}

Overhead lines or overhead wires are used to transmit electrical energy to trams, trolleybuses or trains. Overhead line is designed on the principle of one or more overhead wires situated over rail tracks. Feeder stations at regular intervals along the overhead line supply power from the high-voltage grid. For some cases low-frequency AC is used, and distributed by a special [[traction current]] network.

==Further applications==
Overhead lines are also occasionally used to supply transmitting antennas, especially for efficient transmission of long, medium and short waves. For this purpose a staggered array line is often used. Along a staggered array line the conductor cables for the supply of the earth net of the transmitting antenna are attached on the exterior of a ring, while the conductor inside the ring, is fastened to insulators leading to the high-voltage standing feeder of the antenna.

==Use of area under overhead power lines==
Use of the area below an overhead line is limited because objects must not come too close to the energized conductors. Overhead lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard. Radio reception can be impaired under a power line, due both to shielding of a receiver antenna by the overhead conductors, and by partial discharge at insulators and sharp points of the conductors which creates radio noise.

In the area surrounding the overhead lines it is dangerous to risk interference; e.g. flying kites or  balloons, using ladders or operating machinery.

Overhead distribution and transmission lines near [[airfield]]s are often marked on maps, and the lines themselves marked with conspicuous plastic reflectors, to warn pilots of the presence of conductors.

Construction of overhead power lines, especially in wilderness areas, may have significant environmental effects. Environmental studies for such projects may consider the effect of bush clearing, changed migration routes for migratory animals, possible access by predators and humans along transmission corridors, disturbances of fish habitat at stream crossings, and other effects.

==Aviation accidents ==
[[File:High voltage transmission line aviation obstruction marker.jpg|thumb|An aviation obstruction marker on a high-voltage overhead transmission line reminds pilots of the presence of an overhead line. Some markers are lit at night or have strobe lights.]]
General aviation, hang gliding, paragliding, skydiving, balloon, and kite flying must avoid accidental contact with power lines. Nearly every kite product warns users to stay away from power lines. Deaths occur when aircraft crash into power lines. Some power lines are marked with obstruction makers, especially near air strips or over waterways that may support floatplane operations. The placement of power lines sometimes use up sites that would otherwise be used by hang gliders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retasite.wordpress.com/2014/09/10/aircraft-accidents-due-to-overhead-power-lines-updated/ Aircraft Accidents Due to Overhead Power Lines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Pacific+Gas+and+Electric+Company+Reminds+Customers+About+Flying+Kites...-a084267973 Pacific Gas and Electric Company Reminds Customers About Flying Kites Safely.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first transmission of electrical impulses over an extended distance was demonstrated on July 14, 1729 by the physicist [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The demonstration used damp hemp cords suspended by silk threads (the low resistance of metallic conductors not being appreciated at the time).

However the first practical use of overhead lines was in the context of [[electrical telegraph|telegraphy]]. By 1837 experimental commercial telegraph systems ran as far as  20&amp;nbsp;km (13 miles).   Electric power transmission was accomplished in 1882 with the first high-voltage transmission between [[Miesbach–Munich Power Transmission|Munich and Miesbach]] (60&amp;nbsp;km). 1891 saw the construction of the first three-phase [[alternating current]] overhead line on the occasion of the International Electricity Exhibition in [[Frankfurt]], between [[Lauffen]] and Frankfurt.

In 1912 the first 110 kV-overhead power line entered service followed by the first 220 kV-overhead power line in 1923. In the 1920s [[RWE]] AG built the first overhead line for this voltage and in 1926 built a [[Rhine]] crossing with the pylons of [[Voerde]], two masts 138 meters high.

&lt;!-- Milestones of years and voltages table here --&gt;
In 1953, the first 345 kV line was put into service by [[American Electric Power]] in the [[United States]]. In Germany in 1957 the first 380 kV overhead power line was commissioned (between the transformer station and Rommerskirchen). In the same year the overhead line traversing of the Strait of Messina went into service in Italy, whose [[Pylons of Messina|pylons]] served the Elbe crossing 1. This was used as the model for the building of the Elbe crossing 2 in the second half of the 1970s which saw the construction of the highest overhead line pylons of the world. Earlier, in 1952, the first 380 kV line was put into service in [[Sweden]], in 1000&amp;nbsp;km (625 miles) between the more populated areas in the south and the largest hydroelectric power stations in the north.
Starting from 1967 in Russia, and also in the USA and Canada, overhead lines for voltage of 765 kV were built. In 1982 overhead power lines were built in Soviet Union between [[Elektrostal]] and the power station at [[Ekibastuz]], this was a three-phase alternating current line at 1150 kV ([[Powerline Ekibastuz-Kokshetau]]). In 1999, in Japan the first powerline designed for 1000 kV with 2 circuits were built, the [[Kita-Iwaki Powerline]]. In 2003 the building of the highest overhead line commenced in China, the [[Yangtze River Crossing]].

==Mathematical analysis==
An overhead power line is one example of a [[transmission line]]. At power system frequencies, many useful simplifications can be made for lines of typical lengths. For analysis of power systems, the distributed resistance, series inductance, shunt leakage resistance and shunt capacitance can be replaced with suitable lumped values or simplified networks.

===Short and medium line model===
A short length of a power line (less than 80&amp;nbsp;km) can be approximated with a resistance in series with an inductance and ignoring the shunt admittances. This value is not the total impedance of the line, but rather the series impedance per unit length of line. For a longer length of line (80–250&amp;nbsp;km), a shunt capacitance is added to the model. In this case it is common to distribute half of the total capacitance to each side of the line. As a result, the power line can be represented as a [[two-port network]], such as with ABCD parameters.&lt;ref name=Glover21&gt;J. Glover, M. Sarma, and T. Overbye, ''Power System Analysis and Design, Fifth Edition'', Cengage Learning, Connecticut, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-111-42577-7}}, Chapter 5 ''Transmission Lines: Steady-State Operation''&lt;/ref&gt;

The circuit can be characterized as
:&lt;math&gt;Z = z l = (R + j \omega L)l &lt;/math&gt;
where
*''Z'' is the total series line [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]
*''z'' is the series impedance per unit length
*''l'' is the line length
*&lt;math&gt;\omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[sinusoidal]] [[angular frequency]]
The medium line has an additional shunt [[admittance]]
:&lt;math&gt;Y = y l = j \omega C l &lt;/math&gt;
where
*''Y'' is the total shunt line admittance
*''y'' is the shunt admittance per unit length

A '''photovoltaic system''', also '''PV system''' or '''solar power system''', is a [[power system]] designed to supply usable [[solar power]] by means of [[photovoltaics]]. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including [[solar panel]]s to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity, a [[solar inverter]] to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as [[photovoltaic mounting system|mounting]], [[solar cable|cabling]], and other electrical accessories to set up a working system. It may also use a [[solar tracking system]] to improve the system's overall performance and include an [[rechargeable battery|integrated battery solution]], as prices for storage devices are expected to decline. Strictly speaking, a '''solar array''' only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels, the visible part of the PV system, and does not include all the other hardware, often summarized as [[balance of system]] (BOS). Moreover, PV systems convert light directly into electricity and shouldn't be confused with other technologies, such as [[concentrated solar power]] or [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]], used for heating and cooling.

PV systems range from small, [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop-mounted]] or [[building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large [[photovoltaic power station|utility-scale power station]]s of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]], while off-grid or [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone systems]] only account for a small portion of the market.

Operating silently and without any moving parts or [[Air pollution|environmental emissions]], PV systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation. A rooftop system [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|recoups]] the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within 0.7 to 2 years and produces about 95 percent of net clean [[renewable energy]] over a 30-year service lifetime.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014 /&gt;{{rp|30}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy97/22572.pdf Service Lifetime Prediction for Encapsulated Photovoltaic Cells/Minimodules], A.W.

Due to the exponential [[growth of photovoltaics]], prices for PV systems have rapidly declined in recent years. However, they vary by market and the size of the system. In 2014, prices for residential 5-kilowatt [[Solar power in the United States|systems in the United States]] were around $3.29 per watt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |title=Photovoltaic System Pricing Trends – Historical, Recent, and Near-Term Projections, 2014 Edition |publisher=NREL |page=4 |date=22 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XOoaSCpl?url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the highly penetrated [[Solar power in Germany|German market]], prices for rooftop systems of up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW declined to €1.24 per watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=Photovoltaik-Preisindex |trans-title=Solar PV price index |publisher=PhotovoltaikGuide |quote=Turnkey net-prices for a solar PV system of up to 100 kilowatts amounted to Euro 1,240 per kWp. |access-date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, solar PV modules account for less than half of the system's overall cost,&lt;ref&gt;Fraunhofer ISE [http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien-en/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/study-levelized-cost-of-electricity-renewable-energies.pdf Levelized Cost of Electricity] Study, November 2013, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the rest to the remaining BOS-components and to soft costs, which include customer acquisition, permitting, inspection and interconnection, installation labor and financing costs.&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Overview ===
[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|Diagram of the possible components of a photovoltaic system]]

A [[photovoltaic]] system converts the sun's [[solar radiation|radiation]] into usable [[electricity]]. It comprises the solar array and the balance of system components. PV systems can be categorized by various aspects, such as, [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]] vs. [[Stand alone power system|stand alone]] systems, building-integrated vs. rack-mounted systems, residential vs. utility systems, [[Distributed generation|distributed]] vs. centralized systems, rooftop vs. ground-mounted systems, tracking vs. fixed-tilt systems, and new constructed vs. [[retrofitted]] systems. Other distinctions may include, systems with microinverters vs. central inverter, systems using [[crystalline silicon]] vs. [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film technology]], and systems with modules from Chinese vs. European and U.S.-manufacturers.

About 99 percent of all European and 90 percent of all U.S. solar power systems are connected to the [[electrical grid]], while off-grid systems are somewhat more common in Australia and South Korea.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2014-2018|url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/EPIA_Global_Market_Outlook_for_Photovoltaics_2014-2018_-_Medium_Res.pdf|website=www.epia.org|publisher=EPIA - European Photovoltaic Industry Association|accessdate=12 June 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QGSvAF7w?url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/EPIA_Global_Market_Outlook_for_Photovoltaics_2014-2018_-_Medium_Res.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} PV systems rarely use battery storage.

=== Grid-connection ===
{{Main|Grid-connected photovoltaic power system}}
[[File:PV-system-schematics-residential-Eng.png|thumb|240px|Schematics of a typical residential PV system]]

A grid connected system is connected to a larger independent grid (typically the public electricity grid) and feeds energy directly into the grid. This energy may be shared by a residential or commercial building before or after the revenue measurement point. The difference being whether the credited energy production is calculated independently of the customer's energy consumption ([[feed-in tariff]]) or only on the difference of energy ([[net metering]]). Grid connected systems vary in size from residential (2–10&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) to solar power stations (up to 10s of MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). This is a form of [[decentralized electricity generation]]. The feeding of electricity into the grid requires the transformation of DC into AC by a special, synchronising [[grid-tie inverter]]. In kilowatt-sized installations the DC side system voltage is as high as permitted (typically 1000V except US residential 600&amp;nbsp;V) to limit ohmic losses. Most modules (60 or 72 crystalline silicon cells) generate 160&amp;nbsp;W to 300&amp;nbsp;W at 36 volts. It is sometimes necessary or desirable to connect the modules partially in parallel rather than all in series. One set of modules connected in series is known as a 'string'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.homepower.com/view/?file=HP113_pg106_WordPower |title=Photovoltaic...

=== Scale of system ===

Photovoltaic systems are generally categorized into three distinct market segments: residential rooftop, commercial rooftop, and ground-mount utility-scale systems. Their capacities range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts. A typical residential system is around 10 kilowatts and mounted on a sloped roof, while commercial systems may reach a megawatt-scale and are generally installed on low-slope or even flat roofs. Although rooftop mounted systems are small and display a higher [[cost per watt]] than large utility-scale installations, they account for the largest share in the market. There is, however, a growing trend towards bigger utility-scale power plants, especially in the "sunbelt" region of the planet.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014 /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;ref&gt;NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53347.pdf Residential, Commercial, and Utility-Scale Photovoltaic (PV) System Prices in the United States], p.6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

; Utility-scale
{{main|Photovoltaic power station}}
[[File:Perovosolarstation.jpg|thumb|[[Perovo Solar Park]] in Ukraine]]

: Large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station|solar parks or farms]] are [[power station]]s and capable of providing an energy supply to large numbers of consumers. [[Electricity generation|Generated electricity]] is fed into the transmission grid powered by central generation plants (grid-connected or grid-tied plant), or combined with one, or many, domestic electricity generators to feed into a small [[electrical grid]] (hybrid plant). In rare cases generated electricity is stored or used directly by island/standalone plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/types_of_pv.htm Types of PV systems]. Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), a research institute of the University of Central Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahmani, R.; Fard, M.; Shojaei, A.A.; Othman, M.F.; Yusof, R., A complete model of stand-alone photovoltaic array in MATLAB-Simulink environment, 2011 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD), pp 46–51, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; PV systems are generally designed in order to ensure the highest energy yield for a given investment. Some large photovoltaic power stations such as [[Solar Star]], [[Waldpolenz Solar Park]] and [[Topaz Solar Farm]] cover tens or hundreds of hectares and have power outputs up to hundreds of [[megawatt]]s.

; Rooftop, mobile, and portable
{{main|Rooftop photovoltaic power station}}
[[File:Solar panels on house roof.jpg|thumb|[[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|Rooftop system]] near [[Boston]], USA.]]

: A small PV system is capable of providing enough AC electricity to power a single home, or even an isolated device in the form of AC or DC electric. For example, military and civilian Earth observation [[satellite]]s, [[street lights]], construction and traffic signs, [[electric car]]s, solar-powered tents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/article/49138/army-evaluating-transportable-solar-powered-tents/ Army evaluating transportable solar-powered tents | Article | The United States Army]. Army.mil (2010-12-08). Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electric aircraft]] may contain integrated photovoltaic systems to provide a primary or [[Emergency power system|auxiliary power]] source in the form of AC or DC power, depending on the design and power demands. In 2013, rooftop systems accounted for 60 percent of worldwide installations. However, there is a trend away from rooftop and towards utility-scale PV systems, as the focus of new PV installations is also shifting from Europe to countries in the sunbelt region of the planet where opposition to ground-mounted solar farms is less accentuated.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014 /&gt;{{rp|43}}

: Portable and mobile PV systems provide electrical power independent of utility connections, for "off the grid" operation. Such systems are so commonly used on [[recreational vehicle]]s and boats that there are retailers specializing in these applications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rvsolarelectric.com/ RV Solar Electric]&lt;/ref&gt; and products specifically targeted to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gpelectric.com/applications/rv-marine-power Go Power Electric RV and Marine Solar Power Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://samlexsolar.com/ Samlex Solar]&lt;/ref&gt; Since recreational vehicles (RV) normally carry batteries and operate lighting and other systems on nominally 12-volt DC power, RV PV systems normally operate in a voltage range chosen to charge 12-volt batteries directly, and addition of a PV system requires only panels, a charge controller, and wiring. Solar systems on recreation vehicles are usually constrained in wattage by the physical size of the RV's roof space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.outsidesupply.com/rv-solar-guide/|title=RV Solar Guide|website=www.outsidesupply.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why more efficiency from solar panels for these applications is important.

; Building-integrated
{{main|Building-integrated photovoltaics}}
[[File:Façana Fotvoltaica MNACTEC.JPG|thumb|[[Building-applied photovoltaics|BAPV]] wall near Barcelona, Spain]]

: In urban and suburban areas, photovoltaic arrays are commonly used on rooftops to supplement power use; often the building will have a connection to the [[power grid]], in which case the energy produced by the PV array can be sold back to the [[utility]] in some sort of [[net metering]] agreement. Some utilities, such as Solvay Electric in Solvay, NY, use the rooftops of commercial customers and telephone poles to support their use of PV panels.&lt;ref name="Solvay Electric Using Solar Panels on Telephone Poles"&gt;http://www.9wsyr.com/news/local/story/Solvay-Electric-using-solar-panels-on-utility/4fFgF35JP0yyCmRElazAQg.cspx&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar tree]]s are arrays that, as the name implies, mimic the look of trees, provide shade, and at night can function as [[street light]]s.

=== Performance ===

Uncertainties in revenue over time relate mostly to the evaluation of the solar resource and to the performance of the system itself. In the best of cases, uncertainties are typically 4% for year-to-year climate variability, 5% for solar resource estimation (in a horizontal plane), 3% for estimation of irradiation in the plane of the array, 3% for power rating of modules, 2% for losses due to dirt and soiling, 1.5% for losses due to snow, and 5% for other sources of error. Identifying and reacting to manageable losses is critical for revenue and O&amp;M efficiency. Monitoring of array performance may be part of contractual agreements between the array owner, the builder, and the utility purchasing the energy produced. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Recently, a method to create "synthetic days" using readily available weather data and verification using the [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] make it possible to predict photovoltaic systems performance with high degrees of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.04.016 |title=Improved parametric empirical determination of module short circuit current for modelling and optimization of solar photovoltaic systems |journal=Solar Energy |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=2240 |year=2012 |last1=Andrews |first1=Rob W |last2=Pollard |first2=Andrew |last3=Pearce |first3=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to then determine loss mechanisms on a local scale - such as those from snow&lt;ref name="open access"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snow2"/&gt; or the effects of surface coatings (e.g. [[hydrophobic]] or [[hydrophilic]]) on soiling or snow losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.01.032 |title=A new method to determine the effects of hydrodynamic surface coatings on the snow shedding effectiveness of solar photovoltaic modules |journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |volume=113 |pages=71 |year=2013 |last1=Andrews |first1=Rob W |last2=Pollard |first2=Andrew |last3=Pearce |first3=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although in heavy snow environments with severe ground interference can result in annual losses from snow of 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2466448 |title=Impact of Snow and Ground Interference on Photovoltaic Electric System Performance |journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=1680 |year=2015 |last1=Heidari |first1=Negin |last2=Gwamuri |first2=Jephias |last3=Townsend |first3=Tim |last4=Pearce |first4=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
Access to the Internet has allowed a further improvement in energy monitoring and communication. Dedicated systems are available from a number of vendors. For solar PV systems that use [[microinverters]] (panel-level DC to AC conversion), module power data is automatically provided. Some systems allow setting performance alerts that trigger phone/email/text warnings when limits are reached. These solutions provide data for the system owner and the installer. Installers are able to remotely monitor multiple installations, and see at-a-glance the status of their entire installed base.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

== Components ==
[[File:Balance of System.svg|thumb|The [[balance of system]] components of a PV system (BOS) balance the power-generating subsystem of the solar array (left side) with the power-using side of the AC-household devices and the utility grid (right side).]]

A photovoltaic system for residential, commercial, or industrial energy supply consists of the solar array and a number of components often summarized as the [[balance of system]] (BOS). This term is synonymous with "[[Balance of plant]]" q.v. BOS-components include power-conditioning equipment and structures for mounting, typically one or more DC to [[alternating current|AC]] power converters, also known as [[Power inverter|inverters]], an energy storage device, a racking system that supports the solar array, electrical wiring and interconnections, and mounting for other components.

Optionally, a balance of system may include any or all of the following: [[renewable energy credit]] revenue-grade meter, [[maximum power point tracker]] (MPPT), [[Rechargeable battery|battery]] system and [[battery charger|charger]], [[GPS]] [[solar tracker]], [[energy management software]], [[solar irradiance]] sensors, [[anemometer]], or task-specific accessories designed to meet specialized requirements for a system owner. In addition, a [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]] system requires [[optical lens]]es or mirrors and sometimes a cooling system.

The terms ''"solar array"'' and ''"PV system"'' are often incorrectly used interchangeably, despite the fact that the solar array does not encompass the entire system. Moreover, ''"solar panel"'' is often used as a synonym for ''"solar module"'', although a panel consists of a string of several modules. The term ''"[[solar system]]"'' is also an often used [[misnomer]] for a PV system.

=== Solar array ===
{{further|PV module}}

Conventional [[Crystalline silicon|c-Si]] [[solar cell]]s, normally wired in series, are encapsulated in a solar module to protect them from the weather. The module consists of a [[tempered glass]] as cover, a soft and flexible [[ethylene vinyl acetate|encapsulant]], a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant [[Polyvinyl fluoride|material]] and an aluminium frame around the outer edge. Electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure, solar modules build a string of modules, often called solar panel. A solar array consists of one or many such panels.&lt;ref&gt;PV Education.org [http://pveducation.org/pvcdrom/modules/module-materials Module Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; A photovoltaic array, or solar array, is a linked collection of solar modules. The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to form an array. Most PV arrays use an [[solar inverter|inverter]] to convert the DC power produced by the modules into [[alternating current]] that can power [[light]]s, motors, and other loads. The modules in a PV array are usually first connected in [[Series circuits|series]] to obtain the desired [[voltage]]; the individual strings are then connected in [[Parallel circuits|parallel]] to allow the system to produce more [[Electric current|current]]. Solar panels are typically measured under STC (standard test conditions) or PTC (PVUSA test conditions), in [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumplanet.com/solar-buyers-guide.html Key Factors in selecting solar components]&lt;/ref&gt; Typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/equipment/pv_modules.php List of Eligible SB1 Guidelines Compliant Photovoltaic Modules]&lt;/ref&gt; The array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings, in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.

; Module and efficiency

A typical "150 watt" [[PV module]] is about a square meter in size. Such a module may be expected to produce 0.75&amp;nbsp; [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) every day, on average, after taking into account the weather and the latitude, for an insolation of 5 sun hours/day. In the last 10 years, the efficiency of average commercial wafer-based [[crystalline silicon]] modules increased from about 12% to 16% and CdTe module efficiency increased from 9% to 13% during same period.

Due to the low voltage of an individual [[solar cell]] (typically ca. 0.5V), several cells are wired ''(also see [[Copper in renewable energy#Solar photovoltaic power generation|copper used in PV systems]])'' in series in the manufacture of a "laminate". The laminate is assembled into a protective weatherproof enclosure, thus making a photovoltaic module or [[solar panel]]. Modules may then be strung together into a photovoltaic array. In 2012, solar panels available for consumers can have an efficiency of up to about 17%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sroeco.com/solar/most-efficient-solar-panels|title=Solar Panel Comparison Table |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; while commercially available panels can go as far as 27%.

; Shading and dirt {{anchor|Shading and dirt}}

Photovoltaic cell electrical output is extremely sensitive to shading. The effects of this shading are well known.&lt;ref&gt;Kajihara, Atsushi, and A. T. Harakawa. "Model of photovoltaic cell circuits under partial shading." ''Industrial Technology, 2005. ICIT 2005. IEEE International Conference on.

''Photovoltaic systems engineering''. CRC press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When even a small portion of a cell, module, or array is shaded, while the remainder is in sunlight, the output falls dramatically due to internal 'short-circuiting' (the electrons reversing course through the shaded portion of the [[p-n junction]]). If the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell, the current (and so power) developed by the string is limited. If enough voltage is available from the rest of the cells in a string, current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the shaded portion. This breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts. Instead of adding to the power produced by the panel, the shaded cell absorbs power, turning it into heat. Since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell, one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string, disproportionately affecting panel output. For example, a shaded cell may drop 8 volts, instead of adding 0.5 volts, at a particular current level, thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells.&lt;ref name=UE03&gt;Ursula Eicker, ''Solar Technologies for Buildings'', Wiley 2003, {{ISBN|0-471-48637-X}}, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; It is, thus important that a PV installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions.

Several methods have been developed to determine shading losses from trees to PV systems over both large regions using [[LiDAR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.01.017 |title=Incorporating shading losses in solar photovoltaic potential assessment at the municipal scale |journal=Solar Energy |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=1245 |year=2012 |last1=Nguyen |first1=Ha T |last2=Pearce |first2=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also at an individual system level using [[sketchup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2013.06.019 |title=Simple and low-cost method of planning for tree growth and lifetime effects on solar photovoltaic systems performance |journal=Solar Energy |volume=95 |pages=300 |year=2013 |last1=Dereli |first1=Z |last2=Yücedağ |first2=C |last3=Pearce |first3=J.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most modules have bypass diodes between each cell or string of cells that minimize the effects of shading and only lose the power of the shaded portion of the array. The main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array, and cause fires. Sunlight can be absorbed by dust, snow, or other impurities at the surface of the module. This can reduce the light that strikes the cells. In general these losses aggregated over the year are small even for locations in Canada.&lt;ref name="open access"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/PVSC.2012.6318297 |chapter=Prediction of energy effects on photovoltaic systems due to snowfall events |title=2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference |pages=003386 |year=2012 |last1=Andrews |first1=Rob W |last2=Pearce |first2=Joshua M |isbn=978-1-4673-0066-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a clean module surface will increase output performance over the life of the module.

; Insolation and energy
[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-World-map-en.png|thumb|left|Global [[Insolation|solar potential]]]]

[[Solar insolation]] is made up of direct, diffuse, and reflected [[radiation]]. The absorption factor of a PV cell is defined as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santbergen|first=R|author2=R.J.C. van Zolingen|title=The absorption factor of crystalline silicon PV cells: A numerical and experimental study|journal=Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells|date=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high noon on a cloudless day at the equator, the power of the sun is about 1 [[kilowatt|kW]]/m²,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Sharkawi|first=Mohamed A.|title=Electric energy|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-3078-0|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Earth's surface, to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. As such, PV arrays can [[solar tracker|track the sun]] through each day to greatly enhance energy collection. However, tracking devices add cost, and require maintenance, so it is more common for PV arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face [[solar noon]] (approximately due south in the Northern Hemisphere or due north in the Southern Hemisphere). The tilt angle, from horizontal, can be varied for season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macslab.com/optsolar.html Optimum Tilt of Solar Panels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811104430/http://www.macslab.com/optsolar.html |date=2015-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but if fixed, should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system. This optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-RR-54-98-2.pdf Stand Alone Photovoltaic Lighting Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; The optimization of the photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux, soiling, and snow losses should be taken into effect. In addition, recent work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection. For example, the spectral [[albedo]] can play a significant role in output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | year = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 233–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the type of solar cell material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | last2 = Abramase | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Andrews | first3 = R.W. | last4 = Pearce | first4 = J.

A photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of Europe or the United States may expect to produce 1 kWh/m²/day. A typical 1&amp;nbsp;kW photovoltaic installation in Australia or the southern latitudes of Europe or United States, may produce 3.5–5&amp;nbsp;kWh per day, dependent on location, orientation, tilt, insolation and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/how-much-energy-will-my-solar-cells-produce/ |title=How much energy will my solar cells produce?|accessdate=2012-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Sahara]] desert, with less cloud cover and a better solar angle, one could ideally obtain closer to 8.3 kWh/m²/day provided the nearly ever present wind would not blow sand onto the units.

=== Mounting ===
{{Main|Photovoltaic mounting system}}
[[File:Pellworm Solarkrftanlage MS P4140082.JPG|thumb|A 23-year-old, ground mounted PV system from the 1980s on a [[North Frisian Islands|North Frisian Island]], Germany. The modules conversion efficiency was only 12%.]]

Modules are assembled into arrays on some kind of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For [[solar park]]s a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.
For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.

=== Cabling ===
{{main|Solar cable|Electrical wiring}}

Due to their outdoor usage, [[solar cable]]s are specifically designed to be resistant against [[UV]] radiation and extremely high temperature fluctuations and are generally unaffected by the weather. A number of standards specify the usage of [[electrical wiring]] in PV systems, such as the [[IEC 60364]] by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], in section 712 ''"Solar photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems"'', the British Standard [[BS 7671]], incorporating regulations relating to [[microgeneration]] and photovoltaic systems, and the US [[Solar cable#UL4703 standard|UL4703 standard]], in subject 4703 ''"Photovoltaic Wire"''.

=== Tracker ===

[[File:ZomeworksTrackerHead5816.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A 1998 model of a passive solar tracker, viewed from underneath.]]

A [[solar tracker|solar tracking system]] tilts a solar panel throughout the day. Depending on the type of tracking system, the panel is either aimed directly at the sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky. Trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance, increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about 20–25% for a single axis tracker and about 30% or more for a dual axis tracker, depending on latitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ A Performance Calculator].

Mecasolar.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
Trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly. In diffuse light (i.e. under cloud or fog), tracking has little or no value. Because most [[concentrated photovoltaics]] systems are very sensitive to the sunlight's angle, tracking systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Al-Mohamad | first1 = Ali | year = 2004 | title = Efficiency improvements of photo-voltaic panels using a Sun-tracking system | url = | journal = Applied Energy | volume = 79 | issue = 3| pages = 345–354 | doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2003.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking systems improve performance for two main reasons. First, when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight, it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled. Second, direct light is used more efficiently than angled light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2015/october/shining-more-light-solar-panels.html Shining More Light on Solar Panels]. mtu.edu. Retrieved on 2018-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Special [[Anti-reflective|Anti-reflective coatings]] can improve solar panel efficiency for direct and angled light, somewhat reducing the benefit of tracking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081106102753/http://www.scientificblogging.com/news_releases/reflective_coating_silicon_solar_cells_boosts_absorption_over_96_percent Reflective Coating Silicon Solar Cells Boosts Absorption Over 96 Percent].

Trackers and sensors to optimise the performance are often seen as optional, but tracking systems can increase viable output by up to 45%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solartown.com/learning/solar-panels/beginners-guide-to-solar-trackers-how-to-increase-output-for-your-home-solar-panel-system/ Beginners' Guide to Solar Trackers: How to Increase Output for Your Home Solar Panel System], 17 August 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Sqbm9QvL?url=http://www.solartown.com/learning/solar-panels/beginners-guide-to-solar-trackers-how-to-increase-output-for-your-home-solar-panel-system/ archived])&lt;/ref&gt; PV arrays that approach or exceed one megawatt often use solar trackers. Accounting for clouds, and the fact that most of the world is not on the equator, and that the sun sets in the evening, the correct measure of solar power is [[insolation]] – the average number of kilowatt-hours per square meter per day. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges from 2.26&amp;nbsp;kWh/m²/day in northern climes to 5.61&amp;nbsp;kWh/m²/day in the sunniest regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apricus.com/html/insolation_levels_europe.htm Insolation Levels (Europe)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porta-energy.com/Insolation_USA.htm 10 years Average Insolation Data]&lt;/ref&gt;

For large systems, the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity (trackers can increase efficiency by 30% or more). For [[Very large scale solar power plant|very large systems]], the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/04b38b804a178f13b377ffdd29332b51/SOLAR%2BGUIDE%2BBOOK.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Utility Scale Solar Power Plants]&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration [[Concentrated photovoltaics|photovoltaic system]]s. For high-concentration photovoltaic systems, dual axis tracking is a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helmholz.us/smallpowersystems/Intro.pdf Should You Install a Solar Tracker?]&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track. When solar panel prices drop, trackers become a less attractive option.

=== Inverter ===

[[File:Central inverter cutout.jpg|thumb|Central inverter with AC and DC disconnects (on the side), monitoring gateway, transformer isolation and interactive LCD.]]

[[File:Vermont Law School Solar Panel Array-4.JPG|thumb|left|String inverter (left), generation meter, and AC disconnect (right). A modern 2013 installation in [[Vermont]], United States.]]

Systems designed to deliver [[alternating current]] (AC), such as [[Photovoltaic system#Grid-connected applications|grid-connected applications]] need an inverter to convert the [[direct current]] (DC) from the solar modules to AC. Grid connected inverters must supply AC electricity in sinusoidal form, synchronized to the grid frequency, limit feed in voltage to no higher than the grid voltage and disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepower.com/article/?file=HP130_pg28_ATE_2 Grid-Tied Inverter Safety]. Homepower.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Islanding inverters need only produce regulated voltages and frequencies in a sinusoidal waveshape as no synchronisation or co-ordination with grid supplies is required.

A [[solar inverter]] may connect to a string of solar panels. In some installations a [[solar micro-inverter]] is connected at each solar panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/trend-watch-microinverters-invade-solar/9707 Trend watch: Microinverters invade solar]&lt;/ref&gt; For safety reasons a circuit breaker is provided both on the AC and DC side to enable maintenance. AC output may be connected through an [[electricity meter]] into the public grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515213135/http://www.schurter.com/content/download/244246/7047074/version/3/file/Solar_Technology_wp_us.pdf Services and Solutions for Photovoltaic Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[Modular design|module]]s in the system determines the total DC watts capable of being generated by the solar array; however, the inverter ultimately governs the amount of AC watts that can be distributed for consumption. For example, a PV system comprising 11 [[kilowatt]]s DC (kW&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;) worth of PV modules, paired with one 10-kilowatt AC (kW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;) inverter, will be limited to the inverter's output of 10&amp;nbsp;kW. As of 2014, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial PV systems, central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively, leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters.&lt;ref name="fraunhofer-report-september-2014" /&gt;

[[Maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic array. In order to do so, the inverter's MPPT system digitally samples the solar array's ever changing power output and applies the proper resistance to find the optimal ''maximum power point''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solar-electric.com [http://www.solar-electric.com/mppt-solar-charge-controllers.html All About Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-islanding]] is a protection mechanism that immediately shuts down the inverter preventing it from generating AC power when the connection to the load no longer exists. This happens, for example, in the case of a blackout. Without this protection, the supply line would become an "island" with power surrounded by a "sea" of unpowered lines, as the solar array continues to deliver DC power during the power outage. Islanding is a hazard to utility workers, who may not realize that an AC circuit is still powered, and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices.&lt;ref&gt;EDN.com [http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4391907/Product-How-To--Solar-power-anti-islanding-and-control Solar power anti-islanding and control], 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battery ===
{{main|Rechargeable battery|Battery (electricity)}}
Although still expensive, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|Batteries used for grid-storage]] also stabilize the [[electrical grid]] by [[Grid energy storage#Load leveling|leveling out peak loads]], and play an important role in a [[smart grid]], as they can charge during periods of low demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is high.

Common battery technologies used in today's PV systems include the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]]– a modified version of the conventional [[lead–acid battery]], [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries. Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low self discharge as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, as storage devices for PV systems are stationary, the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as, for example, in [[Electric vehicle|electric transportation]]&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard /&gt;{{rp|4,9}} Other rechargeable batteries that are considered for distributed PV systems include [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium–sulfur]] and [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium redox]] batteries, two prominent types of a [[Molten salt battery|molten salt]] and a [[Flow battery|flow]] battery, respectively.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard /&gt;{{rp|4}} In 2015, Tesla motors launched the [[Powerwall (Tesla)|Powerwall]], a rechargeable lithium-ion battery with the aim to revolutionize energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-launches-powerwall-home-battery-with-aim-to-revolutionize-energy-consumption-1.3056587 |title=Tesla launches Powerwall home battery with aim to revolutionize energy consumption |date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PV systems with an integrated battery solution also need a [[charge controller]], as the varying voltage and current from the solar array requires constant adjustment to prevent damage from overcharging.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Fink, www.homepower.com [http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/equipment-products/2012-charge-controller-buyers-guide Charge Controller Buyer's Guide], January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Basic charge controllers may simply turn the PV panels on and off, or may meter out pulses of energy as needed, a strategy called PWM or [[pulse-width modulation]]. More advanced charge controllers will incorporate [[Maximum power point tracking|MPPT]] logic into their battery charging algorithms. Charge controllers may also divert energy to some purpose other than battery charging. Rather than simply shut off the free PV energy when not needed, a user may choose to heat air or water once the battery is full.

=== Monitoring and metering ===

{{main|Net metering|Energy metering|Smart meter}}
The metering must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions or two meters must be used. Many meters accumulate bidirectionally, some systems use two meters, but a unidirectional meter (with detent) will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarelectricpower.org/media/84144/sepa%20pv%20metering.pdf Residential Photovoltaic Metering and Interconnection Study]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, for installations over 30 [[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Watt-peak|kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]] a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required. This is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility, and the excess can not either be exported or [[Grid energy storage|stored]]. Grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity. Now they need to also provide storage. This is normally hydro-storage, but other means of storage are used. Initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output. With [[variable renewable energy]], storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available, and consumption whenever it is needed. [[File:Stromzähler in Kanada.JPG|thumb|left|A Canadian electricity meter]]
The two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for ''when'' it is needed, or transmitting it to ''where'' it is needed. If both of those fail, installations over 30kWp can automatically shut down, although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate. Grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems, although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power, and results in a substantial loss of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53732.pdf Integrating Variable Renewable Energy in Electric Power Markets]&lt;/ref&gt; Three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/smart-pv-inverter-benefits-for-utilities Smart PV Inverter Benefits for Utilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize their operation. There are several [[Photovoltaic system performance|photovoltaic monitoring]] strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature. Monitoring can be performed on site or remotely. It can measure production only, retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment (probes, meters, etc.). Monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions. Individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software.&lt;ref&gt;[https://enphase.com/en-us/products-and-services/enlighten-and-apps Enphase Solar Monitoring]&lt;/ref&gt; Energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes. A third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters, using the inverter manufacturer's protocols, and also acquire weather-related information. Independent [[smart meter]]s may measure the total energy production of a PV array system. Separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter (a [[pyranometer]]) can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://buildingsfieldtest.nrel.gov/solar_irradiance_measurements Solar Irradiance Measurements]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Data collected from a monitoring system can be [[List of monitored photovoltaic power stations|displayed remotely]] over the World Wide Web, such as [[OSOTF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua.

== Other systems ==

This section includes systems that are either highly specialized and uncommon or still an emerging new technology with limited significance. However, [[Stand-alone power system|standalone]] or off-grid systems take a special place. They were the most common type of systems during the 1980s and 1990s, when PV technology was still very expensive and a pure niche market of small scale applications. Only in places where no electrical grid was available, they were economically viable. Although new stand-alone systems are still being deployed all around the world, their contribution to the overall installed photovoltaic capacity is decreasing. In Europe, off-grid systems account for 1 percent of installed capacity. In the United States, they account for about 10 percent. Off-grid systems are still common in Australia and South Korea, and in many developing countries.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014 /&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== CPV ===
{{main|Concentrator photovoltaics}}
[[File:Concentració Fotovoltaica.jpg|thumb|right|[[Concentrator photovoltaic]] (CPV) in [[Catalonia]], Spain]]

Concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) and ''high concentrator photovoltaic'' (HCPV) systems use [[optical lens]]es or curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small but highly efficient solar cells. Besides concentrating optics, CPV systems sometime use solar trackers and cooling systems and are more expensive.

Especially HCPV systems are best suited in location with high solar irradiance, concentrating sunlight up to 400 times or more, with efficiencies of 24–28 percent, exceeding those of regular systems. Various designs of CPV and HCPV systems are commercially available but not very common. However, ongoing research and development is taking place.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

CPV is often confused with CSP ([[concentrated solar power]]) that does not use photovoltaics. Both technologies favor locations that receive much sunlight and are directly competing with each other.

=== Hybrid ===

[[File:Hybrid Power System.gif|thumb|A [[Solar hybrid power systems|wind-solar PV hybrid system]]]]

A hybrid system combines PV with other forms of generation, usually a diesel generator. Biogas is also used. The other form of generation may be a type able to modulate power output as a function of demand. However more than one renewable form of energy may be used e.g. wind. The photovoltaic power generation serves to reduce the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands. [[Pellworm]] island in Germany and [[Kythnos]] island in Greece are notable examples (both are combined with wind).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php PV resources website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128022703/http://pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php |date=2010-11-28 }}, Hybrid power station accessed 10 Feb 08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pellworm.de/energieversorgung.0.html |title=Daten und Fakten |accessdate=2008-02-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719072419/http://www.pellworm.de/energieversorgung.0.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}.

In 2015, a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids. However, financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant. While cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant, the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities, such as [[independent power producer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |title=New study: Hybridising electricity grids with solar PV saves costs, especially benefits state-owned utilities |publisher=SolarServer.com |date=31 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726213948/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |archivedate=26 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/renewable-energy-hybrid-mini-grids-and-isolated-grids-economic-benefits-and-business#overlay-context=publications |title=Renewable Energy in Hybrid Mini-Grids and Isolated Grids: Economic Benefits and Business Cases |publisher=Frankfurt School – UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate &amp; Sustainable Energy Finance |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been recent work showing that the PV penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of PV+CHP hybrid systems in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M. Pearce|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2009.08.012|title= Expanding Photovoltaic Penetration with Residential Distributed Generation from Hybrid Solar Photovoltaic + Combined Heat and Power Systems|journal=Energy|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1947–1954 |year=2009|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1974/5307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal distribution of solar flux, electrical and heating requirements for representative U.S. single family residences were analyzed and the results clearly show that hybridizing CHP with PV can enable additional PV deployment above what is possible with a conventional centralized electric generation system. This theory was reconfirmed with numerical simulations using per second solar flux data to determine that the necessary battery backup to provide for such a hybrid system is possible with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems.&lt;ref&gt;P.

=== Floating solar arrays ===
[[Floating solar]] arrays are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs, quarry lakes, irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds. These systems are called "floatovoltaics" when used only for electrical production or "aquavoltaics" when such systems are used to synergistically enhance [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.191 |title=Aquavoltaics: Synergies for dual use of water area for solar photovoltaic electricity generation and aquaculture |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=80 |pages=572 |year=2017 |last1=Pringle |first1=Adam M |last2=Handler |first2=R.M |last3=Pearce |first3=J.M }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of such systems exist in France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SolarServer.com |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |title=Kyocera, partners announce construction of the world's largest floating solar PV Plant in Hyogo prefecture, Japan |date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=EnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/11/running-out-of-precious-land-floating-solar-pv-systems-may-be-a-solution |title=Running Out of Precious Land?

The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land. The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Goodemay, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/science/solar-power-floating-on-water.html?_r=0 New Solar Plants Generate Floating Green Power], ''New York Times'', 20 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477&amp;nbsp;kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Winery-goes-solar-with-Floatovoltaics-3282171.php |title=Winery goes solar with Floatovoltaics |publisher=SFGate |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary benefit of such a system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose. In the case of the Far Niente Winery, it saved three-quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land-based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf |title=Napa Valley's Far Niente Winery Introduces first-ever Floatovoltaic solar array |publisher=Far Niente |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316135710/http://farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land, leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion. The floating PV array also reduces the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibits the growth of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2011/08/15/napa-winery-pioneers-solar-floatovoltaics/ |title=Napa Winery Pioneers Solar Floatovoltaics |publisher=Forbes |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct current grid ===
DC grids are found in electric powered transport: railways trams and trolleybuses. A few pilot plants for such applications have been built, such as the tram depots in Hannover Leinhausen, using photovoltaic contributors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/products/download/rep7_07.pdf |title=Innovative Electrical Concepts |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231142/http://www.iea-pvps.org/products/download/rep7_07.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2009 |df= }}.

A [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone]] or off-grid system is not connected to the [[electrical grid]]. Standalone systems vary widely in size and application from [[Solar-powered watch|wristwatches]] or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|calculators]] to remote buildings or [[Solar panels on spacecraft|spacecraft]]. If the load is to be supplied independently of solar [[insolation]], the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery. In non-portable applications where weight is not an issue, such as in buildings, [[lead acid battery|lead acid batteries]] are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse.

A charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging. It may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique ([[Maximum power point tracking|MPPT]]). However, in simple PV systems where the PV module voltage is matched to the battery voltage, the use of MPPT electronics is generally considered unnecessary, since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the PV module.
In small devices (e.g. calculators, parking meters) only [[direct current]] (DC) is consumed. In larger systems (e.g. buildings, remote water pumps) AC is usually required. To convert the DC from the modules or batteries into AC, an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is used.

In [[agriculture|agricultural]] settings, the array may be used to directly power DC [[pump]]s, without the need for an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]]. In remote settings such as mountainous areas, islands, or other places where a power grid is unavailable, solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity, usually by charging a [[storage battery]]. Stand-alone systems closely relate to [[microgeneration]] and [[distributed generation]].

*'''Pico PV systems'''

:The smallest, often portable photovoltaic systems are called pico solar PV systems, or pico solar. They mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller, with a very small PV panel. The panel's nominal capacity is just a few watt-peak (1–10 W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and its area less than a tenth of a square meter, or one square foot, in size. A large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players, fans, portable lamps, security lights, solar lighting kits, solar lanterns and street light ''(see below)'', phone chargers, radios, or even small, seven-inch LCD televisions, that run on less than ten watts. As it is the case for power generation from [[pico hydro]], pico PV systems are useful in small, rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity. Since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably, in particular due to the usage of [[LED lights]] and efficient rechargeable batteries, pico solar has become an affordable alternative, especially in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/technical/rep9_12_PVPS_Pico_Solar_PV_Systems_apr13.pdf |title=Pico Solar PV Systems for Remote Homes – A new generation of small PV systems for lighting and communication |publisher=IEA-PVPS |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric prefix ''[[pico-]]'' stands for a ''trillionth'' to indicate the smallness of the system's electric power.

* '''Solar street lights'''

:[[Solar street light]]s raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid PV system charges a [[rechargeable battery]], which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night. Solar street lights are stand-alone power systems, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly.

* '''Telecommunication and signaling'''

:Solar PV power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, microwave and other forms of electronic communication links. This is because, in most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, [[Low-power broadcasting|low power transmitters]] are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.&lt;ref&gt;B.H Khan, 'Non-Conventional Energy Resources', TMH Publications 01-01-2006&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Solar vehicles'''

:[[Solar vehicle]], whether ground, water, air or space vehicles may obtain some or all of the energy required for their operation from the sun. Surface vehicles generally require higher power levels than can be sustained by a practically sized solar array, so a battery assists in meeting peak power demand, and the solar array recharges it. Space vehicles have successfully used solar photovoltaic systems for years of operation, eliminating the weight of fuel or primary batteries.

* '''Solar pumps'''

:One of the most cost effective solar applications is a solar powered pump, as it is far cheaper to purchase a solar panel than it is to run power lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/RAJ-JPR-pay-bill-for-4-months-get-power-for-25-years-3491363.html 'Pay bill for 4 months, get power for 25 years']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pumping Water with Sunshine|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/equipment-products/pumping-water-sunshine|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Well Pumps|url=https://www.sunrotor.com/|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often meet a need for water beyond the reach of power lines, taking the place of a [[windmill]] or [[windpump]]. One common application is the filling of livestock watering tanks, so that grazing cattle may drink. Another is the refilling of drinking water storage tanks on remote or self-sufficient homes.

* '''Spacecraft'''

:[[Solar panels on spacecraft]] have been one of the first applications of photovoltaics since the launch of [[Vanguard 1]] in 1958, the first satellite to use solar cells. Contrary to [[Sputnik]], the first artificial satellite to orbit the planet, that ran out of batteries within 21 days due to the lack of solar-power, most modern [[communications satellite]]s and [[space probe]]s in the [[inner solar system]] rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power |title=Space-Based Solar Power |website=energy.gov |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploringgreentechnology.com/solar-energy/history-of-solar-energy/ |title=History of Solar Energy |website=http://exploringgreentechnology.com/ |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Do it yourself community'''

:With a growing interest in environmentally friendly green energy, an increasing number of hobbyists in the [[Do it yourself|DIY]]-community have endeavored to build their own solar PV systems from kits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenplanet4energy.com People building their own solar systems from kits].

As a result, the DIY-systems often end up cheaper than their commercial counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/gov/Alternative_Energy_223194_7.pdf | title=Alternative Energy Development: Michigan will be Nation’s Leader in Alternative Energy Technology, Jobs | publisher=State of Michigan, Office Of The Governor | accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the system is also hooked up into the regular [[power grid]], using [[net metering]] instead of a battery for backup. These systems usually generate power amount of ~2&amp;nbsp;kW or less. Through the internet, the community is now able to obtain plans to (partly) construct the system and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements.

The cost of producing photovotaic cells have dropped due to economies of scale in production and technological advances in manufacturing. For large-scale installations, prices below $1.00 per watt were common by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-end-the-nuclear-renaissance-6325?page=1 |title=The End of the Nuclear Renaissance &amp;#124; |author=[[John Quiggin]] |date=January 3, 2012 |work=National Interest }}&lt;/ref&gt; A price decrease of 50% had been achieved in Europe from 2006 to 2011 and there is a potential to lower the generation cost by 50% by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar photovoltaics: Competing in the energy sector|url=http://decarboni.se/publications/solar-photovoltaics-competing-energy-sector/executive-summary|publisher=European Photovoltaic Industry Association (EPIA)|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2014-04-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103194525/http://decarboni.se/publications/solar-photovoltaics-competing-energy-sector/executive-summary|archivedate=2014-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal silicon [[solar cell]]s have largely been replaced by less expensive multicrystalline silicon solar cells, and thin film silicon solar cells have also been developed recently at lower costs of production. Although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline "siwafers", they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quantumsp.com/en/solar-energy/a-comparison-of-pv-technologies/ A Comparison of PV Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709163216/http://quantumsp.com/en/solar-energy/a-comparison-of-pv-technologies/ |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below shows the total cost in US cents per kWh of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{I\cdot (1+i)+\sum_{t=0}^T \frac{I \cdot b}{(1+i)^t}}{\sum_{t=0}^T\frac{E\cdot (1-v)^t}{(1+i)^t}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solar-estimate.org/showfaq.php?id=261 What is Levelized Cost?]&lt;/ref&gt; The row headings on the left show the total cost, per peak kilowatt (kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), of a photovoltaic installation. Photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in Germany, for example, were reported to have fallen to USD 1389/kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; by the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="pvgde:priceindex"&gt;[http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex PV price index Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; The column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kWh expected from each installed kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. This varies by geographic region because the average [[insolation]] depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight. It also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon. 
Panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude, and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar [[declination]]. [[Solar tracking]] can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight, thereby raising the total energy output.

The calculated values in the table reflect the total cost in cents per kWh produced. They assume a 10% total capital cost (for instance 4% [[interest rate]], 1% operating and maintenance cost,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/46025.pdf PV operation and maintenance costs]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2012-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Straight-line depreciation|depreciation]] of the capital outlay over 20 years). Normally, photovoltaic modules have a 25-year warranty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solarconsumerreporting.webs.com/warranties.htm Solar PV warranties]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cleanenergyexperts.com/2011/02/01/understanding-solar-panel-warranties/ Understanding Solar Panel Warrantees]&lt;/ref&gt;

* LCOE : levelized cost of electricity (in USD/kWh)
* Capacity : cumulative installed capacity of photovoltaic systems (in MW)

== Regulation ==

=== Standardization ===

Increasing use of photovoltaic systems and integration of photovoltaic power into existing structures and techniques of supply and distribution increases the value of general standards and definitions for photovoltaic components and systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The standards are compiled at the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and apply to efficiency, durability and safety of cells, modules, simulation programs, plug connectors and cables, mounting systems, overall efficiency of inverters etc.&lt;ref&gt;Regan Arndt and Dr. Ing Robert Puto. Basic Understanding of IEC Standard Testing For Photovoltaic Panels. Available: http://tuvamerica.com/services/photovoltaics/ArticleBasicUnderstandingPV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning and permit ===

While article 690 of the National Electric Code provides general guidelines for the installation of photovoltaic systems, these guidelines may be superseded by local laws and regulations. Often a permit is required necessitating plan submissions and structural calculations before work may begin. Additionally, many locales require the work to be performed under the guidance of a licensed electrician. Check with the local City/County AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) to ensure compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.

In the [[United States]], the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]] (AHJ) will review designs and issue permits, before construction can lawfully begin. Electrical installation practices must comply with standards set forth within the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) and be inspected by the AHJ to ensure compliance with [[building code]], [[electrical code]], and [[fire safety]] code. Jurisdictions may require that equipment has been tested, certified, listed, and labeled by at least one of the [[Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories]] (NRTL). Despite the complicated installation process, a recent list of solar contractors shows a majority of installation companies were founded since 2000.&lt;ref name="Solar Power World"&gt;[http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/top-250-solar-contractors/ Solar Power World]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National regulations ===

;United Kingdom

In the UK, PV installations are generally considered permitted development and don't require planning permission. If the property is listed or in a designated area (National Park, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Site of Special Scientific Interest or Norfolk Broads) then planning permission is required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/commonprojects/solarpanels/ Solar Panels]. Planning Portal. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States

In the US, many localities require a permit to install a photovoltaic system. A grid-tied system normally requires a licensed electrician to make the connection between the system and the grid-connected wiring of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bootsontheroof.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32:requirements-for-solar-installation-a-incentives-by-state&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=65 |title=Requirements for Solar Installations |work=bootsontheroof.com |year=2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installers who meet these qualifications are located in almost every state.&lt;ref name="Solar Power World"/&gt; The State of California prohibits [[homeowners' association]]s from restricting solar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=CA45R&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1|title=California Solar Rights Act|accessdate=February 25, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019231500/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=CA45R&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1|archivedate=October 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Spain

Although [[Renewable energy in Spain|Spain generates around 40%]] of its electricity via photovoltaic and other renewable energy sources, and cities such as Huelva and Seville boast nearly 3,000 hours of sunshine per year, Spain has issued a solar tax to account for the debt created by the investment done by the Spanish government. Those who do not connect to the grid can face up to a fine of 30 million euros ($40 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hunt |first=Tam |title=Spain and Portugal Lead the Way on Renewable Energy Transformation |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/02/spain-and-portugal-lead-the-way-on-renewable-energy-transformation|publisher=Renewable Energy World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips Erb|first=Kelly|title=Out Of Ideas And In Debt, Spain Sets Sights On Taxing The Sun|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2013/08/19/out-of-ideas-and-in-debt-spain-sets-sights-on-taxing-the-sun/ |accessdate=20 November 2014 |newspaper=Forbes |date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations==

*;Pollution and Energy in PV Production 
PV has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. PV systems are often made of PV modules and inverter (changing DC to AC). PV modules are mainly made of PV cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips. The process of producing PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals. There are few PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations.

*; Impact on Electricity Network
With the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, there have been more than 30% of households with rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 duck curve appears very often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows from these PV households back to the network.&lt;ref&gt;W. Miller, A. L. Liu, Z. Amin, and A. Wagner, "Power quality and rooftop-PV households: an examination of measured data at point of customer connection," Sustainability,  http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/4/1224 (Open Access), p. 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.

*; Implication onto Electricity Bill Management and Energy Investment
There is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;L. Liu, W. Miller, and G. Ledwich. (2017) Solutions for reducing facilities electricity costs. Australian Ageing Agenda. 39-40.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3250">A '''Plagioclimax community''' is an area or [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] in which the influences of the [[humans]] have prevented the ecosystem from developing further. The ecosystem may have been stopped from reaching its full climatic climax or deflected towards a different climax by activities such as:

* Cutting down the existing [[vegetation]]
* [[Slash and burn|Burning]] as a means of [[deforestation|forest clearance]]
* [[Planting]] [[trees]] or [[crops]]
* [[Grazing]] and trampling by domesticated [[animal]]s
* [[Harvesting]] of planted crops

These are known as [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]s, or arresting factors.

In each case, human activity has led to a community which is not the [[climax community]] expected in such an area. If the human activity continues, the community will be held in a stable position and further succession will not occur until the human activity ceases.

==Examples==
An example may be in a beach [[dune]] system where the impact of the human race has caused footpath [[erosion]] to occur, affecting the [[vegetation]] so that feet trampling on the dune plants eventually destroys them.

The uplands of Northern [[England]] were once covered by [[deciduous]] woodland. Some [[Calluna|heather]] would have been present, but in relatively small amounts. Gradually the [[forests]] were removed during the early [[Middle Ages]] for [[timber]] and [[fuel]] purposes, and to create space for [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities. The [[soil]] deteriorated as a result and heather came to dominate the [[plant community]]. [[Sheep]] [[grazing]] was the major form of agriculture in the area at the time and the sheep prevented the re-growth of woodland by destroying any young [[sapling]]s.

In more recent times the process of controlled [[burning]] of the heather has taken place. The heather is burnt after 15 years of its life cycle before it becomes mature and allows [[Ecological succession|colonisation]] of the area by other [[plants]]. The ash adds to the soil fertility and the new growth that results increase the productivity of the ecosystem and provides the sheep with a more nutritious diet than is provided by the elder heather. This controlled burning maintains a plant community which is not the climatic climax of the area, and is therefore a plagioclimax.

In [[Studland]] Heath in Dorset, England, the management agency prevents the climax community (in this case trees) becoming established. At Studland the aim is to keep the area as heathland, so that the small reptiles that inhabit the dune system continue to survive. If the area is allowed to develop naturally into woodland, the reptiles would be replaced by other species of animals.

Another good example of a plagioclimax community is [[Braunton Burrows]], [[England]].

'''Pre-consumer recycling''' is the reclamation of waste materials that were created during the process of manufacturing or delivering goods prior to their delivery to a consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/pre-consumer-materials.html |title=pre-consumer materials |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=businessdictionary.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-consumer [[recycled]] materials can be broken down and remade into similar or different materials, or can be sold "as is" to third-party buyers who then use those materials for consumer products. One of the largest contributing industries to pre-consumer recycling is the [[textile industry]], which recycles fibers, fabrics, trims and unsold "new" garments to third-party buyers.

There are generally two types of recycling: [[post-consumer]] and pre-consumer. Post-consumer recycling is the most heavily practiced form of recycling,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} where the materials being recycled have already passed through to the consumer.

According to the Council for Textile Recycling, each year 750,000 tons of textile waste is recycled (pre- and post-consumer) into new raw materials for the automotive, furniture, mattress, coarse yarn, home furnishings, paper and other industries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textilerecycle.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although this amount accounts for 75% of textile waste in the United States, there is little research on textile excess produced in countries that play a larger role in global textile production, such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, India and Bangladesh.

'''Prometheus Gas S.A.''' is a [[Greece|Greek]] – [[Russia]]n joint company, established in 1991 in [[Athens]]. The Russian [[natural gas]] export company [[Gazprom Export]], on behalf of [[Gazprom]], holds the 50% of the shares. Mr. Dimitrios Ch. Copelouzos, Chairman &amp; Managing Director of [[Copelouzos Group]], holds the 50% of shares.

Among the basic sectors of the business activity of the Copelouzos Group and of Prometheus Gas are the importation and marketing of Russian natural gas in the Greek Market, the participation in the development of the necessary infrastructure with active involvement in the construction of natural gas transmission pipelines, compressor stations and city [[natural gas]] distribution networks. Within the interests of the company also fall the promotion and the implementation of business plans, aiming at creating new major [[natural gas]] consumers such as the modern [[natural gas]] fired [[combined cycle]] [[power stations]].

Prometheus Gas has secured for at least 50 years, through Gazprom, large quantities of gas in excess of those contracted to be imported into Greece by the state utility [[DEPA]]. These quantities amount to 3 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually until 2016 and 7 bcm annually beyond this period.

[[File:REN21 logo.jpg|thumb|REN21 logo]]
'''REN21''' ('''Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century''') is a global [[renewable energy]] policy multi-stakeholder network that connects a wide range of key actors. 
REN21’s goal is to facilitate knowledge exchange, policy development and joint action towards a rapid global transition to renewable energy. REN21 brings together governments, non-governmental organisations, research and academic institutions, international organisations and industry to learn from one another and build on successes that advance renewable energy. To assist policy decision-making, REN21 provides high-quality information, catalyses discussion and debate, and supports the development of thematic networks. REN21 facilitates the collection of comprehensive and timely information on renewable energy. This information reflects diverse viewpoints from both private and public sector actors, serving to dispel myths about renewable energy and to catalyse policy change. It does this through six product lines: Renewables Global Status Report ([http://www.ren21.net/gsr-2017/ GSR]): [http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/regional-status-reports/ Regional Reports]; [http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/ren21-interactive-map/ Renewables Interactive Map]; Global Futures Reports ([http://www.ren21.net/future-of-renewables/global-futures-report/ GFR]); [http://www.ren21.net/renewables-academy/ Renewables Academy]; International Renewable Energy Conference ([[International_Renewable_Energy_Conference|IREC]]). 
 
The REN21 Secretariat is based at UN Environment in Paris, France, and is a registered non-profit association under German law (e.V.). The organisation has more than 60 members and with its governance structure consists of the Bureau, the Steering Committee and REN21 Members. 

== History ==
REN21 was launched in June 2004 as an outcome of the International Conference for Renewable Energies in [[Bonn]], Germany. [[Paul Hugo Suding]], was the first Executive Secretary upon REN21’s formation in 2006.  He was succeeded by [[Virginia Sonntag O'Brien]] (2008-2011). [[Christine Lins]] was Executive Secretary 2011-2018.  The current Executive Secretary is Rana Adib. 

== Publications ==
=== GSR ===
The [http://www.ren21.net/gsr-2017/ Renewables Global Status Report] (GSR) is the flagship product of REN21 and is released on a yearly basis, giving a status report of the deployment of renewable technologies globally. The GSR has been produced since 2005 and includes the three sectors power, heating &amp; cooling and transport, reporting on policy development, energy industry, investment and market. The report is based on data and information produced by the REN21 member network of more than 800 experts and researchers from around the world. The GSR is openly peer-reviewed by the expert and research community, which contributes to the high transparency of the report. Today, the GSR is the most frequently referenced report on the renewable energy market, industry and policy trends. 
The full report is available on a [http://www.ren21.net/gsr-2017/ microsite] along with its colourful infographics. References are easily accessible – users can place their mouse over a reference and see all the sources used and access them directly via individual hyperlinks. The [http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/global-status-report/renewables-2017-global-status-report-infographics/ infographics] are incorporated throughout the text and the simple navigation structure allows the reader to jump easily from chapter to chapter. The new Google translate function allows the user to translate the full content into the reader’s native language.

The GSR report is complemented by a [http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/GSR2017_Highlights_FINAL.pdf Highlights Report] that presents the overarching trends and developments.  It outlines what is happening to drive the energy transition and details why it is not happening fast enough or as fast as possible.  This document draws extensively on the meticulously documented data found in the GSR. It is available in multiple languages 

=== Regional Reports ===
The [http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/regional-status-reports/ Regional Status Report] focus on the progress of renewable energy deployment in specific regions. The report process encourages and supports regional data collection processes as well as informed decision making. Regional status reports have been produced since 2009 and include: China (2009); India (2010); Middle East and Northern Africa ([[MENA]], 2009); Economic Community of West African States ([[ECOWAS]], 2014); Southern African Development Community ([[Southern_African_Development_Community|SADC]], 2015); United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ([[UNECE]], 2015); East African Community ([[East_African_Community|EAC]], 2016) and [[UNECE]] (2017). 

=== Thematic Reports ===
In its [http://www.ren21.net/spotlight/ Thematic Report] series , REN21 looks at a certain topic in-depth.  Past reports include a publication on mini-grid policies, a ten year overview of renewable energy developments, as well as tendering and community power in Latin America and the Caribbean.   
 
=== Renewable Interactive Map ===
The [http://www.ren21.net/status-of-renewables/ren21-interactive-map/ Renewable Interactive Map] is a research tool for tracking the development of renewable energy worldwide. The interactive map complements the perspectives and findings of the Renewable Global Status Report and Regional Status Report series. The data includes statistics like renewable share of final energy demand, carbon pricing policy tracking and annual average renewable growth rate, on a global level, and can be extracted as a datapack. 

=== Global Futures Report (GFR) ===
In the [http://www.ren21.net/future-of-renewables/global-futures-report/ Global Futures Report] (GFR) series energy experts from around the world share their views and perspectives on the feasibility and challenges of achieving a world fed by renewable energy. The 2013 report provides a range of thinking about the future of renewables. The 2017 report documents global views about the feasibility of achieving a 100% renewable energy future by mid-century. The GFR does not include any forecasts; rather it aims to spur debate about opportunities and challenges of a 100% renewable future. 
 
== REN21’s Renewable Academy ==
REN21’s first [http://www.ren21.net/renewables-academy/ Renewables Academy] was held 10-12 November, 2014, in Bonn, Germany. It was held exclusively for REN21’s community, offering a venue for brainstorming on future-oriented policy solutions. The Academy offers a rich environment, stimulating active contribution and new ideas on issues central to a renewable energy transition as well as identifying its key policy drivers. A summary of what was discussed on the Academy of 2014 in Bonn can be found here. Plans are underway for an Academy in the latter half of 2018.

== International Renewable Energy Conferences (IRECs) ==
Initiated at the renewables 2004 conference in Bonn, [[International_Renewable_Energy_Conference|IREC]]s a high-level political conference series exclusively dedicated to renewable energy sector. The conference is held on a biennial basis, hosted by a national government and convened by REN21. 
 
These multi-stakeholder events act as a common platform for government, private sector and civil society leaders to jointly address the goal of advancing renewable energy and have provided the impulse for several momentous initiatives over the past decade.
 
IRECs have been held in the following countries: Beijing, China (BIREC, 2005); Washington, the U.S (WIREC, 2008); Delhi, India (DIREC, 2010); Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (ADIREC, 2013); South Africa (SAIREC, 2015); Mexico City, Mexico (MEXIREC, 2017). The next IREC will be hosted by the Republic of Korea, to be held 23-26 October 2019, in Seoul. 

== Collaborations with other institutions ==

[[File:Rockfall.jpg|thumb|300px|Rockfalls from steep hillsides frequently disrupt road traffic in the mountainous regions of [[British Columbia]], Canada.]]

A '''rockfall''' or '''rock-fall'''&lt;ref name="Whittow"&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to quantities of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] falling freely from a [[cliff]] face. The term is also used for collapse of rock from roof or walls of mine or quarry workings. A rockfall is a fragment of rock (a block) detached by sliding, toppling, or falling, that falls along a vertical or sub-vertical cliff, proceeds down slope by  bouncing and flying along ballistic trajectories or by rolling on talus or debris slopes,” (Varnes, 1978). Alternatively, a "rockfall is the natural downward motion of a detached block or series of blocks with a small volume involving free falling, bouncing, rolling, and sliding". The mode of failure differs from that of a [[rockslide]].&lt;ref name="Whittow" /&gt;

==Causal mechanisms==
Favourable geology and [[climate]] are the principal causal mechanisms of rockfall, factors that include intact condition of the rock mass, discontinuities within the rockmass, [[weathering]] susceptibility, ground and surface water, [[Frost weathering|freeze-thaw]], root-wedging, and external stresses. A tree may be blown by the wind, and this causes a pressure at the root level and this loosens rocks and can trigger a fall. The pieces of rock collect at the bottom creating a ''talus'' or ''[[scree]]''. Rocks falling from the cliff may dislodge other rocks and serve to create another [[mass wasting]] process, for example an [[avalanche]].

A cliff that has favorable geology to a rockfall may be said to be incompetent. One that is not favorable to a rockfall, which is better consolidated, may be said to be competent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PyocAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Eisbacher+%26+Clague,+1984,+p.48&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J2KXCPiyC-&amp;sig=RvynhQTY_WzoWr3kKrHDd-4c9TU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1CYKUbaCFYXItAb084CwDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Eisbacher%20%26%20Clague%2C%201984%2C%20p.48&amp;f=false google.at], U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper, Issue 1606 Debris Flows from Failures of Neoglacial-Age Moraine Dams in the Three Sisters and Mount Jefferson Wilderness Areas, Oregon Eisbacher &amp;amp; Clague, 1984, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
[[File:Sion Panvel Highway Rock Netting.jpg|250 px|thumbnail|Steel nets installed for rockfall protection on [[Sion Panvel Highway]] in [[India]].]]
Typically, rockfall events are mitigated in one of two ways: either by passive mitigation or active mitigation. Passive mitigation is where only the effects of the rockfall event are mitigated and are generally employed in the deposition or run-out zones, such as through the use of drape nets, rockfall catchment fences, diversion dams, etc. The rockfall still takes place but an attempt is made to control the outcome. In contrast, active mitigation is carried out in the initiation zone and prevents the rockfall event from ever occurring. Some examples of these measures are [[rock bolt]]ing, slope retention systems, [[shotcrete]], etc. Other active measures might be by changing the geographic or climatic characteristics in the initiation zone, e.g. altering slope geometry, [[Dewatering|dewatering the slope]], revegetation, etc.

Design guides of passive measures have been proposed by Ritchie (1963),&lt;ref name="Ritchie"&gt;Ritchie, A.M. (1963). ''Evaluation of rockfall and its control''. Highway Research Record, No. 17, pp. 13-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Pierson et al. (2001),&lt;ref name="Pierson et al."&gt;Pierson, L.A., Gullixson C.F., Chassie R.G. (2001) Rockfall Area Design Guide. Final Report SPR-3(032), Oregon Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration, FHWA-OR-RD-02-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Pantelidis (2010)&lt;ref name="Pantelidis"&gt;Pantelidis, L. (2010).

(2016)&lt;ref name="Bar et al."&gt;Bar, N., Nicoll, S., Pothitos, F.

==Effects on trees==

The effect of rockfalls on trees can be seen in several ways. The tree roots may rotate, via the rotational energy of the rockfall. The tree may move via the application of translational energy. And lastly deformation may occur, either elastic or plastic. [[Dendrochronology]] can reveal a past impact, with missing [[tree rings]], as the tree rings grow around and close over a gap; the callus tissue can be seen microscopically. A macroscopic section can be used for dating of [[avalanche]] and rockfall events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2143">'''Runaway breakdown''' is a theory of [[lightning]] initiation proposed by [[Alex Gurevich]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;A. V. Gurevich, G. M. Milikh, and R. A. Roussel-Dupre (1992) "Runaway electron mechanism of air breakdown and preconditioning during a thunderstorm," ''Physics Letters A'', '''165''' :  463–468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander V.

[[Electron]]s in air have a [[mean free path]] of ~1&amp;nbsp;cm.  Fast electrons which move at a large fraction of the [[speed of light]] have a mean free path up to 100 times longer.  Given the long free paths, an [[electric field]] can accelerate these electrons to energies far higher than that of initially static electrons.  If they strike air molecules, more [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] electrons will be released, creating an avalanche multiplication of "runaway" electrons.  This process,  [[relativistic runaway electron avalanche]], has been hypothesized to lead to [[electrical breakdown]] in thunderstorms, but only when a source of high-energy electrons from a [[cosmic ray]] is present to start the "runaway" process.

The resulting conductive [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] trail, many tens of meters long, is suggested to supply the "seed" which triggers a lightning flash.

A '''spray''' is a dynamic collection of drops dispersed in a [[gas]].&lt;ref&gt;ASTM standard E-1620 Standard Terminology Relating to Liquid Particles and Atomization&lt;/ref&gt; The process of forming a spray is known as atomization. A [[spray nozzle]] is the device used to generate a spray. The two main uses of sprays are to distribute material over a cross-section and to generate liquid surface area. There are thousands of applications in which sprays allow material to be used most efficiently. The [[spray characteristics]] required must be understood in order to select the most appropriate technology, optimal device and size.&lt;ref&gt;Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-578-10090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spray formation==

Spray atomization can be formed by several methods. The most common method is through a [[spray nozzle]] which typically has a fluid passage that is acted upon by different mechanical forces that atomize the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-578-10090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first atomization nozzle was invented by Thomas A. DeVilbiss of Toledo, Ohio in the late 1800s  His invention was bulb atomizer that used pressure to impinge upon a liquid, breaking the liquid into a fine mist. Spray formation has taken on several forms, the most common being, pressure sprayers, centrifugal, electrostatic and [[ultrasonic nozzle]].

==Fuel sprays==
Sprays of hydrocarbon liquids (fossil fuels) are among the most economically significant applications of sprays. Examples include fuel injectors for gasoline and [[diesel engines]], atomizers for [[jet engines]] (gas turbines),&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, A.H. Gas Turbine Combustion, 1999, {{ISBN|1-56032-673-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; atomizers for injecting heavy fuel oil into combustion air in steam boiler injectors, and rocket engine injectors. Drop size is critical because the large surface area of a finely atomized spray enhances fuel evaporation rate. Dispersion of the fuel into the combustion air is critical to maximize the efficiency of these systems and minimize emissions of pollutants ([[soot]], [[NOx]], CO).&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, Rolf D, Modeling atomization processes in high-pressure vaporizing sprays, Atomization and Spray Technology (ISSN 0266-3481), vol. 3, no. 4, 1987, p. 309-337.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial sprays==

Spray application of herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides is essential to distribute these materials over the intended target surface.&lt;ref&gt;Lipp, Charles W. , Practical Spray Technology: Fundamentals and Practice , 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-578-10090-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-emergent herbicides are sprayed onto soil, but many materials are applied to the plant leaf surface. Agricultural sprays include the spraying of cropland, forest, turf grass, and orchards. The sprayer may be a hand nozzle, on a ground vehicle, or on an aircraft. Herbicides, [[insecticides]] and [[pesticides]] are spray applied to soil or plant foliage to distribute and disperse these materials. See [[aerial application]], [[pesticide application]], [[sprayer]].
The control of spray characteristics is critical to provide the coverage of foliage and to minimize off target drifting of the spray to adjacent areas. (pesticide drift). Spray drift is managed by applying only in appropriate wind conditions and humidity, and by controlling drop size and drop size distribution. Minimizing the height of the spray boom above the crop reduces drift. The spray nozzle type and size and the operating pressure provide the correct application rate of the material and control the amount of driftable fines.
Spays, single fluid nozzles, are also used to cool animals

===Consumer products===
Atomizers are used with pump-operated sprays of household cleaning products. The function of these nozzles is to distribute the product over an area. see [[Aerosol spray]] and [[spray can]]

[[File:Thorium sample 0.1g.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A sample of [[thorium]]]]
'''Thorium-based nuclear power''' generation is fueled primarily by the [[nuclear fission]] of the [[isotope]] [[uranium-233]] produced from the [[fertile material|fertile]] element [[thorium]].  According to proponents, a [[thorium fuel cycle]] offers several potential advantages over a [[uranium fuel cycle]]—including much [[Thorium#Occurrence|greater abundance]] of thorium on Earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. However, development of thorium power has significant start-up costs. Proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium, while critics say that development of [[breeder reactor]]s in general (including thorium reactors, which are breeders by nature) increases proliferation concerns.  Since about 2008, nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply [[nuclear fuel]] in place of [[uranium]] to generate [[nuclear power]]. This renewed interest has been highlighted in a number of scientific conferences, the latest of which, ThEC13&lt;ref&gt;[http://indico.cern.ch/event/222140/  The international Thorium Energy Committee, iThEC organises the international Thorium Energy Conference ThEC13, at CERN, in Geneva Switzerland, from October 27 to 31, 2013.], ThEC13 website&lt;/ref&gt; was held at [[CERN]] by [[International Thorium Energy Committee|iThEC]] and attracted over 200 scientists from 32 countries.

A nuclear reactor consumes certain specific [[nuclear fission|fissile]] [[isotopes]] to produce energy. The three most practical types of nuclear reactor fuel are:
* [[Uranium-235]], purified (i.e. "[[Enriched uranium|enriched]]") by reducing the amount of [[uranium-238]] in natural mined uranium.  Most nuclear power has been generated using low-enriched uranium (LEU), whereas high-enriched uranium (HEU) is necessary for weapons.  
* [[Plutonium-239]], [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] from [[uranium-238]] obtained from natural mined uranium. 
* [[Uranium-233]], transmuted from [[thorium-232]], derived from natural mined thorium, which is the subject of this article.

Some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner, safer nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energyfromthorium.com/thorium/ |title=The Energy From Thorium Foundation Thorium  |publisher=Energyfromthorium.com |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 opinion piece by a group of scientists at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], considering its overall potential, thorium-based power "can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative environmental impact."&lt;ref name=EST&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es2021318 | volume=45 | title=Should We Consider Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors for Power Generation? | year=2011 | journal=Environmental Science | pages=6237–6238 | last1 = Cooper | first1 = Nicolas| bibcode=2011EnST...45.6237C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying the feasibility of using thorium, nuclear scientists Ralph W. Moir and [[Edward Teller]] suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built.&lt;ref name=Teller&gt;Moir, Ralph W. and Teller, Edward.

==Background and brief history==
[[File:Thorium reactor ORNL.jpg|thumb|Early thorium-based ([[Molten salt reactor|MSR]]) nuclear reactor at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the 1960s]]
After World War II, uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity. These were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons.  During that period, the government of the United States also built [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|an experimental molten salt reactor]] using U-233 fuel, the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons. The MSRE reactor, built at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], operated [[critical mass|critical]] for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969. In 1968, Nobel laureate and discoverer of [[plutonium]], [[Glenn Seaborg]], publicly announced to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], of which he was chairman, that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested.

In 1973, however, the US government settled on uranium technology and largely discontinued thorium-related nuclear research. The reasons were that uranium-fueled reactors were more efficient, the research was proven, and thorium's breeding ratio was thought insufficient to produce enough fuel to support development of a commercial nuclear industry.  As Moir and Teller later wrote, "The competition came down to a liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) on the uranium-plutonium cycle and a thermal reactor on the thorium-233U cycle, the molten salt breeder reactor. The LMFBR had a larger breeding rate ... and won the competition."  In their opinion, the decision to stop development of thorium reactors, at least as a backup option, “was an excusable mistake.”&lt;ref name=Teller/&gt;

Science writer Richard Martin states that nuclear physicist [[Alvin Weinberg]], who was director at Oak Ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor, lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/ Weinberg Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231203905/http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/ |date=2015-12-31 }}, Main website, London, UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pentland, William.

Possibly"] ''Forbes'', Sept. 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg himself recalls this period:

{{quote|[Congressman] [[Chet Holifield]] was clearly exasperated with me, and he finally blurted out, "Alvin, if you are concerned about the safety of reactors, then I think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy." I was speechless. But it was apparent to me that my style, my attitude, and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the AEC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LeM-Dyuk6g "LFTR in 10 Minutes], video presentation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Martin explains that Weinberg's unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire:
{{quote|Weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor, one that would have zero risk of meltdown. . . . his team built a working reactor . . . . and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nation’s atomic power effort. He failed. Uranium reactors had already been established, and [[Hyman Rickover]], de facto head of the US nuclear program, wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs. Increasingly shunted aside, Weinberg was finally forced out in 1973.&lt;ref name=Martin-Wired&gt;Martin, Richard.

Despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power, many of today’s nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it. According to ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'', "most people—including scientists—have hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it...," noting a comment by a conference attendee that "it's possible to have a Ph.D. in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/science/87/8746sci2.html "Reintroducing Thorium"], Nov. 16, 2009{{Dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]], for one, first learned of it in 2012:
{{quote|It came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since World War II, but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications.&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite news|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=LFTR: A Long-Term Energy Solution?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/victor-stenger/lftr-a-longterm-energy-so_b_1192584.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=Jan 9, 2012|authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Others, including former [[NASA]] scientist and thorium expert [[Kirk Sorensen]], agree that "thorium was the alternative path that was not taken … "&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZR0UKxNPh8#at=219 "Energy From Thorium"], talk at Google Tech Talks,  July 23, 2009, video, 1 hr. 22 min.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Martin, Richard. ''Superfuel: Thorium, the Green Energy Source for the Future.'' Palgrave – Macmillan (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} According to Sorensen, during a documentary interview, he states that if the US had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have "probably achieved energy independence by around 2000."&lt;ref name=Motherboard&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ9Ll5EX1jc "The Thorium Dream"], Motherboard TV video documentary, 28 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The thorium fuel cycle offers enormous energy security benefits in the long-term – due to its potential for being a self-sustaining fuel without the need for fast neutron reactors. It is therefore an important and potentially viable technology that seems able to contribute to building credible, long-term nuclear energy scenarios.&lt;ref name="WNA" /&gt;}}

Moir and Teller agree, noting that the possible advantages of thorium include "utilization of an abundant fuel, inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use, together with good economics and safety features … "&lt;ref name="Teller" /&gt;
Thorium is considered the "most abundant, most readily available, cleanest, and safest energy source on Earth," adds science writer Richard Martin.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

*Thorium is three times as abundant as uranium and nearly as abundant as lead and gallium in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;Goswami, D. Yogi, ed. ''The CRC Handbook of Mechanical Engineering, Second Edition'', CRC Press (2012) p. 7-45&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thorium Energy Alliance]] estimates "there is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years."&lt;ref name="WNA"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf62.html#References Thorium], World Nuclear Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRC" /&gt; "America has buried tons as a by-product of rare earth metals mining," notes Evans-Pritchard.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-3-20-11" /&gt; Almost all thorium is [[Fertile material|fertile]] Th-232, compared to uranium that is composed of 99.3% fertile U-238 and 0.7% more valuable fissile U-235.
*It is difficult to make a practical nuclear bomb from a thorium reactor's byproducts. According to [[Alvin Radkowsky]],  designer of the world's first full-scale atomic electric power plant, "a thorium reactor's plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor, and the plutonium's isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation."&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/05/world/alvin-radkowsky-86-developer-of-a-safer-nuclear-reactor-fuel.html "Alvin Radkowsky, 86, Developer Of a Safer Nuclear Reactor Fuel"], obituary, ''New York Times'', March 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Several uranium-233 bombs have been tested, but the presence of [[uranium-232]] tended to "poison" the uranium-233 in two ways: [[Gamma ray|intense radiation]] from the uranium-232 made the material difficult to handle, and the uranium-232 led to possible pre-detonation. Separating the uranium-232 from the uranium-233 proved very difficult, although newer [[laser]] techniques could facilitate that process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Weapons of Mass Destruction: Radiological, Chemical, and Biological |last=Langford |first=R.

*There is much less nuclear waste—up to two orders of magnitude less, state Moir and Teller,&lt;ref name="Teller" /&gt; eliminating the need for large-scale or long-term storage;&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;{{rp|13}} "Chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium."&lt;ref name="Telegraph-3-20-11" /&gt; The radioactivity of the resulting waste also drops down to safe levels after just a one or a few hundred years, compared to tens of thousands of years needed for current nuclear waste to cool off.&lt;ref name="energyfromthorium.com"&gt;[http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/AmSci_LFTR.pdf American Science LFTR] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208020100/http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/AmSci_LFTR.pdf |date=2013-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to Moir and Teller, "once started up [it] needs no other fuel except thorium because it makes most or all of its own fuel."&lt;ref name="Teller" /&gt; This only applies to breeding reactors, that produce at least as much fissile material as they consume. Other reactors require additional fissile material, such as uranium-235 or plutonium.&lt;ref name="WNA" /&gt;
*Thorium fuel cycle is a potential way to produce long term nuclear energy with low radio-toxicity waste. In addition, the transition to thorium could be done through the incineration of weapons grade plutonium (WPu) or civilian plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/TE_1450_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Since all natural thorium can be used as fuel no expensive fuel enrichment is needed.&lt;ref name="energyfromthorium.com"/&gt; However the same is true for U-238 as fertile fuel in the uranium-plutonium cycle.
*Comparing the amount of thorium needed with coal, Nobel laureate [[Carlo Rubbia]] of [[CERN]], (European Organization for Nuclear Research), estimates that one ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium, or 3,500,000 tons of coal.&lt;ref name="Pritchard" /&gt;
*Liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof. A plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit, draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Juhasz |first1=Albert J. |last2=Rarick |first2=Richard A. |last3=Rangarajan |first3=Rajmohan |title=High Efficiency Nuclear Power Plants Using Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor Technology |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090038711.pdf |website=NASA |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mining thorium is safer and more efficient than mining uranium. Thorium's ore monazite generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore. This makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source. Thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining, as the mine is an open pit which requires no ventilation, unlike underground uranium mines, where [[radon]] levels can be potentially harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=International Atomic Energy Agency |title=Thorium fuel cycle — Potential benefits and challenges |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/TE_1450_web.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing some of the potential benefits, Martin offers his general opinion: "Thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concern—weapons proliferation, radioactive pollution, toxic waste, and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;{{rp|13}} From an economics viewpoint, UK business editor [[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard]]  has suggested that "Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium," suggesting a "new [[Manhattan Project]]," and adding, "If it works, Manhattan II could restore American optimism and strategic leadership at a stroke …"&lt;ref name="Pritchard"&gt;Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/7970619/Obama-could-kill-fossil-fuels-overnight-with-a-nuclear-dash-for-thorium.html "Obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium"], ''The Telegraph'', UK August 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Moir and Teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be "well under $1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of $100 million per year," and as a result a "large-scale nuclear power plan" usable by many countries could be set up within a decade.&lt;ref name="Teller" /&gt;

A report by the [[Bellona Foundation]] in 2013 concluded that the economics are quite speculative. Thorium nuclear reactors are unlikely to produce cheaper energy, but the management of spent fuel is likely to be cheaper than for uranium nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name=bellona-2013&gt;{{cite report |url=http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/4/Certain-issues-of-economic-prospects-of-thorium-based-nuclear-energy-systems.pdf |title=Certain issues of economic prospects of thorium-based nuclear energy systems |first=Leonid |last=Andreev |publisher=Bellona Foundation |year=2013 |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible disadvantages==
Some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power:&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nelson, Andrew T. |title=Thorium: Not a near-term commercial nuclear fuel |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=Sep–Oct 2012 |volume=68 |issue=5 |pages=33–44 |doi=10.1177/0096340212459125 |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/68/5/33.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Breeding in a thermal neutron spectrum is slow and requires extensive [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]]. The feasibility of reprocessing is still open.&lt;ref name="Mathieu2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pnucene.2006.07.005 |arxiv=nucl-ex/0506004v1 |journal=Progress in Nuclear Energy |title=The thorium molten salt reactor: Moving on from the MSBR |first1=L. |last1=Mathieu |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=664–679 |url=http://hal.in2p3.fr/docs/00/03/09/52/PDF/TMSR.pdf|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Significant and expensive testing, analysis and licensing work is first required, requiring business and government support.&lt;ref name="WNA" /&gt; In a 2012 report on the use of thorium fuel with existing water-cooled reactors, the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] suggested that it would "require too great an investment and provide no clear payoff", and that "from the utilities’ point of view, the only legitimate driver capable of motivating pursuit of thorium is economics".&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt;
* There is a higher cost of fuel fabrication and reprocessing than in plants using traditional solid fuel rods.&lt;ref name="WNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bellona-2013/&gt;
* Thorium, when being irradiated for use in reactors, will make uranium-232, which is very dangerous due to the gamma rays it emits. This irradiation process may be altered slightly by removing protactinium-233. The irradiation would then make uranium-233 in lieu of uranium-232, which can be used in nuclear weapons to make thorium into a dual purpose fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/nuclear/is-the-superfuel-thorium-riskier-than-we-thought-14821644|title="Superfuel" Thorium a Proliferation Risk?|date=5 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Uribe |first1=Eva C. |title=Thorium power has a protactinium problem |url=https://thebulletin.org/2018/08/thorium-power-has-a-protactinium-problem/ |publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current "smog crisis," they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10. "In the past, the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage. Now they are more interested because of smog," said Professor Li Zhong, a scientist working on the project. "This is definitely a race," he added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1452011/chinese-scientists-urged-develop-new-thorium-nuclear-reactors-2024 "Chinese scientists urged to develop new thorium nuclear reactors by 2024"], ''South China Morning Post'', March 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012, it was reported that China, using components produced by the West and Russia, planned to build two prototype thorium [[molten salt reactor|MSR]]s by 2015, and had budgeted the project at $400 million and requiring 400 workers."&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; China also finalized an agreement with a Canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved [[CANDU]] reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1016061/candu-signs-expanded-agreement-with-china-to-further-develop-recycled-uranium-and-thorium-fuelled-candu-reactors "Candu Signs Expanded Agreement with China to Further Develop Recycled Uranium and Thorium Fuelled CANDU Reactors"], ''Canada Newswire, Aug. 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany, 1980s===
The German [[THTR-300]] was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched U-235 as fissile fuel. Though named thorium high temperature reactor, mostly U-235 was fissioned. The THTR-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a [[pebble-bed reactor]] core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix. 
It fed power to Germany's grid for 432 days in the late 1980s, before it was shut down for cost, mechanical and other reasons.

===India===
India has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world, with comparatively poor quantities of uranium. India has projected meeting as much as 30% of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katusa|first1=Marin|title=The Thing About Thorium: Why The Better Nuclear Fuel May Not Get A Chance|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/energysource/2012/02/16/the-thing-about-thorium-why-the-better-nuclear-fuel-may-not-get-a-chance/2/|accessdate=17 November 2014|work=Forbes|date=16 February 2012|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC), in Mumbai, India, presented their latest design for a "next-generation nuclear reactor" that will burn thorium as its fuel ore, calling it the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AWHR). They estimated the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days.&lt;ref name=Indiatoday&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/worlds-first-thorium-based-nuclear-reactor-barc/1/343569.html "Design of World's first Thorium based nuclear reactor is ready"], ''India Today'', Feb. 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Validation of its core reactor physics was underway by late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

According to Dr R K Sinha, chairman of their Atomic Energy Commission, "This will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, mostly imported, and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change." Because of its inherent safety, they expect that similar designs could be set up "within" populated cities, like Mumbai or Delhi.&lt;ref name=Indiatoday/&gt;

India's government is also developing up to 62, mostly thorium reactors, which it expects to be operational by 2025. It is the "only country in the world with a detailed, funded, government-approved plan" to focus on thorium-based nuclear power. The country currently gets under 2% of its electricity from nuclear power, with the rest coming from coal (60%), hydroelectricity (16%), other renewable sources (12%) and natural gas (9%).&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy policy of India#Power Generation capacity in India]]&lt;/ref&gt; It expects to produce around 25% of its electricity from nuclear power.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; In 2009 the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission said that India has a "long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/business/global/20renthorium.html?pagewanted=1&amp;sq=Thorium%20reactor&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1 "Considering an Alternative Fuel for Nuclear Energy"], ''New York Times,'' Oct. 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Nl5DiTPw3dk|"India's experimental Thorium Fuel Cycle Nuclear Reactor [NDTV Report]}} 2010, 7 minutes&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorium is mostly found with the [[Rare earth element|rare earth]] phosphate mineral, [[monazite]], which contains up to about 12% thorium phosphate, but 6-7% on average. World monazite resources are estimated to be about 12 million tons, two-thirds of which are in heavy mineral sands deposits on the south and east coasts of India. There are substantial deposits in several other countries ''(see table "World thorium reserves")''.&lt;ref name=WNA/&gt; Monazite is a good source of REEs (Rare Earth Element), but monazites are currently not economical to produce because the radioactive thorium that is produced as a byproduct would have to be stored indefinitely. However, if thorium-based power plants were adopted on a large-scale, virtually all the world's thorium requirements could be supplied simply by refining monazites for their more valuable REEs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLR39sT_bTs International Atomic Energy Agency presentation by Jim Kennedy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of thorium-based reactors==
According to the [[World Nuclear Association]], there are seven types of reactors that can be designed to use thorium as a nuclear fuel. Six of these have all entered into operational service at some point. The seventh is still conceptual, although currently in development by many countries:&lt;ref name=WNA/&gt;
*[[Heavy water reactor]]s (PHWRs)
*[[Very high temperature reactor|High-temperature gas-cooled reactors]] (HTRs)
*[[Boiling water reactor|Boiling (light) water reactors]] (BWRs)
*[[Pressurized water reactor|Pressurized (light) water reactors]] (PWRs)
*[[Fast-neutron reactor|Fast neutron reactors]] (FNRs)
*[[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs), including [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor]]s (LFTRs). Instead of using fuel rods, molten salt reactors use compounds of fissile materials, in the form of molten salts, which are cycled through the core to undergo fission. The molten salt then carries the heat produced by the reactions away from the core, and exchanges it with a secondary medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=119788127&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSep644y9fwOLCmr1Cepq5Sr6a4SrWWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGpskuwqbROuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|title=Nuclear power from thorium: different options.|last=|first=|date=|website=offcampus.lib.washington.edu|access-date=2018-03-10}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molten salt breeder reactors, or MSBRs, are another type of molten salt reactor that use thorium to breed more fissile material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4770">A '''vacuum furnace''' is a type of [[furnace]] in which the product in the furnace is surrounded by a [[vacuum]] during processing. The absence of air or other gases prevents [[Redox|oxidation]], heat loss from the product through [[convection]], and removes a source of contamination. This enables the furnace to heat materials (typically metals and ceramics) to temperatures as high as {{Convert|3000|C|F|0|lk=on}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mrf-furnaces.com/vacuum-furnaces/|title=Vacuum Furnaces - Materials Research Furnaces, Inc.|newspaper=Materials Research Furnaces, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; with select materials. Maximum furnace temperatures and vacuum levels depend on [[Melting points of the elements (data page)|melting points]] and [[Vapor pressures of the elements (data page)|vapor pressures]] of heated materials. Vacuum furnaces are used to carry out processes such as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[brazing]], [[sintering]] and [[heat treatment]] with high consistency and low contamination.

Characteristics of a vacuum furnace are:

* Uniform temperatures in the range. {{Convert|800-3000|C|lk=on|sigfig=2}}
* Commercially available vacuum pumping systems can reach vacuum levels as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; Torr. (1 Torr = 1.333 millibar)
* Temperature can be controlled within a heated zone, typically surrounded by heat shielding or insulation.
* Low contamination of the product by carbon, [[oxygen]] and other gases.
* Vacuum pumping systems remove low temperature by-products from the process materials during heating, resulting in a higher purity end product.
* Quick cooling ([[quenching]]) of product can be used to shorten process cycle times.
* The process can be computer controlled to ensure repeatability.

Heating metals to high temperatures in open to atmosphere normally causes rapid [[oxidation]], which is undesirable. A vacuum furnace removes the oxygen and prevents this from happening.

An [[inert gas]], such as [[Argon]], is often used to quickly cool the treated metals back to non-metallurgical levels (below {{Convert|400|F|disp=sqbr|sigfig=1}}) after the desired process in the furnace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imp.mtu.edu/metallic/vacuum_furnace.html|title=Vacuum Furnace at IMP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This inert gas can be pressurized to two times atmosphere or more, then circulated through the hot zone area to pick up heat before passing through a [[heat exchanger]] to remove heat. This process continues until the desired temperature is reached.

==Common uses==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Vacuum furnaces are used in a wide range of applications in both production industries and research laboratories.

At temperatures below 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, a vacuum furnace is commonly used for the heat treatment of [[steel]] alloys. Many general heat treating applications involve the hardening and tempering of a steel part to make it strong and tough through service. Hardening involves heating the steel to a predetermined temperature, then cooling it rapidly.

A further application for vacuum furnaces is Vacuum [[Carburizing]] also known as Low Pressure Carburizing or LPC. In this process, a gas (such as acetylene) is introduced as a partial pressure into the hot zone at temperatures typically between {{Convert|1600|and|1950|F}}. The gas disassociates into its constituent elements (in this case carbon and hydrogen). The carbon is then diffused into the surface area of the part. This function is typically repeated, varying the duration of gas input and diffusion time. Once the workload is properly "cased", the metal is quenched using oil or high pressure gas (HPGQ). For HPGQ, nitrogen or, for faster quench helium, is commonly used. This process is also known as [[case hardening]].

Another low temperature application of vacuum furnaces is debinding, a process for the removal of binders. Heat is applied under a vacuum in a sealed chamber, melting or vaporizing the binder from the [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]]. The binder is evacuated by the pumping system and collected or purged downstream. The material with a higher melting point is left behind in a purified state and can be further processed.

Vacuum furnaces capable of temperatures above 1200&amp;nbsp;°C are used in various industry sectors such as electronics, medical, crystal growth, energy and artificial gems. The processing of high temperature materials, both of metals and nonmetals, in a vacuum environment allows [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], [[brazing]], [[List of purification methods in chemistry|purification]], [[sintering]] and other processes to take place in a controlled manner.

'''Vapor''' (or '''vapour''') '''recovery''' is the process of [[wikt:recovery|recovering]] the [[vapor]]s of [[gasoline]] or other [[fuel]]s, so that they do not escape into the [[atmosphere]]. This is often done (or required by [[law]]) at [[filling station]]s, in order to reduce [[Poison|noxious]] and potentially [[Explosive material|explosive]] [[Vaporization|fumes]] and [[pollution]].  

The negative [[pressure]] created in the (underground) [[tank]] by the withdrawal is usually used to pull in the vapors. They are drawn-in through holes in the side of the [[nozzle]] and travel through special [[hose]]s which have a return path.

==State requirements==
* Illinois - [http://www.epa.state.il.us/air/stage-ii-vapor-recovery.html]

==Other industries==
Vapor recovery is also used in the chemical process industry to remove and recover vapors from storage tanks. The vapors are usually either environmentally hazardous, or valuable to be recovered. The process consists of a closed venting system from the storage tank [[ullage]] space to a vapor recovery unit (VRU) which will recover the vapors for return to the process or destroy them, usually by oxidation.

Vapor recovery units are also becoming commonly used in the oil and gas industry as a means of recovering natural gas vapor and making it a usable and profitable product. Specifically a newer form of vapor recovery technology, Ejector Vapor Recovery Units create a closed loop system which not only recovers valuable vapor, but also reduces methane and VOC emissions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://commengineering.com/vapor-recovery.html|author=Comm Engineering|publisher=Comm Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian region vapor recovery has become mandatory in major urban areas. There are 2 categories - VR1 and VR2. VR1 is to be installed in fuel stations that pump less than 500,000 litres annually, VR2 is for fuel quantities over 500,000 litres per annum, or as designated by various EPA bodies. 

Vapor recovery towers are also used in the oil and gas industry to provide flash gas recovery at near atmospheric pressure without the potential of oxygen ingress from the top of the storage tanks.  The ability to create the vapor flash inside the vapor recovery tower often reduces storage tank emissions to less than 6 tons per year, exempting the tank battery from Quad O reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HY-BON - Vapor Recovery Tower (VRT)|url=http://hy-bon.com/products/vrt/|publisher=HY-BON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Vegetable oils|image=Olive oil from Oneglia.jpg|caption=[[Olive oil]]}}

'''Vegetable [[oil]]s''', or '''vegetable fats''', are [[fat]]s extracted from seeds, or less often, from other parts of fruits. Like [[animal fat]]s, vegetable fats are ''mixtures'' of [[triglyceride]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Alfred Thomas |title=Fats and Fatty Oils|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial  Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|year=2002|doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_173}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soybean oil]], [[rapeseed oil]], and [[cocoa butter]] are examples of fats from seeds. [[Olive oil]], [[palm oil]], and [[rice bran oil]] are example of fats from other parts of fruits. In common usage, vegetable ''oil'' may refer exclusively to vegetable fats which are [[liquid]] at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pearson Guide to the B.Sc. (Nursing) Entrance Examination|author=Parwez Saroj|publisher=Pearson Education India|page=109|isbn=81-317-1338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The International Cocoa Trade|author=Robin Dand|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|year=1999|page=169|isbn=1-85573-434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of triglyceride vegetable oil==
Oils extracted from plants have been used since ancient times and in many cultures. As an example, in a 4,000-year-old kitchen unearthed in Indiana's [[Charlestown State Park]], archaeologist Bob McCullough of [[Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne]] found evidence that large slabs of rock were used to crush [[hickory nut]]s and the oil was then extracted with boiling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate=2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence shows that olives were turned into olive oil by 6000 BC&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Schuster (December 17, 2014). "8,000-year old olive oil found in Galilee, earliest known in world", ''Haaretz''. Retrieved December 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and 4500 BC in present-day [[Israel]] and [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Galili ''et al.'', "Evidence for Earliest Olive-Oil Production in Submerged Settlements off the Carmel Coast, Israel", ''Journal of Archaeological Science'' '''24''':1141–1150 (1997); Pagnol, p. 19, says the 6th millennium in [[Jericho]], but cites no source.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culinary uses===
{{See also|Cooking oil}}

Many vegetable oils are consumed directly, or indirectly as ingredients in food – a role that they share with some [[fat|animal fats]], including [[butter]], [[ghee]], [[lard]], and [[schmaltz]]. The oils serve a number of purposes in this role:
* Shortening – to give pastry a crumbly texture.
* Texture – oils can serve to make other ingredients stick together less.
* Flavor – while less flavorful oils command premium prices, some oils, such as [[olive oil|olive]], [[sesame oil|sesame]], or [[almond oil|almond]] oil, may be chosen specifically for the flavor they impart.
* Flavor base – oils can also "carry" flavors of other ingredients, since many flavors are due to chemicals that are soluble in oil.

Secondly, oils can be heated and used to cook other foods. Oils suitable for this objective must have a high [[flash point]]. Such oils include the major cooking oils – [[soybean oil|soybean]], [[rapeseed oil|rapeseed]], [[canola oil|canola]], [[sunflower oil|sunflower]], [[safflower oil|safflower]], [[peanut oil|peanut]], [[cottonseed oil|cottonseed]], etc. Tropical oils, such as [[Coconut oil|coconut]], [[Palm oil|palm]], and [[Rice bran oil|rice bran]] oils, are particularly valued in Asian cultures for high-temperature cooking, because of their unusually high flash points.

===Hydrogenated oils===
Unsaturated vegetable oils can be transformed through partial or complete "[[hydrogenation]]" into oils of higher melting point. The hydrogenation process involves "[[Sparging (chemistry)|sparging]]" the oil at high temperature and pressure with [[hydrogen]] in the presence of a [[catalyst]], typically a powdered [[nickel]] compound. As each carbon–carbon double-bond is chemically reduced to a single bond, two hydrogen atoms each form single bonds with the two carbon atoms. The elimination of double bonds by adding hydrogen atoms is called [[saturated fat|saturation]]; as the degree of saturation increases, the oil progresses toward being fully hydrogenated. An oil may be hydrogenated to increase resistance to [[Rancidification|rancidity]] ([[oxidation]]) or to change its physical characteristics. As the degree of saturation increases, the oil's viscosity and melting point increase.

The use of hydrogenated oils in foods has never been completely satisfactory. Because the center arm of the [[triglyceride]] is shielded somewhat by the end fatty acids, most of the hydrogenation occurs on the end fatty acids, thus making the resulting fat more brittle.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} A margarine made from naturally more saturated oils will be more plastic (more "spreadable") than a margarine made from hydrogenated soy oil.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} While ''full hydrogenation'' produces largely saturated fatty acids, partial hydrogenation results in the transformation of unsaturated cis fatty acids to [[trans fats|unsaturated trans fatty acids]] in the oil mixture due to the heat used in hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenated oils and their trans fats have been linked to an increased risk of mortality from [[coronary heart disease]],&lt;ref name=TRANSformingApx9&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trans Fat Task Force |title=TRANSforming the Food Supply (Appendix 9iii) |date=June 2006 |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html |accessdate=2007-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225021532/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/gras-trans-fats/tf-ge/tf-gt_app9iii_e.html |archivedate=February 25, 2007 }} (Consultation on the health implications of alternatives to trans fatty acids: Summary of Responses from Experts)&lt;/ref&gt; among other increased health risks.

In the US, the [[Standard of Identity]] for a product labeled as "vegetable oil margarine" specifies only canola, safflower, sunflower, corn, soybean, or peanut oil may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products not labeled "vegetable oil margarine" do not have that restriction.

===Industrial uses===
Vegetable oils are used as an ingredient or component in many manufactured products.

Many vegetable oils are used to make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as [[drying oil]]s, and are used in making paints and other wood treatment products. Dammar oil (a mixture of linseed oil and [[dammar]] resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly being used in the electrical industry as [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s as vegetable oils are not toxic to the environment, [[biodegradable]] if spilled and have high [[flash point|flash]] and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to [[oxygen]], and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by [[Fischer–Speier esterification|Fischer esterification]]. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable [[hydraulic fluid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[lubricant]].&lt;ref&gt;

 | title=Cass Scenic Railroad, West Virginia
 | publisher=GWWCA
 | accessdate=2011-11-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One limiting factor in industrial uses of vegetable oils is that all such oils are susceptible to becoming [[Rancidification|rancid]]. Oils that are more stable, such as [[ben oil]] or [[mineral oil]], are thus preferred for industrial uses. [[Castor oil]] has numerous industrial uses, owing to the presence of [[hydroxyl]] group on the fatty acid. Castor oil is a precursor to [[Nylon 11]].

===Pet food additive===
Vegetable oil is used in production of some pet foods. AAFCO&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aafco.org/|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  defines vegetable oil, in this context, as the product of vegetable origin obtained by extracting the oil from seeds or fruits which are processed for edible purposes.

===Fuel===
{{Main article|Vegetable oil fuel}}

Vegetable oils are also used to make [[biodiesel]], which can be used like conventional diesel. Some [[vegetable oil blends]] are used in unmodified vehicles but [[straight vegetable oil]], also known as pure plant oil, needs specially prepared vehicles which have a method of heating the oil to reduce its [[viscosity]]. The use of [[vegetable oils as alternative energy]] is growing and the availability of [[Biodiesel by region|biodiesel around the world]] is increasing.

The [[NNFCC]] estimate that the total net greenhouse gas savings when using vegetable oils in place of fossil fuel-based alternatives for fuel production, range from 18 to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/ghg-benefits-from-use-of-vegetable-oils-for-electricity-heat-transport-and-industrial-purposes-nnfcc-10-016 GHG Benefits from Use of Vegetable Oils for Electricity, Heat, Transport and Industrial Purposes, NNFCC 10-016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The production process of vegetable oil involves the removal of oil from plant components, typically seeds. This can be done via mechanical extraction using an [[oil mill]] or chemical extraction using a solvent. The extracted oil can then be purified and, if required, refined or chemically altered.

===Mechanical extraction===

Oils can be removed via mechanical extraction, termed "crushing" or "pressing." This method is typically used to produce the more traditional oils (e.g., olive, coconut etc.), and it is preferred by most "[[health-food]]" customers in the United States and in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} There are several different types of mechanical extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Solvent extraction===
The processing of vegetable oil in commercial applications is commonly done by chemical extraction, using solvent extracts, which produces higher yields and is quicker and less expensive. The most common solvent is petroleum-derived [[hexane]]. This technique is used for most of the "newer" industrial oils such as soybean and corn oils.

[[Supercritical carbon dioxide]] can be used as a non-toxic alternative to other solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11746-006-5038-6 |title=Pilot-scale supercritical carbon dioxide extraction and fractionation of wheat germ oil |year=2006 |last1=Eisenmenger |first1=Michael |last2=Dunford |first2=Nurhan T. |last3=Eller |first3=Fred |last4=Taylor |first4=Scott |last5=Martinez |first5=Jose |journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=863–868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogenation===

Oils may be partially [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to produce various ingredient oils. Lightly hydrogenated oils have very similar physical characteristics to regular soy oil, but are more resistant to becoming rancid. Margarine oils need to be mostly solid at 32&amp;nbsp;°C (90&amp;nbsp;°F) so that the margarine does not melt in warm rooms, yet it needs to be completely liquid at 37&amp;nbsp;°C (98&amp;nbsp;°F), so that it doesn't leave a "lardy" taste in the mouth.

Hardening vegetable oil is done by raising a blend of vegetable oil and a catalyst in near-vacuum to very high temperatures, and introducing hydrogen. This causes the carbon atoms of the oil to break double-bonds with other carbons, each carbon forming a new single-bond with a hydrogen atom. Adding these hydrogen atoms to the oil makes it more solid, raises the [[smoke point]], and makes the oil more stable.

Hydrogenated vegetable oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated. During hydrogenation, it is easier for hydrogen to come into contact with the fatty acids on the end of the triglyceride, and less easy for them to come into contact with the center fatty acid. This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less "spreadable".{{compared to?|date=February 2013}} The other difference is that trans fatty acids (often called [[trans fat]]) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 percent by weight of a partially hydrogenated oil. Hydrogenated oils, especially partially hydrogenated oils with their higher amounts of trans fatty acids are increasingly thought to be unhealthy.

===Deodorization===
In the processing of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced at the bottom of the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors and flavors, and lightens the color of the oil.

=== Occupational exposure ===
People can breathe in vegetable oil mist in the workplace. The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for vegetable oil mist exposure in the workplace as 15&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Vegetable oil mist|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0655.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular oils==
{{mainlist|List of vegetable oils}}

The following triglyceride vegetable oils account for almost all worldwide production, by volume. All are used as both cooking oils and as [[Straight vegetable oil|SVO]] or to make biodiesel. According to the USDA, the total world consumption of major vegetable oils in 2007/08 was:&lt;ref name=USDAOilSeeds2009-01&gt;{{Cite book

Note that these figures include industrial and animal feed use. The majority of European rapeseed oil production is used to produce biodiesel, or used directly as fuel in diesel cars which may require modification to heat the oil to reduce its higher [[viscosity]]. The suitability of the fuel should come as little surprise, as [[Rudolf Diesel]] originally designed his engine to run on peanut oil.

Other significant triglyceride oils include:

* [[Corn oil]], one of the most common cooking oils. As of 2006 the US produced about 1.09 million metric tons &lt;ref name="corn dot org"&gt;Corn Refiners Association. [http://www.corn.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/CornOil.pdf Corn Oil] 5th Edition. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of corn oil, which is used for cooking oil, salad dressing, margarine, mayonnaise, prepared goods like spaghetti sauce and baking mixes, and to fry prepared foods like potato chips and French fries.

* [[Grape seed oil]], used in cooking and cosmetics
* [[Hazelnut oil]] and other nut oils
* [[Linseed oil]], from [[flax]] seeds
* [[Rice bran oil]], from rice grains
* [[Safflower oil]], a flavorless and colorless cooking oil
* [[Sesame oil]], used as a cooking oil, and as a massage oil, particularly in India
* [[Açaí palm]] oil, used in culinary and cosmetics
* [[Jambú oil]], is extracted from the flowers, leaves and stem from jambu (''[[Acmella oleracea]]''), contains [[spilanthol]] 
* [[Graviola oil]], derived from ''[[Annona muricata]]''
* [[Tucumã oil]], from ''[[Astrocaryum aculeatum]]'' is used to manufacture soap.
* [[Brazil nut]] oil, culinary and cosmetics use
* [[Carapa]] oil, pharmaceutical use and anti-mosquito candle
* [[Buriti oil]], from ''[[Mauritia flexuosa]]'', used in cosmetics (skin and hair care)
* [[Passion fruit oil]], derived from ''[[Passiflora edulis]]'', has varied applications in cosmetics manufacturing and for uses as a human or animal food.
* [[Pracaxi oil]], obtained from ''[[Pentaclethra macroloba]]'', cosmetics use
* [[Solarium oil]], derived from chloroplasts, various applications in cooking

===Composition of fats===
{{Vegetable oils, composition}}

==History ==
Such oils have been part of human culture for millennia.  Poppy seed, rapeseed, linseed, almond oil, sesame seed, safflower, and cotton seed were used since at least the [[bronze age]] throughout the Middle East and Central Asia.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;&lt;!--.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  In 1780,  [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] demonstrated that fats were derived from glycerol.  Thirty years later [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] deduced that these fats were esters of fatty acids and glycerol.

In modern times, cottonseed oil was marketed by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] as a creamed shortening in 1911. [[Ginning mill]]s were happy to have someone haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated to give a solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and can it under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter &amp; Gamble was already selling to consumers, [[Crisco]] was cheaper, easier to stir into a recipe, and could be stored at room temperature for two years without turning rancid.

Soybeans were an exciting new crop from China in the 1930s. Soy was protein-rich, and the medium viscosity oil was high in polyunsaturates. [[Henry Ford]] established a soybean research laboratory, developed soybean plastics and a soy-based synthetic wool, and built a car "almost entirely" out of soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s and 1960s, soybean oil had become the most popular vegetable oil in the US.

In the mid-1970s, Canadian researchers developed a low-erucic-acid rapeseed cultivar. Because the word "rape" was not considered optimal for marketing, they coined the name "canola" (from "Canada Oil low acid"). The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved use of the canola name in January 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00198.html|title=Canola oil|accessdate=2006-07-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060617234030/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00198.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. farmers started planting large areas that spring. Canola oil is lower in saturated fats, and higher in monounsaturates and is a better source of [[omega-3]] fats than other popular oils. Canola is very thin (unlike corn oil) and flavorless (unlike olive oil), so it largely succeeds by displacing soy oil, just as soy oil largely succeeded by displacing cottonseed oil.

==Used oil==
A large quantity of used vegetable oil is produced and recycled, mainly from industrial [[deep fryer]]s in potato processing plants, [[snack food]] factories and [[fast food restaurant]]s.

Recycled oil has numerous uses, including use as a [[Vegetable oil fuel|direct fuel]], as well as in the production of [[biodiesel]], soap, [[compound feed|animal feed]], pet food, detergent, and cosmetics. It is traded as the commodity, [[yellow grease]].

Since 2002, an increasing number of [[European Union]] countries have prohibited the inclusion of recycled vegetable oil from catering in animal feed. Used cooking oils from food manufacturing, however, as well as fresh or unused cooking oil, continue to be used in animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/guidancenotes/foodguid/wastecookingoil|title=Waste cooking oil from catering premises|accessdate=2006-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelf life==

Due to their susceptibility to oxidation from the exposure to oxygen, heat and light, resulting in the formation of [[redox|oxidation]] products, such as [[peroxide]]s and [[hydroperoxide]]s, plant oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have a limited shelf-life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Product labeling==

In Canada, palm oil is one of five vegetable oils, along with palm kernel oil, coconut oil, peanut oil and cocoa butter, which must be specifically named in the list of ingredients for a food product.&lt;ref name="CFIA1"&gt;{{citation
 | title=Guide to Food Labelling and Advertising
 | chapter=Basic Labelling Requirements
 | publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency
 | url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/labelling/food-labelling-for-industry/fats-and-oils/eng/1392751693435/1392751782638?chap=2
 | accessdate=2015-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, oils in Canadian food products which have been modified or hydrogenated must contain the word "modified" or "hydrogenated" when listed as an ingredient.&lt;ref name="CFIA2"&gt;{{citation
 | title=Labelling Requirements for Fats and Oils 
 | chapter=Common Name - Fats and Oils
 | publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency
 | url=http://www.alimentheque.com/divers/GuideFoodLabellingAdvertising_CFIA_dec2011.pdf
 | accessdate=2015-04-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mix of oils other than the aforementioned exceptions may simply be listed as "vegetable oil" in Canada; however, if the food product is a cooking oil, salad oil or table oil, the type of oil must be specified and listing "vegetable oil" as an ingredient is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="CFIA1" /&gt;

From December 2014, all food products produced in the [[European Union]] were legally required to indicate the specific vegetable oil used in their manufacture, following the introduction of the Food Information to Consumers Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
