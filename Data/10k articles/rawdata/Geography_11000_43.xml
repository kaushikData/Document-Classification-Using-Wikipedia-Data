The '''68th parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 68 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], in the [[Arctic]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]].

At this latitude the [[sun]] is visible for 24 hours, 0 minutes during the [[summer solstice]] and Civil Twilight during the [[winter solstice]].

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 68° north passes through:

The '''Adirondack Mountains''' {{IPAc-en|æ|d|ᵻ|ˈ|r|ɒ|n|d|æ|k}} form a [[massif]] in northeastern [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. Its boundaries correspond to the boundaries of [[Adirondack Park]]. The mountains form a roughly circular dome, about {{convert|160|mi|km}} in diameter and about {{convert|1|mi|m}} high. The current relief owes much to glaciation.

== History ==
[[File:1876 Wallace Guide Map of NY Wilderness.JPG|thumb|1876 map of the Adirondacks, showing many of the now obsolete names for many of the peaks, lakes, and communities.]]
The earliest written use of the name, spelled ''Rontaks'', was in 1729 by the French missionary [[Joseph-François Lafitau]]. He defined it as ''tree eaters''. In the [[Mohawk language]], Adirondack means [[North American porcupine|porcupine]], an animal that may eat [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. The Mohawks had no written language at the time so Europeans have used various phonetic spellings. An English map from 1761 labels it simply ''Deer Hunting Country'' and the mountains were named ''Adirondacks''  in 1837 by [[Ebenezer Emmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cherniak|first1=D. J.|title=Ebenezer Emmons (1799–1863)|url=http://ees2.geo.rpi.edu/History/emmons.html|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People first arrived in the area following the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]] around 10,000 BC. The [[Algonquian peoples]] and the [[Mohawk nation]] used the Adirondacks for hunting and travel but did not settle. European colonisation of the area began with [[Samuel de Champlain]] visiting what is now [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] in 1609, and [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Isaac Jogues]] visited the region in 1642.&lt;ref name=sulavik&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sulavik|first1=Stephen B.|title=Adirondack : of Indians and mountains, 1535–1838|date=2007|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|location=Fleischmanns, N.Y.|isbn=978-1930098794|pages=21–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1664 the land came under the control of the English when [[New Netherland]] was ceded to [[The Crown]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the lands passed to the people of New York State. Needing money to discharge war debts, the new government sold nearly all the original public acreage about 7 million acres for pennies an acre. Lumbermen were welcomed to the interior, with few restraints,&lt;ref name=apa-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Adirondack Park|url=http://apa.ny.gov/About_Park/history.htm|website=New York State Adirondack Park Agency|accessdate=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in massive deforestation.

For the history of the area since industrialization, see [[Adirondack Park#History|The History of Adirondack Park]].

In 1989, part of the Adirondack region was designated by UNESCO as the [[Champlain-Adirondack Biosphere Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=USA+45&amp;mode=all|title=UNESCO – MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geology ==
[[File:Whiteface Mountain from Lake Placid Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Whiteface Mountain]] is the fifth-highest mountain in the U.S. state of [[New York (state)|New York]], and one of the High Peaks of the Adirondack Mountains.]]
The rocks of the Adirondack mountains originated about two billion years ago as 50,000 feet (15,000 m) thick [[sediments]] at the bottom of a sea located near the [[equator]]. Because of [[continental drift]] these collided with [[Laurentia]] (the precursor of modern North America) in a mountain building episode known as the [[Grenville orogeny]]. During this time the [[sedimentary rock]] was changed into [[metamorphic rock]]. It is these [[Proterozoic]] [[minerals]] and [[lithologies]] that make up the core of the massif. Minerals of interest include:
* [[wollastonite]], mined near [[Harrisville, NY|Harrisville]]
* [[magnetite]] and [[hematite]], formerly mined at the [[Benson Mines]],&lt;ref name=Graton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ridge|first1=J. D.|title=Ore Deposits of the United States, 1933–1967|date=1968|publisher=The American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lyon Mountain, New York|Lyon Mountain]], [[Mineville, New York|Mineville]], [[Tahawus, New York|Tawahus]], and [[Witherbee, New York|Witherbee]].
* [[graphite]], mined near [[Hague, New York|Hague]] and [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]].
* [[garnet]], mined at the Barton Mine, north of [[Gore Mountain (New York)|Gore Mountain]].
* [[anorthosite]], visible in road cuts on the [[New York State Route 3]] between [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake]] and [[Tupper Lake (New York)|Tupper Lake]].&lt;ref name=storey/&gt;
* [[marble]]
* [[zinc]]: The Balmat-Edwards district on the northwest flank of the massif also in St. Lawrence County was a major [[zinc]] ore deposit
* [[titanium]] was mined at [[Tahawus, New York|Tawahus]].

Note that even though they all resulted from the Grenville orogeny, neither the Adirondacks (now uplifted by a hot spot) nor the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] or [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] (a dissected plateau formed from delta deposits) are part of the [[Appalachian Mountain]] chain (faulted and folded by continental collisions).

Around 600 million years ago, as [[Laurentia]] drifted away from [[Baltica]] (European Craton), the area began to be pulled apart forming the [[Iapetus Ocean]]. [[Fault (geology)|Faults]] developed, running north to north east which formed valleys and deep lakes. Examples visible today include the [[grabens]] [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] and [[Schroon Lake]]. By this time the Grenville mountains had been eroded away and the area was covered by a shallow sea. Several thousand feet of sediment accumulated on the sea bed. [[Trilobites]] were the principal life-form of the sea bed, and [[fossil]] tracks can be seen in the [[Potsdam sandstone]] floor of the Paul Smiths Visitor Interpretive Center.&lt;ref name=storey&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storey|first1=Mike|title=Why the Adirondacks look the way they do : a natural history|date=2006|publisher=Storey|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0-9777172-0-8|page=22|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 10 million years ago the region began to be uplifted. It has been lifted about 7000 feet (2100 m) and is continuing at about 2 millimetres per year, which is greater than the rate of [[denudation]]. The cause of the uplift is unknown, but geologists theorize that it is caused by a [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spot]] in the earth's [[Mantle (geology)|crust]].&lt;ref name="storey" /&gt; A recent study has revealed a column of seismically slow materials about 50-80 km deep beneath the Adirondack Mountains&lt;ref name="Adirondacks seismic imaging"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Xiaotao |last2=Gao |first2=Haiying |title=Full‐Wave Seismic Tomography in the Northeastern United States: New Insights Into the Uplift Mechanism of the Adirondack Mountains |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=June 6, 2018 |volume=45 |pages=5992–6000 |doi=10.1029/2018GL078438 |url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078438 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was interpreted to be the upwelling asthenosphere contributing to the uplift of the mountains. The occurrence of [[earthquake swarms]] near the center of the massif at [[Blue Mountain Lake, New York|Blue Mountain Lake]] may be evidence of this. Some of the earthquakes have exceeded 5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].

Starting about 2.5 million years ago a cycle of [[Pleistocene]] [[glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods began which covered the area in ice. During the most recent episode, the [[Laurentide ice sheet]] covered most of northern North America between about 95,000 and c. 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="dyke_prest"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dyke|first=A. S.|author2=Prest, V. K. |year=1987|title=Late Wisconsinan and Holocene History of the Laurentide Ice Sheet|journal=Géographie physique et Quaternaire|volume=41|issue=2|pages=237–263|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/GPQ/1987/v41/n2/032681ar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this the climate warmed, but it took nearly 10,000 years for all of the 10,000 feet (3,000 m) thick layer of ice to melt. Evidence of this period includes:
* [[Eskers]]: the Rainbow Lake esker bisects the eponymous lake and extends discontinuously for 85 miles. Another long discontinuous esker extends from Mountain Pond through [[Keese Mill, New York|Keese Mill]], passing between [[Upper St. Regis Lake]] and the Spectacle Ponds, and continuing to Ochre, Fish, and Lydia Ponds in the [[Saint Regis Canoe Area|St. Regis Canoe Area]]. A 150 foot high esker bisects the [[Five Ponds Wilderness Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sea Serpents in the Adirondacks?

* [[Glacial erratics]]: there is a large one at the [[Newcomb, New York|Newcomb]] Visitor Information Centre next to the Rich Lake Trail.
* [[Kame]]s
* [[Moraines]]
* The [[cirques]] that characterize the [[Whiteface Mountain]].
* [[Outwash plain]]s: St. Regis Canoe Area is an outwash plain pitted with [[Kettle (landform)|kettle holes]].

Soils in the area are generally thin, sandy, acidic, and infertile, having developed since the glacial retreat.

The mountains include many [[wetland]]s, of which there are three kinds:&lt;ref name=storey/&gt;
* [[Swamp]]s, any wetland including trees and shrubs 
* [[Marsh]]es, wetlands with [[water stagnation]]. These may support [[bullfrog]]s and [[spring peeper]]s, [[spotted salamander]]s, [[great blue heron]], [[American bittern]], and [[painted turtles]]. [[Pickerel weed]] often forms large colonies.
* [[Bog]]s, characterized by plants like [[sphagnum moss]], [[orchid]]s, and [[pitcher plant]]s

Common birds include the [[boreal chickadee]]s, [[gray jay]]s, [[spruce grouse]], [[black-backed woodpecker]]s, [[common loon]]s and [[crossbill]]s.

Nearly 60 percent of the park is covered with [[northern hardwood forest]]. Above 2600 feet (790 m) conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and these trees become mixed with or replaced by [[balsam fir]] and [[red spruce]]. Above 3500 feet (1000 m) [[black spruce]] replace red. Higher still only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.

Only a tiny fraction of the area above the [[tree line]] is classified as having an [[alpine climate]].

'''Blasius Kozenn''' ({{lang-sl|Blaž Kocen}};  24 January 1821 in [[Hotunje]], [[Lower Styria]] – 29 May 1871 in [[Hernals]]) was a Slovenian&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich, Charles. 1990. ''South Slav nationalisms: Textbooks and Yugoslav union before 1914''. Columbus: Ohio State University Press, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; cartographer. He has occasionally been misidentified as Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;Klawe, J. J. 1957. "The Faber Atlas" ''The Geographical Journal'' 123(3): 424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Clara Beatrice Muriel. 1969. ''Modern maps and atlases: An outline guide to twentieth century production''. London: Bingley, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lock, Clara Beatrice Muriel. 1976. ''Geography and cartography: A reference handbook''. London: C. Bingley, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Kozenn was familiar to generations of former pupils in [[Austria-Hungary]] because Kozenn's school atlas was published in millions of copies in more than 100 editions and in many languages. It was one of the most commonly used atlases in the Austrian half of Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Wolter, John Amadeus, Ronald E. Grim, &amp; Library of Congress. 1997. ''Images of the world: the atlas through history.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Blasius Kozenn was born into a poor farming family in the village of [[Hotunje]], not far from [[Ponikva]]. After attending elementary school in [[Ponikva]], he attended the upper secondary school in [[Celje]], where he was accepted through the efforts of his elementary school teacher. He continued his studies in [[Graz]] and [[Klagenfurt]], where he studied [[theology]]. He was ordained a priest in 1845.

Kozenn served as a curate in [[Rogatec]] from 1849 to 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Savnik, Roman, ed. 1976. ''Krajevni leksikon Slovenije'', vol. 3. Ljubljana: Državna založba Slovenije. p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1850 to 1852 he held the position of assistant instructor ({{lang-de|Supplent}}) at the Celje upper secondary school. After this he traveled to [[Vienna]], where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[natural history]] at the University of Vienna, passing his teaching exams in these subjects with distinction. In 1854 he was accepted into the civil service and became an upper secondary school instructor, first in [[Ljubljana]], and then from 1855 to 1858 in [[Gorizia]]. This was where he wrote his ''Grundzüge der Geographie für die 1. Classe der Mittel- und Bürgerschulen'' (Essentials of Geography for the First Class of High School; first published in 1858 in [[Budapest]] and Vienna) and his study ''Das Klima von Görz'' (The Climate of the [[Province of Gorizia]]). In 1858 he started teaching at the German-language Imperial Upper Secondary School in [[Olomouc]], where he remained until his early retirement in 1870. He was active in the introduction of the new ''[[Realschule]]'' secondary school, and in 1863 he was named a member of the school inspectorate. 

As a result of poor health, he moved from Olomouc to the Vienna suburb of Hernals, where he died from [[typhoid fever]] on 29 May 1871 at the age of 50.

== School atlas ==

In Olomouc Kozenn became acquainted with the bookseller and publisher [[Eduard Hölzel]], who convinced him to create the first Austrian school atlas. This was finally published in 1861, after Hölzel moved to Vienna. As sources for his maps, he used [[Adolf Stieler]]'s and [[Heinrich Kiepert]]'s German atlases. He did not shy away from directly copying and only slightly modifying German school atlases of the time.

In 1900 Kozenn's atlas was fully revised by Vinzenz von Haardt, Friedrich Umlauft, Wilhelm Schmidt, and Franz Heiderich with regard to content, maps, and technical aspects; as such, it was comparable to the best atlases produced abroad. The success of Hölzel's publishing company encouraged the imperial government to issue other modern school atlases. Competition on the market resulted on the production of increasingly better atlases, including increasingly more thematic maps. The atlas was later revised further by Heinrich Güttenberger, Hermann Leiter, Hans Slanar, and Walter Strzygowski (after 1956).

As a self-taught cartographer, Kozenn also produced numerous wall maps for schools.

'''Canals in Nauru''' have been artificially created to allow boats access to the small island. The canals are predominantly man-made openings in the surrounding reef which encircle the entire island of [[Nauru]]. These canals ease the docking of boats and yachts.

The '''Cullum Geographical Medal''' is one of the oldest awards of the [[American Geographical Society]]. It was established in the will of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[George Washington Cullum]] (1809–92), the vice president of the Society, and is awarded "to those who distinguish themselves by geographical discoveries or in the advancement of geographical science". It was first awarded in 1896 to [[Robert Peary|Robert E. Peary]]. The gold medal was designed by [[Lydia Field Emmet]].

"On the front is the figure of a young man standing in the bow of a boat. He has thrown down his oars upon discovering land. He shades his eyes with his hand as the boat progresses through the waves. A sea gull, hovering, indicates the proximity of land. The whole is supposed to represent enterprise and the spirit of exploration. Inscribed on the face of the medal is: "The American Geographical Society of New York.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Geographical Society of New York|title=Transactions of the Society, January–March, 1897|journal=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York|date=1897|volume=29|issue=no. 1|page=121|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The reverse, to typify achievement and award, bears a female figure – Columbia, the left hand resting on a globe and the right holding out a laurel wreath. Beneath the right arm is the tablet to bear the record of the achievement for which the award is made. On the side is the inscription, "The Cullum Geographical Medal.""&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=American Geographical Society of New York|title=Transactions of the Society, January–March, 1897|journal=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York|date=1897|volume=29|issue=no. 1|page=121|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Děčín Weir''' ({{lang-de|Staustufe Děčín}}, {{lang-cz|Plavební stupeň Děčín}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://tomcat.cenia.cz/eia/detail.jsp?id=MZP102 Informační systém EIA – Záměry na území ČR – MZP102 – Plavební stupeň Děčín]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a planned [[weir]] and [[lock (water transport)|lock]] complex near the town of [[Děčín]] in [[Bohemia]] on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] section of the [[River Elbe]].

== Description ==
The site of the proposed weir and lock system is between ''Děčín-Loubí (Laube)'' and ''Prostřední Žleb (Mittelgrund)'' not far from the German border at river kilometre 737.02 (navigation km 98.98). It will consist of a weir, a lock, a small [[hydropower station]] and two [[fish ladder]]s.

== Purpose ==
The Děčín weir is part of Czech attempts to improve [[navigation]] on the Elbe by increasing the regulation of flow. The declared aim is a draught of at least 140&amp;nbsp;cm on ca.&amp;nbsp;345 days per year.

== Controversy ==
Opponents of the project question whether a measureable economic benefit can be achieved, since the navigability of the Elbe is also limited below the site by weather-driven interruptions. Thus is also concern that the Děčín weir will raise the pressure on Germany to establish similar structures on its section of the Elbe.

The project has also been criticised for its impact on the [[Natural environment|environment]] and on landscape and flood protection and, since 2000, there have been lots of objections, especially on the German side.&lt;ref&gt;aus einem [http://lidd.de/index.php?blog=5&amp;p=44&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 Blog of 2001]: ''„Staustufe ‚Prostřední Žleb‘ bei km 99 – inmitten des Landschaftsschutzgebietes „Elbesandsteine“ [...]. Vom 10. April bis 9. Mai 2000 hatten sächsische Bürger die Gelegenheit, sich zur Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung (UVP) der Staustufenprojekte zu äußern. [...]“''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dresden.bund.net/fileadmin/bundgruppen/bcmsrgdresden/Stellungnahme_060309_A.pdf Oznameni zameru Plavebni stupen Decin dle zakona c. 100/2001 Sb.

'''''Faultlines: Race, Work, and the Politics of Changing Australia''''' is a [[book]] by [[journalist]] [[George Megalogenis]].

George Megalogenis is a senior feature writer for ''[[The Australian]]'' newspaper. Megalogenis divides Australia up into two sections: old Australia and new Australia. This is where all Australia's cultural problems purportedly lie.

The new part of Australia Megalogenis describes as women who were the daughters of the baby boomers, and who have benefited from the new economy. The majority of Australian workers are now female. Added to this generation of women are the children of post-war immigrants. They, too, are all doing very well. Statistics show that the children of immigrants do considerably better than the children of ‘white’, Australian born citizens.

Old Australia is old white Australia. Their children are not doing that well at school, and they themselves are not doing too well in the new deregulated economy.

These are the faultlines that Megalogenis uses as the title of his book. These two Australias are where Australia is currently experiencing its cultural clashes, between the so-called [[Hansonites]] and the so-called inner-city, cut-off-from-reality elites. Megalogenis believes that it is the new Australia that is going to shape the future of the country: that will mean a generation that is pro-republic, pro-reconciliation and at least for a softer policy on refugees.

'''''Finland, the country of white lilies''''' is a journalistic book by Russian priest and social activist [[Grigory Spiridonovich Petrov]] (1866–1925).&lt;ref&gt;[https://fcp.finland.fi/following-my-heart-to-finland/ Book by Grigory Petrov]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[October Revolution]], when Petrov lived in [[Serbia]], he wrote a journalistic book, dedicated to [[Finland]] and [[Johan Vilhelm Snellman]]. The book describes the country as a role model, as a living example for Russia and other countries. In 1923 the book was published in the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] entitled "Зидари живота" ("Creators of Life").

After Petrov's death, the book was published and reprinted many times in different languages (including 14 times in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and 16 times in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages).

==Reviews==
The ideas expressed in the book about [[Finland]], were received with great enthusiasm both in Serbia and in Bulgaria. In 1926, a cultural and social group named "Gregory Petrov" was created to disseminate the ideas of Petrov. Michael Yovov, the national education minister of Bulgaria wrote that Finnish model is an example of a perfect solution of public problems in [[Bulgaria]], in the preface of one of the editions in the Bulgarian language.

'''Sir Frank Merry Stenton''' (17 May 1880 – 15 September 1967) was a 20th-century historian of [[Anglo-Saxon England]], and president of the [[Royal Historical Society]] (1937–1945).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/historians/stenton_frank.html Institute of Historical Research, Summary]; [http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/aboutus.htm Royal Historical Society, 'About Us'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209163942/http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/aboutus.htm |date=2010-02-09 }}. Retrieved 19 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was educated at [[Keble College, Oxford]], and was elected an [[Oxbridge Fellow|Honorary Fellow]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Keble College Centenary Register 1870–1970
|editor=Drennan, Basil St G.|year=1970|publisher=Keble College, Oxford|isbn=978-0-85033-048-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was the author of ''Anglo-Saxon England'', a volume of the [[Oxford History of England]], first published in 1943 and widely considered a classic history of the period. He delivered the [[Ford Lectures]] at [[Oxford University]] in 1929.

Stenton was a professor of history at the [[University of Reading]] (1926–1946), and subsequently the university's vice-chancellor (1946–1950). During his period as vice-chancellor at Reading, he presided over the university's purchase of [[Whiteknights Park]], creating the new campus that allowed for the expansion of the university in later decades. In November 2008, it was announced that a new hall of residence to be constructed on that campus would be named Stenton Hall, in his honour.&lt;ref name=frankstent&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.reading.ac.uk/bulletin/pdfs/489.pdf | title = University of Reading Bulletin (20 November 2008) | publisher = University of Reading | page = 3 | accessdate = 2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2018}} The annual Stenton Lecture, given by an eminent historian, was inaugurated at Reading University in 1967.&lt;ref name=Reading_Uni&gt;{{cite web |title=Stenton Lecture |website=University of Reading, Dept. of History |url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/history/research/hist-stentonlectures.aspx |accessdate=4 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the [[1948 New Year Honours]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38161 |supp=y|page=2|date=30 December 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received the [[accolade]] from [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] at Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38207|pages=1035–1036|date=13 February 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Doris Mary Stenton]], wrote a preface to the third edition of ''Anglo-Saxon England'', published after his death, and edited ''Preparatory to Anglo-Saxon England Being the Collected Papers of Frank Merry Stenton'', published in 1970. She was an historian in her own right, producing ''English Society in the Early Middle Ages'' for the [[Pelican Books|Pelican]] History of England, and ''The English Woman in History'' (1957).&lt;ref name=Reading_Uni /&gt;

Stenton's papers, together with those of his wife Lady Doris Stenton, their library and his coin collection are part of the special collections at Reading University.

'''''Geograficus''''' is a 2003 educational adventure video game, developed by [[Ruske &amp; Pühretmaier]] and published by&lt;big&gt; &lt;/big&gt;[[Heureka-Klett]] (up until 2005) and BrainGame Publishing (from 2005 after acquiring H-K's edutainment catalogue). The game was originally released in Germany.

== History ==
The game, along with a video game in the [[Willy Werkel]] series entitled ''[[Willy Werkel baut Raumschiffe]]'', were used at [[Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus]] in a 2005 program entitled "Expedition Earth" which encourages children to learn about geography through the interactive media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pfh-bundesallee.de/Seiten/Betreuungsangebote/Projekt_Expedition_Erde_2005.htm|title=Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus {{!}} Projekt  Expedition Erde|website=www.pfh-bundesallee.de|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is similar to that of video game [[Myst]], in which players traverse through a series of static screens in a retro science-fiction setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1tfvAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22Geograficus%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VOtfcbNZ1g&amp;sig=_2e7Oe1UP8KTfPfJ72PQZa9bcjw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJosDB5KHYAhVIw7wKHVRtAKc4KBDoAQhZMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Geograficus%22&amp;f=false|title=Affective and Emotional Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction: Game-Based and Innovative Learning Approaches|last=Pivec|first=M.|date=2006-03-02|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=9781607501497|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game aims to teach players about the Earth's physical [[geography]] and history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventure-archiv.com/g/geograficusreviewe.htm|title=Geograficus - Review english|last=slydos|website=www.adventure-archiv.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has an internal interactive encyclopedia that contains scientific information and clues on how to complete the puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rus-game.net/Geograficus%20%5BRUS%5D%20%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8C%20%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE.html|title=Geograficus [RUS] скачать бесплатно|website=rus-game.net|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The young protagonist Geo is tasked by the wise scientist Geograficus to locate the whereabouts of Balvin, a fire dragon who has gone missing.

== Critical reception ==
''[[Adventure Archiv]]'' questioned the choice to set an educational game in a fantasy world with dragons and magic, noting that the logic and physics of such worlds conflict with that of the real world thereby offering a confused message to players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventure-archiv.com/g/geograficusreviewe.htm|title=Geograficus - Review english|last=slydos|website=www.adventure-archiv.com|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Angel Adventure'' thought the game was both captivating and beautiful,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040409120656/http://angels-adventure.de/album1_059.htm|title=Geograficus Review|date=2004-04-09|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Kinderuni Darmstadt]]'' described it as interesting and logical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kinderuni-darmstadt.de/8004-lernadventure-im-test-geograficus-das-abenteuerspiel-aus-der-welt-der-geografie.html|title=Lernadventure im Test: Geograficus - Das Abenteuerspiel aus der Welt der Geografie|website=kinderuni-darmstadt.de|language=de|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wissen.de]]'' gave the game a rating of 3/5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wissen.de/geograficus|title=Geograficus {{!}} wissen.de|last=Leinfelden-Echterdingen|first=Konradin Medien GmbH,|website=www.wissen.de|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macwelt thought the game's graphics or control did not live up to contemporary adventure games such as ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'' (2003) or ''[[Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macwelt.de/news/Rezension-Lernadventure-Geograficus-2856655.html|title=Rezension: Lernadventure 'Geograficus'|last=Hartmann|first=Thomas|work=Macwelt|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macwelt.de/news/Schoene-Bilder-2856661.html|title=Schöne Bilder|last=Hartmann|first=Thomas|work=Macwelt|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lizzy Net wrote that the game made good use of its educational content and made it palatable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lizzynet.de/wws/5207332.php|title=LizzyNet.de - Geograficus|website=www.lizzynet.de|language=de|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article ''Computer games in geography lessons: Learning does not always mean memorizing and timpani'', Christina Bulow concluded that the program would not make a good classroom companion due to the high time investment required and the inefficiency of its educational-content delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505051651/http://websquare.imb-uni-augsburg.de/2010-04/4|title=Computerspiele im Geographieunterricht {{!}} w.e.b.Square|date=2013-05-05|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was awarded the 2004 Comenius Seal of Quality,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100000133/100476388&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2004 GIGA mouse award for best educational game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediengewalt.de/spiele/beste-lernspiele-kinder-12-jahre.shtml|title=Beste Lernspiele für Kinder ab 12 Jahre (und andere Altersgruppen)|website=www.mediengewalt.de|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1746">'''Grid north''' is a [[navigation]]al term referring to the direction northwards along the grid lines of a [[map projection]].  It is contrasted with [[true north]] (the direction of the [[North Pole]]) and [[magnetic north]] (the direction in which a compass needle points). Many [[topographic map]]s, including those of the [[United States Geological Survey]] and Great Britain's [[Ordnance Survey]], indicate the difference between grid north, true north, and magnetic north.

The grid lines on Ordnance Survey maps divide the UK into one-kilometre squares, east of an imaginary zero point in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Cornwall. The grid lines point to a Grid North, varying slightly from True North. This variation is zero on the central meridian (north-south line) of the map, which is at two degrees West of the [[Prime Meridian]], and greatest at the map edges. The difference between grid north and true north is very small and can be ignored for most navigation purposes. The difference exists because the correspondence between a flat map and the round Earth is necessarily imperfect.

At the [[South Pole]], grid north conventionally points northwards along the [[Prime Meridian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/cara/movpole.html "Moving the South Pole"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716140440/http://quest.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/cara/movpole.html |date=2011-07-16 }}, NASA Quest&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the meridians converge at the poles, true east and west directions change rapidly in a condition similar to [[gimbal lock]]. Grid north solves this problem.

Below is description of the characters in the 1990s [[BBC]] British sitcom ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]''.

==Richie &amp; Eddie==

'''Richard 'Richie' Richard''' ([[Rik Mayall]]) is a perpetually optimistic dimwit. His character is aspirational and occasionally a snob. Richie usually wears a white shirt tucked into his Y-fronts and vintage black tie with tie clip, blue jeans with a belt that clearly misses most of the loops and has a light brown raincoat when outdoors. He also occasionally wears brown trousers held up with braces, a red tie and he also wears white and pink striped pyjamas.

Richie is a virgin, and Eddie stole Richie's only ever 'girlfriend', Ethel Cardew, and sometimes torments Richie with how he had sex with her. Although in the episode "Terror", in series three, Eddie looks distinctly nervous when he claims that the Devil drinks virgin's blood. In the episode "Digger", Richie almost has sex with a foreign countess, Lady Natasha Letitia Sarah Jane Wellesley Obstromsky Ponsonsky Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Oblomov Boblomov Dob, after he and Eddie join a dating agency. Natasha agrees to marry Richie, much to his disbelief and delight, and he is naively oblivious to the fact that she is marrying him because she thinks he is a millionaire and she has lost her entire fortune. Towards the end of the episode, Richie moves in to have sex with Lady Natasha, but unfortunately he becomes so nervous that he has a heart attack and is rushed to hospital. Whilst inside the ambulance, Eddie claims to have had sex with Lady Natasha. But again this was before the episode with the discussion of the Devil drinking virgin's blood, so it is almost certain that Eddie is only saying this to torment Richie. Eddie also informs Richie that it was not his heart that gave way but it was a result of his dodgy surgery to remove his kidney.

Richie possesses a domestic characteristic as he wears a blue and pink rimmed apron whenever he is doing housework such as cooking and ironing. His naïve quality makes him unsure of the decade, claiming, in the episode "Carnival", that it is both the 80s and then 70s later on with a bemused Eddie looking to the camera, after Richie mentions it is the 80s after all. Despite what has been said in some episodes, Richie quite often demonstrates strong religious beliefs; when an issue threatening him should come up one of the first things he does is pray and attempts to make a deal with God. He also believes that the dictionary was written by Jesus. In the episode "Terror" along with Spudgun ([[Steven O'Donnell (actor)|Steve O'Donnell]]), Dave Hedgehog ([[Christopher Ryan]]) and Eddie, Richie also prayed to the Devil in the hope of raising him so that he could get his heart's desires granted. However, despite Richie's flaws, he has been shown to be kinder and more generous with money than Eddie; while Eddie constantly swindles Richie out of money at every opportunity he can, when Richie wanted to form a relationship with the queen he said he would split the money between himself, the queen and Eddie. Also before a suicide attempt Richie genuinely thanked Eddie for being his friend. Throughout the series Richie displays occasional elements of anxiety such as in the episode "Break", he insists on sitting in silence staring at a clock waiting for his and Eddie's holiday to start despite their coach not being scheduled to arrive for another seven hours. In ''[[Guest House Paradiso]]'', he goes by the name '''Richard Twat''', which he insists is pronounced "Thwaite".

'''Edward 'Eddie' Elizabeth Hitler''' ([[Ade Edmondson|Adrian Edmondson]]) is a cheerfully violent [[dipsomaniac]]. He wears glasses akin to those of [[Eric Morecambe]], a worn out brown suit and a white shirt with a black spotted tie. Despite having a shaven head, he sports sideburns. He also has a brown trilby hat and a tweed coat. Eddie has two other friends, sad-cases named Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog who mostly hang out together, though Dave is also a family man. (His wife Susan is never seen, but his daughter Doreen appeared once in the episode "Terror".) While Richie does not appear to have any other friends besides Eddie, he does appropriate Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog if in need of company. Eddie is also revealed to be a [[Queen's Park Rangers]] fan: in the episode "Holy", he sprayed the letters 'QPR' on the wall with spray snow; and in "Dough", there are QPR banners on his bedroom wall. He has been shown to break the fourth wall a few times in the series when giving looks or speaking directly to the audience. Oddly enough, some of the men in Eddie's family have girls' names, as his middle name is Elizabeth and he once referred to having a 'Great Uncle Susan' who fought ''"on both sides, depending on which way he was facing"'' during the first world war. Eddie is shown to have quite varying degrees of mechanical expertise, for instance he is able to build a fully functioning printing press within a week and a treadmill powered by a motorbike in a matter of hours, yet it takes him an entire year to set up a domestic recorder.

More of Eddie's and Richie's relatives are often mentioned. Such as Richie's grandfather who was at the Battle of the Somme, while Eddie's uncle used to work in a prison, but really a prisoner peeling potatoes, sewing mailbags and doing ''... "anything they told him to do"''. Richie's wealthy aunt Olga left him a small sum of money in her will, whilst his other aunt Mabel used to own the flat. Richie's father, Oswald Richard, was an acquaintance of Eddie. According to Richie, his father moved in mysterious circles, because he had one leg shorter than the other. Richie's sister lives near [[Hammersmith]] and apparently looks just like her brother, albeit 'with smaller jugs'. Eddie's mother was a wrestler named 'Eddie',&lt;ref&gt;From the episode "[[Digger (Bottom)|Digger]]": Lily: Any relation? Eddie: Well, I've got a mother. Lily: No, no no no, I. Eddie: Yes, that's her!&lt;/ref&gt; who abandoned him when he was young, leaving him her old service revolver and a note saying 'Please look after my baby, I can't be bothered.' Given the unusual naming traditions of the Hitler family it is possible male children are given female middle names while females have male middle names. In ''Guest House Paradiso'', he goes by the name '''Eddie Ndingombaba'''.

===Character analysis===

Despite sharing a mutual dislike, Richie and Eddie are eternally entwined together due to their basic flaws and they seem to have an unspoken care and need for each other as a result, having been friends for 25 years. Both have called each other best friends and Richie has referred to them as "the guys!" on more than one occasion. Richie tolerates Eddie's drunken behaviour and likewise Eddie tolerates Richie's pompous attitude. Eddie's alcoholism and violent nature mean that he has not been able to hold down a steady job since his very short-lived career as a '[[Playboy Bunny|bunny girl]]' back in 1978 that lasted ten minutes and it is unlikely that any landlord would grant him tenancy, even if he could afford the rent. He therefore relies heavily upon Richie's charity. On the other hand, Richie can be very presumptuous and is constantly libidinous, and without Eddie he is unlikely to ever make another friend. The two have an unspoken acceptance of their interdependence and their relationship tends to fluctuate between acting like a married couple from filling in the crossword together and a mother and son relationship with Richie putting an unconscious, drunken Eddie to bed every night. Both Richie and Eddie have died in numerous episodes, only to resurface unharmed the following episode. This partnership has similarities to those of the two title characters in ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', and [[Tony Hancock]] and [[Sid James]] in ''[[Hancock's Half Hour]]''.

Richie becomes overly excited at the prospect of anything good happening and by comparison, Eddie is quite grounded in himself at least when he is sober. There is some debate over who is the most intelligent of the two. Richie considers Eddie 'the stupid one', however, Eddie appears to have quite good general knowledge. He can play chess and spends several hours trying unsuccessfully, to teach Richie. Also Eddie appears to have a greater knowledge of popular culture and the arts than Richie, as he knows a fair amount about [[Napoleon]] and [[Wellington]] (who Richie claims invented the Chelsea Boot), and also appears well versed in the works of [[Vivaldi]] (whom Richie believes to be a football player). However, Richie is usually quick to spot the flaws in Eddie's latest schemes, such as when he noticed how terribly unconvincing his forged money looked in the episode "Dough". Also Richie can read, whereas Eddie rarely spells words correctly including his own name. Another example was the word 'scythe', when Richie pointed it out to him in the dictionary he thought it spelt the word 'zither' and he was also unaware of what a debt was. Both Richie and Eddie frequently use double-entendres either purposely as a joke or it is misinterpreted by the other.

The arguments between Richie and Eddie often lead to exaggerated and destructive fight scenes. Some have likened this to a live action cartoon. However, the boisterousness is somewhat more graphic: examples include heads slammed in and under refrigerators; hands stapled to tables; legs being chainsawed off; genitalia slammed in doors or set on fire; fingers cut off; televisions smashed over heads; darts, forks, or fingers ending up in eyes; faces shoved in camp fires; legs broken or teeth knocked out. Some of the visual effects used for these events are very realistic, whereas others are deliberately fake. All are accompanied by a variety of over-the-top sound effects. The [[BBFC]] has given the Bottom: The Complete Series DVD a classification of 15, with a violence rating of 'None'.

Both Richie and Eddie share many of the qualities that their [[The Young Ones (TV series)|Young Ones]] characters Rick and Vyvyan possess. The fights that Richie and Eddie have are not dissimilar to the ones Rick and Vyvyan have. Eddie has a violent nature that Vyvyan strongly possesses, and Richie like Rick believes himself to be more popular and intelligent than he really is. Although Vyvyan is not a heavy alcoholic like Eddie is, he appears to be the only one of the Young Ones who enjoys alcohol. His favourite drink being either vodka or babycham. Certain jokes that appeared in the Young Ones have also appeared in Bottom on a couple of occasions; for example, in the Young Ones episode "Oil", Vyvyan hit Rick in the crotch with a cricket bat to which Rick replied ''"Ha! Ha! Missed both my legs!"'' Eddie does the same thing to Richie who responds with the same line in the first and second of the [[Bottom Live]] performances. Eddie has on more than one occasion mocked Richie for being a virgin, and throughout most of the Young Ones episode "Time", Vyvyan taunted Rick for being a virgin to which Rick repeatedly denies. However, both Eddie and Vyvyan are believed to be virgins too. In the Bottom episode "Terror", Eddie believed that the [[Devil]] drinks virgins' blood, but immediately after he said this he looked worried. In the Young Ones episode "Nasty", a [[vampire]] was loose in the students' house and Vyvyan smugly stated that he was not worried because he believed that vampires only attack virgins. However, only moments after he said this he muttered under his breath that he hoped ''"snogging with SPG counts"''. Another similarity between Eddie and Vyvyan is that neither of them know who their biological fathers are. In the final Bottom Live performance, while they are travelling through their time machine, Richie suggests doing some old material and impersonates Rick. Eddie obliges to this and takes on Vyvyan's persona to which Richie joked that Eddie has not changed his material very much.

==Recurring characters==

* '''Spudgun''' ([[Steve O'Donnell (actor)|Steve O'Donnell]]): One of Eddie's slobbish and unemployable friends. His nickname comes from a trick he can do involving a potato, although according to Eddie it's not something most people would want to see.
* '''Dave Hedgehog''' ([[Christopher Ryan]]): One of Eddie's friends. While "Hedgehog" appears to be his actual surname, he also can do a trick involving an actual hedgehog. As seen in "[[Terror (Bottom)|Terror]]", he is married, and has a daughter by the name of Doreen - who is remarkably calm when dealing with Richie and Eddie, despite them mistaking her for Satan. Dave's wife's name is Susan as mentioned in "[[Holy (Bottom)|Holy]]", although it takes him a while to recall her name.
* '''Richard "Dick" Head''' ([[Lee Cornes]]): The landlord of the Lamb and Flag, Richie and Eddie's regular pub. Dick is one that usually doesn't get on well with both Richie and Eddie, because of the arguments over the tabs and payments for alcohol. Ignorant of his own field e.g. pronounces the 'd' in [[Pernod Ricard|Pernod]]. His appearances were in "[[Smells (Bottom)|Smells]]", "[[Parade (Bottom)|Parade]]" and "[[Dough (Bottom)|Dough]]". 
* '''Mr. Harrison''' ([[Roger Sloman]]): Richie and Eddie's flat landlord and shopkeeper. His only appearances were in "[['s Up]]" and "[[Holy (Bottom)|Holy]]". In the latter episode, Harrison is shown to have a daughter named Valerie and a grandson named Johnny.

*'''Veronica Head''' ([[Julia Sawalha]]): The beautiful young barmaid at the Lamb and Flag, whom Richie tries to woo by boasting of his false adventures during the [[Falklands War]]. She later turns out to be the niece of Dick Head and has been conspiring against Richie from the start. She only appeared in the episode ''[[Parade (Bottom episode)|Parade]]''.
*'''Lady Natasha Letitia Sarah Jane Wellesley Obstromsky Ponsonsky Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Smythe Oblomov Boblomov Dob, Third [[Viscount|Viscountess]] of [[Moldavia]]''' ([[Helen Lederer]]): A foreign countess Richie met through Lily Linneker's Love Bureau. Richie posed as the Duke of [[Kidderminster]] to secure a date with her. She agreed to marry him and unwittingly admitted that she'd lost her entire fortune in a civil war and had to marry soon lest she be penniless forever. She appears in the episode ''[[Digger (Bottom episode)|Digger]]'', The actress Helen Lederer also briefly appears as a nurse in the episode Apocalypse.
*'''Mr. N. Stiles''' ([[Robert Llewellyn]]): N. Stiles is a Falklands ex-serviceman who was in the Lamb and Flag, asking questions to Richie about his false adventures in the Falklands. Richie and Eddie discover he has a valuable wooden leg and decide to steal it and take to the pawn shop to bet on a horse. He appears in ''[[Parade (Bottom episode)|Parade]]''.
*'''Lil Potato''' ([[Patsy Rowlands]]): Spudgun's mother. Appears in ''[[Parade (Bottom episode)|Parade]]''.
*'''"Skullcrusher" Henderson''' ([[Nick Scott (actor)|Nick Scott]]): The most prolific [[counterfeit money|currency forger]] in London, although this is more down to his tendency to crush the skulls of any rivals than the quality of his forgeries (which feature [[Danny La Rue]] in place of the Queen). Richie and Eddie fell afoul of Skullcrusher and had to pay a £5,000 tribute in order to escape having their skulls crushed; unfortunately they tried to pay Skullcrusher with his own forged cash, and got their skulls crushed anyway. Appeared in ''[[Dough (Bottom episode)|Dough]]''.
*'''"Cannonball" Taffy O'Jones''' (voiced by [[Kevin Allen (actor)|Kevin Allen]]):  Insane Welsh cricketer.  After a deliberate bowl to Richie's forehead, Richie and Eddie steal his car and steal his honeymoon. Taffy follows them however, and gets revenge with another pair of bowls to Richie and Eddie's foreheads. He never appears on-screen, but is heard off-camera sporting a heavy Welsh accent in ''[[Finger (Bottom episode)|Finger]]''.
*'''Harry The Bastard/Ted Nugent''' ([[Brian Croucher]]): Mean spirited pawnbroker who knowingly and brazenly offers prices for items proffered at well below their true worth.  Examples include 7 pence for a house and £1.50 for an engraved wooden leg he acknowledges to be worth at least £2500. He appears in ''[[Parade (Bottom episode)|Parade]]''. Another character named "Harry the Bastard" appeared in Mayall and Edmondson's [[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]], though he was played by [[Alexei Sayle]].
*'''Mr Tent''' (Rupert Bates): A [[Streaking|streaker]] who stalked Richie and Eddie while camping out in Wimbledon Common, as part of a bet in [['S Out]]. He is first seen in the daytime flashing, then at night performing sexual simulations on their tent, while undoing the zip. This only causes the tent covering to be caught in his penis, making him run off withering in pain during a rainstorm as Eddie zipped the tent back up.
*'''Video Repair Man''' (uncredited): Makes a brief appearance in ''[[Carnival (Bottom episode)|Carnival]]'' after Eddie blows up a VCR he took almost a year to set up. After repairing the machine Eddie offers him a box of [[Malibu rum|Malibu]] in lieu of cash, only to send him flying down the stairs and possibly injuring him by pulling a lever.
*'''Gas Man''' ([[Mark Lambert (Irish actor)|Mark Lambert]]): Appears in ''[[Gas (Bottom episode)|Gas]]'' in which he visits Richie and Eddie's flat to read their gas meter only to find the reading is all zeros. As their next door neighbour Mr Rottweiler is up next, Richie and Eddie decide to keep the Gas Man in the flat until his time to clock off for the night arrives, as they have been stealing gas from Rottweiler hence the meter reading. By doing this they force-feed him cold tea while pretending they do not know what gas is, only to knock him out with a frying pan as he tries to leave. The Gas Man later wakes up with a headache while Richie and Eddie try to throw him out of a window onto the roof of the next bus. Although his shift is over, the Gas Man proceeds to check Mr Rottweiler's meter, despite or perhaps due to his tremendous head injuries.
*'''Mr. Rottweiler''' ([[Brian Glover]]): Richie and Eddie's violent neighbour who appears in ''[[Gas (Bottom)|Gas]]''. Richie and Eddie were stealing gas from their neighbour with an illegal gas link, only to try and disconnect it by smashing his wall down while he is asleep with his girlfriend for the night.
*'''Doreen Hedgehog''' ([[Lisa Coleman (actress)|Lisa Coleman]]): Appears in ''[[Terror (Bottom)|Terror]]''. Doreen is Dave's daughter who comes to the flat where she is mistaken for being The Devil by the others due to wearing a devil mask but after taking it off she reveals that she has been sent to collect her father as her mother doesn't like him being out after midnight.
*'''Valerie Bates''': Appears in ''Holy'' is Mr. Harrison's daughter. After her mother has a heart attack, she leaves her son Johnny with her father, but he ends up on Richie and Eddie's doorstep causing them, Dave Hedgehog and Spudgun into thinking he's the son of God. After returning, Valerie sees that Johnny is hungry and prepares to breast feed him in the flat by unbuttoning her top, much to Richie and Eddie's delight.
*'''Johnny Bates''': Appears in ''Holy'' is Mr. Harrison's baby grandson. He is mistakenly left on Richie and Eddie's doorstep after his mother Valerie leaves to be with her mother who had a heart attack. After finding him, Richie, Eddie, Dave Hedgehog and Spudgun mistake Johnny for being the son of God until Harrison arrives and reveals that Johnny is his grandson just moments before Valerie arrives and prepares to breast feed Johnny by unbuttoning her top, much to Richie and Eddie's delight.

==Characters mentioned only==
*'''Ethel Cardew:''' Ethel Cardew is a woman (implied in ''Terror'' to be transsexual) that both Eddie and Richie frequently mention in their conversations. Richie has tried to woo her unsuccessfully (by one occasion pretending to be the captain of a ship, only for her to walk away with the arresting officer), deluding himself into believing that she was his fiancé, though it seemed that she preferred Eddie over Richie and slept with him leaving Richie rather unsettled whenever the topic is brought up. However, it would appear that Eddie and Ethel are no longer on speaking terms, due to the events only described as the "superglue incident".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31504">Beginning with [[Pixar]]'s second film ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', all subsequent [[list of Pixar films|Pixar feature films]], except ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'', have been shown in theaters along with a Pixar-created original [[short film]], known as a "short." Other Pixar shorts, released only on home media, were created to showcase what Pixar can do (either technologically or cinematically), or were created specifically for a client.

Pixar's ideas and technical capabilities have developed by producing shorts since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haswell|first=Helen|date=2014|title=To Infinity and Back Again: Hand-drawn Aesthetic and Affection for the Past in Pixar's Pioneering Animation|journal=Alphaville: Journal of Film and Screen Media|volume=|issue=8|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first shorts were made while Pixar was still a computer hardware company, when [[John Lasseter]] was the only professional [[animator]] in the company's tiny animation department. Starting with ''[[Geri's Game]]'', after Pixar had turned into an [[animation studio]], all later shorts have been produced with a larger crew and budget.

In 1991, Pixar made four [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] shorts produced for the TV series ''[[Sesame Street]]''. The shorts illustrates different weights and directions starring [[Luxo Jr.]] and Luxo — ''[[Light &amp; Heavy (film)|Light &amp; Heavy]]'' (1990), ''[[Surprise (1991 film)|Surprise]]'' (1991), ''Up and Down'' (1993), and ''Front and Back'' (1994).&lt;ref name="disneyfilmguide.page.tl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney Shorts: 1990ies|url=http://disneyfilmguide.page.tl/Disney-Shorts-d--1990ies.htm|publisher=Disney Film Guide|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, beginning with ''A Bug's Life'', Pixar has created extra content for each of their films that is not part of the main story. For their early theatrical releases, this content was in the form of [[outtakes]] and appeared as part of the [[motion picture credits|film's credits]]. For each of their films, this content was a short made exclusively for the DVD release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walt Disney Pictures Presentation of a Pixar Animation Studios Film, THE INCREDIBLES, Sells Five Million Units on DVD and Video in First Day |url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/20050317-158204.htm |accessdate=June 8, 2012 |newspaper=Pixar |date=March 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230141346/http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/20050317-158204.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{World city population tables}}
A [[city proper]] is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of local government.&lt;ref name="wup2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=6 |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2007 Revision Population Database |publisher=Esa.un.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822053414/http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=6 |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbanNotes.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division – Demographic and Social Statistics |publisher=Millenniumindicators.un.org |date= |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Demographic Yearbook 2005, Volume 57|year=2008 |publisher= United Nations|isbn=92-1-051099-2 |page= 2; 756 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OwfGJtkpCbwC&amp;pg=PA241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs, while in other instances may include non-contiguous urban settlements apart from the central urban settlement(s).&lt;ref name="wup2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision |year=2004 |publisher= United Nations|isbn=92-1-151396-0 &lt;!-- This is the correct ISBN. The number on the copyright page of the book is invalid. --&gt; |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxOAckK2stYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''World Urbanization Prospects'', a [[United Nations|UN]] publication, defines population of a city proper as "the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority." The book continues to say that "city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives."&lt;ref name="wup2003" /&gt; This definition does not give an accurate picture of the [[List of urban areas by population|urban area]] or [[List of metropolitan areas by population|metropolitan area]] of cities. Using this strictly administrative definition, many cities will be included on this list that are smaller than their urban area. However, many Chinese cities included govern territories that extend well beyond the traditional "city proper" into suburban and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Ruth|title=The world's biggest cities: How do you measure them?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16761784|date=29 January 2012|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Ankara Province|Metropolitan municipality-province]]&lt;ref&gt;The province of Ankara is divided into twenty five districts, administered by the Metropolitan Municipality of Ankara. The city proper (urban area) of Ankara is generally considered to be formed by eight districts (Sincan, Yenimahalle, Etimesgut, Keçiören, Pursaklar, Altındağ, Mamak, Çankaya).

This is a '''list of notable companies based in Ireland''', or subsidiaries according to their sector. It includes companies from the entire island. The state of the [[Republic of Ireland]] covers five-sixths of the island, with [[Northern Ireland]], part of the [[United Kingdom]], covering the remainder in the north-east. Each has separate regulatory and registration authorities.

==About companies in Ireland==
Irish [[corporation|companies]] fall into three categories:

* [[Private company limited by shares|Private limited companies]], which carry the suffix "Limited" (Ltd) or "Teoranta" (Teo), and whose shares are privately held.
* [[Public limited company|Public limited companies]], which carry the suffix "plc" or "{{abbr|cpt|cuideachta phoiblí theoranta}}" and whose shares may be listed on a stock exchange. Where this is the case, it is noted in this article.
* [[Private company limited by guarantee|Company Limited by Guarantee]], this type of company has members, not shareholders, as such generally limited to trade associations and not-for-profit bodies.

Companies in the Republic of Ireland must be registered with the [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]], and comply with the provisions of the ''Companies Acts''. Companies in Northern Ireland must be registered with the [[Department for the Economy]]'s Companies Registry. Certain Northern Ireland organisations are dealt with on a UK-wide basis and are dealt with by [[Companies House]].

Some entries on this list may be ''statutory corporations'' - a business form governed by a board appointed by an [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government]] minister under a particular piece of legislation - not formally companies as such, but are effectively treated as such and are included on this list as they are usually large business. For more details on this form of governance, see [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state-sponsored bodies of Ireland]].

Some [[Mutual organization|mutual]] bodies, such as [[building society|building societies]], are also included on this list.

Some entries such as [[Three Ireland]] and [[Intel Ireland]] are subsidiaries of foreign companies.

[[Mineralogy]] is an active science in which [[mineral]]s are discovered or recognised on a regular basis. Use of old mineral names is also discontinued, for example when a name is no longer considered valid. Therefore, a list of recognised mineral species is never complete. 

Minerals are distinguished by various chemical and physical properties. Differences in chemical composition and crystal structure distinguish the various ''species''. Within a mineral species there may be variation in physical properties or minor amounts of impurities that are recognized by mineralogists or wider society as a mineral ''variety''.

The [[International Mineralogical Association]] (IMA) is the international group that recognises new minerals and new mineral names.  However, minerals discovered before 1959 did not go through the official naming procedure. Some minerals published previously have been either confirmed or discredited since that date. This list contains a mixture of mineral names that have been approved since 1959 and those mineral names believed to still refer to valid mineral species (these are called "grandfathered" species). Presently, each year about 50-60 new mineral species are officially approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification (CNMNC) of the International Mineralogical Association.&lt;ref name=CNMNC2007&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Elements |year=2007 |volume=3 |page=360 |url=http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ima-cnmnc/missingminerals.doc |title=Missing Minerals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

**"*" – discredited (IMA/CNMNC status).
**"s.p." – special procedure. 
**&lt;sup&gt;Q&lt;/sup&gt; or "?" – questionable/doubtful (IMA/CNMNC, mindat.org or mineralienatlas.de status).
**&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; – published without approval of the IMA/CNMNC, or just not an IMA approved mineral but with some acceptance in the scientific community nowadays. The 'IMA database of mineral properties' (rruff.info/ima) has 173 species with 'not an IMA approved mineral' tag, some are an intermediate member of a [[solid solution]] series, others are "recently" discredited minerals.&lt;ref name="rruff" /&gt;
**&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; – intermediate member of a solid-solution series.
**&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt; – hypothetical mineral (synthetic, anthropogenic, etc.)
***&lt;sup&gt;ch&lt;/sup&gt; – incomplete description, hypothetical solid solution end member. Published without approval and formally discredited or not approved, yet.
**** Mainly: [[pyrochlore]], [[tourmaline]] and [[amphibole]] supergroups, [[List of minerals (synonyms)#Arrojadite group|arrojadite]], and [[yftisite-(Y)]]. IMA/CNMNC revisions generate hypothetical solid solution [[endmember]]s.
**group  – a name used to designate a group of species, sometimes only a mineral group name.

== Clockwork ==

* The name of a new mineral is an IMA secret until it is approved or until its full description is published, its authors' option (approved decision: 'IMA2009-D').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minerals approved in 2010|url=http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ima-cnmnc/newminerals2010.pdf|publisher=IMA/ CNMNC|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMA uses a code for its own procedures for the supposed new mineral (and so it is a synonym). Ferri-ottoliniite's proposal was assigned code 'IMA2001-067', it was redefined and approved as 'IMA2001-067a' in 2003, for instance (the ottoliniite root name is discredited since 2012).&lt;ref name="hawthorne2012" /&gt;
* Current IMA regulations do not allow substances of anthropogenic origin (burning coal mine dumps, coal mine fires, slag, etc.) to be validated as a mineral species. Since 1998, the majority of [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s (especially polytypes and polytypoids) are not regarded as separate mineral species anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=The Canadian Mineralogist |title=The IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names: Procedures and Guidelines on Mineral Nomenclature, 1998 |year=1998 |last1=Nickel |first1=Ernest H. |last2=Grice |first2=Joel D. |volume=36 |url=http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/ima-cnmnc/cnmmn98.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* IMA/CNMNC identifiers are usually written without space, as years don't get meaningful hits on Google search.
* "The System of Mineralogy of James Dwight Dana and Edward Salisbury Dana" (8 ed.) was the reference of CNMNC/CNMMN's (IMA) initial work. At the [[Kobe]] 2006 general meeting, the IMA council endorsed the creation of an Internet site on minerals ('rruff.info/ima'). So a Master List was needed and the older minerals were reviewed in a document of 130 pages. The final GQN List was published (grandfathered, questionable and published without approval) after a final review of Burke E A J and Nickel E H (approved decision: 'IMA2006-C'). Not only the well established minerals before 1959 was grandfathered (G), but the minerals that could not be discredited as well. The merging of the 'ARD List' (approved, revalidated and discredited) with the 'GQN List' resulted in the first 'IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names'. The 2007 draft of the 'IMA/CNMNC List of Mineral Names' was a courtesy of the Materials Data, Inc.

* The IMA was founded in a meeting in Madrid (1958). The CNMMN (now CNMNC) was one of the original eight commissions, it was founded in 1959. Not all grandfathered mineral were first described prior to 1959.

*** Tellurocanfieldite was conditionally approved as 'IMA2012-013'. Its approval was withdrawn as further studies showed it to be a Te-rich variety of [[canfieldite]] (Y: 1894, 2.BA.70).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-42786.html Mindat.org - Tellurocanfieldite]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some old minerals were known before their 20th century names were first published.

== Curiosities ==
* Current regulations do not allow a new mineral name to honour a person a second time. But there are exceptions: [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779–1848) ([[berzelianite]], [[berzeliite]] and berzeline (now [[haüyne]])); [[Pierre Berthier]] (1782–1861) ([[berthierine]] and [[berthierite]]); [[Andor von Semsey]] (1833–1923) ([[andorite]] IV, andorite VI and [[semseyite]]); [[Brian Harold Mason]] (1917–2009) ([[brianite]] and [[stenhuggarite]]); [[Caleb Wroe Wolfe]] (1908–1980) ([[wolfeite]] and [[wroewolfeite]]) and [[Leo Neal Yedlin]] (1908–1977) ([[yedlinite]] and [[nealite]]). The regulation does not affect mineral series and other variations (prefix iso, hexa, ortho, tetra, clino, meta, para, pseudo etc.). For instance: [[Karl Hugo Strunz]] (1910–2006) ([[strunzite]] group); [[George P. Merrill]] (1854–1929) ([[merrillite]] series, [[whitlockite]] group); [[Edward S. Grew]] (Ph.D. 1971) ([[edgrewite]] series, [[humite]] group).
*[[Standard temperature and pressure]] (STP).
** [[Silicate perovskite]]s, [[argentite]] and β-quartz are not valid minerals, as they do not occur on Earth's surface (STP). The type material of [[bridgmanite]] is from a meteorite. Some minerals are unstable on Earth's surface ([[metastability]]): [[diamond]]s, [[cohenite]] and [[haxonite]], for instance. [[Acanthite]] var. argentite (a [[pseudomorph]] after argentite) and β-quartz pseudomorphs are sometimes sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mineralienatlas.de/lexikon/index.php/MineralData?lang=en&amp;language=english&amp;mineral=Argentit Argentit (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Attention with the [[amphiboles]]: some mineral names have been redefined (IMA2012 s.p. was the last revision), some even more than once; i.e. their chemical formula range changed.&lt;ref name="hawthorne2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Frank C. Hawthorne, Roberta Oberti, George E. Harlow, Walter V. Maresch, Robert F. Martin, John C. Schumacher, Mark D. Welch |title=Nomenclature of the amphibole supergroup |journal=American Mineralogist |year=2012 |volume=97 |pages=2031–2048 |doi=10.2138/am.2012.4276}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, aluminotaramite ('IMA2006-023', 9.DE.20) is a synonym of [[ferro-taramite]], sodic-ferri-ferropedrizite (IMA2003 s.p., 9.DE.25) was renamed to [[ferro-ferri-pedrizite]], ehimeite is a synonym of [[chromio-pargasite]] ('IMA2011-023', 9.DE.15), kôzulite is a synonym of [[mangano-arfvedsonite]] ('IMA1968-028', 9.DE.25) and kornite is a synonym of [[potassic-mangani-leakeite]] ('IMA1992-032', 9.DE.25).
*Some IMA-CNMNC approved minerals have a questionable status on mineralienatlas.de, but their unit cell parameters are given on mindat.org (or vice versa). Their status here doesn't change, it remains 'approved mineral'.
*The mineral systematic given on Nickel-Strunz (9 and 10 ed) is not controversial. [[Dmisteinbergite]] ([[feldspar]], 9.EG.15), uranyl sorovanadates (4.HD. ids) and silica family (4.DA. ids) are some exceptions, for instance.
* Great care must be taken with definitions and their redefinitions. There is a difference between rocks, natural minerals and chemical compounds. Some examples: rocksalt (a redirect), [[halite]] and sodium chloride; kaolin earth (a redirect) and [[kaolinite]]; apatite, strict sense ([[chlorapatite]], [[fluorapatite]] and [[hydroxylapatite]]), apatite group and apatite supergroup; kaolinite-serpentine group (alias serpentine), [[serpentine subgroup]], serpentinization and [[serpentinite]]; olivine structural group (after rruff.nfo/ima); olivine group and [[olivine]] (a [[fosterite]] var.); [[spessartine]] (a [[garnet]]) and spessartite (a [[lamprophyre]]); [[iron]] (element), [[telluric iron]] (alias native iron) and [[meteoric iron]]; [[phyllosilicate minerals]] (alias sheet silicates) and [[clay]]s; [[pyrochlore]] (invalid mineral name since 2010), pyrochlore group and pyrochlore supergroup; [[antimony]] and [[stibnite]] (alias antimonite); etc.
* The data of a mineral on the databases is similar but not equal. For instance:
** [[Opal]] is a valid IMA/CNMNC name but it is a mineraloid (a mixture of [[cristobalite]] and/or [[tridymite]] and amorphous silica), it has a page on Mindat.org and Webmineral.com but not on the Handbook of Mineralogy.
*** Ice, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (low melting point); allophane, [[delvauxite]], [[hisingerite]] (amorphous/ poorly cristalline); [[actinolite]], [[augite]], [[omphacite]], [[sanidine]] (intermediate member of a [[solid solution]] series) are IMA/CNMNC valid names too. The reasons can be inherited pre-IMA status, practical reasons or entrenchment in the literature, including medical and legal usage.
** [[Oligoclase]]&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is an albite variety on Mindat.org and it has pages on the Handbook of Minerals and Webmineral.com, see 'List of minerals (synonyms)' ([[plagioclase]]/[[albite]]-[[anorthite]] series). It is not the only intermediate member of a solid solution series with a page on the Handbook of Mineralogy ([[List of minerals (synonyms)#Mineral varieties|mineral varieties]]).
** The Handbook of Mineralogy has pages on [[clinochrysotile]], [[orthochrysotile]] and [[parachrysotile]], but not on [[chrysotile]]; but they are polytypes of chrysotile, see 'List of minerals (synonyms)'.
** Mindat.org uses to give the chemical formula of some minerals as a range (between parentheses, if tin dominant then [[herzenbergite]]: (Sn,Pb)SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; otherwise [[teallite]]: (Pb,Sn)SnS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), on the other side the IMA Database of Mineral Properties/ Rruff Project uses to give the ideal chemical formula of the solid solution end member (herzenbergite: SnS). 
***The given chemical names are a compromise for information purposes, being based on the Nickel-Strunz code too. Most of the time the chemical formula on rruff.info was used, sometimes the simpler one on mindat.org. To illustrate it: [[bartonite]], K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; (mindat.org), K&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;S (rruff.info); [[bayleyite]], Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·18H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (mindat.org), Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (rruff.info) and [[bredigite]], Ca&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Mg(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (mindat.org), CaCa&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (rruff.info).
***Caution with the chemical formula units of silicates and their "formula masses". Some molecules have a repeating unit, these might be chains, networks, [[polymers]], and so the true molecule might be a multiple of the smallest repeating unit (the [[unit cell]] of a crystal is formed by repeating 'Z' times the chemical formula). Examples: [[wadsleyite]] (Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) a sorosilicate and high pressure polymorth of [[forsterite]] and [[ringwoodite]]; [[leucophanite]] (NaCaBeSi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 9.DH.05 (inosilicates with 4-periodic single chains, Si&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;); [[clinoenstatite]] (MgSiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 9.DA.10 (inosilicates with 2-periodic single chains, Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;); [[scolecite]] (CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;·3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 9.GA.05 (zeolites with T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; units – the fibrous zeolites); [[mogánite]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but it has Nickel-Strunz identifier 4.DA.20 (oxides with small cations: silica family).
*The existence in nature of some questionable/ doubtful minerals is very unlikely at all or at the [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]]. For example, [[magnesium chloride|chloromagnesite]]&lt;sup&gt;Q&lt;/sup&gt; (Y: 1872, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 3.AB.20 and [[zinc sulfate|zinkosite]]&lt;sup&gt;Q&lt;/sup&gt; (Y: 1852, ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) 7.AB.10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-1022.html Mindat.org - Chloromagnesite]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-4418.html Mindat.org - Zinkosite]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some names are not names of minerals anymore, but names of a group of minerals:
**Micas, [[biotite]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-677.html Mindat.org - Biotite]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" &gt;No Webmineral reference&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handbookofmineralogy.com/pdfs/biotite.pdf Handbookofmineralogy - Biotite]&lt;/ref&gt;
***The IMA/CNMMN, Subcommittee on Nomenclature of the Micas (1998, 1999) has recommended that the name biotite be used for a series including [[phlogopite]], [[siderophyllite]], [[annite]] and [[eastonite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Rieder, Milan, Cavazzini, Giancarlo, D'yakonov, Yurii S., Frank-Kamenetskii, Viktor A. &lt;!-- Glauco Gottardi, Stephen Guggenheim, Pavel V.

|"During that time, being more significant, Mr Astone held the first license to transport passengers to and from the Fremantle Port. Mr Astone transported hundreds of migrants and brought them to settle within the Northbridge area. During the 1950s, Mr Astone made a significant contribution to the local community through his work as the owner of a taxi fleet, fruit and vegetable vendor, and a crockery business where he established a vast network of Northbridge restaurant clients. His crockery business continued for 26 years. My father was a well known figure within the Northbridge community, who resided at 135 Bulwer Street for over 40 years. The cohort of students from that time (Highgate Primary School) remember Mr Astone as the 'Man with the red truck'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordinary Meeting of Council - 26 September 2006|url=https://www.vincent.wa.gov.au/Profiles/vincent/assets/moduledata/councilmeetings/8e6a2288-444f-4cac-ac44-cdf91defd1c4/1.0/20060926.pdf|publisher=City of Vincent|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Dual carriageway road traffic bridge that connects Perth and East Perth to the [[Canning Highway]], [[Great Eastern Highway]], Shepperton Road and [[Albany Highway]]. In 1839, a dam is constructed across the Swan River between the Perth shore and Heirrison Islands, and being a dam rather than a bridge, it became known as the Causeway. The name was retained for subsequent bridges built here, the first joining of the shores of the Swan River here with a bridge, occurring in 1843. This bridge remained in use until 1947. The post-war baby boom and increased immigration brought rapid growth to Australia's towns and cities, and growth in the number of vehicles and traffic increased greatly. Governments across Australia pursued road construction with great vigour, and it was at this time that the present Causeway was built and the boundaries of Heirrison Island were clearly defined with the building of the island's seawalls.&lt;ref name=thecauseway&gt;{{cite web|title=The Causeway|url=http://australiaforeveryone.com.au/perth/causeway.html|publisher=Pocket Oz Travel and Information Guide|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
There are a number of theories on the origin of the name ''Mamilla''. John Gray writes that it may be a corruption of the Hebrew word for 'the filler' (m'malle'), though that is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;A history of Jerusalem, John Gray, Praeger, 1969, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Others indicate it may have been named for its sponsor, ''Mamilla'' or ''Maximilla'',&lt;ref name=Pringle&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0jH6VPi4-gC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=mamilla+614&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=B2YkTpjcA8jxsgbz9tWVAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mamilla%20614&amp;f=false|page=217|title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: The city of Jerusalem|author=Denys Pringle|edition=Illustrated|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|ISBN=9780521390385}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for a church that once stood near the pool that was dedicated to a saint named ''Mamilla'' or ''Babila''.&lt;ref name=Willisp65&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy city: Historical, topographical, and antiquarian notices of Jerusalem, Volume 1|author=[[George Williams (clergyman)|George Williams]] and [[Robert Willis (engineer)|Robert Willis]]|pages=65–66|publisher=J.

==History==
The pool's original date of construction is unknown.&lt;ref name=Oconnor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

===Roman period===
During the rule of [[Herod the Great]], king of the Roman provinces of Judea, Galilee and Samaria in the 1st century BCE, improvements were made to the water supply system in Jerusalem. Two new pools constructed during his reign, the Pool of the Towers and the Serpent's Pool (''Birket es-Sultan''), were fed by the Mamilla Pool via aqueducts.&lt;ref name=Bromiley&gt;{{Cite book|pages=1024–1025|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yklDk6Vv0l4C&amp;pg=PA1025&amp;dq=jerusalem+mamilla+herod&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JygnTr7VM8_1sgaKo7mUCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jerusalem%20mamilla%20herod&amp;f=false|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: E-J|author=Geoffrey W.

===Byzantine period===
Following the Persian capture of Jerusalem from the Byzantines in 614, a large number of Christians were massacred by Jews at the pool.&lt;ref name="jta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem blessed, Jerusalem cursed: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Holy City from David's time to our own.

===Crusader period===
During the period of Crusader rule over Jerusalem in the 12th century, Mamilla pool was known as ''the Patriarch's Lake'', and the [[Hezekiah's Pool|Pool of Hezekiah]] inside the city walls that it fed was known as the ''Pool of the Patriarch's Bath''.&lt;ref name=Pringle/&gt;

===19th century===
In the 19th century, Horatio Balch Hackett described the pool: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the distance of several hundred yards we come to another pool, Birket el-Mamilla, generally supposed to be the Upper Gihon of Scripture, (Isaiah 36, 2.) This reservoir is still used, and on the ninth of April contained three or more feet of water. It is about three hundred feet long, two hundred wide, and twenty feet deep. It has steps at two of the corners, which enable the people not only to descend and fetch up water, but to lead down animals to drink. It is customary, also, to bathe here. 
&lt;ref&gt;Illustrations of Scripture: suggested by a tour through the Holy Land By Horatio Balch Hackett, Heath &amp; Graves, 1856, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===20th century===
After the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]], the Jerusalem municipality temporarily tried to connect the pool to the Jerusalem water supply, and coated the pool with cement.&lt;ref name="jta"&gt;[http://tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Euk/Articles/Attractions/Hidden+Treasures+in+Jerusalem.htm Hidden Treasures in Jerusalem], the Jerusalem Tourism Authority&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
The pool's dimensions as recorded by [[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Edward Robinson]] in the mid-19th century give a depth of {{convert|18|ft}}, a length of {{convert|316|ft}}, and a width of {{convert|200|ft}} at its western end and {{convert|218|ft}} at its eastern end. In 2008, the dimensions are given as {{convert|291|ft}} x {{convert|192|ft}} x {{convert|19|ft}}.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;The Land of Israel; A Text-Book on the Physical and Historical Geography of the Holy Land Embodying the Results of Recent Research, Robert Laird Stewart, 2008. Page 214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecosystem==
With the first rains, the pool hosts an ecosystem of crabs, frogs, and insects. During Spring, it becomes a haven for migrating birds.&lt;ref name="jta"/&gt; In 1997, a previously unknown species of tree frogs was discovered in the pool. The researchers named their find [[Hyla heinzsteinitzi]], in honor of [[Heinz Steinitz]], a deceased Israeli marine biologist. As of 2007, the species is assumed to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/who-s-to-blame-for-disappearance-of-a-new-species-of-amphibian-1.227731 Who's to blame for disappearance of a new species of amphibian?], By Ofri Ilani, Haaretz, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Grach, Plesser, and Werner}}, 2007, A new, sibling, tree frog from Jerusalem (Amphibia: Anura: Hylidae), 41: 714.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Map regression''' is the process of working backwards from later maps to earlier maps of the same area, to determine change or to locate past features.

==Historical map regression==
The process is mainly used in research on the history of places, sometimes termed ''historic'' map regression. Comparing maps of an area compiled in different periods can help reconstruct the chronology of events which have altered the natural or built environment. In archaeology, map regression can help to locate features appearing only on earlier maps and to assign building phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic map regression|url=http://www.archaeologyskills.co.uk/historic-map-regression|publisher=Skills Passport|accessdate=28 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231042212/http://www.archaeologyskills.co.uk/historic-map-regression/|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often part of ''desk based assessments'' before field work is undertaken.

==Methods==
Map regression is performed either by comparing individual features between maps, or by re-projecting an entire map so as to fit another onto which it can then be superimposed. The process can include resolving any differences in map scale, projection, [[Geodetic datum|datum]], or format; and the interpretation of each map in its meaning and accuracy.

===Transcription===
Similarities between maps, such as topography or built structures, are identified to determine where distinct features from one map are plotted on another. One manual technique is to copy features from earlier maps onto transparent overlays placed on the most recent map which provides the spatial framework. By working in sequence back in time a chronology is compiled. This intensive process can promote a more considered assessment as every feature is treated individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Mick Aston|Aston, Mick]]|title=Using Maps|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/micks-dig-diary/mick-aston-using-maps.htm|work=Mick's Dig Diary|publisher=Current Archaeology|accessdate=28 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Transformation===
Computer based [[geographical information systems]] facilitate the scaling, rotation, and translation of an entire map to fit over another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Understanding the Archaeology of Landscapes|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/understanding-archaeology-of-landscapes|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=28 December 2013|at=Part 4, p.30|format=PDF|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georeferencing]] establishes a congruent relationship between maps, and allows each map to be transformed and automatically re-projected as an overlay. This method is useful for the regression of maps that differ in format, for example, [[Raster graphics|raster]] images of early maps and [[Vector graphics|vector]] representations of modern maps. 

==Limitations==
Features not appearing on one map but shown on another do not necessarily indicate an actual difference, due to purpose, detail, or accuracy; for example, comparing [[Cadastre#Cadastral map|cadastral]] and topographic maps.

Map format can reduce confidence in a regression. 'Strip' maps, or traverse surveys, which record features in a linear path can complicate the spatial interpolation required to match a planar format.

Historical research can involve early maps of uncertain accuracy or datum. They are often small scale which leads to the magnification of any position errors in enlarging to match large scale maps. Georeferencing is not always straightforward; topography such as river courses and coastlines change over time, as do road routes and other built structures.

'''Martakert''' ({{lang-hy|Մարտակերտ}} ''Martakert'', also spelled as ''Mardakert'') or  '''Aghdara''' ({{lang-az|Ağdərə}} also spelled as ''Agdere'' or ''Aqdara'') is a town that is ''[[de facto]]'' in the [[Republic of Artsakh]], a state with limited recognition established in the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. The town is internationally recognized as being ''[[de jure]]'' in [[Azerbaijan]]. The area around the town has been controlled by Artsakh forces since the end of the 1991–94 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].

Martakert was the administrative center of the [[Mardakert District (NKAO)|Mardakert District]] of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast during the Soviet era, and is now the administrative center of the [[Martakert Region]] of Artsakh. Azerbaijan considers the town to be part of its [[Tartar District]].

During the Nagorno-Karabakh War the area of Martakert saw heavy fighting, including the Azerbaijani [[Mardakert and Martuni Offensives]]. In 2016, some [[2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes|clashes along the ceasefire lines]] took place near Martakert.

{{Politics of Grenada}}

The Caribbean [[island country]] of [[Grenada]] is divided into regions known as [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]].
 
A [[Parish (administrative division)|parish]] defines a territorial unit or region that, historically, was usually an area under the pastoral care served by a local church as an ecclesiastical administrative unit (see [[Parish]]) and later used by map-makers to set boundaries to an area of land.  Traditionally a settlement or village would centre on a church and later grow to become a town and then even a city.  Therefore, a parish has now come to mean an administrative division and is used so by several countries as the smallest unit (or lowest tier) of local government.

The differing size and shape of each parish was primarily influenced by the island's earlier history and land that was granted to the first settlers that claimed that territory during the [[Colonialism|colonial]] years of the island.

Two decades after Barbados was settled the French governor of Martinique, [[Jacques Dyel du Parquet]], purchased Grenada from a French company and in 1650 established a settlement at what was to be Fort Royal in the parish of the low lands (''Ville Ft.

The French cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin (1703–1772) draw several editions of a chart of the island of Grenada showing the earlier French parish divisions and was published as ''Carte de L'Isle de la Grenade'' in Paris 1756.

However, by 1763 the island was under British rule and a later map of the Island of Grenada showing towns and villages and division of the island into quarters in English by cartographer Bryon Edwards (for J. Cooke's ''History of the West Indies'') was engraved in 1818.

After a century the French capitulated to the British and formally ceded the island to Britain in 1763 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]].  The English took over the churches and, as was traditional, [[chaples of ease]] and local churches were elevated to [[Church of England parish church|parish church]] status across the island, leading to the formation of new parishes surrounding those newly named churches.  The six boundaries or borders of these parishes having already  been well established in the mindset of the people then living simply took on the names of these churches.

The nation's capital [[Saint George's, Grenada|St. George's]], which is located within the parish of [[Saint George, Grenada|Saint George]], and even to this day the original parishional border-lines are still well defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2512">[[Image:Gishron Stream.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Gishron Stream]], [[Israel]]. Showing the relationship; a large and deep stream in its proportionally sized valley.]]
In estimating [[erosion]], '''Playfair's law''' is an [[empirical relationship]] that relates the size of a stream to the valley it runs through. It is better defined as a [[scientific theory|theory]] rather than law.

==Definition==
The law states each [[stream]] cuts into its own [[valley]], that each valley is proportional in size to its stream and that the stream junctions in the valley are proportional in depth in accordance with the stream level. Although there are models, in the most basic sense it simply says that large, fast streams will be in large valleys and vice versa. This is because steady, heavy flow of water will tug surrounding soil and subsequently erode and deepen the valley it cuts through.

Playfair's law also states that at tributary junctions, tributaries will have the same slope as the main channels. This is referred to by saying that the junctions occur "at grade".

==Equation==
By modeling Playfair's law in the following mathematical scheme, we can find the incision rate of the stream into the valley by following:
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{\varepsilon}=k A^{m}S^{n} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiley Interscience: Fundamentals"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.3290090207/abstract| title= On Playfair's law of accordant junctions| accessdate=2009-01-09 | doi=10.1002/esp.3290090207| volume=9| issue= 2| journal=[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]| pages=153–173| year= 1984| last1= Kennedy| first1= Barbara A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt;\ \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the erosion (or incision), and &lt;math&gt;\ \dot{\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt; is therefore equal to the incision rate
:&lt;math&gt;\ k &lt;/math&gt; is an erosion parameter (see below)
:&lt;math&gt;\ A &lt;/math&gt; is the area drained by the stream
:&lt;math&gt;\ S &lt;/math&gt; is the local gradient of the channel
:&lt;math&gt;\ m,n &lt;/math&gt; stream parameters (see below)
In evaluating the case specific parameters, we regard &lt;math&gt;\ k&lt;/math&gt; as a [[parameter]] that is dependent on the type of land or [[soil]] that the stream is penetrating. Also, &lt;math&gt;m,n&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by first assuming that at the junction the law holds over the distance used to determine S and taking their [[ratios]] (m/n) at different points, then substitution.

'''Raymond Dugrand''' (13 January 1925 – 13 February 2017) was a French geographer and urban planner. He was a professor of geography at the [[University of Montpellier]], and the author of several books about the geography of the [[Languedoc]]. He was the head of urban planning for the city of [[Montpellier]] from 1977 to 2001. He is the namesake of an avenue in Montpellier.

==Early life==
Raymond Dugrand was born on 13 January 1925. He joined the [[French Resistance]] in [[Haute-Vienne]] in 1943, in the midst of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"/&gt; He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1945, but later became an "anti-communist".&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt; Meanwhile, he joined an underground network of activists who hid people sentenced to the death penalty.&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt;

Dugrand attended a teachers college in [[Châteauroux]] until 1945, when he enrolled at the [[University of Paris]] to study geography.&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chevalier|first1=Dominique|title=Raymond Dugrand et Montpellier : une relation géographique et politique|journal=Sud-Ouest Européen|date=2014|volume=37|pages=129–140|url=https://soe.revues.org/1156|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned the [[agrégation]] in geography,&lt;ref name="france3obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonnet|first1=Sylvie|title=Disparition de l'urbaniste montpelliérain Raymond Dugrand|url=http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/occitanie/herault/montpellier-metropole/montpellier/disparition-urbaniste-montpellierain-raymond-dugrand-1195679.html|accessdate=14 February 2017|work=France 3 Occitanie|date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Montpellier : mort de Raymond Dugrand à l'âge de 92 ans|url=http://www.midilibre.fr/2017/02/13/montpellier-mort-de-raymond-dugrand-a-l-age-de-92-ans,1465821.php|accessdate=14 February 2017|work=Midi Libre|date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a doctorate in geography.&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt; His thesis supervisor was [[Pierre George]].&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt;

==Career==
Dugrand became a faculty member at the [[University of Montpellier]], later known as [[Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III|Paul Valéry University]], in 1963.&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"/&gt; He was the author of three books and the co-author of two more books on the geography of the [[Languedoc]]. He also served on the editorial board of the ''L’Espace géographique'', an academic journal.&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt;

Upon [[Georges Frêche]]'s election as the mayor of Montpellier in 1977, Dugrand became the head of urban planning for the city.&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"/&gt; He served in this capacity until 2001.&lt;ref name="chevalierraymondet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt; During his tenure, he hired Spanish architect [[Ricardo Bofill]] to design the [[Antigone, Montpellier|Antigone]] neighbourhood of Montpellier.&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt; He also hired architects [[Paul Chemetov]], Robert Croizet, François Fontès, [[Massimiliano Fuksas]], [[Rob Krier]], Emmanuel Nebout, Jean Nouvel, [[Christian de Portzamparc]] and [[Jean-Michel Wilmotte]] to design other buildings in Montpellier.&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"/&gt;

The ''Avenue Raymond Dugrand'' in Montpellier was named in his honour in 2009.&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"/&gt;

==Death==
Dugrand died on 13 February 2017 in Montpellier, at the age of 92.&lt;ref name="france3obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="midilibreobituary"/&gt;

'''Reidgotaland''', '''Reidgothland''', '''Reidgotland''', '''Hreidgotaland''' or '''Hreiðgotaland''' was a land in [[saga|Scandinavian sagas]] as well as in the pre-Viking English [[Tribes of Widsith|Widsith]], which usually referred to the land of the [[Goths]]. 

==Etymology and Location==

Oddly, ''hreiðr'' can mean "bird's nest" and perhaps it was a [[kenning]] for the Goths tradition of moving and "nesting" in new territories, but ''hreið-'' is also a name-prefix meaning "beautiful", "eager", "great", "famous", "noble". Another possibility is that it was originally ''reið'' "ride, journey" (see [[Raidô]]). The use of the prefix is simple as the same tribal name was used for the [[Gutes]] of [[Gotland]]. The identification of the territory varies between the sources. This is the list of meanings given by [[Nordisk familjebok]]:

#The Island of [[Gotland]].
#[[Götaland]].
#The land of the [[Goths]], i.e. [[Gothiscandza]] and their later territories. In [[Hervarar saga]], it was the same as [[Oium]] and bordered the land of the [[Huns]] from which it was separated by [[Myrkviðr]].
#The territories of the [[Goths]] in southern Europe, according to [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] sources.
#[[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] (according to Snorri's Edda it was the earthly kingdom of [[Odin]]).
#[[Denmark]].
#[[Jutland]].

The second edition of [[Nordisk familjebok]] explains that '''Hreidgoths''' was originally applied to the [[Ostrogoths]] in south-eastern Europe. It appears as ''hraiðgutum'' on the [[Rök Stone]] in [[Östergötland]]. In [[Hervarar saga]], the name ''Hreiðgotaland'' is applied to the territories of the Ostrogoths in south-eastern Europe. In [[Widsith]], the traveller has been with the ''Hreð-Gotum''. In [[Snorri's Edda]], it is either applied to [[Jutland]] or to  [[Scandinavia]] as a whole, while the islands are called ''Eygotaland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution-url=http://runeberg.org/nfcb/0655.html |title=[[Nordisk Familjebok]] |year=1915 |contribution=Reidgotaland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Legendary sagas]] however, Eygotaland is used only for the island of [[Gotland]] in the [[Baltic Sea]].

The '''Subantarctic''' is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|region]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]], located immediately north of the [[Antarctic]] region. This translates roughly to a [[latitude]] of between [[46th parallel south|46°]] and [[60th parallel south|60°]] south of the [[Equator]]. The subantarctic region includes many [[island]]s in the southern parts of the [[Indian Ocean]], [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Pacific Ocean]], especially those situated north of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]. '''Subantarctic glaciers''' are, by definition, located on islands within the subantarctic region. All [[glacier]]s located on the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]] are by definition considered to be [[List of glaciers in the Antarctic|Antarctic glaciers]].

==Geography==
The subantarctic region comprises two geographic zones and three distinct [[Weather front|front]]s. The northernmost boundary of the subantarctic region is the rather ill-defined [[Subtropical Front]] (STF), also referred to as the Subtropical Convergence. To the south of the STF is a geographic zone, the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ). South of the SAZ is the Subantarctic Front (SAF). South of the SAF is another marine zone, called the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). The SAZ and the PFZ together form the subantarctic region. The southernmost boundary of the PFZ (and hence, the southern border of the subantarctic region) is the Antarctic Convergence, located approximately 200 kilometers south of the [[Polar front|Antarctic Polar Front]] (APF).&lt;ref name=Smith2008&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ryan Smith |author2=Melicie Desflots |author3=Sean White |author4=Arthur J.

===Influence of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and thermohaline circulation===
[[Image:Corrientes-oceanicas.png|350px|thumb|left|Diagram of the major [[ocean current]]s, showing the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC). In addition to the global [[thermohaline circulation]], the ACC strongly influences regional and global [[climate]].]]

The Subantarctic Front, found between [[48th parallel south|48°S]] and [[58th parallel south|58°S]] in the Indian and Pacific Ocean and between [[42nd parallel south|42°S]] and 48°S in the Atlantic Ocean, defines the northern boundary of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (or ACC).&lt;ref name=Smith2008/&gt; The ACC is the most important [[ocean current]] in the [[Southern Ocean]], and the only current that flows completely around the Earth. Flowing eastward through the southern portions of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, the ACC links these three otherwise separate [[oceanic basin]]s. Extending from the sea surface to depths of 2000–4000 meters, and with a width of as great as 2000 kilometers, the ACC transports more water than any other ocean current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Another factor that contributes to the climate of the subantarctic region, though to a much lesser extent than the thermohaline circulation, is the formation of [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (ABW) by [[Halothermal circulation|halothermal dynamics]]. The halothermal circulation is that portion of the global ocean circulation that is driven by global [[density gradient]]s created by surface heat and [[evaporation]].

===Definition of subantarctic: political versus scientific===
[[File:Antarctic bottom water.svg|thumb|left|Diagram showing different [[water mass]]es in the [[Southern Ocean]].]]
Several distinct [[water mass]]es converge in the immediate vicinity of the APF or Antarctic Convergence (in particular the [[Subantarctic Mode Water|Subantarctic Surface Water]] (Subantarctic Mode Water or SAMW), [[Antarctic Surface Water]], and the [[Antarctic Intermediate Water]]). This convergence creates a unique environment, noted for its very high [[Primary production|marine productivity]], especially for [[Antarctic krill]]. Because of this, all lands and waters situated south of the Antarctic Convergence are considered to belong to the Antarctic from a [[climatology|climatological]], [[biology|biological]] and [[hydrology|hydrological]] standpoint.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} However, the text of the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], article VI ("Area covered by Treaty") states: "The provisions of the present Treaty shall apply to the area south of [[60th parallel south|60° South latitude]]".&lt;ref name=treaty&gt;{{cite web

===Subantarctic islands===
{{See also|List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands}}
[[File:Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.svg|400px|thumb|right|[[Antarctica]] and surrounding islands in relation to the Antarctic Convergence and the 60th parallel south]]
[[Image:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Trees growing along the north shore of the [[Beagle Channel]], [[55th parallel south|55°S]].]]
[[Tristan da Cunha|Tristan da Cunha group]], [[Île Amsterdam]], [[Île Saint-Paul]], and [[Gough Island]] are all isolated [[High island|volcanic islands]] situated at between [[37th parallel south|37°]] - [[40th parallel south|40°]] south of the equator, just south of the [[Horse latitudes|southern Horse latitudes]]. Because they are located far to the north of the Antarctic Convergence and have a relatively [[Temperateness|temperate]] climate, they are not typically considered to be subantarctic islands.

At between about [[46th parallel south|46°]] – [[50th parallel south|50°]] south of the equator, in the region often referred to as the ''[[Roaring Forties]]'', are the [[Crozet Islands]], [[Prince Edward Islands]], [[Bounty Islands]], [[Snares Islands]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Antipodes Islands]], and [[Auckland Islands]]. The geography of these islands is characterized by tundra, with some trees on Snares and Auckland Islands. These islands are all located near the Antarctic Convergence (with Kerguelen south of the Convergence) and are properly considered to be subantarctic islands.

At between [[51st parallel south|51°]] – [[56th parallel south|56°]] south of the equator, the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Ildefonso Islands]], [[Diego Ramírez Islands]], and other islands associated with [[Tierra del Fuego]] and [[Cape Horn]], lie north of the Antarctic Convergence in the region often referred to as the ''[[Furious Fifties]]''. Unlike other subantarctic islands, these islands have [[Tree line|trees]], [[Amsterdam and Saint-Paul Islands temperate grasslands|temperate grasslands]] (mostly ''[[Poa flabellata|tussac grass]]''), and even [[arable land]]. They also lack [[tundra]] and [[Snow line|permanent snow]] and ice at their lowest elevations. Despite their more southerly location, it is debatable whether these islands should be considered as such because their climate and geography differs significantly from other subantarctic islands.

At between [[52nd parallel south|52°]] – [[57th parallel south|57°]] south of the equator, [[Campbell Island group]], [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]], [[Bouvet Island]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia Group]], [[Macquarie Island]], and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Sandwich Islands]] are also located in the Furious Fifties. The geography of these islands is characterized by tundra, [[permafrost]], and [[volcano]]es. These islands are situated close to or south of the Antarctic Convergence, but north of [[60th parallel south|60°S latitude]] (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty).&lt;ref name=treaty/&gt; Therefore, although some are located south of the Antarctic Convergence, they should still be considered as subantarctic islands by virtue of their location north of the 60° latitude.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

At between [[60th parallel south|60°]] – [[69th parallel south|69°]] south of the equator, the [[South Orkney Islands]], [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Balleny Islands]], [[Scott Island]], and [[Peter I Island]] are all properly considered to be Antarctic islands for the following three reasons:
#they are all located south of the Antarctic Convergence
#they are all located within the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean
#they are all located south of the 60° latitude (in the region often referred to as the ''[[Shrieking Sixties]]'')

In light of the above considerations, the following should be considered to be [[List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|subantarctic islands]]:

===Impact of climate change on SAMW===
[[File:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|300px|right|Air-sea exchange of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]]]
Together, the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) act as a [[carbon sink]], absorbing [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric carbon dioxide]] and storing it in solution. If the SAMW temperature increases as a result of [[climate change]], the SAMW will have less capacity to store dissolved carbon dioxide. Research using a computerized climate system model suggests that if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration were to increase to 860 ppm by the year 2100 (roughly double today's concentration), the SAMW will decrease in density and salinity. The resulting reductions in the subduction and transport capacity of SAMW and AAIW water masses could potentially decrease the absorption and storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=down2009&gt;{{cite journal

The physical landscape and biota communities of [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] are constantly changing due to [[volcanism]], strong winds and waves, and [[climate change]]. Volcanic activity has been observed in this area since the mid-1980s, with fresh [[lava]] flows on the southwest flanks of Heard Island. [[Satellite imagery]] shows that McDonald Island increased in size from about 1 to 2.5 square kilometers between 1994 and 2004, as a result of volcanic activity.&lt;ref name=aad2008&gt;{{cite web

In addition to new land being produced by volcanism, [[global warming]] of the climate is causing the [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreat of glaciers]] on the islands (''see section below ''). These combined processes produce new ice-free [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] and [[Ecoregion#Freshwater|freshwater]] [[ecoregion]]s, such as [[moraine]]s and [[lagoon]]s, which are now available for colonization by plants and animals.&lt;ref name=aad2008/&gt;

Heard Island has vast colonies of [[penguin]]s and [[petrel]]s, and large harems of land-based marine predators such as [[elephant seal]]s and [[fur seal]]s. Due to the very high numbers of [[seabird]]s and [[marine mammal]]s on Heard Island, the area is considered a "biological hot spot".&lt;ref name=aad2008/&gt; The marine environment surrounding the islands features diverse and distinctive [[Benthic zone|benthic habitats]] that support a range of species including [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s, [[barnacle]]s and [[echinoderm]]s.

===Glaciers of Heard Island===
Heard Island is a heavily glacierized, subantarctic [[High island|volcanic island]] located in the [[Southern Ocean]], roughly 4000 kilometers southwest of [[Australia]]. 80% of the island is covered in ice, with glaciers descending from 2400 meters to [[sea level]].&lt;ref name=Allis1986/&gt; Due to the steep [[topography]] of Heard Island, most of its glaciers are relatively thin (averaging only about 55 meters in depth).&lt;ref name=Ruddell/&gt; The presence of glaciers on Heard Island provides an excellent opportunity to measure the rate of glacial retreat as an indicator of climate change.&lt;ref name="aad2008"/&gt;

Available records show no apparent change in [[glacier mass balance]] between 1874 and 1929. Between 1949 and 1954, marked changes were observed to have occurred in the ice formations above 5000 feet on the southwestern slopes of [[Big Ben (Heard Island)|Big Ben]], possibly as a result of [[volcanism|volcanic activity]]. By 1963, major recession was obvious below 2000 feet on almost all glaciers, and minor recession was evident as high as 5000 feet.&lt;ref name=Budd1970&gt;{{cite journal

During the time period between 1947 and 1988, the total area of Heard Island's glaciers decreased by 11%, from 288&amp;nbsp;km² (roughly 79% of the total area of Heard Island) to only 257&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=Ruddell/&gt; A visit to the island in the spring of 2000 found that the [[Stephenson Glacier|Stephenson]], [[Brown Glacier|Brown]] and [[Baudissin Glacier|Baudissin]] glaciers, among others, had retreated even further.&lt;ref name=Ruddell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thost2008/&gt; The terminus of Brown Glacier has retreated approximately 1.1 kilometres since 1950.&lt;ref name=aad2008/&gt; The total ice-covered area of Brown Glacier is estimated to have decreased by roughly 29% between 1947 and 2004.&lt;ref name=Thost2008/&gt; This degree of loss of glacier mass is consistent with the measured increase in temperature of +0.9&amp;nbsp;°C over that time span.&lt;ref name=Thost2008/&gt;

The coastal ice cliffs of Brown Glacier and Stephenson Glacier, which in 1954 were over 50 feet high, had disappeared by 1963 when the glaciers terminated as much as 100 yards inland.&lt;ref name=Budd1970/&gt; Baudissin Glacier on the north coast, and [[Vahsel Glacier]] on the west coast have lost at least 100 and 200 vertical feet of ice, respectively.&lt;ref name=Budd1970/&gt; [[Winston Glacier]], which retreated approximately one mile between 1947 and 1963, appears to be a very sensitive indicator of glacier change on the island. The young moraines flanking [[Winston Lagoon]] show that Winston Glacier has lost at least 300 vertical feet of ice within a recent time period.&lt;ref name=Budd1970/&gt;

The glaciers of Laurens Peninsula, whose maximum elevation is only 500 m above sea level, are smaller and shorter than most of the other Heard Island glaciers, and therefore much more sensitive to temperature effects. Accordingly, their total area has decreased by over 30 percent. [[Jacka Glacier]] on the east coast of Laurens Peninsula has also demonstrated marked recession since 1955.&lt;ref name=Budd1970/&gt; In the early 1950s, Jacka Glacier had receded only slightly from its position in the late 1920s, but by 1997 it had receded about 700 m back from the coastline.&lt;ref name=Allis1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ruddell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Quil2000&gt;{{cite journal

Possible causes of glacier recession on Heard Island include:
#Volcanic activity
#Southward movement of the Antarctic Convergence: such a movement conceivably might cause glacier retreat through a rise in sea and air temperatures
#Climatic change

The [[Australian Antarctic Division]] conducted an expedition to Heard Island during the [[austral summer]] of 2003-04. A small team of scientists spent two months on the island, conducting studies on [[Bird|avian]] and terrestrial biology and glaciology. Glaciologists conducted further research on the Brown Glacier, in an effort to determine whether glacial retreat is rapid or punctuated. Using a portable [[Echo sounding|echo sounder]], the team took measurements of the volume of the glacier. Monitoring of climatic conditions continued, with an emphasis on the impact of [[Foehn wind]]s on glacier mass balance.&lt;ref name=heard&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the findings of that expedition, the rate of loss of glacier ice on Heard Island appears to be accelerating. Between 2000 and 2003, repeat [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[Surveying|surface surveys]] revealed that the rate of loss of ice in both the [[ablation zone]] and the [[accumulation zone]] of Brown Glacier was more than double average rate measured from 1947 to 2003. The increase in the rate of ice loss suggests that the glaciers of Heard Island are reacting to ongoing climate change, rather than approaching [[dynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name=Thost2008/&gt; The retreat of Heard Island's glaciers is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=Allis1986/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7914">'''TOXMAP''' is a [[geographic information system|geographic information system (GIS)]] from the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the [[United States]] to help users explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory|Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)]] and [[Superfund]] programs with visual projections and maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explore.data.gov/Health-and-Nutrition/TOXMAP-online-toxicology-maps-/3zb7-374y? |title=TOXMAP®:online toxicology maps |publisher=[[United States Data.gov]] |date=February 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genengnews.com/best-of-the-web/toxmap/584/ |title=TOXMAP® |publisher=[[Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News (GEN)]] |date=August 2005 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TOXMAP helps users create nationwide, regional, or local area maps showing where TRI chemicals are released on-site into the air, water, ground, and by underground injection, as reported by industrial facilities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hochstein |first1=Colette |last2=Szczur |first2=Marti |title=TOXMAP: a GIS-based gateway to environmental health resources |journal=Medical reference services quarterly |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=13–31 |year=2006 |pmid=16893844 |pmc=2703818 |doi=10.1300/J115v25n03_02}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It also identifies the releasing facilities, color-codes release amounts for a single year or year range, and provides multi-year aggregate chemical release data and trends over time, starting with 1988. Maps also can show locations of Superfund sites on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [[National Priorities List]] (NPL), which lists all chemical contaminants present at these sites.

There are two versions of TOXMAP available from its home page: the classic version of TOXMAP released in 2004 and, a newer version released in 2014 that is based on [[Adobe Flash]]/[[Apache Flex]] technology. In addition to many of the features of TOXMAP classic, the new version provides an improved map appearance and interactive capabilities as well as a more current GIS look-and-feel. This includes seamless panning, immediate update of search results when zooming to a location, two collapsible side panels to maximize map size, and automatic size adjustment after a window resize. The new TOXMAP also has improved [[U.S. Census]] layers and availability by Census Tract (2000 and 2010), Canadian [[National Pollutant Release Inventory]] (NPRI) data, U.S. commercial [[nuclear power plants]], as well as improved and updated [[congressional district]] boundaries.

TOXMAP classic users may search the system by location (such as city, state, or ZIP code), chemical name, chemical name fragment, release medium, release amount, facility name and ID, and can filter results to those residing within a pre-defined or custom geographic region.

Search results may be brought up in [[Google Maps]] or [[Google Earth]], or saved for use in other tools. TOXMAP also overlays map data such as U.S. Census population information, income figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and health data from the [[National Cancer Institute]] and the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/toxmap.html |title=TOXMAP Fact Sheet|publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New York's Finger Lakes.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[New York (state)|New York]]'s [[Finger Lakes]]. Lying south of Lake Ontario, the Finger Lakes formed in tunnel valleys.]]
A '''tunnel valley''' is a large, long, [[U-shaped valley]] originally cut under the [[glacial ice]] near the margin of continental ice sheets such as that now covering Antarctica and formerly covering portions of all continents during past [[ice ages|glacial ages]].&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Jørgensen | first =Flemming   | authorlink =   |author2=Peter B.E. Sandersen   | title = Buried and open tunnel valleys in Denmark—erosion beneath multiple ice sheets  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews  | volume = 25  | issue = 11–12  | pages = 1339–1363  | publisher =   | location =   | date = June 2006  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2005.11.006     | id =   |bibcode = 2006QSRv...25.1339J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tunnel valley can be as long as {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep (its depth may vary along its length).

Tunnel valleys were formed by subglacial erosion by water and served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water. Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to [[fjord]] walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.

They presently appear as dry valleys, lakes, seabed depressions, and as areas filled with sediment. If they are filled with sediment, their lower layers are filled primarily with glacial, [[glacio-fluvial|glaciofluvial]] or [[glaciolacustrine deposits|glaciolacustrine]] sediment, supplemented by upper layers of temperate infill.&lt;ref name=Stucki2010&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =   Durst Stucki | first =Mirjam   | authorlink =   | author2 = Regina Reber and Fritz Schlunegger  | title = Subglacial tunnel valleys in the Alpine foreland: an example from Bern, Switzerland  | journal = Swiss Journal of Geosciences | volume =   103| issue =   3| pages =   363–374| publisher =  Springer (Online First) | location =   | date = June 2010  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1007/s00015-010-0042-0     | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in areas formerly covered by glacial ice sheets including Africa, Asia, North America, Europe, Australia and offshore in the North Sea, the Atlantic and in waters near Antarctica.

Tunnel valleys appear in the technical literature under several terms, including tunnel channels, subglacial valleys, [[iceway]]s, [[Snake coils (geology)|snake coils]] and linear incisions.

==Significance==
Understanding tunnel valleys is important because: 
* They serve as a marker for areas with the potential for effective oil exploration in Africa
* Their bedrock boundaries and glacial infill makes them effective aquifers in many regions
* Soil engineers must accommodate the variations which they exhibit when boring tunnels and establishing foundations
* They provide one of several signatures marking the edge of former glaciations

Tunnel valleys play a useful role in identifying oil rich areas in [[Arabia]] and [[North Africa]]. The Upper [[Ordovician]]–Lower [[Silurian]] materials there contain a roughly {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick, carbon-rich layer of black shale. Approximately 30% of the world's oil is found in these shale deposits. Although the origin of these deposits is still under study,  it has been established that the shale routinely overlies glacial and glacio-marine sediment deposited ~445 million years before the present by the [[Hirnantian|Hirnantian glaciation]]. The shale has been linked to glacial meltwater nutrient enrichment of the shallow marine environment. Hence the presence of tunnel valleys is an indicator of the presence of oil in these areas.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armstrong| first =Howard A. | authorlink = | author2 = Geoffrey D.

Tunnel valleys represent a substantial fraction of all melt-water drainage from glaciers. Melt-water drainage influences the flow of glacial ice, which is important in understanding of the duration of glacial–interglacial periods and aids in identifying glacial cyclicity, a problem that is important to palaeoenvironmental investigations.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Smellie | first = John L. | authorlink = | author2 = J.S.

Tunnel valleys are typically eroded into bedrock and filled with glacial debris of varying sizes. This configuration makes them excellent at capturing and storing water. Hence they serve an important role as [[aquifer]]s across much of [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].  Examples include [[Oak Ridges Moraine| Oak Ridges Moraine Aquifer]], Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, [[Mahomet Aquifer]], the [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_164191.htm Saginaw Lobe Aquifer], and the [http://pubs.usgs.gov/ha/ha730/ch_m/M-text1.html Corning Aquifer].

==Characteristics==
[[File:Tunneldal Noordbergum.jpg|280px|left|thumb|A figure in Dutch showing the cross-section of a tunnel valley which has been refilled after erosion into bedrock.]]

===Buried, open and partially filled===
Tunnel valleys have been observed as open valleys and as partially or totally buried valleys.  If buried they may be partially or totally filled with glacial outwash or other debris. The valleys may be incised in bedrock, sand, silt, or clay.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

A part of a tunnel valley may go uphill: water can flow uphill if it is under pressure in an enclosed pipe: for example in [[Doggerland]] (submerged land which is now part of the bed of the [[North Sea]]) are some infilled tunnel valleys that flowed from north to south across the hollow of the [[Outer Silver Pit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SrsrE8oZx44C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=Doggerland&amp;ots=YzrIXDuQeI&amp;sig=DaeFOytqn6t-JpW1-zBTGqVqO50#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Vincent Gaffney, Kenneth Thomson, Simon Finch, Mapping Doggerland: The Mesolithic Landscapes of the Southern North Sea, University of Birmingham, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===
They vary in channel depth and width; Danish examples run from {{convert|0.5|-|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and from {{convert|50|–|350|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.  They vary in depth/altitude along their course, exhibiting [[overdeepening]]; overdeepened sections cut into bedrock and typically are significantly deeper than either upstream or downstream sections of the same tunnel valley. They have steep sides which are frequently [[asymmetric valley|asymmetric]].&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

Tunnel valleys frequently include relatively straight individual segments parallel to and independent of one another. Tunnel valley courses may be periodically interrupted; the interruption may include a stretch of elevated [[esker]], indicating the channel ran through ice for a distance. The below-grade sections typically run {{convert|5|-|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length; in some cases the sections form a larger pattern of an interrupted channel composed of strings of depressions which can extend from {{convert|70|-|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

===Structure===
The upstream portion – that section furthest into the glacier – consists of a branching system forming a network, similar to the [[Anastomosis|anastomostic]] branching patterns of the upper reaches of a river (as contrasted with [[wikt:dendritic|dendritic]] patterns). They typically exhibit the largest cross-sectional area in the center of the course and terminate over a relatively short distance in elevated outwash fans at the ice-margin.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

Tunnel valleys are found to cross the regional gradient – as a result they may be crosscut by modern stream networks. In one example, tributaries of the Kalamazoo River cut at nearly right angles across buried tunnel channel filled with ice and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Tunnel valleys from successive glaciations may crosscut one another.&lt;ref&gt;“Principles of glacier mechanics”; Roger LeB. Hooke; 2nd Edition;  2005; Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys frequently run along roughly parallel courses. They originate in and run through regions which include clear evidence of glacial erosion through [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] and may exhibit [[Glacial striation|striations]] and [[roche moutonnée]]. Depositional forms such as [[Moraine|terminal moraines]] and [[outwash fan]]s are found at their terminal end.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; In Michigan tunnel valley channels have been observed to diverge slightly with an average spacing between the channels of {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} and a [[standard deviation]] of {{convert|2.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Fisher2005&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Fisher       | first = Timothy G.     | authorlink =   | author2 = Harry M.

[[File:Kawartha Lakes w legend.png|thumb|280px|right|The Kawartha lakes in Ontario formed in residual tunnel valleys from the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Late Wisconsonian]] glacial period. The water flow was from upper right to lower left. Close examination shows the existence of buried tunnel valleys as well – they can be identified by contrasting vegetation.]]

Tunnel valley channels often start or stop abruptly.  They have convex-up longitudinal profiles. They are often occupied by elongated lakes of [[underfit]] streams.  They frequently show signs of subsequent depositions such as eskers.&lt;ref name=Fisher2005/&gt;

===Evidence of erosion mechanisms===
Evidence suggests that erosion in a tunnel valley is primarily the result of water flow. They erode by meltwater, which it has been argued, episodically drains in repeated [[jökulhlaup]]s from subglacially stored lakes and reservoirs; examples of such motion have been observed in [[Antarctica]]. Although there is evidence of ice erosion such as linear striations in the bedrock, these are observed only in the widest valleys, and are believed to have played a secondary role.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

The subglacial layout of  valley tunnels/channels is predominantly oriented parallel to glacial ice flow lines – essentially they stretch from areas of thicker sheet ice toward areas of thinner sheet ice. They can exhibit reverse gradients, which result when pressurized meltwater flows over obstacles such as ridges or hills along the glacier bed.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

Tunnel valleys can be formed under extremely thick glacial ice – examples have been observed on the bottom of [[Lake Superior]] and in the oceans offshore in Antarctica. The course of a tunnel valley typically runs from thickest glacial ice to the glacier margin; as a result the glacial ice pressurizes the water such that it runs uphill toward its end.&lt;ref name=J/&gt;

==Formation of tunnel valleys/channels==
Although there is agreement on the role of meltwater in creation of tunnel valleys, several theories are still under consideration for the role of that meltwater:
:*Steady state theory – Boulton and Hindmarsh propose a steady state theory. They suggest tunnel valleys form in unconsolidated sediment when meltwater flows under pressure through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive removal of sediment by meltwater, ice deforms under its own weight into the cavity to create a tunnel valley through a positive feedback mechanism.&lt;ref name=Boulton1987&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Boulton  | first = G.A.|author2=R.C.A. Hindmarsh  | title = Sediment deformation beneath glaciers; rheology and geological consequences | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 92 | issue = B2 | pages = 9059–9082 | publisher = American Geophysical Union| location = | date = 27 January 1987 | url = | issn = | doi =  10.1029/JB092iB09p09059| id = | bibcode=1987JGR....92.9059B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:*Jökulhlaup driven erosion – Piotrowski argues that ice sheets may, in some instances, be cold-based; that is they contact land that is frozen (permafrost) and they freeze to the permafrost. Meltwater builds up behind this frozen ice terminus until it generates sufficient pressure to lift the ice and break the bond, with a catastrophic meltwater release such as is seen with the [[Iceland]]ic [[jökulhlaup]]. As a consequence of this jökulhlaup a tunnel valley is formed.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
:*Upglacier erosion – Wingfield proposes that tunnel valleys form gradually, with the valley head cutting progressively back toward the source up-glacier during deglaciation.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield R.; The origin of major incisions within the Pleistocene deposits of the North Sea
(1990) Marine Geology, 91 (1–2), pp.&amp;nbsp;31–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodic outbursts of subglacial water have been observed moving subglacial water between subglacial lakes beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.  Satellite data recorded a subglacial discharge totaling {{convert|2|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}  traveling ~{{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} over a period of less than a year.

===Common features of tunnel valley theories===
[[File:Lagowski Park Krajobrazowy-World Wind.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A Polish [[ribbon lake]] formed in a tunnel valley. Note the variable width and the interruption between segments of the course. There is also evidence of other sediment-filled channels adjacent to this (e.g., two smaller lakes to the right)]]
Subglacial meltwater flow is common to all theories; hence a key to understanding channel formation is an understanding of subglacial meltwater flow. Meltwater may be produced on the glacier surface (supraglacially), below the glacier (basally) or both. Meltwater may flow either supraglacially or basally as well; the signatures of supraglacial and basal water flow differ with the passage zone. Supraglacial flow is similar to stream flow in all surface environments – water flows from higher areas to lower areas under the influence of gravity. Basal flow exhibits significant differences. In basal flow the water, either produced by melting at the base or drawn downward from the surface by gravity, collects at the base of the glacier in ponds and lakes in a pocket overlain by hundreds of meters of ice. If there is no surface drainage path, water from surface melting will flow downward and collect in crevices in the ice, while water from basal melting will collect under the glacier; either source will form a subglacial lake. The [[hydraulic head]] of the water collected in a basal lake will increase as water drains through the ice until the pressure grows high enough to either develop a path through the ice or to float the ice above it.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

===Steady state theory===
Sources of water and water drainage routes through and below temperate and sub-polar glaciers are reasonably well understood and provide a basis for understanding tunnel valleys. For these glaciers, supraglacial water ponds or moves in rivers across the surface of the glacier until it drops down a vertical crevice (a [[Moulin (geology)|moulin]]) in the glacier. There it joins subglacial water created by geothermal heat; some portion of the water drains into aquifers below the glacier. Excess subglacial water that cannot drain through sediment or impermeable bedrock as groundwater, moves either through channels eroded into the bed of sediment below the glacier (called Nye channels&lt;ref&gt;The smaller channels, known as ''Nye channels,'' are named after British physicist [[John Nye (scientist)|John Nye]].&lt;/ref&gt;) or through channels upward into the glacial ice (called Rothlisberger channels), eventually flowing out at the ice margin.  On the simplest level, the tunnel valley can be considered a larger-scale version of these phenomena.&lt;ref name=Eyles2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Eyles | first = Nick K | title = The role of meltwater in glacial processes | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 190 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 257–268 | publisher = | location = | date = 1 August 2006 | url = | issn = | doi = 10.1016/j.sedgeo.2006.05.018 | id = |bibcode = 2006SedG..190..257E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys or tunnel channels are produced by meltwater flows beneath glacial ice. Tunnel valleys are often buried or partially buried by sediment accumulation during periods of ice advance and retreat.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Shaw | first = J | authorlink = | author2 = A.

R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although attractive since it scales up the Nye channel formation which has been observed in sediments, a weakness of the steady state theory is that it requires that tunnel valleys be excavated in unconsolidated sediment, in which meltwater is initially forced through an initially narrow subglacial conduit. With progressive sediment erosion by the meltwater, ice deforms under its own weight into the cavity to creating an ever-larger tunnel valley. However the steady state theory appears not to account for erosion into bedrock, which has been extensively observed.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

===Jökulhlaup driven erosion===
There is evidence that meltwater discharges are episodic.&lt;ref name=Wingham2006/&gt; This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice is lifted, and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice is most easily lifted (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) are lifted first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice.&lt;ref&gt;A [[waterbed]] analogy can be applied here – the water moves under the pressure of the overlying ice, just as it does when a mass is placed on a water bed.&lt;/ref&gt; As water collects, additional ice is lifted until a release path is created.

If no preexisting channel is present, the water is initially released in a broad-front [[jökulhlaup]] which can have a flow front that is tens of kilometers wide, spreading out in a thin front. As the flow continues, it tends to erode the underlying materials and the overlying ice, creating a channel even as the reduced pressure allows most of the glacial ice to settle back to the underlying surface, sealing off the broad front release and channelizing the flow. The direction of the channel is defined primarily by the overlying ice thickness and secondarily by the gradient of the underlying earth, and may be observed to “run uphill” as the pressure of the ice forces the water to areas of lower ice coverage until it emerges at a glacial face. Hence the configuration of the various tunnel valleys formed by a specific glaciation provide a general mapping of the glacier thickness when the tunnel valleys were formed, particularly if the original surface relief under the glacier was limited.&lt;ref name=Smellie2008A/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt;

Analyses by Piotrowski demonstrate that the annual production of water from one typical catchment of {{convert|642000000|m3|cuft|abbr=out}} would normally drain through its associated tunnel valley in less than 48 hours.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Piotrowski  | first = Jan A.   | authorlink =   | title = Subglacial hydrology in north-western Germany during the last glaciation: groundwater flow, tunnel valleys and hydrological cycles  | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews  | volume = 16  | issue = 2  | pages = 169–185  | publisher =   | location =   | year = 1997  | url =   | issn =   | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(96)00046-7  | id =   |bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..169P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The debris found in tunnels and at the mouth of tunnels tends to be coarse rocks and boulders – this is indicative of high flow velocities and an extremely erosive environment. This erosive environment is consistent with creation of tunnels over {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, as have been observed in the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=Shaw2008/&gt; Piotrowski’s model predicts a cycle as follows: 
# Meltwater is produced as a result of geothermal heating from below. Surface ablation water is not considered as it would be minimal at the glacial maximum and evidence indicates that surface water does not penetrate more than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} into a glacier.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# Meltwater initially drains through subglacial aquifers.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# When the hydraulic transmissivity of the substratum is exceeded, subglacial meltwater accumulates in basins.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# Water accumulates sufficiently to open the ice blockage in the tunnel valley which accumulated after the last discharge.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# The tunnel valley discharges the meltwater excess – turbulent flow melts out or erodes the excess ice as well as eroding the valley floor.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;
# As the water level drops, the pressure decreases until the tunnel valleys again close with ice and water flow ceases.&lt;ref name=Piotrowski2009/&gt;

===Post-erosion infill processes===
Tunnel valleys have similar characteristics, irrespective of whether they are formed on land or in a submerged environment. This is because they are formed by high pressure water under a thick ice sheet – in a submerged environment they still have sufficient pressure to erode tunnel valleys into configurations comparable to those generated on land.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Le Heron | first = Daniel Paul | author2 = Jonathan Craig and James L. Etienne | title = Ancient glaciations and hydrocarbon accumulations in North Africa and the Middle East | journal = Earth-Science Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 47–76 | publisher = © 2009 Elsevier B.V. | location = | date = April 2009 | doi =10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.02.001   | id = |bibcode = 2009ESRv...93...47L | last3 = Etienne | first3 = James L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnel valleys may remain open, partially filled or filled, as a function of the glacial recession. The filled configuration is significant because filled tunnel valleys become excellent reservoirs for either water (aquifer) or for oil. This results since relatively coarse-grained sandstones are located on the valley floors and valley margins and valley floor because the coarser-grained sediments settle out more easily and accumulate preferentially in the flowing water common to the tunnel valley fill stages.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

The subglacial tunnel valley networks originally formed near the ice margin. Tunnel valleys are likely to fill with sediment as the result of meltwater release during glacial recession. Tunnel valleys fill in two main ways. In the first instance, debris carried by flow settles out and accumulates in the tunnel valley. Subsequently, once the ice has retreated sufficiently, marine deposits may be laid down, depending on the water depth at the ice front.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

The tunnel valley sedimentary record is controlled by meltwater release flowrates and sediment burdens during glacial recession. The sediment found in the tunnel valley provides insight into whether it was laid down in a tidal environment, a transitional environment, or an essentially dry environment with good drainage. In the glaciomarine environment, glacially-related deposits are interbedded with to those similar to those on non-glaciated tidal areas; the tidal environment will show undertow dominated fans. The transitional environment is characterized by both mixed marine and fresh water life in a delta environment. In an essentially dry environment, the glacial flow carries sediment which accumulates much as it would in any stream bed.&lt;ref name=LeHeron2009A/&gt;

===Large-scale structure===
[[Ice sheet dynamics|Ice flow within glaciers]] results from an increase in the surface slope of the glacier, which result from geographic features combined with an imbalance between the amounts of ice accumulated through precipitation and lost through [[ablation]]. The increased gradient increases the [[shear stress]] on a glacier until it begins to flow. The flow velocity and deformation are also affected by the slope of the ice, the ice thickness and temperature.

Punkari identified that [[ice sheets|continental ice sheets]] typically flow in fan-shaped lobes, which converge from separate sources and move at differing speeds. Lobes are separated by [[interlobular|interlobate]] zones, which have thinner ice coverage. Water collects in this interlobate area. The hydraulic head (pressure) is lower in areas of thinner ice; hence subglacial water tends to converge on the interlobate joint. The separate lobes move at different speeds, generating friction at the ice boundary; the heat released melts ice to release additional water. The surface of the interlobate area is crevassed, allowing surface meltwater, which runs down the ice surface to the lower area, to penetrate into the ice. As a result, the ice-flow patterns and the debris accumulation are different in interlobate zones. Specifically, tunnel valleys and [[esker]]s indicate water flow toward the interlobate zones, which are elevated as the result of debris carried and deposited there.&lt;ref name=Punkari1997&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Punkari   | first = Mikko   | authorlink =   | title = Glacial and Glaciofluvial Deposits in the Interlobate Areas of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet   | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews   | volume = 16   | issue =   7| pages = 741–753  | publisher = Elsevier Science Ltd.    | location =   | year = 1997  | url =   | issn =   | doi =   10.1016/S0277-3791(97)00020-6| id =   |bibcode = 1997QSRv...16..741P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Argentino periodically breaks through in outburst floods with drainage initially through a tunnel with subsequent roof collapse to form an open channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Depetris | first = P.J. | authorlink = |author2=A.I.
