'''1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane''', ('''dibromochloropropane''') better known as '''DBCP''', is the active ingredient in the [[nematicide]] '''Nemagon''', also known as Fumazone.

It is a soil [[fumigant]] formerly used in American [[agriculture]]. In mammals it causes male sterility at high levels of exposure. After discovery of its deleterious health effects on humans, the compound was banned from use in 1979 by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/dibromo-.html Hazard Summary]. - [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. - EPA.gov.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing presence of the chemical as a [[contaminant]] in [[ground water]] remains a problem for many communities for years after end of use.

|}

== Uses ==
* Until 1977, DBCP was used as a soil [[fumigant]] and [[nematocide]] on over 40 different crops in the United States. It fights pests that attack the roots of fruit trees and boosts the weight of harvests by 20 percent.&lt;ref name=SpanoJ-LAT-2007-11-15&gt;Spano, John. - "Dole Must Pay $2.5 Million in Punitive Damages". - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. - November 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1979, EPA suspended registration for all DBCP-containing products except for use on pineapples in [[Hawaii]]. In 1985, EPA issued an intent to cancel all registrations for DBCP, including use on [[pineapple]]s. Subsequently, the use of existing stocks of DBCP was prohibited.
* DBCP is used as an intermediate in the [[synthesis of organic chemicals]].

== Sources and potential exposure ==
* Human exposure to DBCP could result from the ingestion of contaminated [[drinking water]] and food.
* Human exposure could also result from inhalation and / or skin contact with the product.
* In the past, release of DBCP to the environment occurred primarily from its fumigant and nematocide uses; because of the cancellation of all DBCP uses, environmental exposure is expected to decline with time.

== Examples of persistence ==
DBCP residues have persisted in [[soil contamination|contaminated soil]] and groundwater long after applications have ceased. For example, in agricultural areas around [[Turlock, California|Turlock]] in the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] of California, DBCP was applied to crops in the 1970s. As late as 1989, DBCP persistence was reported in groundwater that was previously used for beneficial purposes, and numerous nearby [[water well|wells]] had to be shut down at that time.&lt;ref&gt;"Environmental Screening Analysis, Tully Road Properties, Turlock, California". - Earth Metrics Incorporated. - Report 7826, San Mateo, California. - March, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lawsuits ==
Workers at the [[Dow Chemical]] plant producing DBCP were made [[Infertility|sterile]] by exposure to DBCP. These male reproductive effects were consistent with animal experiments showing that DBCP sterilizes rabbits. One contract worker at the production plant successfully sued the company. Most workers remained with the company and in a company sponsored medical program until the facility was sold in 1987. At that time, some of the workers did file suit against the company. However, the suit was denied due to [[statute of limitations]] issues.

Most domestic uses of the chemical were banned in 1977. Amid growing concerns over DBCP's effects on male workers, Dow ceased production and reclaimed DBCP that had been shipped to its users.

However, despite warnings from Dow about its health effects, the [[Dole Food Company]], which was using the chemical on its [[banana]] [[plantation]]s in [[Latin America]], threatened to sue Dow if it stopped DBCP shipments. Dow then shipped half a million gallons of DBCP to Dole, much of it reclaimed from other users. Plantation workers who became sterile or were stricken with other maladies subsequently sued Dow and Dole in Nicaraguan courts, alleging that their ailments were caused by DBCP exposure. Under a special law that was passed specifically for DBCP litigation, the Nicaraguan courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded them over US$600 million in damages. When plaintiff lawyers tried to enforce one of those judgments in the United States, the U.S. District Court in Florida held that "the credible and unrefuted medical testimony in this case is that it is factually impossible for what is represented in the Judgment to have occurred," and that due process "do[es] not permit awarding damages in the face of clear scientific evidence of the absence of causation," or, as in this case, "with proof that [the defendants] are not at fault."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rttnews.com/1104848/u-s-court-refuses-to-enforce-nicaragua-judgment-against-dole-food-update.aspx "U.S. Court Refuses To Enforce Nicaragua Judgment Against Dole Food - Update"]. - ''[[rttnews.com]]''. - October 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  A group of workers then filed lawsuits in the United States, and on November 5, 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded them US$3.2 million.&lt;ref name=SpanoJ-LAT-2007-11-06&gt;Spano, John. - [http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-dole6nov06,1,2105565.story "Dole must pay farmworkers $3.2 million"]. - ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. - November 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 15, 2010, that judgment was thrown out after the Court presiding over the case found that the claims were part of "a massive fraud perpetrated on the court".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/15/california-judge-dismisses-m-jury-award-dole-food-banana-workers-case/ "California judge dismisses $2.3M jury award against Dole Food Co. in banana workers case"]. - ''[[FoxNews.com]]''. - July 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 2009, a Los Angeles judge also threw out two similar cases against Dole and Dow Chemical due to fraud and extortion by lawyers in Nicaragua recruiting fraudulent plaintiffs to make claims against the company.&lt;ref name=HallmanB-TAL-2009-4-27&gt;Hallman, Ben. - [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202430211082&amp;amp;rss=newswire "Finding Plaintiffs Lawyers Committed Fraud, Judge Dismisses Tort Cases Against Dole and Dow Chemical"]. - ''[[The American Lawyer]]''. - April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling casts doubt on US$2 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] in judgments in similar lawsuits.&lt;ref name=KeatingG-Forbes-2009-4-24&gt;Keating, Gina. - [https://www.forbes.com/feeds/reuters/2009/04/24/2009-04-24T052809Z_01_N21503396_RTRIDST_0_BANANAS-UPDATE-2.html "Judge throws out Dole "bananeros" cases, citing fraud"]. - ''[[Forbes]]''. - April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], using the [[Alien Tort Claims Act]], and claiming sterility, crimes against humanity, and [[genocide]], sued (in ''Abagninin v. AMVAC Chemical Corp.'' [No. 07-56326]), these manufacturers of DBCP: Amvac Chemical, [[Dow Chemical]], [[Shell Oil Company]], as well as [[Dole Food Company]], who used it on overseas crops, but never used it in Côte d'Ivoire. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled against the workers in September 2008, stating that the plaintiffs did not show that the defendants had "specific intent" to intend harm against the workers and the citizens of the country. To be found guilty of genocide the defendant must have knowingly set out to commit the offense.&lt;ref name=USCofA9thC-AvACC&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ca9/newopinions.nsf/40AB16BDDF8C33D9882574CD007E8677/$file/0756326.pdf?openelement ''Abagninin v.

== Safety ==
DBCP causes a dramatic decrease in male fertility, ranging from [[oligospermia]] (low sperm count) to [[azoospermia]] (lack of sperm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DDT exposure, work in agriculture, and time to pregnancy among farmworkers in California|journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine|date = Dec 2008|issn = 1536-5948|pmc = 2684791|pmid = 19092487|pages = 1335–1342|volume = 50|issue = 12|doi = 10.1097/JOM.0b013e31818f684d|first = Kim G.|last = Harley|first2 = Amy R.|last2 = Marks|first3 = Asa|last3 = Bradman|first4 = Dana B.|last4 = Barr|first5 = Brenda|last5 = Eskenazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chilean grape scare''' was a 1989 incident involving two [[grape]]s from [[Chile]] allegedly found tainted with [[cyanide]] after a threat was supposedly made by phone to the [[US Embassy]] in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. No additional contaminated fruit was found, but the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] banned the import of Chilean fruit and warned people not to eat grapes or Chilean fruit despite the fact investigators found no traces of cyanide in any other fruit shipped from Chile to [[Philadelphia]].

==The scare==
The individual who supposedly telephoned the U.S. embassy in Santiago on March 2 told them some Chilean grapes contained cyanide. No individual or group ever claimed responsibility for poisoning the two grapes or making the phone call. Just two grapes were said to have been injected with cyanide and the country's fruit export sector was thrown into panic.  Thousands of farm workers lost their jobs and the Government was forced to provide temporary subsidies to offset the more than $400 million in losses.

==The doubts==
Because cyanide is highly reactive and the fact that a punctured grape decomposes rapidly, it is not possible for a grape to be injected with cyanide (or anything else for that matter) and arrive in the U.S. intact, two to three weeks later.  This fact led the GAO (General Accounting Office) to investigate to determine whether the scare was a result of poor laboratory processes.  The investigation was inconclusive.

[[File:Hieronymus Wierix - Acedia - WGA25736.jpg|thumb|Acedia, engraving by [[Hieronymus Wierix]], 16th century]]
'''Acedia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|iː|d|i|ə}}; also '''accidie''' or '''accedie''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|ᵻ|d|i}}, from [[Latin]] ''acedĭa'', and this from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκηδία, "negligence", ἀ- "lack of" -κηδία "care") is a state of listlessness or [[torpor]], of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world.  It can lead to a state of being unable to perform one's duties in life.  Its spiritual overtones make it related to but arguably distinct from [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = the hermitary and Meng-hu | title  = Acedia, Bane of Solitaries | url = http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html | year = 2004 |accessdate =22 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090103154838/http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html| archivedate= 3 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acedia was originally noted as a problem among monks and other ascetics who maintained a solitary life.

==Aquinas' definition==

The ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t95.e35 accidie]"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; defines acedia (or accidie) as "a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray". Some see it as the precursor to [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]—one of the [[seven deadly sins]]. In his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with "the sorrow of the world" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that "worketh death" and contrasts it with that sorrow "according to God" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is "sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good." It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's "flight" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, "on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].

Aquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted "spiritual joy", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, "One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa'', I, 48, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient depictions==
[[Image:Brueghel - Sieben Laster - Disidia.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted by [[Pieter Bruegel the elder]].]]
Moral theologians, intellectual historians and cultural critics have variously construed acedia as the ancient depiction of a variety of psychological states, behaviors or existential conditions: primarily [[laziness]], [[apathy]], [[ennui]] or [[boredom]].

The demon of acedia holds an important place in early monastic [[demonology]] and proto-psychology. In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as "the most troublesome of all" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary, the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', "the noonday demon", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun,  as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.&lt;ref&gt;John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"should be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.&lt;ref&gt;''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: "The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Signs==
[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in Sopron, Hungary.]]
Acedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this "temptation"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being "a slave from within". She relates this to forgetfulness about "the one thing needful": remembrance of God.

==In culture==
*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an "indolence of the heart" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: "The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.&lt;ref name="BenjamínOsborne2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjamín|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwy7yFgFN4IC|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee, ''Virginia Wolff'' (1996) p. 708&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chekhov]] and [[Samuel Becket]]'s plays often have themes of acedia.
*[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an essay on acedia called "Accidie". A non-Christian, he examines "the noon day demons" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.
*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in [[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]] cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Alfredo Palacio González''' (born January 22, 1939) is an Ecuadorian cardiologist and former politician who served as [[President of Ecuador]] from April 20, 2005 to January 15, 2007. From January 15, 2003 to April 20, 2005, he served as vice president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vicepresidencia.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/10/VICEPRESIDENTES-EN-LA-HISTORIA-2013.pdf|format=PDF|title=Vicepresidentes en la historia|website=www.vicepresidencia.gob.ec|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after which he was appointed to the presidency when the [[Ecuador]]ian [[National Congress of Ecuador|Congress]] removed President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] from power following a week of growing unrest with his government.

==Biography==
Born in [[Guayaquil]], Palacio is a physician by profession, specializing in [[cardiology]]. He studied in his home town and, later, at [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], doing residency at [[Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine|Case Western Reserve University]], followed by a two-year cardiology fellowship at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and [[Washington University School of Medicine]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], in the [[United States]]. He later lectured in cardiology and public health at the [[University of Guayaquil]]'s faculty of medicine.

Palacio was chosen as Lucio Gutiérrez's running mate in the 2002 election. It was a common sight during the campaign to see Gutiérrez, dressed in his army fatigues, accompanied by Palacio, wearing surgical scrubs. Palacio had previously served as the [[Health minister|minister for health]] during the administration of [[Sixto Durán Ballén]]. Many of the [[Political minister|minister]]s he chose were from the [[Democratic Left (Ecuador)]].

One of Palacio's first proposals made as president was to hold a [[Constitutional Congress|Constitutional Assembly]] to amend Ecuador's [[1998 Constitution of Ecuador|1998 Constitution]]. For a period of several months prior to assuming office, he had been a critic of the Gutiérrez regime, saying that the country was "falling apart" and in need of "intensive care".

[[Rafael Correa]] was elected president in November 2006 and replaced Palacio as president on January 15, 2007.

==World Health Organization==
Palacio was one of the candidates for the position of director-general of the [[World Health Organization]], to be decided in a vote on November 9, 2006. However, on October 18, 2006, he announced he would not be pursuing the position, preferring to concentrate on his presidency until the very last day of his mandate.

Established in 1953 as the American Academy of Child Psychiatry (AACP),&lt;ref name="pmid_17344448"&gt;{{Citation |last=Barthel  |first=RP |year=2007 |title=The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=119-121 |pmid=17344448 |doi=10.1176/appi.ap.31.2.119 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) in 1989.&lt;ref name="pmid_17344448"/&gt;

==Mission==
The Academy's official mission, adopted in 1994 with later emendations, is to "Promote the healthy development of children, adolescents, and families through research, training, prevention, comprehensive diagnosis and treatment and to meet the professional needs of child and adolescent psychiatrists throughout their careers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/about_us/mission_statement | title = Mission Statement | publisher = AACAP | accessdate = 25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Since 1962, the AACAP has published its monthly journal, ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry]]'' (''JAACAP''). There have been concerns about industry-sponsored clinical trials published in the journal. ''JAACAP'' editors have repeatedly declined to retract the journal's 2001 article on [[study 329]], a clinical trial examining [[paroxetine]] and teenagers. The trial was sponsored by, and ghostwritten on behalf of, SmithKline Beecham (now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]), and is widely regarded as having downplayed the trial's negative results.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Heck, [http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/04/02/controversial-paxil-paper-still-fire-13-years-later/ "Controversial Paxil paper still under fire 13 years later"], ''The Brown Daily Herald'', 2 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Newman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20800711 "The Rules of Retraction"], ''BMJ'', 341(7785), 11 December 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;1246–1248. {{doi|10.1136/bmj.c6985}} {{PMID|21138994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2907">A '''behavioral change''' can be a temporary or permanent effect that is considered a change in an individual's behavior when compared to previous behavior. It is often considered a [[mental disorder]]. This change is generally characterized by abnormal thinking, interpretations, [[emotion]]s, or changing relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/slinden/files/dolan.pdf|author=van der Linden, S.|title=A Response to Dolan.

== Psychological treatment==
In many cases, a person can exhibit behaviors that are harmful. [[Behavior modification]] is one method used to correct harmful behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/why-behavior-change-is-hard-and-why-you-should-keep-trying|title=Why behavior change is hard - and why you should keep trying - Harvard Health|first=Harvard Health|last=Publications|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] can be used in the effort to change the behavior of an individual. It requires the willing participation of the individual being counseled to be effective.
Training of counselors and their interventions can increase the likelihood of behavioral changes in those they counsel.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title =

== Clinical significance ==
In some instances, the reaction to a medication is an expected effect. In other instances, a behavior change may indicate that the dosage of medication is at a toxic level, or is an indication of [[hypersensitivity]] to the medication. [[Gerontology|Geriatric]] patients are more susceptible to these effects.&lt;ref name = Davis2017/&gt;&lt;ref name =zolDavis2017/&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''Berne Convention''' (formally, the '''International Convention respecting the Prohibition of the Use of White (Yellow) Phosphorus in the Manufacture of Matches''' ({{lang-fr|Convention internationale sur l'interdiction de l'emploi du phosphore blanc (jaune) dans l'industrie des allumettes}})) of 1906 is a [[multilateral treaty]] negotiated in [[Berne]], [[Switzerland]], which prohibits the use of [[white phosphorus]] in the manufacture of [[matches]]. The treaty also prohibits the import and sale of such matches.

The background to the treaty was the extensive medical problems such as [[phossy jaw]] facing workers in match production. The treaty was concluded on 26 September 1906. It entered into force on 1 January 1912. The Convention remains in force for 48 states. Switzerland is the depositary for the treaty.

In 1925 [[Edward J. Phelan]], future Director General of the [[International Labour Organization]], stated that the establishment of the ILO "may in one sense be traced to the Berne Convention of 1906", partly as a result of lobbying by the International Association for Labour Legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The cation appears in the head groups of [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[sphingomyelin]], two classes of [[phospholipid]] that are abundant in [[cell membranes]]. Choline is the precursor for the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]], which is involved in many functions including memory and muscle control.

==History==
Choline was first isolated by [[Adolph Strecker]] from pig and ox [[bile]] (Greek: χολή, ''chole'') in 1862.&lt;ref name=cholinehistory&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeisel|first1=Steven H.|title=A Brief History of Choline|journal=Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism|date=2012|volume=61|issue=3|pages=254–258|doi=10.1159/000343120|pmid=23183298|pmc=4422379}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When it was first [[chemical synthesis|chemically synthesized]] by [[Oscar Liebreich]] in 1865,&lt;ref name=cholinehistory /&gt; it was known as '''neurine'''.  In 1898 neurine was shown to be chemically identical to choline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boldyrev|first1=A.

==In humans==
===Physiology===
[[Image:Choline metabolism-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Choline metabolism.]]
Choline and its [[metabolites]] serve three purposes: structural integrity and [[cell signaling|signaling]] roles for cell membranes, cholinergic [[neurotransmission]] ([[acetylcholine]] [[protein biosynthesis|synthesis]]), and a source for [[methyl group]]s via its metabolite, [[trimethylglycine]] ([[betaine]]), which participates in the biosynthesis of [[S-adenosylmethionine]] (SAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glier | first1 = Melissa B. | last2 = Green | first2 = Timothy J. | last3 = Devlin | first3 = Angela M. | year = 2014 | title = Methyl nutrients, DNA methylation, and cardiovascular disease | url = | journal = Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 172–182 | doi=10.1002/mnfr.201200636| pmid = 23661599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dietary Betaine Promotes Generation of Hepatic S-Adenosylmethionine and Protects the Liver from Ethanol-Induced Fatty Infiltration" (June 1993) ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research'' Volume 17, Issue 3, Pages: 552–555, Anthony J. Barak, Harriet C. Beckenhauer, Matti Junnila and Dean J. Tuma&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary sources of choline===
Some animals cannot produce choline, but must consume it through their diet to remain healthy. Humans make a small amount of choline in the liver. In the United States, choline is recommended as an [[essential nutrient]].&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zeisel/&gt; Possible benefits include reducing the risk of neural tube defects and fatty liver disease. It has also been found that intake of choline during pregnancy can have long-term beneficial effects on memory for the child.&lt;ref name=Zeisel/&gt;

Choline deficiency is rare in the general population.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand|url=https://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients/choline|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] states there are no Recommended Daily Intakes in the EU and "no indications of inadequate choline intakes available in the EU".&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to choline and contribution to normal lipid metabolism (ID 3186), maintenance of normal liver function (ID 1501), contribution to normal homocysteine metabolism (ID 3090), maintenance of normal neurological function (ID 1502), contribution to normal cognitive function (ID 1502), and brain and neurological development (ID 1503) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2011|volume=9|issue=4|page=2056|quote=The Panel notes that no dietary reference values for choline have been established in the EU. There are no reliable intake data and there are no indications of inadequate choline intakes available in the EU|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are choline values for a selection of foods&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; in quantities that people may consume in a day.

As an example, even though peanuts contain some choline, they are a poor source given their 237% of diet to meet AI requirement, which means that a person who ate nothing but peanuts would have less than half of AI. Nearly identical figures are obtained for an average adult female when using 2000 calories and 425mg as assumptions; therefore, separate columns for male and female are not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adequate Intake instead of Recommended Dietary Allowance===

The Australian, New Zealand, and European Union national nutrition bodies note there have been no reports of choline deficiency in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand|url=https://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients/choline|quote=Although choline is essential, there appear to have been no reports of deficiency in the general population. Deficiencies have been seen in experimental situations and also in total parenteral nutrition (Buchman et al. 1992, 1993, 1995, Chalwa et al. 1989, Shapira et al. 1986, Sheard et al. 1986).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=efsa/&gt; The USA joins these three in not publishing a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups.&lt;ref&gt;Choline.

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) published its own Adequate Intake values, most recently in 2016.&lt;ref name=efsa/&gt;&lt;ref name="efsa2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/160817|title=Dietary reference values: EFSA publishes advice on choline|publisher=European Food Safety Authority, Parma, Italy|date=17 August 2016|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For U.S. dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV) based on the AI. For choline, as shown in [[Reference Daily Intake]], 100% of the Daily Value is 550&amp;nbsp;mg.

===Average or common intakes===

Studies on a number of populations have found that the average intake of choline was below the [[Dietary Reference Intake|Adequate Intake]].&lt;ref name=Zeisel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bidulescu A, Chambless LE, Siega-Riz AM, Zeisel SH, Heiss G |title=Repeatability and measurement error in the assessment of choline and betaine dietary intake: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study |journal=Nutrition Journal |volume=8 |issue= 1|page=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19232103 |pmc=2654540 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-8-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shaw2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = GM | last2 = Carmicheal | first2 = SL | last3 = Yang | first3 = W | last4 = Selvin | first4 = S | last5 = Schaffer | first5 = DM | year = 2004 | title = Periconceptional dietary intake of choline and betain and neural tube defects in offspring | url = | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 160 | issue = 2| pages = 102–9 | doi=10.1093/aje/kwh187 | pmid=15234930}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a recently published government survey on food consumption reported that for men and women ages 20 and older the average choline intakes were, respectively, 402 and 278&amp;nbsp;mg/day. For post-menopausal women, 280&amp;nbsp;mg/day&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf What We Eat In America, NHANES 2013-2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health effects of dietary choline===

Choline deficiency may play a role in [[liver disease]], [[atherosclerosis]], and possibly [[neurological disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Zeisel/&gt; One sign of choline deficiency is an elevated level of the [[liver function tests|liver enzyme]] [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]].&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; If low choline intake causes an elevated [[homocysteine]] level, it raises the risk for [[preeclampsia]], [[preterm birth|premature birth]], and very low birth weight.&lt;ref name=Zeisel/&gt;

Involvement of choline in long-term health and development of [[medicine|clinical]] disorders, such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[dementia|cognitive decline]] in aging and regulation of [[blood lipid]] levels, has not been well-defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/nutrit/nuv010|pmid=26108618|title=Effects of choline on health across the life course: A systematic review|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=73|issue=8|pages=500–22|year=2015|last1=Leermakers|first1=Elisabeth T.M.|last2=Moreira|first2=Eduardo M.|last3=Kiefte-De Jong|first3=Jessica C.|last4=Darweesh|first4=Sirwan K.L.|last5=Visser|first5=Thirsa|last6=Voortman|first6=Trudy|last7=Bautista|first7=Paula K.|last8=Chowdhury|first8=Rajiv|last9=Gorman|first9=Donal|last10=Bramer|first10=Wichor M.|last11=Felix|first11=Janine F.|last12=Franco|first12=Oscar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a dietary supplement===
{{see also|citicoline}}
The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] requires that [[infant formula]] not made from cow's milk be supplemented with choline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=107.100 |title=21 CFR 107.100: Infant formula; Nutrient requirements; Nutrient specifications; Choline content |publisher=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21; Food and Drug Administration|date=1 April 2016|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choline-providing dietary supplement ingredients include: choline chloride, choline bitartrate, citicoline (CDP-choline), L-alpha-glycerophosphocholine (Alpha-GPC), lecithin, phosphatidylcholine.

===Pregnancy and brain development===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}

The human body can produce choline by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine by N-methyltranferase ([[Phosphatidyl ethanolamine methyltransferase|PEMT]]) to form phosphatidylcholine in the liver, or it may be consumed from the diet. It has been demonstrated that both ''de novo'' production and dietary consumption are necessary, as humans eating diets lacking choline develop fatty liver, liver damage, and muscle damage. However, because of the close interplay between choline, folate, methionine, and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, (whose pathways overlap), the function of choline can be complex.

To begin with, methionine can be formed two ways, either from methyl groups derived from folate, or from methyl groups derived from betaine (which gets its methyl groups from choline). Changes in one of these pathways is compensated for by the other, and if these pathways do not adequately supply methyl groups to produce methionine, the precursor to methionine, homocysteine, rises.

Choline in food exists in either a free or esterified form (choline bound within another compound, such as phosphatidylcholine, through an [[ester]] linkage). Although all forms are most likely usable, some evidence indicates they are unequally bioavailable (able to be used by the body). Lipid-soluble forms (such as phosphatidylcholine) bypass the liver once absorbed, while water-soluble forms (such as free choline) enter the liver portal circulation and are generally absorbed by the liver.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeisel | first1 = SH | year = 2006 | title = The fetal origins of memory: the role of dietary choline in optimal brain development | journal = J Pediatr | volume = 149 | issue = 5| pages = S131–S136 | doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.06.065 | pmid=17212955 | pmc=2430654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of [[Phosphatidyl ethanolamine methyltransferase|PEMT]] via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline ''de novo'', but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that ''Pemt -/-'' mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline.&lt;ref name="Zeisel, SH. Choline 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeisel | first1 = SH | year = 2006 | title = Choline: critical role during fetal development and dietary requirements in adults | url = | journal = Annu. Rev. Nutr. | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 229–50 | doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111156 | pmid=16848706 | pmc=2441939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While maternal stores of choline are depleted during pregnancy and lactation, the placenta accumulates choline by pumping choline against the concentration gradient into the tissue, where it is then stored in various forms, mostly as acetylcholine, (an uncommon occurrence outside of neural tissue). The fetus itself is exposed to a very high choline environment as a result, and choline concentrations in amniotic fluid can be ten times higher than in maternal blood. This high concentration is assumed to allow choline to be abundantly available to tissues and cross the blood-brain barrier effectively.&lt;ref name="Zeisel, SH. Choline 2006"/&gt;

====Functions in the fetus====

Choline is in high demand during pregnancy as a substrate for building cellular membranes, (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for addition of methylation to DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing "fat" portions).&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board. Dietary reference intakes for Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folate, Vitamin B12, Pantothenic Acid, Biotin and Choline. Washington, DC: National Academies Press;1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen LH. Pregnancy and lactation In: Bowman BA, Russle RM, eds. Present Knowledge in Nutrition. Washington DC: ILSI Press; 2006: 529–543&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = King | first1 = JC | year = 2000 | title = Physiology of pregnancy and nutrient metabolism | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 1218S–1225S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline's use as a material for making cellular membranes, (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy and continues to be rapid to approximately five years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morgane | first1 = PJ | last2 = Mokler | first2 = DJ | last3 = Galler | first3 = JR | year = 2002 | title = Effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on the hippocampal formation | url = | journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 471–483 | doi=10.1016/s0149-7634(02)00012-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the demand is high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphatidyl choline (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oshida | first1 = K | last2 = Shimizu | first2 = T | last3 = Takase | first3 = M | last4 = Tamura | first4 = Y | last5 = Shimizu | first5 = T | last6 = Yamashiro | first6 = Y | year = 2003 | title = Effects of dietary sphingomyelin on central nervous system myelination in developing rats | url = | journal = Pediatric Research| volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 589–593 | doi=10.1203/01.pdr.0000054654.73826.ac| pmid = 12612207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation. Acetylcholine is even present in the placenta and may help control cell proliferation/differentiation (increases in cell number and changes of multiuse cells into dedicated cellular functions) and parturition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sastry | first1 = BV | year = 1997 | title = Human placental cholinergic system | url = | journal = Biochem Pharmacol | volume = 53 | issue = 11| pages = 1577–1586 | doi=10.1016/s0006-2952(97)00017-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sastry | first1 = BV | last2 = Sadavongvivad | first2 = C | year = 1978 | title = Cholinergic systems in non-nervous tissues | url = | journal = Pharmacol Rev | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 65–132 | pmid = 377313 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choline uptake into the brain is controlled by a low-affinity transporter located at the blood-brain barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12236062|year=2002|author1=Lockman|first1=P. R.|title=The transport of choline|journal=Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy|volume=28|issue=7|pages=749–71|last2=Allen|first2=D. D.|doi=10.1081/DDC-120005622}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport occurs when arterial plasma choline concentrations increase above 14 μmol/l, which can occur during a spike in choline concentration after consuming choline-rich foods. Neurons, conversely, acquire choline by both high- and low-affinity transporters. Choline is stored as membrane-bound phosphatidylcholine, which can then be used for acetylcholine neurotransmitter synthesis later. Acetylcholine is formed as needed, travels across the synapse, and transmits the signal to the following neuron. Afterwards, acetylcholinesterase degrades it, and the free choline is taken up by a high-affinity transporter into the neuron again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Caudill | first1 = M | year = 2010 | title = Pre and Postnatal Health: evidence of increased choline needs | url = | journal = American Dietetic Association | volume = 110 | issue = 8| pages = 1198–1206 | doi=10.1016/j.jada.2010.05.009| pmid = 20656095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neural tube closure====

While folate is most well known for preventing neural tube nonclosure (the basis for its addition to prenatal vitamins), folate and choline metabolism are interrelated. Both choline and folate (with the help of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) can act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can then go on to form SAM ([[S-Adenosyl methionine]]) and act as a methyl donor for methylation of DNA. Dietary choline deficiency alone without concurrent folate deficiency can decrease SAM concentration, suggesting that both folate and choline are important sources of methyl groups for SAM production.&lt;ref name="Zeisel, SH. Choline 2006"/&gt; Inhibition of choline absorption and use is associated with [[Neural tube defect|neural-tube defects]] in mice, and this may also occur in humans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A retrospective case control study (a study that collects data after the fact, from cases occurring without the investigator causing them to occur) of 400 cases and 400 controls indicated that women with the lowest daily choline intake had a four-fold greater risk of having a child with a [[Neural tube defect|neural-tube defect]] than women in the highest quartile of intake.&lt;ref name="shaw2004" /&gt;

====Choline and long-term memory====

In humans, the brain continues to develop after birth, and does not become similar to its adult structure until around four years of age. By feeding infants formula instead of milk, and presumably through differences in choline amount in the breast milk of mothers consuming different choline levels, the still-developing brain of an infant may be impacted, which may, in part, contribute to the differences seen between individual adult humans in memory and recall.&lt;ref name="Zeisel, SH. Choline 2006"/&gt;

===Choline and lactation===

The human mammary gland is composed of several cell types, including adipose (fat cells), muscle, ductal epithelium, and mammary epithelium (referred to sometimes as lactocytes). The mammary epithelium is the site for excretion of raw materials into the milk supply, including choline. This occurs, for the fat portion of the milk, by apocrine secretion, where vacuoles containing materials bud off the cell into the lumen (storage) of the alveolus (milk secretion gland). From here the milk will be released upon stimulation with oxytocin via suckling.&lt;ref name="Hale T p. 35-44"&gt;Hale T &amp; Hartmann P. Textbook of Human Lactation. Hale Publishing, 2007; p. 35-44&lt;/ref&gt;

====Choline in milk====

Choline can be found in milk as free choline, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine, and choline levels within breast milk are correlated with choline levels in maternal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes-McNarry | first1 = MQ | last2 = Cheng | first2 = WL | last3 = Mar | first3 = MH | last4 = Fussell | first4 = S | last5 = Zeisel | first5 = SH | year = 1996 | title = Choline and choline esters in human and rat milk in infant formulas | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 572–6 | pmid = 8839502 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/64.4.572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Y.O. Ilcol 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ilcol | first1 = Y.O. | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Choline status in newborns, infants, children, breast-feeding women, breast-fed infants, and human breast milk | url = | journal = Journal of Nutritional Biochemsitry | volume = 16 | issue = 8| pages = 489–499 | doi=10.1016/j.jnutbio.2005.01.011| pmid = 16043031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Choline consumed via breast milk has been shown to impact blood levels of choline in breast-fed infants – indicating that choline consumed in breast milk is entering the neonatal system.&lt;ref name="Y.O. Ilcol 2005"/&gt; Choline may enter the milk supply either directly from the maternal blood supply, or choline-containing nutrients may be produced within the mammary epithelium.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;James AR. Hormone Regulation of Choline Uptake and Incorporation in Mouse mammary Gland Explants. Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2004 Apr;229(4):323–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Choline reaches the milk through a transporter specific for choline from the maternal blood supply (against a concentration gradient) into the mammary epithelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = CK | last2 = Pomfret | first2 = EA | last3 = Zeisel | first3 = SH | year = 1988 | title = Uptake of choline by rat mammary gland epithelial cells | url = | journal = Biochem J | volume = 254 | issue = 1| pages = 33–8 | doi=10.1042/bj2540033| pmid = 3178755 | pmc = 1135035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At high concentrations (greater than that typically seen in humans), choline can diffuse across the cell membrane into the mammary epithelium cell. At more normal concentrations, it passes via what is believed to be a calcium/sodium-dependent, phosphorylation-related, active transporter into the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Chiao-Kang et al. Uptake of choline by rat mammary-gland epithelial cells. Biochem J. (1988) 254, 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Differences between breast milk and formula====

Human milk is rich in choline, but formulas derived from other sources, particularly soy, have lower total choline concentrations than human milk.&lt;ref name="Zeisel, SH. Choline 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banapurmath | first1 = CR | display-authors = etal | year = 1996 | title = Developing brain and breastfeeding | url = | journal = Indian Pediatrics | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 235–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tram | first1 = TH | display-authors = etal | year = 1997 | title = Sialic acid content of infant saliva: comparison of breast fed with formula fed infants | url = | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 315–318 | doi=10.1136/adc.77.4.315| pmid = 9389234 | pmc = 1717361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bovine milk and bovine-derived formulas had similar or higher glycerophosphocholine compared to human milk, and soy-derived formulas had lower glycerophosphocholine content. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin concentrations were similar between bovine formulas and human milk, but soy-derived infant formulas had more phosphatidylcholine than human or bovine sources. Soy-derived formulas had less sphingomyelin than human milk, which is a concern, since sphingomyelin is used for producing myelin, which insulates neurons. Free choline concentrations in mature human milk were 30–80% lower than those found in bovine milk or formulas. Mature human milk also has lower free choline than colostrum-transitional human milk. Phosphocholine is particularly abundant in human milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes-McNary | first1 = M | last2 = Cheng | first2 = WL | last3 = Mar | first3 = MH | last4 = Fussel | first4 = S | last5 = Zeisel | first5 = SH | year = | title = Choline and choline esters in human and rat milk and infant formulas | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 1996 | issue = 64| pages = 572–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish odor syndrome===
{{main|trimethylaminuria}}
Choline is a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to [[trimethylamine]], which persons suffering from [[trimethylaminuria]] are unable to break down. Persons with this disorder may suffer from a strong fishy or otherwise unpleasant [[body odor]], due to the body's release of odorous trimethylamine. A body odor will occur even on a normal diet{{spaced ndash}} ''i.e.'', one that is not particularly high in choline. Persons with trimethylaminuria are advised to restrict the intake of foods high in choline; this may help to reduce the sufferer's body odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell SC, Smith RL | title=Trimethylaminuria: the fish malodor syndrome | journal=Drug Metab Dispos | year=2001 | pages=517–21 | volume=29 | issue=4 Pt 2 | pmid=11259343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CommNet''' is an informal network of communications managers from [[European Union]]-funded research projects. It focuses on food quality and safety.

CommNet was established in early 2005 based on an initiative from the [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Network of Excellence]] CASCADE. It is an informal network and started with Communicators from about 15 different Integrated Projects and Networks of Excellence. Later, more projects have been added, and the network now counts more than 20 Framework Programme 6 projects supported by the [[Directorate-General for Research and Innovation (European Commission)|European Commission Directorate General for Research]]’s Food Quality and Safety Programme.

About 3000 scientists are fully or partly engaged in the consortia forming the CommNet. The members of CommNet address common issues related to the design and implementation of communication activities within European Union’s funded projects in the health and food sector.

CommNet members are responsible for managing communication of EU food and health research with [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), authorities, and other policy-makers that are stakeholders in Community research, [[European Commission]] officials, science journalists, especially those with special interest in the [[bioscience]]s, ongoing FP6 consortia, newly FP6 research consortia, planned European Union Framework Programme 7 (FP7) research consortia and other groups interested in the management of science&amp;ndash;society issues or communication of the biosciences.

'''Creme Puff''' (August 3, 1967 &amp;ndash; August 6, 2005) was a [[cat|domestic cat]], owned by Jake Perry of [[Austin, Texas]].

&lt;!--Granpa is likely the 3rd oldest cat ever lived --&gt;when she died aged 38 years and 3 days.

==Signs and symptoms==
Abnormal descent of the perineum may be asymptomatic, but otherwise the following may feature:

*[[perineodynia]] (perineal pain) &lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt;
*Colo-proctological symptoms, e.g. [[obstructed defecation]],&lt;ref name=Coloproctology&gt;{{cite book|last=Wexner|first=edited by Andrew P. Zbar, Steven D.|title=Coloproctology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84882-755-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dyschesia]] (constipation),&lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt; or degrees of [[fecal incontinence]] &lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt;
*[[gynaecological]] symptoms, e.g. [[cystocele]] (prolapse of the bladder into the vagina) and [[rectocele]] (prolapse of the rectum into the vagina) &lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt;
*lower [[urinary tract]] symptoms, e.g. [[dysuria]] (painful urination), [[dyspareunia]] (pain during sexual intercourse), [[urinary incontinence]] and urgency &lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt;

Other researchers concluded that abnormal perineal descent did not correlate with constipation or perineal pain, and there are also conflicting reports of the correlation of fecal incontinence with this condition.&lt;ref name="Broekhuis 2010" /&gt;

==Cause==
One of the main causes is suggested to be excessive and repetitive straining during defecation.&lt;ref name="Broekhuis 2010" /&gt; Other causes include weakness of the pelvic floor muscles (secondary to age-related neuropathic degeneration or traumatic injury during pregnancy and labor.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by [[rectal examination]]. A specialized tool called a "Perineocaliper" can be used to measure the descent of the perineum. A retro anal ultrasound scan may demonstrate the condition.&lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt; "Anti sagging tests", whereby the abnormal descent is corrected temporarily, may help to show whether symptoms are due to descending perineum syndrome or are in fact due to another condition.

Normally, the [[Anus|anal margin]] lies just below a line drawn between the [[coccyx]] (tailbone) and the [[pubic symphysis]]. In descending perineum syndrome the [[anal canal]] is situated several cm below this imaginary line, or it descends 3–4&amp;nbsp;cm during straining.

[[Defecography]] may also demonstrate abnormal perineal descent.&lt;ref name="Baek 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baek|first=HN|author2=Hwang, YH |author3=Jung, YH |title=Clinical Significance of Perineal Descent in Pelvic Outlet Obstruction Diagnosed by using Defecography.|journal=Journal of the Korean Society of Coloproctology|date=December 2010|volume=26|issue=6|pages=395–401|pmid=21221239|doi=10.3393/jksc.2010.26.6.395|pmc=3017974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Surgical treatments may be used to treat the condition, and include retro-rectal levatorplasty, post-anal repair, retro-anal levator plate myorrhaphy.&lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt;
==Epidemiology==
The condition mainly occurs in women, and it is thought by some to be one of the main defects encountered problem in [[perineology]].&lt;ref name="Beco 2008" /&gt;

The '''Durham-Humphrey Amendment''' explicitly defined two specific categories for medications, legend ([[prescription drug|prescription]]) and [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] (OTC). This amendment was co-sponsored by then Senator (and later Vice President) [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Jr., who was a pharmacist in South Dakota before beginning his political career.&lt;ref name="FDA_Hist"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/centennial/this_week/43_oct_22_oct_28.html This Week In FDA History...] Accessed 1 Apr 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The other sponsor of this amendment was [[Carl Durham]], a pharmacist representing North Carolina in the House of Representatives.

The bill requires any drug that is habit-forming or potentially harmful to be dispensed under the supervision of a health practitioner as a prescription drug and must carry the statement, "Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without a prescription."&lt;ref name="FDA_Hist"/&gt; 

Until this law, there was no requirement that any drug be labeled for sale by prescription only. The amendment defined prescription drugs as those unsafe for [[self-medication]] and which should therefore be used only under a doctor's supervision.&lt;ref name="drug_law_evo"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/FDAC/special/newdrug/benlaw.html The Evolution of U.S. Drug Law] Accessed 1 Apr 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend drugs must be dispensed with direct medical supervision, but over-the-counter drugs can be purchased and used without a prescription.

The law also legalized verbal transmission of prescriptions and provided for the legal right of a pharmacist to refill prescriptions as indicated in a provider's initial prescription.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8041">The '''Easterlin Paradox''' is a finding in [[happiness economics]] formulated in 1974 by [[Richard Easterlin]], then professor of economics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and the first economist to study happiness data.&lt;ref name="Easterlin1974"&gt;{{cite book|last=Easterlin|year=1974|chapter=Does Economic Growth Improve the Human Lot? Some Empirical Evidence|editor1=Paul A. David|editor2=Melvin W. Reder|title=Nations and Households in Economic Growth: Essays in Honor of Moses Abramovitz|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|chapterurl=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/04/16/business/Easterlin1974.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paradox states that at a point in time happiness varies directly with income both among and within nations, but over time happiness does not trend upward as income continues to grow. It is the contradiction between the point-of-time and time series findings that is the root of the Paradox.  Various theories have been advanced to explain the Paradox, but the Paradox itself is solely an empirical generalization.

== Evidence ==
The original evidence for the Paradox was United States data. Subsequently, supporting findings were given for other developed nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Easterlin |first1=Richard |title=Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization |date=1995 |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=35-48 |doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently for less developed countries and countries transitioning from socialism to capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Easterlin |first1=Richard |title=Paradox Lost? |journal=Review of Behavioral Economics |date=2017 |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=311-339 |doi=10.1561/105.00000068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original conclusion for the United States was based on data from 1946 to 1970; later evidence through 2014 confirmed the initial finding—the trend in United States happiness has been flat or even slightly negative over a roughly seven decades stretch in which real incomes more than tripled.

The time series conclusion of the Paradox refers to long term trends.  As the economy expands and contracts, fluctuations in happiness occur together with those in income&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiTella, R., R. J. MacCulloch, and A. J. Oswald |title=Preferences Over Inflation and Unemployment: Evidence from Surveys of Happiness |journal=American Economic Review |date=2001 |volume=91 |issue=1 |page=335-341 |doi=10.1257/aer.91.1.335}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfers |first1=Justin |title=Is Business Cycle Volatility Costly? Evidence from Surveys of Subjective Well-Being. |journal=International Finance |date=2003 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=1-26 |doi=10.1111/1468-2362.00112}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but the fluctuations in income occur around a rising trend line, whereas those in happiness take place around a horizontal trend line. The Paradox refers, not to the fluctuations, but to the absence of a synchronous relation between the trends.  

==Criticism==
Objections to the Paradox focus on the time series generalization, that trends in happiness and income are not related. In a 2008 article economists [[Betsey Stevenson]] and [[Justin Wolfers]] state that “the core of the Easterlin paradox lies in Easterlin’s failure to isolate statistically significant relationships between average levels of happiness and economic growth through time,” and present time series evidence of a significant positive statistical association between happiness and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevenson, B., and J. Wolfers |title=Economic Growth and Subjective Well-Being:  Reassessing the Easterlin Paradox. |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity |date=2008 |volume=1 |page=1-87 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27561613.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 article by the same authors and Daniel Sacks returns to this time series criticism with new data, though at times the article asserts that the Paradox is a contradiction between two types of cross section evidence -- data for persons and for countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks, D. W., B. Stevenson, and J. Wolfers |title=“Subjective Well-Being, Income, Economic Development, and Growth.” In …and the Pursuit of Happiness: Well-Being and the Role of Government. |date=2012 |publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs |location=London |page=59-97 |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/IEA%20Pursuit%20of%20Happiness%20web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of economics, two founding fathers in the study of self-reported happiness, [[Ed Diener]] in psychology, and [[Ruut Veenhoven]] in sociology, have each, with their collaborators, also presented evidence of a significantly positive time series relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diener, E., L. Tay, and S. Oishi |title=Rising Income and the Subjective Well-Being of Nations. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=104 |issue=2 |page=267-276}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Veenhoven, R. and F. Vergunst |title=The Easterlin Illusion: Economic Growth Does Go with Greater Happiness |journal=International Journal of Happiness and Development |date=2014 |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=311-343 |doi=10.1504/IJHD.2014.066115}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rebuttal by Easterlin points out that these studies do not focus on identifying long term trends; rather, they are based on time series that are short or have only two observations –in both cases insufficient observations to establish a trend. The positive association they present is that between the fluctuations in happiness and income, not the trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Easterlin |first1=Richard |title=Paradox Lost? |journal=Review of Behavioral Economics |date=2017 |volume=4 |issue=4 |page=311-339 |doi=10.1561/105.00000068}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is sometimes said that the flattening of the happiness trend occurs after some minimum level of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Layard, R., A. Clark, and C. Senik |title=“The Causes of Happiness and Misery”.  In World Happiness Report 2012. |date=2012 |publisher=Sustainable Development Solutions Network |url=http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2012/}}&lt;/ref&gt; No time series evidence has been advanced to support this claim, and time series for China and Japan, both of which start from low income levels, give no indication of a threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Easterlin |first1=Richard |title=Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization |date=1995 |volume=27 |issue=1 |page=35-48 |doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Easterlin, R.

{{Taxation}}
A '''fat tax''' is a [[tax]] or [[fee|surcharge]] that is placed upon fattening food, beverages or on overweight individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/06/13/another-thing-big-in-japan-measuring-waistlines/|title=Another Thing Big In Japan: Measuring Waistlines|first=Shirley S.|last=Wang|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an example of [[Pigovian tax]]ation. A fat tax aims to discourage [[Healthy diet#Unhealthy diets|unhealthy diets]] and offset the [[Obesity#Economic impact|economic costs of obesity]].

A fat tax aims to decrease the consumption of foods that are linked to [[obesity]]. A related idea is to tax foods that are linked to increased risk of [[coronary heart disease]]. Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

To implement a fat tax, it is necessary to specify which food and beverage products will be targeted. This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.&lt;ref name="Mytton, Gray, Rayner, &amp; Rutter (2007)"&gt;{{Cite journal

Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be [[regressive tax|regressive]]. Taxing foods that provide primarily [[calorie]]s, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem, since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations.  To make a fat tax less burdensome for the poor, proponents recommend earmarking the revenues to [[subsidize]] healthy foods and [[health education]].&lt;ref name="Brownell &amp; Frieden (2009)"/&gt; Additionally, proponents have argued that the fat tax is less regressive to the extent that it lowers medical expenditures and expenditures on the targeted foods among the poor.&lt;ref name="Brownell &amp; Farley"/&gt; Indeed, there is a higher incidence of diet-related illnesses among the poor than in the general population.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Unlike placing restrictions on foods or ingredients, a fat tax would not limit consumer choice, only change relative prices.

== Benefits of a fat tax ==
Public health practitioners and scholars in a range of different countries have called for a fat tax on unhealthy foods. The reasoning behind implementing a fat tax is the hope that people will avoid risky dietary behaviours, improving health outcomes in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laurance|first=Jeremy|title=Time for a fat tax?|url=https://dx.doi.org.ipacez.nd.edu.au/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60893-X|journal=The Lancet|volume=373|issue=9675|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60893-x|pages=1597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that the current obesity epidemic is increasing as a result of the fast food industry expanding. Junk food outlets are changing the dietary habits of society, pushing out traditional restaurants and leading to the detrimental health effects of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strnad{{notatypo}}|first=Jeff|date=2004-07-01|title=Conceptualizing the 'Fat Tax': The Role of Food Taxes in Developed Economies|ssrn=561321|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes on tobacco have seen smoking rates decrease, and as a result there have been calls for fat taxes to be implemented in more countries in an attempt to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
In 1942, U.S. physiologist [[A. J. Carlson]] suggested levying a fee on each pound of overweight, both to counter an "injurious luxury" and to make more food available for the war effort.&lt;ref name="Slate 2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2228713/|title=Let Them Drink Water! What a fat tax really means for America.|last=Engber|first=Daniel|date=September 21, 2009|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was reintroduced by Milton Merryweather and P. Franklin Alexander in the late 1970s, but became well known in the early 1980s by [[Kelly D. Brownell]], director of the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]].  Brownell proposed that revenue from [[junk food]] taxes be used to subsidize more healthful foods and fund nutrition campaigns.

In a 1994 Op-Ed in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Brownell noted that food costs were out of balance, with healthy foods costing more than unhealthy ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times Op-Ed piece that proposed the "fat tax" elicited controversy and outrage nationwide.  Author Kelly Brownell became the focal point of this controversy, especially from [[Rush Limbaugh]], who spoke out adamantly against the tax and the general principle of [[government intervention|governmental intrusion]] into food choices and a possible invasion of privacy.  Brownell’s proposal was listed as number seven on the list of U.S. News &amp; World Report's "16 Smart Ideas to Fix the World."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/971229/archive_008861.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205110248/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/971229/archive_008861.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-05 |title=Silver Bullets&amp;nbsp;— US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=1997-12-29 |accessdate=2012-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this and other work, Brownell was named by [[Time Magazine]] as one of the "World's Most Influential People."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975844_1976430,00.html | title= Kelly Brownell – The 2006 TIME 100 – Time | last= Huckabee | first= Mike | date= 2006-05-08 | publisher= Time | accessdate= 2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 a paper in the [[British Medical Journal]] outlined the potential impact on deaths from ischemic heart disease of a tax on the main sources of saturated fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Marshall | first=Tom

In December 2003, The [[World Health Organization]] proposed that nations consider taxing junk foods to encourage people to make healthier food choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the WHO report, "Several countries use fiscal measures to promote availability of and access to certain foods; others use taxes to increase or decrease consumption of food; and some use public funds and subsidies to promote access among poor communities to recreational and sporting facilities."

Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs for the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]], said his nonprofit nutrition advocacy organization welcomed the recommendations and has spent years fighting for measures like a Junk Food Tax.  The proposal got more traction when New York Assemblyman Felix Ortiz proposed taxes on junk food and entertainment contributing to [[sedentary lifestyle]]s to fund nutrition and exercise programs. It should also be remembered {{weasel inline|date=February 2013}} that taxing foodstuffs is not an argument for increasing taxation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Other taxes can be reduced commensurately if the overall objective is to keep the tax take neutral. The fat tax is an argument for raising taxes on activities that we prefer to discourage (consumption of certain foodstuffs) rather than raising taxes on socially desirable activities. Therefore, opponents of this type of taxation must identify which taxes are preferable to taxing these foodstuffs.{{Original research inline |date=February 2013}}

Other advocates of the tax, such as [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nihcm.org/pdf/ExpertVoices_Gruber_April2010.pdf | title=Taxing Sin to Modify Behavior and Raise Revenue | date=April 2010 | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to the effect taxes have had on [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] use. Five studies published between 1981 and 1998 found that drinking declined as the price of alcohol increased.  The same holds for tobacco. In California in 1988, Proposition 99 increased the state tax by 25 cents per cigarette pack and allocated a minimum of 20% of revenue to fund anti-tobacco education. From 1988 to 1993, the state saw tobacco use decline by 27%, three times better than the U.S. average.

A CBS News poll from January 2010 reported that a tax on items such as soft drinks and foods considered to be junk food, is opposed 60% to 38%. An even larger number, 72% of Americans, also believed that a tax would not actually help people lose weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CBS News|title=Poll: Most Oppose Tax on Junk Food|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=January 9, 2010|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2010/01/07/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry6068825.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the question of whether or not taxation influences diet is an empirical question and not simply a matter of public opinion. While a February 2010 poll by the [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] found that [[New York City]] residents overwhelmingly favor a soft drink tax, with 76 percent wanting the tax, and 22 percent opposing it.  The poll found both Republicans and Democrats favor the tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ny1.com/1-all-boroughs-news-content/news_beats/politics/113892/poll-shows-voters-sweeten-to-idea-of-sugary-drink-tax/ New York 1 News, Poll Shows Voters Sweeten To Idea Of Sugary Drink Tax]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] implemented the 'metabo' law which included the measurement of waist sizes in 2008 in attempt to overcome increasing obesity rates. ''The New York Times'' wrote: "To reach its goals of shrinking the overweight population by 10 percent over the next four years and 25 percent over the next seven years, the government will impose financial penalties on companies and local governments that fail to meet specific targets. The country’s Ministry of Health argues that the campaign will keep the spread of diseases like [[diabetes]] and [[stroke]]s in check."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/world/asia/13fat.html Japan, Seeking Trim Waists, Measures Millions] June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 'metabo' law involved conducting an annual waist measurement check of people aged between 40 and 75, which was administered by employers and local government.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/11/japans-fat-tax.html|title=Overcoming Bias : Japan’s Fat Tax|website=www.overcomingbias.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of employers and local government was to ensure there was a minimum of 65% participation, with a goal to decrease Japan's obesity rates by 25% by 2015 and failure to meet these goals results in a fine.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Denmark===
In October 2011, [[Denmark]] introduced a fat tax on butter, milk, cheese, pizza, meat, oil and processed food if the item contains more than 2.3% saturated fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Denmark introduces world's first food fat tax|date=October 1, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2011|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15137948}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2012, the Danish Tax Ministry announced it would abolish the fat tax,&lt;ref name="denmark-repeals-fattax"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title=Denmark to abolish tax on high-fat foods |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20280863  |date=11 November 2012 |accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that it failed to change Danes' eating habits, had encouraged cross border trading, put Danish jobs at risk and had been a bureaucratic nightmare for producers and outlets.&lt;ref name="denmark-repeals-fattax" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=ABC News |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-11/denmark-to-scrap-world27s-first-fat-tax/4365176 |title=Denmark to scrap world's first fat tax |date=11 November 2012 |accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of Denmark's fat tax was also due to financial reasons, with politicians identifying the fat tax as a funding source for the government, rather than a health initiative that attempted to improve the health outcomes of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bødker|first=M|date=2015|title=The rise and fall of the world's first fat tax.|pmid=25840733|journal=Health Policy|doi=10.1016/j.healthpol.2015.03.003|volume=119|pages=737–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed sugar tax plans were also scrapped.&lt;ref name="nytimesfat" /&gt;

[[Mette Gjerskov]], the Danish minister of food, agriculture and fisheries, stated that "the fat tax is one of the most criticized we had in a long time. Now we have to try to improve public health by other means.” Although the tax resulted in an additional $216 million in revenue, it also led to numerous complaints from Danish retailers that their customers were taking their business to other countries, such as Sweden and Germany, to take advantage of their lower prices.&lt;ref name="nytimesfat"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/global/fat-tax-in-denmark-is-repealed-after-criticism.html ‘Fat Tax’ in Denmark Is Repealed After Criticism] by Stephanie Strom, ''The New York Times'', November 12, 2012.

'''Fertility medication''', better known as '''fertility drugs''', are drugs which enhance reproductive [[fertility]]. For women, fertility medication is used to stimulate [[ovarian follicle|follicle]] development of the [[ovary]]. There are currently very few fertility medication options available for men.

Agents that enhance ovarian activity can be classified as either [[Gonadotropin releasing hormone]], [[Estrogen]] [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] or [[Gonadotropins]].

==Female==

===Gonadotropin-releasing hormone===
{{Main|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone}}

Either [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) or any [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]] (i.e. Lupron) may be used. GnRH stimulates the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the anterior pituitary in the body.

===Oestrogen antagonists===
Fertility medication inhibiting the effects of [[estrogen]] includes [[Clomiphene]] and [[Aromatase inhibitor]]s.

====Clomiphene====
{{Main|Clomiphene}}
[[Clomiphene]] (trademarked as '''Clomid''') is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). It is the most widely used fertility drug. It is used as an [[Ovulation induction|ovarian stimulator]] by inhibiting the negative feedback of estrogen at the hypothalamus. As the negative feedback of estrogen is inhibited, the hypothalamus secretes GnRh  which in turn stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete LH and FSH which help in ovulation.

====Aromatase inhibitors====
{{Main|Aromatase inhibitor}}
Although primarily a breast cancer treatment, [[aromatase inhibitor]]s can also work as fertility medication, probably through a mechanism similar to clomiphene.

===Gonadotropins===
{{Main|Gonadotropin preparations}}
[[Gonadotropins]] are the hormones in the body that normally stimulate the [[gonads]] (testes and ovaries). For medication, they can be extracted from urine or by genetic modification.

For example, the so-called [[menotropin]]s consist of [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] extracted from human [[urine]] from [[menopausal]] women.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Menotropins}}&lt;/ref&gt; FSH and FSH analogues are mainly used for [[Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation|ovarian hyperstimulation]] as well as reversal of [[anovulation]].

There are also recombinant variants which are created by inserting the DNA coding for it into bacteriae. The bacterial DNA is then called [[Recombinant DNA]]. Examples of recombinant FSH are Follistim and Gonal F, while Luveris is a recombinant LH.

===Human chorionic gonadotropin===
{{Main|Human chorionic gonadotropin#Use as medication}}
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is normally produced during pregnancy. However, it can also replace LH as an [[ovulation inducer]].

===Other===
hMG is a medication containing a [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and a lutenizing hormone (LH).

==Male==
There currently are no effective medications to treat [[oligospermia]], so other [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive technologies]] are used.

Research in male fertility medication is currently ongoing. A study in Egypt assessed the efficacy of a combination of [[clomiphene]] and [[vitamin E]] in improving [[sperm count]] and [[sperm motility]] in [[male infertility]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghanem H et al. Combination clomiphene and antioxidant therapy for idiopathic male infertility: A randomized controlled trial. Fertil Steril 2009 Mar 5; [e-pub ahead of print]. Published in Journal Watch General Medicine March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Estrogen antagonists and gonadotropins may stimulate multiple follicles and other ovarian hormones leading to [[multiple birth]] and possible [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]].

'''''Health Education &amp; Behavior''''' is a bimonthly [[peer-reviewed]] [[healthcare journal]] covering applied [[Behavioral science|behavioral]] and [[social science]] in [[public health]] published by [[SAGE Publications]]. It is an official journal of the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE).

==History==
The journal was established in 1957 as ''Health Education Monographs'' which was produced on an occasional basis with no set publishing schedule until 1974, when it became a quarterly publication with standard volume numbering and pagination.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zimmerman |first=M. A. |date=2016-07-01 |title=Message From the Editor |journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1177/109019819802500101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue of 1974 became volume 2, issue 1. All previous issues covering issues 1 to 36, from 1957 to 1973, were designated to constitute volume 1. During this period, ''Health Education Monographs'' was printed by various small publishing companies or cooperatively by SOPHE and the [[World Health Organization]]. No volume was published in 1979 due to extensive ongoing changes, including a new publisher, editor, and format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1980, the journal was renamed ''Health Education Quarterly'' and a publication agreement was negotiated with Human Sciences Press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] became the publisher with volume 10 in 1983 and the journal changed to its present publisher, SAGE Publications, in 1995. In 1997, the journal expanded to six issues annually to accommodate the growing volume of submissions and was renamed ''Health Education &amp; Behavior''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed by [[CAB Abstracts]], [[CINAHL]], [[Current Contents]]/Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences, [[Global Health]], [[Index Medicus]]/[[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]], [[ProQuest|ProQuest databases]], [[Psychological Abstracts]], [[PsycINFO]], [[PsycLIT]], [[SafetyLit]], [[Scopus]], [[Social Sciences Citation Index]], and [[Sociological Abstracts]]. According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal's 2015 [[impact factor]] is 2.312.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2016 |chapter=Health Education &amp; Behavior|title=2015 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Social Sciences |series=[[Web of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy has risen by two years for males and females in Vietnam between 2000 and 2012.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/countries/vnm.pdf?ua=1|title=Viet Nam: WHO statistical profile|last=|first=|date=January 2015|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|access-date=Oct 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is half of the average rise in life expectancy for other parts of the world during the same time period.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Malnutrition]] is still common in the provinces, and the life expectancy and [[infant mortality]] rates are stagnating. In 2001 government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government subsidies covered only about 20 percent of health care expenses, with the remaining 80 percent coming out of individuals’ own pockets.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf Vietnam country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, almost 22% of deaths could be attributed to strokes. This leading cause of death was followed by heart disease with 7% of deaths, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with 4.9% of deaths.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The two largest risk factors for adults are tobacco use and raised blood pressure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Contraception is widely used and most births are attended to by trained healthcare providers. Only about 60% of women receive antenatal care during their pregnancies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Issues ==
Beginning in the late 1980s, the quality of health care began to decline as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has led to delays in planned upgrades to [[water supply]] and [[sewage]] systems. Consequently, almost half the population has no access to clean water, a deficiency that promotes such infectious diseases as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]]. Additionally, inadequate funding has contributed to a shortage of [[nurses]], [[midwives]], and hospital beds. In 2000 Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, a very low ratio among Asian nations, according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Government expenditure on health has declined and the health system is largely financed through user-fees which has direct implications for the rural poor, deterring them from accessing health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huong|first=D|title=Ensuring health care for the rural poor: Social aims and commercial means in Vietnam and China|journal=Int J of Health Services|year=2007|volume=37|issue=3|pages=555–572|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/ensuring-health-care-for-the-rural-poor-social-aims-and-comm.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|display-authors=etal|doi=10.2190/h0l2-8004-6182-6826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agent Orange ===
Several health defects have been correlated with the use of the chemical dioxin, also known as [[Agent Orange]], during the [[Vietnam War|Resistance War Against America]] (Vietnam War). Dioxin was used in the war as a [[defoliant]] and is now considered a carcinogen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dwyer|first1=J. H.|last2=Flesch-Janys|first2=D.|title=Agent Orange in Vietnam|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1995|volume=85|issue=4|doi=10.2105/ajph.85.4.476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major differences in dioxin levels have been measured in the blood and breast milk of those living in areas that had been sprayed with Agent Orange when compared to other areas of Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This carcinogen is associated with tumors, immune deficiency, reproductive and developmental disorders, nervous system defects, and a variety of other birth defects including [[Spina bifida]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/29/13/22/agent-orange|title=Agent Orange|date=2016|website=American Public Health Association: For science. For action. For health.|publisher=American Public Health Association|access-date=Oct 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent Orange continues to be a risk factor in Vietnam today because of its continued presence in soil, wildlife, and food.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the effects continue to be seen in generations born to those exposed to Agent orange.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Beginning in 2007, Vietnam Veterans are now compensated for detrimental health effects due to Exposure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Malaria ===
Vietnam has made progress in combating [[malaria]], for which the mortality rate declined sharply, to about 5 percent of the rate in the early 1990s, after the country introduced antimalarial drugs and treatment.

=== Tuberculosis ===
The Viet Nam National Tuberculosis Control Program (NTP) worked with a control strategy recommended by the World Health Organization to lower [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) rates, and successfully exceeded target goals in 1997.&lt;sup&gt;[[Health in Vietnam#cite note-:0-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; However, although there was a decrease in TB incidence among women and persons over 35, the rates of Tuberculosis among young men in Vietnam significantly increased during this time, causing a stabilization of the overall rate.&lt;sup&gt;[[Health in Vietnam#cite note-:0-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; According to the World Health Organization, Vietnam has the 12th highest incidence of Tuberculosis worldwide. There are an estimated 89 positive cases for every 100,000 individuals.&lt;sup&gt;[[Health in Vietnam#cite note-:0-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; With an intensified vaccination program, better [[hygiene]], and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to sharply reduce the number of TB cases and annual number of new infections.&lt;sup&gt;[[Health in Vietnam#cite note-cp-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

A 2012 study of tuberculosis control in Vietnam identified a shortcoming in the current strategy of attending solely to symptomatic patients, as it has not been marked by any significant decrease in TB rates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Gregory|last2=Viet Nhung|first2=Nguyen|last3=Ngoc Sy|first3=Dinh|last4=Thi Lien|first4=Luu|last5=Kim Cuong|first5=Nguyen|last6=Britton|first6=Warwick|last7=Marks|first7=Guy|year=2012|title=Contact Investigation in Households of Patients with Tuberculosis in Hanoi, Vietnam: A Prospective Cohort Study|url=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|pages=1–7|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the authors of the research advocated for a strategy of contact tracing that would focus on household members of Tuberculosis patients in Hanoi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study found a high incidence of TB rates in the household contacts tested and concluded that household contact investigation would be a feasible disease management strategy in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== HIV and AIDS ===
As of January 2005, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) and 9,554 died. But the actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher. An average of 40–50 new infections are reported every day in Vietnam. Vietnam hopes to contain the HIV infection rate at the current official rate of 0.35 percent, which is about average worldwide, by limiting the disease as much as possible to sex workers and intravenous drug users. However, if the current trend continues, the number of infected persons could reach 1 million by 2010. One of the impediments to containing HIV/AIDS is that the victims face discrimination and stigmatization that are more severe than almost anywhere else in the world, according to a [[United Nations]] official. However non-governmental organizations, like the  [http://www.scdi.org.vn/?slangid=en-US Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI)] for example, are devoted to improve the situation and quality of life of HIV/AIDS affected people. In June 2004, the Bush Administration announced that Vietnam would be one of 15 nations to receive funding as part of a US$15 billion global AIDS plan.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

=== Dengue Fever ===
Vietnam experienced a boom of dengue fever when 181,054 infection cases and 30 deaths were reported in almost localities in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. As many as 14,079 dengue fever cases with three deaths have been reported this year so far across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://english.vov.vn/society/three-deaths-of-dengue-fever-reported-so-far-in-2018-372338.vov|title=Three deaths of dengue fever reported so far in 2018|date=2018-04-10|work=VOV - VOV Online Newspaper|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome''''' is a condition caused by mutations in the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox ([[ADNP (gene)|ADNP]]) gene.&lt;ref name=VanDijck2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Dijck A, Vulto-van Silfhout AT, Cappuyns E, van der Werf IM, Mancini GM, Tzschach A, Bernier R, Gozes I, Eichler EE, Romano C, Lindstrand A, Nordgren A, Kvarnung M, Kleefstra T, de Vries BB, Küry S, Rosenfeld JA, Meuwissen ME, Vandeweyer G, Kooy RF | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical Presentation of a Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder Caused by Mutations in ADNP | journal = Biological Psychiatry | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29724491 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.02.1173 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This condition is rare with &lt;100 cases described up to 2018. 

==Genetics==

This condition is caused by mutations in the ADNP gene. This gene is located on the long arm of [[chromosome 20]] (20q13.13).

==Pathogensis==

The ANDP gene is involved in the [[autophagy]] pathway. Its precise role in this process is under active investigation.

==Clinical features==

These are variable and include autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and hypotonia. 

==Diagnosis==

This is made by sequencing the ADNP gene.

==Treatment==

Treatment is symptomatic. This may include speech, occupational, and physical therapy and specialized learning programs depending on individual needs.

Treatment of neuropsychiatric features may also be needed.

Nutritional support is sometimes needed. 

Treatment of the ophthalmologic and cardiac finding that may co exist is also indicated.

==History==

The gene was described in 1999.

===Notes===

ADNP has been associated with abnormalities in the autophagy pathway in [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=Sragovich2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sragovich S, Merenlender-Wagner A, Gozes I | title = ADNP Plays a Key Role in Autophagy: From Autism to Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease | journal = BioEssays | volume = 39 | issue = 11 | pages = 1700054 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28940660 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201700054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard John Clinebell''' (June 3, 1922&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitts.emory.edu/Archives/text/mss254.html Clinebell, Howard John] in Pitts Theology Library Archives and Manuscripts Dept.&lt;/ref&gt; – April 13, 2005) was a minister in the [[United Methodist Church]] and a professor in [[pastoral counseling]]. He pioneered a counseling approach that combined [[psychotherapy]] and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Article is based on {{cite web | last = Rourke | first = Mary | title = Howard Clinebell Jr., 83; Minister Advocated Combining Religion, Psychotherapy to Treat Addiction | year = 2005 | publisher = Los Angeles Times | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/14/local/me-clinebell14 | accessdate = 2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==

Howard Clinebell was born in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[Illinois]] on June 3, 1922 to Howard J. and Clem (Whittenberg) Clinebell. He "graduated from [[DePauw University]] in [[Indiana]] and [[Garrett Theological Seminary]] in Illinois. He earned a doctorate at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Rourke | first = Mary | title = Howard Clinebell Jr., 83; Minister Advocated Combining Religion, Psychotherapy to Treat Addiction | year = 2005 | publisher = Los Angeles Times | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/14/local/me-clinebell14 | accessdate = 2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition he studied psychotherapy at the [[William White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychoanalysis]] in New York City.

In the mid-1950s Clinebell joined the staff at the First United Methodist Church in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. He went on to become counselor at Methodist Hospital in [[Arcadia]]. In 1959 he joined the [[Claremont School of Theology|Claremont faculty]] as a professor of pastoral psychology. Clinebell retired in 1988.

Clinebell is author or co-author of more than 20 books of which the most influential are "Understanding and Counseling the Alcoholic Through Religion and Psychology" (1956) and "Basic Types of Pastoral Counseling" (1966, revised edition "Basic Types of Pastoral Care and Counseling" 1984). With his book on counseling of alcoholics Clinebell introduced the concept to view alcoholism as a disease rather than a character deficiency in religious circles. As one of the fathers of the  pastoral counseling movement Clinebell was an early advocate of training in psychotherapy for seminarians aiming to work as counselors. He was a founding member of the [[American Association of Pastoral Counselors]].

Besides pastoral counseling Clinebell addressed topics like personal problems in the context of relationships, the effects of social systems on individual lives, and the relationship of human beings to the environment.

Clinebell died April 13, 2005 of complications from Parkinson's disease at Vista del Monte Retirement Community in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Hydrocephalus''' is a condition in which an accumulation of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) occurs within the brain.&lt;ref name=NIH2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm|title=Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet|date=April 5, 2016|website=NINDS|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727231854/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm|archivedate=27 July 2016|deadurl=no|accessdate=5 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This typically causes increased [[intracranial pressure|pressure inside the skull]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Older people may have [[headache]]s, [[double vision]], poor balance, [[urinary incontinence]], personality changes, or [[mental impairment]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; In babies, it may be seen as a rapid increase in head size.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Other symptoms may include [[vomiting]], sleepiness, [[seizures]], and downward pointing of the eyes.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Hydrocephalus can occur due to [[birth defect]]s or be acquired later in life.&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Associated birth defects include [[neural tube defects]] and those that result in [[aqueductal stenosis]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kahle|first1=KT|last2=Kulkarni|first2=AV|last3=Limbrick DD|first3=Jr|last4=Warf|first4=BC|title=Hydrocephalus in children.|journal=Lancet|date=20 February 2016|volume=387|issue=10020|pages=788–99|pmid=26256071|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60694-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes include [[meningitis]], [[brain tumors]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[intraventricular hemorrhage]], and [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; The four types of hydrocephalus are communicating, noncommunicating, ''ex vacuo'', and [[normal pressure hydrocephalus|normal pressure]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt; Diagnosis is typically made by examination and [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=NIH2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Hydrocephalus CDC.png|thumb|400px|Illustration showing different effects of hydrocephalus on the brain and cranium]]
The clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with [[chronicity]]. Acute dilatation of the [[ventricular system]] is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. By contrast, chronic dilatation (especially in the elderly population) may have a more insidious onset presenting, for instance, with [[Hakim's triad]] (Adams triad).

Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may include [[headache]]s, [[vomiting]], [[nausea]], [[papilledema]], [[somnolence|sleepiness]], or [[coma]]. Elevated intracranial pressure may result in [[brain herniation|uncal or tonsillar herniation]], with resulting life-threatening [[brain stem]] compression.

Hakim's triad of [[gait]] instability, [[urinary incontinence]], and [[dementia]] is a relatively typical manifestation of the distinct entity [[normalpressure hydrocephalus|normal-pressure hydrocephalus]]. Focal neurological deficits may also occur, such as [[abducens nerve]] palsy and vertical [[gaze palsy]] ([[Parinaud syndrome]] due to compression of the [[quadrigeminal plate]], where the neural centers coordinating the [[Conjugate eye movement|conjugated vertical eye movement]] are located). The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage, the person's age, and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling.

In infants with hydrocephalus, CSF builds up in the central nervous system, causing the [[fontanelle]] (soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected. Early symptoms may also include:
* Eyes that appear to gaze downward
* Irritability
* Seizures
* Separated sutures
* Sleepiness
* Vomiting

Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:
* Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry
* Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think
* Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing
* Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements
* Difficulty feeding
* Excessive sleepiness
* Headache
* Irritability, poor temper control
* Loss of bladder control ([[urinary incontinence]])
* Loss of coordination and trouble walking
* Muscle spasticity ([[spasm]])
* Slow growth (child 0–5 years)
* Slow or restricted movement
* Vomiting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001571.htm|title=Hydrocephalus|vauthors=((Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine)), ((Also reviewed David Zieve, MD, MHA, Bethanne Black, and the A.D.A.M. Editorial team.))|work=nih.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616134243/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001571.htm|archivedate=2010-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because hydrocephalus can injure the brain, thought and behavior may be adversely affected. [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]] including [[Amnesia|short-term memory loss]] are common among those with hydrocephalus, who tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ, which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} However, the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals, and some are of average or above-average intelligence. Someone with hydrocephalus may have coordination and visual problems, problems with coordination, or clumsiness. They may reach puberty earlier than the average child (see [[precocious puberty]]). About one in four develops [[epilepsy]].

==Cause==

===Congenital===
[[File:Hydrocephalus with sunset eyes.jpg|thumb|A 1ne-year-old girl with hydrocephalus showing "sunset eyes", before shunt surgery]]
Congenital hydrocephalus is present in the infant prior to birth, meaning the fetus developed hydrocephalus ''[[in utero]]'' during [[fetal development]]. The most common cause of congenital hydrocephalus is [[aqueductal stenosis]], which occurs when the narrow passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the brain is blocked or too narrow to allow sufficient cerebral spinal fluid to drain. Fluid accumulates in the upper ventricles, causing hydrocephalus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydroassoc.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820210617/http://www.hydroassoc.org/ |date=2006-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes of congenital hydrocephalus include [[neural tube|neural-tube]] defects, [[Arachnoid cyst|arachnoid cysts]], [[Dandy-Walker syndrome]], and [[Arnold-Chiari malformation]].
The [[Cranial bone|cranial bones]] fuse by the end of the third year of life. For head enlargement to occur, hydrocephalus must occur before then. The causes are usually genetic, but can also be acquired and usually occur within the first few months of life, which include intraventricular matrix hemorrhages in [[premature infants]], infections,  type II Arnold-Chiari malformation, aqueduct atresia and stenosis, and Dandy-Walker malformation.

In newborns and toddlers with hydrocephalus, the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile. Since the skull bones have not yet firmly joined together, bulging, firm [[anterior fontanelle|anterior]] and [[posterior fontanelle]]s may be present even when the patient is in an upright position.

The infant exhibits fretfulness, poor feeding, and frequent vomiting. As the hydrocephalus progresses, [[torpor]] sets in, and infants show lack of interest in their surroundings. Later on, their upper eyelids become retracted and their eyes are turned downwards ("sunset eyes") (due to hydrocephalic pressure on the [[mesencephalic tegmentum]] and [[paralysis]] of upward gaze). Movements become weak and the arms may become [[Tremor|tremulous]]. [[Papilledema]] is absent, but vision may be reduced. The head becomes so enlarged that they eventually may be bedridden.

About 80–90% of fetuses or newborn infants with [[spina bifida]]—often associated with [[meningocele]] or [[myelomeningocele]]—develop hydrocephalus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spinabifidamoms.com/english/about.html |title=wwww.spinabifidamoms.com |publisher=Spinabifidamoms.com |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101014750/http://www.spinabifidamoms.com/english/about.html |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired===
This condition is acquired as a consequence of CNS [[infections]], [[meningitis]], [[brain tumors]], [[traumatic brain injury|head trauma]], [[toxoplasmosis]], or [[stroke|intracranial hemorrhage]] (subarachnoid or intraparenchymal), and is usually painful.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Type==
The cause of hydrocephalus is not known with certainty and is probably multifactorial. It may be caused by impaired [[cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]] flow, reabsorption, or excessive CSF production.

*Obstruction to CSF flow hinders its free passage through the ventricular system and [[subarachnoid space]] (e.g., [[stenosis]] of the [[cerebral aqueduct]] or obstruction of the [[interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|interventricular foramina]]) secondary to [[tumor]]s, [[hemorrhage]]s, [[infection]]s or [[congenital]] malformations) and can cause increases in [[central nervous system]] pressure.
*Hydrocephalus can also be caused by overproduction of CSF (relative obstruction) (e.g., [[choroid plexus papilloma]], villous [[hypertrophy]]).&lt;ref name="AdunkaBuchman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oliver Adunka|author2=Craig Buchman|title=Otology, Neurotology, and Lateral Skull Base Surgery: An Illustrated Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kv-Z-L5UUAC&amp;pg=PT353|accessdate=12 August 2013|date=11 October 2010|publisher=Thieme|isbn=978-3-13-149621-8|pages=353–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705102607/http://books.google.com/books?id=2kv-Z-L5UUAC&amp;pg=PT353|archivedate=5 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20367337"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3171/2009.10.peds08454 |pmid=20367337 |title=Single-stage bilateral choroid plexectomy for choroid plexus papilloma in a patient presenting with high cerebrospinal fluid output |journal=Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=342–5 |year=2010 |last1=Nimjee |first1=Shahid M |last2=Powers |first2=Ciaran J |last3=McLendon |first3=Roger E |last4=Grant |first4=Gerald A |last5=Fuchs |first5=Herbert E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bilateral [[Ureter|ureteric]] obstruction is a rare, but reported, cause of hydrocephalus.

Based on its underlying mechanisms, hydrocephalus can be classified into communicating and noncommunicating (obstructive). Both forms can be either congenital or acquired.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Communicating===
Communicating hydrocephalus, also known as nonobstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by impaired CSF reabsorption in the absence of any CSF-flow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. This may be due to functional impairment of the [[arachnoid villi|arachnoidal granulations]] (also called arachnoid granulations or [[Pacchioni's granulations]]), which are located along the [[superior sagittal sinus]], and is the site of CSF reabsorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis, and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Noncommunicating===
Noncommunicating hydrocephalus, or obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by a CSF-flow obstruction. 
*[[Interventricular foramina (neural anatomy)|Foramen of Monro]] obstruction may lead to dilation of one, or if large enough (e.g., in [[colloid cyst]]), both lateral ventricles.
*The [[Cerebral aqueduct|aqueduct of Sylvius]], normally narrow, may be obstructed by a number of genetically or acquired lesions (e.g., atresia, [[ependymitis]], hemorrhage, tumor) and lead to dilation of both lateral ventricles, as well as the [[third ventricle]].
*[[Fourth ventricle]] obstruction leads to dilatation of the aqueduct, as well as the lateral and third ventricles (e.g., [[Chiari malformation]]).
*The [[foramina of Luschka]] and [[Median aperture|foramen of Magendie]] may be obstructed due to congenital malformation (e.g., [[Dandy-Walker malformation]]).

===Other===
[[File:BrainAtrophy(exvacuo).png|thumb|Hydrocephalus ex vacuo from vascular dementia as seen on MRI]]
*[[Normal pressure hydrocephalus]] (NPH) is a particular form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus, characterized by enlarged cerebral ventricles, with only intermittently elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Characteristic triad of symptoms are; dementia, apraxic gait and urinary incontinence. The diagnosis of NPH can be established only with the help of continuous intraventricular pressure recordings (over 24 hours or even longer), since more often than not instant measurements yield normal pressure values. Dynamic compliance studies may be also helpful. Altered compliance ([[wiktionary:elastic#Adjective|elasticity]]) of the ventricular walls, as well as increased [[viscosity]] of the cerebrospinal fluid, may play a role in the pathogenesis.
*''Hydrocephalus ex vacuo'' also refers to an enlargement of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, and is usually due to brain [[atrophy]] (as it occurs in [[dementia]]s), post-[[traumatic brain injury|traumatic brain injuries]] and even in some psychiatric disorders, such as [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/939553425|title=Complications in neuroanesthesia|last=Hemanshu,|first=Prabhakar,|isbn=9780128040751|oclc=939553425}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to hydrocephalus, this is a compensatory enlargement of the CSF-spaces in response to brain [[parenchyma]] loss; it is not the result of increased CSF pressure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Intracerebral hemorrhage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Spontaneous [[intracerebral hemorrhage|intracerebral]] and [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] with hydrocephalus shown on CT scan&lt;ref name="Yadav07"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-2377-7-1 |title=Endoscopic management of hypertensive intraventricular haemorrhage with obstructive hydrocephalus |journal=BMC Neurology |volume=7 |year=2007 |last1=Yadav |first1=Yad Ram |last2=Mukerji |first2=Gaurav |last3=Shenoy |first3=Ravikiran |last4=Basoor |first4=Abhijeet |last5=Jain |first5=Gaurav |last6=Nelson |first6=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:3DPX-003132 Cast of Lateral ventricles in Hydrocephaly NevitDilmen.stl|thumb|3D cast of lateral ventricles in hydrocephalus]]
Hydrocephalus is usually due to blockage of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) outflow in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] or in the [[subarachnoid space]] over the brain. In a person without hydrocephalus, CSF continuously circulates through the brain, its ventricles and the [[spinal cord]] and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system. Alternatively, the condition may result from an overproduction of the CSF, from a [[congenital malformation]] blocking normal drainage of the fluid, or from complications of [[head injuries]] or infections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm "Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727231854/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/hydrocephalus/detail_hydrocephalus.htm |date=2016-07-27 }}, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually may cause neurological symptoms such as [[convulsions]], [[intellectual disability]] and [[Epileptic seizure|epileptic seizures]]. These signs occur sooner in adults, whose skulls are no longer able to expand to accommodate the increasing fluid volume within. Fetuses, infants, and young children with hydrocephalus typically have an abnormally large head, excluding the face, because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones—which have yet to fuse—to bulge outward at their [[juncture points]]. Another [[medical sign]], in infants, is a characteristic fixed downward gaze with whites of the eyes showing above the iris, as though the infant were trying to examine its own lower eyelids.&lt;ref&gt;Cabot, Richard C. (1919) ''Physical diagnosis'', William Wood and Company, New York, 7th edition, 527 pages, page 5. (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

The elevated intracranial pressure may cause compression of the brain, leading to brain damage and other complications. Conditions among affected individuals vary widely.

If the [[foramina]] of the [[fourth ventricle]] or the [[cerebral aqueduct]] are blocked, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can accumulate within the ventricles. This condition is called internal hydrocephalus and it results in increased CSF pressure. The production of CSF continues, even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked. Consequently, fluid builds inside the brain, causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the [[nervous tissue]]. Compression of the nervous tissue usually results in [[irreversible brain damage]]. If the [[human skull|skull]] bones are not completely [[ossified]] when the hydrocephalus occurs, the pressure may also severely enlarge the head. The cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of [[birth]] or may become blocked later in life because of a [[tumor]] growing in the [[brainstem]].

==Treatment==

Hydrocephalus can be successfully treated by placing a drainage tube (shunt) between the brain ventricles and abdominal cavity. Some risk exists of [[infection]] being introduced into the brain through these shunts, however, and the shunts must be replaced as the person grows. A subarachnoid hemorrhage may block the return of CSF to the circulation.

This should be distinguished from external hydrocephalus. This is a condition generally seen in infants and involving enlarged fluid spaces or subarachnoid spaces around the outside of the brain. This is generally a [[benign]] condition that resolves spontaneously by 2 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0TC9Cns4Qz8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=Greenberg+handbook+of+neurosurgery+external+hydrocephalus#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Handbook of Neurosurgery | isbn = 9781604063264 | author1 = Greenberg | first1 = Mark S | date = 2010-02-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170225063619/https://books.google.com/books?id=0TC9Cns4Qz8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=Greenberg+handbook+of+neurosurgery+external+hydrocephalus#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | archivedate = 2017-02-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imaging studies and a good medical history can help to differentiate external hydrocephalus from [[subdural hematoma|subdural hemorrhages]] or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by [[vomiting]], [[headaches]], and [[seizures]].

Hydrocephalus treatment is surgical, creating a way for the excess fluid to drain away. In the short term, an [[external ventricular drain]] (ETV), also known as an extraventricular drain or ventriculostomy, provides relief. In the long term, some patients will need any of various types of [[cerebral shunt]]. It involves the placement of a ventricular [[catheter]] (a tube made of [[silastic]]) into the [[ventricle (brain)|cerebral ventricles]] to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations and drain the excess fluid into other body cavities, from where it can be resorbed. Most shunts drain the fluid into the [[peritoneum|peritoneal cavity]] ([[cerebral shunt|ventriculoperitoneal shunt]]), but alternative sites include the [[right atrium]] ([[cerebral shunt|ventriculoatrial shunt]]), [[pleura|pleural cavity]] ([[cerebral shunt|ventriculopleural shunt]]), and [[gall bladder]]. A shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine and have the CSF redirected to the [[peritoneal cavity]] ([[lumbar-peritoneal shunt]]).&lt;ref name="pmid20508332"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0028-3886.63778 |pmid=20508332 |title=Lumbar peritoneal shunt |journal=Neurology India |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=179–84 |year=2010 |last1=Yadav |first1=Yadr |last2=Parihar |first2=Vijay |last3=Sinha |first3=Mallika }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus in selected patients is the [[endoscopic third ventriculostomy]] (ETV), whereby a surgically created opening in the floor of the third ventricle allows the CSF to flow directly to the basal cisterns, thereby shortcutting any obstruction, as in [[aqueductal stenosis]]. This may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy. For infants, ETV is sometimes combined with choroid plexus cauterization, which reduces the amount of cerebrospinal fluid produced by the brain. The technique, known as ETV/CPC was pioneered in [[Uganda]] by neurosurgeon [[Ben Warf]] and is now in use in several U.S. hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An American surgeon pioneers surgery for kids in Uganda that helps kids in the US|url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-27/american-surgeon-pioneers-surgery-kids-uganda-helps-kids-us|website = Public Radio International|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302012700/http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-04-27/american-surgeon-pioneers-surgery-kids-uganda-helps-kids-us|archivedate = 2016-03-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00138-6 |pmid=26091960 |title=Infant hydrocephalus in Africa: Spreading some good news |journal=The Lancet Neurology |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=789–790 |year=2015 |last1=Burton |first1=Adrian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shunt complication===
Examples of possible complications include shunt malfunction, shunt failure, and shunt infection, along with infection of the shunt tract following surgery (the most common reason for shunt failure is infection of the shunt tract). Although a shunt generally works well, it may stop working if it disconnects, becomes blocked (clogged) or infected, or it is outgrown. If this happens, the CSF begins to accumulate again and a number of physical symptoms develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, [[photophobia]]/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, such as [[seizure]]s. The shunt failure rate is also relatively high (of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually to treat hydrocephalus, only 30% are a patient's first surgery) and patients not uncommonly have multiple shunt revisions within their lifetimes.

Another complication can occur when CSF drains more rapidly than it is produced by the [[choroid plexus]], causing symptoms of listlessness, severe [[headaches]], [[irritability]], light sensitivity, auditory [[hyperesthesia]] (sound sensitivity), nausea, vomiting, [[dizziness]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], [[migraines]], seizures, a change in personality, [[weakness]] in the arms or legs, [[strabismus]], and [[Diplopia|double vision]] to appear when the patient is vertical. If the patient lies down, the symptoms usually vanish quickly. A [[CT scan]] may or may not show any change in ventricle size, particularly if the patient has a history of slit-like ventricles. Difficulty in diagnosing overdrainage can make treatment of this complication particularly frustrating for patients and their families. Resistance to traditional [[analgesic]] pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage or failure.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The diagnosis of CSF buildup is complex and requires specialist expertise. Diagnosis of the particular complication usually depends on when the symptoms appear, that is, whether symptoms occur when the patient is upright or in a prone position, with the head at roughly the same level as the feet.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Developing countries===
Because the shunt systems are too expensive for most people in developing countries, such people often die without getting a shunt. Worse, the rate of revision in shunt systems adds to their cost, many times over. Looking at this point, a study compares shunt systems and highlights the role of low-cost shunt systems in most of the developing countries. It compares the [[Chhabra]] shunt system to shunt systems from developed countries and finds no difference in the outcomes of procedures using the different systems.&lt;ref name="pmid15926385"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warf|first1=Benjamin C|year=2005|title=Comparison of 1-year outcomes for the Chhabra and Codman-Hakim Micro Precision shunt systems in Uganda: A prospective study in 195 children|journal=Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics|volume=102|issue=4|pages=358–62|doi=10.3171/ped.2005.102.4.0358|pmid=15926385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vimont Traite de Phrenologie 022.jpg|right|thumb|Skull of a hydrocephalic child (1800s)]]
References to hydrocephalic skulls can be found in [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|ancient Egyptian]] medical literature from 2500 BC to 500 AD.&lt;ref name=Aschoff/&gt; Hydrocephalus was described more clearly by the ancient [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]] in the fourth century BC, while a more accurate description was later given by the [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Galen]] in the second century AD.&lt;ref name=Aschoff/&gt;

The first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus appears in the ''[[Al-Tasrif]]'' (1000 AD) by the [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arab]] surgeon, [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi|Abulcasis]], who clearly described the evacuation of superficial [[intracranial]] fluid in hydrocephalic children.&lt;ref name="Aschoff"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s101430050035 |pmid=10547004 |title=The scientific history of hydrocephalus and its treatment |journal=Neurosurgical Review |volume=22 |issue=2–3 |pages=67–93; discussion 94–5 |year=1999 |last1=Aschoff |first1=A |last2=Kremer |first2=Paul |last3=Hashemi |first3=Bahram |last4=Kunze |first4=Stefan }}&lt;/ref&gt; He described it in his chapter on [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgical]] disease, describing infantile hydrocephalus as being caused by mechanical compression. He wrote:&lt;ref name="Aschoff" /&gt;

{{quote|The skull of a newborn baby is often full of liquid, either because the matron has compressed it excessively or for other, unknown reasons. The volume of the skull then increases daily, so that the bones of the skull fail to close. In this case, we must open the middle of the skull in three places, make the liquid flow out, then close the wound and tighten the skull with a bandage.}}

[[File:Hydrocephalus-baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Historical specimen of an infant with severe hydrocephalus, probably untreated|alt=Preserved corpse of a newborn with an enlarged head|left]]
In 1881, a few years after the landmark study of [[Gustaf Retzius|Retzius]] and Key, [[Carl Wernicke]] pioneered sterile ventricular puncture and external drainage of cerebrospinal fluid for the treatment of hydrocephalus.&lt;ref name="Aschoff" /&gt; It remained an intractable condition until the 20th century, when cerebral shunt and other neurosurgical treatment modalities were developed.

It is a lesser-known medical condition; relatively little research is conducted to improve treatment, and still no cure has been found. In developing countries, the condition often goes untreated at birth. Before birth, the condition is difficult to diagnose, and access to medical treatment is limited. However, when head swelling is prominent, children are taken at great expense for treatment. By then, brain tissue is undeveloped and neurosurgery is rare and difficult. Children more commonly live with undeveloped brain tissue and consequential [[Intellectual disability|intellectual disabilities and restrictions]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Society and culture==

===Awareness campaign===
[[File:Hydrocephalus ribbon two tone blue.jpg|thumb|150px|Hydrocephalus [[awareness ribbon]]]]
September was designated National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month in July 2009 by the [[U.S. Congress]] in HR373. The resolution campaign is due in part to the advocacy work of the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation, Inc. Prior to July 2009,  no awareness month for this condition had been designated. Many of the hydrocephalus organizations within the United States use various ribbon designs as a part of their awareness and fundraising activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Exceptional case===
{{main|Dandy-Walker syndrome}}
One exceptional case of hydrocephalus was a man whose brain shrank to a thin sheet of tissue, due to a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in his skull. As a child, the man had a shunt, but it was removed when he was 14. In July 2007, at age 44, he went to a hospital due to mild weakness in his left leg. When doctors learned of the man's medical history, they performed a CT scan and MRI scan, and were astonished to see "massive enlargement" of the lateral ventricles in the skull. Dr. Lionel Feuillet of Hôpital de la Timone in [[Marseille]] said, "The images were most unusual... the brain was virtually absent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,290610,00.html "Man with Almost No Brain Has Led Normal Life"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916054402/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,290610,00.html |date=2007-09-16 }}, ''Fox News'' (2007-07-25).

The patient was a married father of two children, and worked as a civil servant, leading an at least superficially normal life, despite having enlarged ventricles with a decreased volume of brain tissue. "What I find amazing to this day is how the brain can deal with something which you think should not be compatible with life", commented Dr. Max Muenke, a pediatric brain-defect specialist at the National Human Genome Research Institute. "If something happens very slowly over quite some time, maybe over decades, the different parts of the brain take up functions that would normally be done by the part that is pushed to the side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Lives Normal Life Despite Having Abnormal Brain|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=July 19, 2007|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070719.wbrain0719/BNStory/Science/home|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828013153/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070719.wbrain0719/BNStory/Science/home|archivedate=August 28, 2007|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New Scientist Health"&gt;{{cite news|title = Man with tiny brain shocks doctors|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html|accessdate = 8 June 2013|date = 20 July 2007|work = New Scientist and Reuters|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130726110907/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html|archivedate = 26 July 2013|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17658396"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61127-1 |pmid=17658396 |title=Brain of a white-collar worker |journal=The Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9583 |pages=262 |year=2007 |last1=Feuillet |first1=Lionel |last2=Dufour |first2=Henry |last3=Pelletier |first3=Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6967">IDEAL ('''I'''dea, '''D'''evelopment, '''E'''xploration, '''A'''ssessment, '''L'''ong-term study) is a framework for describing the stages of innovation in [[surgery]] and other interventional procedures. The purpose of IDEAL is to improve the quality of research in surgery by emphasizing appropriate methods, transparency of data and rigorous reporting of outcomes.

To achieve this, the IDEAL framework provides a set of recommendations for improving the evidence base from research at each stage of innovation, as outlined in the seminal [[paper]] published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch P, Altman DG et al. "No surgical innovation without evaluation: the IDEAL recommendations." Lancet. 2009 Sep 26;374(9695):1105-12. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61116-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations emphasize evaluating new procedures prospectively, entering patients and studies into registries and databases to capture all incidences of a procedure, and reporting outcomes by established protocols. It is the first and only such framework for [[evidence-based practice]] that was established specifically for surgery and interventional procedures.

== Background ==
The IDEAL framework was the result of an expert [[consensus]] developed from a series of meetings held at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] from 2007-2009. This group was known as the Balliol Collaboration. The purpose of the meetings was to address the challenges unique to establishing the optimal evidence base in surgery, including practical, methodological, and ethical challenges.  Attendees to the meeting (the “IDEAL collaboration”) included experts in evidence-based medicine, including [[Cochrane Collaboration]] founder [[Iain Chalmers]], public health expert [[Muir Gray]], statistician and founder of the Centre for Statistics in Medicine in Oxford [[Doug Altman]], clinician-researchers, [[methodologists]], and manufacturers of medical devices.

== Framework and recommendations ==
The five stages of IDEAL, and the recommendations for each stage, are as follows:

=== Stage 1: Idea ===
* All new procedures should be reported automatically
* An online registry should be established for reporting of procedures
* Reports should include adverse events

=== Stage 2a: Development ===
* Protocols for prospective development studies should be established 
* Protocols should include details about patient selection, operative methods and predefined outcomes
* A registry for these protocols should be established
* The publication of retrospective case series should be avoided
* If retrospective case series are to be published, they should include all consecutive patients and adhere to a reporting template such as [[STROBE]]

=== Stage 2b: Exploration ===
* A prospective research database should be established
* Validated methods for evaluating learning curves, such as [[CUSUM]],  should be used
* Reporting should be more disease-based than procedure-based
* Outcome measures should be predefined and include technical, clinical, and patient-reported outcomes

=== Stage 3: Assessment ===
* Study design should be a [[randomized controlled trial]], or acceptable alternatives

=== Stage 4: Long-term study ===
* Reporting should include only key outcomes and relevant information
* When comparing outcomes among different surgeons or interventionalists and institutions, results should be adjusted for the [[comorbidities]] of the patient and the learning curve of the surgeon or interventionalist

== Proposals ==
In the original publication in ''The Lancet'', the authors outline a number of proposals for key stakeholders in the generation of surgical evidence. These include journal editors, funders of services and research, regulators, and professional societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDEAL Proposals for actions which would improve the environment for invasive therapy research|url=http://www.ideal-collaboration.net/proposals/|publisher=IDEAL|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IDEAL collaboration ==
The original IDEAL collaboration consists of attendees to the Balliol meetings. Subsequent members include other stakeholders in evidence-based surgery and interventional procedures. The IDEAL collaboration is led by Oxford surgeon-researcher Peter McCulloch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/about-nds/staff-listing/peter-mcculloch Peter McCulloch — Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120141907/http://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/about-nds/staff-listing/peter-mcculloch |date=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in device regulation ==
While the initial Balliol meetings were intended to address innovations in surgery and interventional procedures, it soon became clear that there were also deficits in the evaluation of medical devices and implants used in such procedures. In December 2011, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]] held a public workshop on using the IDEAL framework to help develop high-quality evidence for devices and implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript for Public Workshop - Bridging the IDEAL and TPLC Approaches for Evidence Development for Surgical Medical Devices and Procedures,|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm288553.htm|work=fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drugs Administration|accessdate=17 February 2014|date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the FDA published its strategy for improved postmarket surveillance based in part on the discussions from the IDEAL meeting, including the promotion of registries for devices, better assessment of evidence already published, and improved reporting of adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengthening Our National System for Medical Device Postmarket Surveillance|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDRH/CDRHReports/UCM301924.pdf|work=fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=17 February 2014|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IDEAL collaborators have written several editorials and commentaries in journals such as the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' and ''The Lancet'' concerning the regulation of devices.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch P. "The EU's system for regulating medical devices." BMJ. 2012 Oct 24;345:e7126. doi: 10.1136/bmj.e7126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"McCulloch P, Barkun J, Sedrakyan A; IDEAL Collaboration.

BMJ. 2011 Jun 7;342:d3540. doi: 10.1136/bmj.d3540.&lt;/ref&gt;

(The initial conference, in 1985, was the International Conference on Linked Databases.)  ISPE is the only international acting society dealing with the topics of pharmacoepidemiology in the context of [[pharmacovigilance]] or [[drug safety]]; the [[International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research]] (ISPOR) addresses outcomes research epidemiology. The society has organized yearly conferences since its foundation. The society's office is located in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], and its executive director is Mark Epstein. A number of the major figures in drug safety and pharmacovigilance have served as its Presidents, and its Officers and Trustees have been drawn from the leadership of the pharmacoepidemiology community.  Members of the Society come from 53 nations and mostly come from academia, [[pharmaceutical industry]], [[Contract Research Organization]]s and governmental institutions (e.g., [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]], [[National Institutes of Health]], [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]], BfArM, [[Robert Koch]] Institute (RKI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rki.de]&lt;/ref&gt;) acting als drug regulators. The official journal of the society is ''Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety'' which is indexed in [[MEDLINE]] and the regularly edited newsletter ''Scribe'' is available on the above-mentioned website of ISPE.  (The original Society newsletter was the PharmacoEpidemiology Newsletter (PEN), created by Stanley A. Edlavitch (edited by Edlavitch and David E. Lilienfeld) in 1985.  In 1992, the Society returned the PEN to Edlavitch.) The current president of the society is John D. Seeger, from the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at [[Harvard Medical School]]/Brigham and Women's Hospital 
Boston, MA.

The ISPE is directed by a structured Board of Trustees, ensuring that each of its various constituencies has some voice within the organization.  The major areas within which pharmacoepidemiology is practiced (industry, government, academia) provides the framework for the three forums within which ISPE members may raise items for discussion by the ISPE Board.

'''The Kassian Method''' is a system of manual therapy supposedly taken from [[Russian traditions and superstitions|traditional Ukrainian medicine]] that was developed by Professor Nikolaj Andreevich Kassian at [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|The National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. Kassian proposed to use this [[therapy]] as a way to treat diseases of the [[Lumbar spine|lumbosacral]] [[Vertebral column|spine]] without the use of drugs. Observation and testing of patients before treatment became a core principle of the Kassian method. He latter applied this technique to treatment [[Arthritis]] of hands, feet and knees.

It is claimed {{by whom|date=February 2015}} that 95% of patients feel improvement after the Kassian Method is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55516">This page lists more than 100 small arms designs which have been produced in numbers exceeding one million since the late 18th century. Many more types have been made in the hundreds of thousands. Many of the firearms on this list are military weapons which were used during both World Wars, so it is unsurprising that they were manufactured in such high numbers. Others are civilian hunting and sporting weapons, which generally sell very well in countries such as the U.S. and Canada. Many of those produced have been destroyed, deactivated or fallen into disrepair, but others will have been kept in working order and sold or passed on from one generation to another down the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shotgunsportsmagazine.com/archive/nov14/story1114.html|title=Shotgun Sports {{!}} Old Guns and Pressure by Ron Jones|website=shotgunsportsmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, [[Small Arms Survey]] reported that there are over '''one billion''' small arms distributed globally, of which 857 million (about 85 percent) are in [[civilian]] hands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/de/about-us/highlights/2018/highlight-bp-firearms-holdings.html Small Arms Survey reveals: More than one billion firearms in the world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf Estimating Global CivilianHELD Firearms Numbers.

|Designed and built originally in Norway, the rifle would be the official rifle of the US military from 1892-4 (it won Army trials and was adopted in 1892, but due to legal challenges was re-tested and re-adopted in 1893, however Springfield Armory didn't start making a licensed copy which would be the standard issue rifle till 1894) until 1904, and was the first smokeless rifle adopted by the US.  When the US transitioned to the Springfield Model 1903, the US began to give and sell many of its Krag rifles to Caribbean nations including Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.  The Norwegians used the Krag from the early 1890's up until the Germans invaded in WWII, whereupon they built limited numbers for the Germans. The rifle would also see limited use in the Boer War in Liberia.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Serious side effects have not been reported when administering the medication to those without worms,&lt;ref name="WHO2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Albonico2008" /&gt; and testing for the infection is many times more expensive than treating it. So for the same amount of money, mass deworming can treat more people more cost-effectively than selective deworming.&lt;ref name=WHO1&gt;{{Cite book |title = Helminth control in school-age children: a guide for managers of control programmes |edition=2nd |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2011 |isbn=9789241548267 |location= |pages=vii |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241548267_eng.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass deworming is one example of [[mass drug administration]].&lt;ref name=Taylor2015 /&gt;

Mass deworming of children can be carried out by administering [[mebendazole]] and [[albendazole]] which are two types of [[anthelmintic]] drug.&lt;ref name=WHO1 /&gt; The cost of providing one tablet every six to twelve months per child (typical doses) is relatively low.&lt;ref name=EAcost /&gt;

Over 870 million children are at risk of parasitic worm infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil Transmitted Helminths|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs366/en |publisher=WHO|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worm infections interfere with nutrient uptake; can lead to anemia, malnourishment and impaired mental and physical development; and pose a serious threat to children’s health, education, and productivity. Infected children are often too sick or tired to concentrate at school, or to attend at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miguel|first1=Edward |title=Worms at work: Long-run impacts of a child health investment |journal=Working Paper |date=May 2015 |url=http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/64/Worms-at-Work_2015-07-23.pdf |accessdate=28 July 2015 |display-authors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[World Health Assembly]] set a target for the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) to treat 75% of school-aged children by 2010.&lt;ref name=WHO1/&gt; There has been disagreement on the evidence regarding the extent of the long-term benefits for children who have been part of mass deworming programmes.&lt;ref name="Taylor2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor-Robinson|first1=DC |last2=Maayan|first2=N |last3=Soares-Weiser|first3=K |last4=Donegan|first4=S |last5=Garner|first5=P |title=Deworming drugs for soil-transmitted intestinal worms in children: effects on nutritional indicators, haemoglobin, and school performance |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=23 July 2015 |volume=7 |pages=CD000371 |pmid=26202783 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000371.pub6 |pmc=4523932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of mass deworming argue that the methodology of studies that discount the value of mass deworming is biased, sample sizes have been small, and studies did not evaluate more subtle long-term impacts. As a result, they argue that such studies should not be used alone in deciding mass deworming policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Montresor|first1=A |last2=Addiss|first2=D |last3=Albonico|first3=M |last4=Ali|first4=SM |last5=Ault |first5=SK |last6=Gabrielli|first6=AF |last7=Garba|first7=A |last8=Gasimov|first8=E |last9=Gyorkos|first9=T |last10=Jamsheed|first10=MA |last11=Levecke|first11=B |last12=Mbabazi|first12=P |last13=Mupfasoni|first13=D |last14=Savioli|first14=L |last15=Vercruysse|first15=J |last16=Yajima|first16=A |title=Methodological bias can lead the Cochrane Collaboration to irrelevance in public health decision-making |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |date=October 2015 |volume=9 |issue=10 |pages=e0004165 |pmid=26492178 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004165 |pmc=4619606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Montresor|first1=A |last2=Gabrielli|first2=AF |last3=Engels|first3=D |last4=Daumerie|first4=D |last5=Savioli|first5=L |title=Has the NTD community neglected evidence-based policy?

Some [[non-governmental organizations]] specifically support mass deworming. The [[Deworm the World Initiative]], a project of the non-governmental organization Evidence Action, is one of the highest-rated charities by the evaluator [[Givewell]] because of the low cost of deworming children, large-scale implementation, and wider benefits to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deworm the World Initiative (DtWI), led by Evidence Action |url=http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative|website=Givewell|accessdate=28 July 2015|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intestinal parasitic worms (collectively called [[helminths|soil-transmitted helminths]]) affect approximately 1.5 billion people, according to WHO estimates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soil-transmitted helminth infections |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs366/en/ |publisher=WHO |accessdate=14 May 2017|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 218 million needing preventive treatment for [[schistosoma]]-type worms in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schistosomiasis fact sheet |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/en/ |publisher=WHO |accessdate=14 May 2017|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] recommends mass deworming of children who live in endemic areas, in order to reduce morbidity by reducing the overall worm burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WHO intestinal worms strategy |url = http://www.who.int/intestinal_worms/strategy/en/ |website = who.int |access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO advises that worm infections adversely affect nutritional status, impair cognitive processes, and can cause conditions such as intestinal obstruction or lesions in the urinary tract and liver. Periodic drug treatment is expected to bring about health benefits such as reduced micronutrient loss, reduced environmental contamination, improved nutritional status and cognitive function, and better school performance in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="Taylor2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO1/&gt;

In 2001, the [[World Health Assembly]] set a target for the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to treat 75 percent of school-aged children by 2010.&lt;ref name=WHO1/&gt; In 2014, over 396 million preschool and school-aged children were treated, corresponding to 47 percent of children at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Soil-transmitted helminthiases: number of children treated in 2014 |url=http://www.who.int/wer/2015/wer9051_52.pdf |journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record |issue=51/52 |volume=90 |pages=701–712 |date = 18 December 2015 |issn=0049-8114 |publisher=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Pills ===
Deworming programmes for children usually administer an [[anthelmintic]] drug such as [[albendazole]] or [[mebendazole]] (or [[praziquantel]] in a weight based or height based dose for schistosomiasis). The treatment is given as a single dose in a pill formulation.&lt;ref name="Taylor2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO1 /&gt; Other drugs used, though not approved by the WHO, include pyrantel pamoate, piperazine, piperazine citrate, tetrachloroethylene, and levamisole.&lt;ref name="Taylor2015" /&gt; In mass deworming programs, all children are given the medication, whether they are infected or not. In endemic areas, the deworming needs to be repeated regularly.&lt;ref name="Taylor2015" /&gt; The frequency of the treatment depends on the prevalence and severity of infection which is determined by periodic surveys but is usually required annually.&lt;ref name=WHO1 /&gt;

=== Accompanying measures ===
To increase the benefits of mass deworming and to lower the rate of reinfection, accompanying measures of mass deworming programmes should include [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] interventions.&lt;ref name="HalesZiegelbauer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hales, S|last2=Ziegelbauer, K|last3=Speich, B|title=Effect of Sanitation on Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=9|issue=1|year=2012|pages=e1001162|issn=1549-1676|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001162|display-authors=etal|pmid=22291577|pmc=3265535}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example for such a combined intervention is the Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines: This national programme combines twice annual deworming of school children with group [[Hand washing|handwashing]] with soap at set times of the day at the school premises.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=School Community Manual - Indonesia (formerly Manual for teachers), Fit for School.|date=2014|publisher=GIZ Fit for School, Philippines|isbn=978-3-95645-250-5|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNICEF (2012) [http://www.unicef.org/wash/schools/files/Raising_Even_More_Clean_Hands_Web_17_October_2012(1).pdf Raising Even More Clehran Hands: Advancing Health, Learning and Equity through WASH in Schools], Joint Call to Action&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called "Fit for School" approach has also been implemented in Indonesia in 2014.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Health aspects ==

=== Evidence ===
* In 2015, a review in a [[World Bank]] journal concluded that evidence supports a benefit with respect to school attendance and long term income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahuja|first1=Amrita|last2=Baird|first2=Sarah|last3=Hicks|first3=Joan Hamory|last4=Kremer|first4=Michael|last5=Miguel|first5=Edward|last6=Powers|first6=Shawn|title=When Should Governments Subsidize Health? The Case of Mass Deworming|journal=The World Bank Economic Review|date=2015|volume=29|issue=suppl 1|pages=S9–S24|doi=10.1093/wber/lhv008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Cochrane review]] carried out in 2015 found that high quality [[Evidence-based medicine|medical evidence]] on mass deworming of children did not support beneficial effect on school performance, body weight, cognition, and rates of anemia.&lt;ref name="Taylor2015" /&gt; However, it excluded a number of studies which showed positive long-term results as they did not meet the inclusion criteria of a pure control (for studies using the method of [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCT)). Supporters of mass deworming argue that these studies make a case for long-term benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozier|first1=Owen|title=Exploiting Externalities to Estimate the Long-Term Effects of Early Childhood Deworming|journal=World Bank Group|date=Oct 2014|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/10/01/000158349_20141001145539/Rendered/PDF/WPS7052.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New deworming reanalyses and Cochrane review|url=http://blog.givewell.org/2015/07/24/new-deworming-reanalyses-and-cochrane-review/|website=The GiveWell Blog|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A review in 2016 examining the effects of deworming on child weight included studies omitted from Cochrane. It also extracted additional data from included studies. This review concluded that in environments with greater than 20% prevalence, where the WHO recommends mass treatment, the estimated average weight gain per dollar expenditure from deworming MDA is more than 35 times that estimated from school feeding programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croke|first=Kevin|last2=Hicks|first2=Joan Hamory|last3=Hsu|first3=Eric|last4=Kremer|first4=Michael|last5=Miguel|first5=Edward |title=Does Mass Deworming Affect Child Nutrition? Meta-analysis, Cost-Effectiveness, and Statistical Power |work=NBER Working Paper No. 22382 |date=July 2016 |doi=10.3386/w22382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2017, a systematic review and meta-analysis re-examined available studies and concluded that mass deworming for soil-transmitted helminths had little effect. However for schistosomiasis, mass deworming might have been effective for weight but probably was ineffective for height, cognition, and school attendance.&lt;ref name="lancet2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=Vivian A|last2=Ghogomu|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Hossain|first3=Alomgir|title=Mass deworming to improve developmental health and wellbeing of children in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and network meta-analysis|journal=The Lancet Global Health|date=January 2017|volume=5|display-authors=etal |issue=1|pages=e40–e50|doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(16)30242-X|pmid=27955788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinfection and resistance ===
Reinfection with worms may begin shortly after the pill has killed the intestinal worm population.&lt;ref name="CooperJia2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooper, PJ |last2=Jia, T |last3=Melville, S |title=Soil-transmitted helminth reinfection after drug treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |volume=6 |issue=5 |year=2012 |pages=e1621|issn=1935-2735|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001621|display-authors=etal|pmid=22590656|pmc=3348161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular re-treatment together with an increased focus on other aspects of [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] reduces the rates of infection in areas where parasitic worms are endemic.&lt;ref name="HalesZiegelbauer2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CooperJia2012" /&gt;

Resistance of worms to anthelmintic drugs over time is a possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levecke, B |last2=Montresor, A |last3=Albonico, M |title=Assessment of anthelmintic efficacy of mebendazole in school children in six countries where soil-transmitted helminths are endemic |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |date=9 October 2014 |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=e3204 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003204 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs==
Mass deworming has been determined to be cheap when calculated on a 'per child/per year'&lt;ref name="EAcost"&gt;{{cite web |author=Williams, Katherine |title=How do we calculate the cost of deworming? |url=http://www.evidenceaction.org/blog-full/how-do-we-calculate-the-cost-of-deworming |website=Evidence Action |accessdate=12 December 2016 |date=16 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or $/[[Disability-adjusted life year|DALY]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost-effectiveness in $/DALY for deworming interventions |url=http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming/cost-effectiveness |website=Givewell.org |accessdate=30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; basis. Screening test to detect if a child is actually infected would be up to 12 times more expensive.&lt;ref name="Ahuja"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahuja, A|last2=Baird, S|last3=Hicks, JH|title=When should governments subsidize health? The case of mass deworming |date=2015 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |edition=NBER Working Paper No. 21148 |url=http://schoolsandhealth.org/Shared%20Documents/Why%20Should%20Governments%20Subsidize%20Health.%20The%20Case%20of%20Mass%20Deworming.pdf |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of treating a child for infection of soil transmitted helminths and schistosomes costs different amounts in different countries when administered as part of mass school-based deworming, but Evidence Action states that their recent programmes cost $0.56 or less per child per dose.&lt;ref name="EAcost" /&gt; This programme is recommended by [[Giving What We Can]] and the [[Copenhagen Consensus|Copenhagen Consensus Centre]] as one of the most efficient and cost-effective solutions. Modelling studies also suggest that deworming programmes are highly cost effective.&lt;ref name="LoBogoch2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lo|first1=Nathan C|last2=Bogoch|first2=Isaac I|last3=Blackburn|first3=Brian G|last4=Raso|first4=Giovanna|last5=N'Goran|first5=Eliézer K|last6=Coulibaly|first6=Jean T|last7=Becker|first7=Sören L|last8=Abrams|first8=Howard B|last9=Utzinger|first9=Jürg|last10=Andrews|first10=Jason R|title=Comparison of community-wide, integrated mass drug administration strategies for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis: a cost-effectiveness modelling study|journal=The Lancet Global Health|volume=3|issue=10|year=2015|pages=e629–e638|issn=2214-109X|doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(15)00047-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National deworming programmes==
National deworming programmes target children of school age, which the WHO defines as being between 5 and 14 years of age.&lt;ref name=WHO1 /&gt; By 2015, the total global number estimated to be in deworming programmes was 495 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deworming campaign improves child health, school attendance in Rwanda |url=http://www.who.int/features/2015/rwanda-deworming-campaign/en/ |website=WHO.int |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and national deworming programs had been started in a number of countries. The world's largest deworming programme was started in 2015 in India, with an aim to target 240 million children at risk for parasitic worms.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |title=World's largest deworming program in India to start |url=http://www.evidenceaction.org/blog-full/largest-deworming-program-in-india-to-start-with-support-from-evidence-action |website=Evidence Action |accessdate=28 July 2015 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acceptance ===
Deworming programmes are widely accepted, although there have been some reports of parents refusing to allow their children to receive medication due to fears of illness, such as those reported in the media in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Garcia" /&gt;
One survey in the Philippines reported that some parents will not allow their children to receive deworming tablets, while the majority would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parikh|first1=DS|last2=Totañes|first2=FI|last3=Tuliao|first3=AH|title=Knowledge, attitudes and practices among parents and teachers about soil-transmitted helminthiasis control programs for school children in Guimaras, Philippines |journal=The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health |date=2013 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=744–52 |pmid=24437309 |display-authors=etal |url=http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2013-44-5-full/03-5797-8.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another in rural China found that scepticism and local myths about the deworming programme could affect the uptake of medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lu|first1=Louise |last2=Liu|first2=Chengfang |last3=Zhang|first3=Linxiu |title=Gut instincts: knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding soil-transmitted helminths in rural China |journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases |date=2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=e0003643 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003643 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN agencies and NGOs===
The UN is involved in mass deworming programmes via the [[World Food Programme]],&lt;ref name="NGOdewinv"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Global NGO Deworming Inventory 2010 |title=2010 Global NGO Deworming Inventory summary report: deworming programs by country |url=http://storage.ugal.com/5115/deworming-programs-by-country-2010-3.1.12.pdf |website=deworminginventory.org |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]]&lt;ref name="Kabaka" /&gt; and [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="Kabaka" /&gt;

NGOs involved in deworming advocacy or delivery include: the [[Deworm the World Initiative]] from Evidence Action, Goods For Good, [[Save the Children]], [[Counterpart International]], [[Helen Keller International]], the [[Carter Center]], Inmed Partnerships for Children, [[Operation Blessing International]], and [[Children Without Worms]].&lt;ref name="NGOdewinv" /&gt;

=== Pharmaceutical companies===
[[Biotechnology]] companies in the developing world have targeted [[neglected tropical diseases]] - which many helminth infections are classified as - and [[mass drug administration]] due to a need to improve global health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frew SE, Liu VY, Singer PA |title=A business plan to help the 'global South' in its fight against neglected diseases |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=1760–73 |year=2009 |pmid=19887417 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.6.1760 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079975330/Peter_Singer_Neglected_Tropical_Diseases.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keenan"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Keenan JD, Hotez PJ, Amza A, etal |title=Elimination and eradication of neglected tropical diseases with mass drug administrations: a survey of experts |journal=PLoS Negl Trop Dis |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e2562 |year=2013 |pmid=24340111 |pmc=3855072 |doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002562 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002562}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples==

===Nicaragua===

The national deworming programme was established as a partnership between the [[Pan American Health Organization]] - which serves as the Regional Office of the WHO, the [[Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], Nicaraguan Government ministries, International NGOs and the main donor [[Children Without Worms]].&lt;ref name=lucien&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucien, F|last2=Janus, CB|title= Worms and WASH(ED) Nicaragua|date=2011|publisher=The George Washington University|url=http://storage.ugal.com/5116/nicaragua-case-studyworms-and-washed-july-2012.pdf|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children Without Worms is a public-private partnership between [[The Task Force for Global Health]] and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], who donated the mebendazole medication.&lt;ref name=lucien /&gt; Intestinal helminths are a major problem in Nicaragua with 73% of rural households lacking clean drinking water and 73% lacking sanitation.&lt;ref name=lucien /&gt;

Since 2009, drug donations from Johnson &amp; Johnson have enabled annual deworming of school-aged children and medication supplied by other NGOs has enabled deworming of pre-school children, although questions were raised as to whether the frequency should have been increased.&lt;ref name=lucien /&gt;

However, in 2013 the Director of the National Institute of Health in the Philippines questioned the effectiveness of the programme because it only covered only 20% of affected children with an infection rate of 44%.&lt;ref name=Tubeza&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tubeza|first1=Philip|title=Gov deworming programme in public schools not very effective|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/365399/govt-deworming-program-in-public-schools-not-very-effective-says-health-exec|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, 16 million children were targeted in the deworming programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crisostomo|first1=Sheila|title=DOH targets deworming of 16M students|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/26/1481053/doh-targets-deworming-16-m-students|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=philststar|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some media claims that some of the medication was found to be expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geronimo|first1=Jee|title=DOH looks into 'expired' deworming medicine claim|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/101010-doh-probe-expired-deworming-medicine-zamboanga|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=Rappler|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials later denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jocson|first1=Liza|title=DOH confirms deworming medicine not expired|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2015/07/30/DOH-confirms-deworming-medicine-not-expired.html|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=CNN Philippines|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national press reports in July 2015 stated that a small number of children had been admitted to hospital due to an "adverse effect" of the deworming medication.&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Bong|title=Deworming tablet downs hundreds of schoolchildren|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/zamboanga/local-news/2015/07/29/deworming-tablet-downs-hundreds-schoolchildren-421671|accessdate=31 July 2015|agency=Sun Star|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Philippine Department of Education====
Successful deworming and positive health outcomes were also achieved by the Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines. This national programme includes giving school children deworming drugs twice a year, as well as group [[Hand washing|handwashing]] with soap and brushing teeth daily with [[fluoride]] toothpaste as a group activity at set times of the day at the school premises.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In 2012 [[UNICEF]] described it as an "outstanding example of at scale action to promote children’s health and education".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===United States of America (USA)===
Public health campaigns to reduce helminth infections in the U.S. may be traced as far back as 1910, when the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] began the fight against hookworm – the so-called "germ of laziness" – which was found to infect 40% of children in the American South.&lt;ref name="BundyWalson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Walson, JL|last3=Watkins, KL|year=2013|title=Worms, wisdom, and wealth: why deworming can make economic sense|journal=Trends in Parasitology|volume=29|issue=3|pages=142–148|doi=10.1016/j.pt.2012.12.003|issn=1471-4922|pmid=23332661|last1=Bundy, DAP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wat2"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title='Stupidity or worms': do intestinal worms impair mental performance?|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/121/2/171.pdf|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=121|issue=2|pages=171–91|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.121.2.171|pmid=9100486|vauthors=Watkins WE, Pollitt E}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Records of the programme suggest that it led to increased school enrollment and attendance for children, and improved literacy and income for adults who were treated as children.&lt;ref name="BundyWalson2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ble2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=[[Hoyt Bleakley|Bleakley]]|first=[[Hoyt Bleakley|Hoyt]]|year=2007|title=Disease and development: evidence from hookworm eradication in the American South|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/qjec.121.1.73|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=122|pages=73–117|doi=10.1162/qjec.121.1.73|pmc=3800113|pmid=24146438}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This campaign was enthusiastically received by educators throughout the region; as one [[Virginia]]n school observed: "children who were listless and dull are now active and alert; children who could not study a year ago are not only studying now, but are finding joy in learning... for the first time in their lives their cheeks show the glow of health."&lt;ref name="Ble2" /&gt; From [[Louisiana]], a grateful school board added: "As a result of your treatment...their lessons are not so hard for them, they pay better attention in class and they have more energy...In short, we have here in our school-rooms today about 120 bright, rosy-faced children, whereas had you not been sent here to treat them we would have had that many pale-faced, stupid children."&lt;ref name="Ble2" /&gt;

Military personnel returning from the [[Second World War]] were found to be bringing intestinal worms back to the United States, so in 1947 the [[American Society of Parasitologists]] called for increased attention on deworming.&lt;ref name="BundyWalson2013" /&gt;

== History==

{{Main|Timeline of deworming}}

Following [[World War II]], the [[World Health Organization]] "has been the principal body concerned with the international support of research and control programmes" of schistosomiasis.&lt;ref name="sandbach"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1081781/pdf/medhist00110-0029.pdf |title=The History of Schistosomiasis Research and Policy for Its Control |accessdate=April 16, 2016 |date=July 1976 |last=Sandbach |first=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11464">Neuroscientists have learned a lot about the role of the brain in numerous [[Cognition|cognitive mechanisms]] by understanding corresponding disorders. Similarly, neuroscientists have come to learn a lot about [[music cognition]] by studying '''music-specific disorders'''. Even though [[music]] is most often viewed from a "historical perspective rather than a biological one"&lt;ref name="Zatorre, R. 2005"&gt;Zatorre, R., &amp; McGill, J. (2005). Music, the food of neuroscience [Article]. Nature, 434(7031), 312-315&lt;/ref&gt; music has significantly gained the attention of [[neuroscientist]]s all around the world. For many centuries music has been strongly associated with [[art]] and [[culture]]. The reason for this increased interest in music is because it "provides a tool to study numerous aspects of [[neuroscience]], from [[motor skill]] learning to [[emotion]]".&lt;ref name="Zatorre, R. 2005"/&gt;

==Overview==
An important technique that is used by neuroscientists in understanding the cognition of music involves understanding musical disorders. This article describes some of the disorders that have been identified by neuroscientists. They range from disorders involving pitch, rhythm and melody, playing instruments and creating music. This article explores two of the most commonly found music related disorders—(1)

==Definitions: basic musical concepts==
Before delving into the disorders related to music, it is important to have a basic understanding of the following terms:

===Pitch===
In the physical sense of the term, the word "[[pitch (music)|pitch]]" refers to the frequency of a sound. Another term that is frequently used by music neuroscientists is "fine-grained pitch processing" which refers to the ability of a person to distinguish minor changes or fluctuations in pitch. Processing pitch is an extremely integral part of music cognition. Recent developments in brain scanning techniques have shown neuroscientists that the posterior secondary cortex plays an extremely important part in the processing of pitch in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Peretz, I. Zatorre, R., &amp; McGill, J. (2005). Brain Organization for Music Processing [Article]. Annual Review of Psychology, 56, 89-114&lt;/ref&gt; In music, "pitch relation" is more important than pitch itself. A subset of five to seven pitches creates a scale. The scale tones are "not equivalent and are organized around a central tone, called the tonic" (Peretz 2005).

===Time relations===
Temporal organization of music is commonly referred to as "[[rhythm]]". In 1982 the neuroscientist Fraisse claimed that there are mainly two types of time relations that are fundamental to musical temporal organization: (1) "the segmentation of an ongoing sequence into temporal groups" based on the duration values (in musical terms a whole, half, quarter, eighth or sixteenth note), and (2) "extraction of an underlying temporal regularity or beat".&lt;ref&gt;Fraisse P (1982) Rhythm and tempo. See Deutsch 1999, pp. 149–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brain, it is believed that the right hemisphere better handles meter, while the left hemisphere better handles rhythm. Scientists have studied patients with brain lesions in their right temporal auditory cortex and realized that they were unable to "tap a beat or generate a steady pulse".&lt;ref&gt;Ibbotson NR, Morton J (1981) Rhythm and dominance. Cognition 9:125–38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timbre===
"[[Timbre]]" refers to the quality of a musical note that enables us to distinguish between different kinds of sound production. It is the characteristic of music that helps us recognize an instrument or source of a particular sound—such as a piano, saxophone, or a flute.

===Memory===
It is important to note that music unfolds over time, thus the "auditory cognitive system must depend to a large degree on mechanisms that allow a stimulus to be maintained on-line to be able to relate one element in a sequence to another that occurs later" (Peretz 2005). Research has shown that working memory mechanisms for pitch information over a short period of time may be different from those involved in speech. In addition to the role that auditory cortices play in working memory for music, neuroimaging and lesion studies prove that frontal cortical areas also play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;Gaab N, Gaser C, Zaehle T, J¨ancke L, Schlaug G (2003) Functional anatomy of pitch memory—an fMRI study with sparse temporal sampling. NeuroImage 19:1417–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotion===
Music is not merely "limited to perception and memory", but is also closely related to emotion. The mode of music (major or minor), and the tempo of a song (fast or slow) can invoke joy or sorrow in the listener.&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Gagnon L, Bouchard B (1998) Music and emotion: perceptual determinants, immediacy, and isolation after brain damage. Cognition 68:111–41&lt;/ref&gt; In the brain, emotional analysis is carried out by "a common cortical relay, suggesting no direct access to subcortical, limbic structures".&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Blood AJ, Penhune V, Zatorre R (2001) Cortical deafness to dissonance. Brain 124:928–40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical disorders==
[[Image:Music Disorders.jpg|thumb|right|Music-specific disorders may be acquired or congenital]]
With a growing interest in music cognition amongst neuroscientists, music-specific disorders are becoming more relevant in research and in understanding music processing in the brain. In the past decade, myriad music-specific disorders have been identified, causes ranging from congenital to acquired (specific lesions in the brain).

===Amusia===
{{Main|Amusia}}

====Definition and history====
[[Amusia]] refers to the inability of certain individuals to recognize simple tunes.&lt;ref&gt;"Zatorre, Robert, [[University of Montreal]] Dept of [[Psychology]], interviewed by Christa Caesar, Oct 28,2009"&lt;/ref&gt; Amusia is commonly referred to as [[tone deafness|tone-deafness]], [[tune deaf|tune-deafness]], [[dysmelodia]], or [[dysmusia]]. The first documented case of [[congenital amusia]] was reported in 2002 by leading music neuroscientists from the Department of Psychology at the University of Montreal, [[Canada]]. The case followed the case of a middle-aged woman who "lacks most basic musical abilities".&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Ayotte J, Zatorre RJ, Mehler J, Ahad P, Penhune VB, Jutras B (2002) Congenital Amusia: a disorder of fine-grained pitch discrimination. Neuron 17;33(2): 185-91&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the techniques that are used in studying this disorder are [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[positron emission tomography]] or PET scans, and anatomical [[MRI]].

====Symptoms and causes====
Amusia may be congenital or acquired. Congenital amusia, as the term suggests, is acquired as a result of birth or one's genes; while acquired amusia occurs as a result of accidental brain damage, stress, or [[Cognitive disorder|cognitive deficits]]. Symptoms of this disease vary from lack of basic melodic discrimination, recognition despite normal audiometry, above average intellectual, memory, as well as language skills (Peretz 2002). Another conspicuous symptom of amusia is the ability of the affected individual to carry out normal speech, however, he or she is unable to sing. Amusic individuals "show a particular deficit in discriminating musical pitch variations and in recognizing familiar melodies".&lt;ref&gt;Ayotte J, Peretz I, Hyde K (2002) Congenital Amusia: A group study of adults afflicted with a music specific disorder. Brain 125: 238-251&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists are now classifying congenital amusia as a "new class of learning disabilities that affect musical abilities" (Ayotte 2002).

===Acquired music agnosia===
====Definition====
The term "agnosia" refers to a loss of knowledge. Acquired music agnosia is the "inability to recognize music in the absence of sensory, intellectual, verbal, and mnesic impairments".&lt;ref&gt;Peretz I, Can we lose memory for music? A case of music agnosia in a nonmusician (1996). J Cogn Neuroscience 8:481-96&lt;/ref&gt; Music agnosia is most commonly acquired; in most cases it is a result of bilateral infarction of the right temporal lobes.&lt;ref&gt;Satoh M. A case of auditory agnosia with impairment of perception and expression of music: cognitive processing of tonality (2007) European Neurology 58(2) 70-77&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, Satoh states "when pure word deafness, auditory sound agnosia, and receptive amusia occur simultaneously, the state is called [[auditory agnosia]]" (Satoh 2007). However, one must understand the subtle difference between auditory and music agnosia; the former refers to the inability to recognize environmental sounds while the latter refers to the inability to recognize music.&lt;ref&gt;Vignolo L. Music agnosia and auditory agnosia (2003) Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 999:50-57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Symptoms and causes====
The main symptoms of music agnosia range from the inability to recognize pitch, rhythm, chords, and notes to the inability to discriminate and recognize familiar songs, and judge tonality, and reproduce musical phrases. As was previously mentioned the main causes for music agnosia are lesions in the right or bilateral temporal lobes (Satoh 2007) or unilateral strokes.

===Musical hallucinations===
{{Main|Musical hallucinations}}
====Definition====
Musical hallucinations (MH) can be described as perceptions of musical sounds in the absence of external auditory stimuli. Although imagined sounds can be non-musical; such as bells, whistles and sirens, case studies indicate that music “[takes] precedence over all other auditory hallucinations” (Sacks, 2006). Furthermore, MH may often take the form of songs from childhood and may be connected with strong childhood emotions.

====Symptoms and causes====
In a literature review by Evers and Ellger (2004), manifestations of MH can also be attributed to: a) psychiatric disorder, b) brain lesion, c) epilepsy and d) intoxication. Of great interest to researchers are individuals who experience MH with focal lesions and epileptic brain activity. Until recently, neurologists believed in a hemispheric dominance theory of music. Brain scans of subjects with lesions seem to refute this notion. Evers and Ellger (2004) found no significant difference in the hemisphere associated with the lesion as the major cause of MH.

==Summary==
There are a range of music-specific disorders that afflict many individuals in any given population. However, since music cognition is a newly developing area of interest in the neuroscientific community, a lot more research is yet to be done and the knowledge that currently exists is vague and indefinitive. The inability to recognize or reproduce music is a major psychological disorder, as it incapacitates an individual to appreciate music and experience its therapeutic powers. Music is known for its healing and relaxing properties, therefore it is even more important that more robust experiments and research be performed in this relatively new area of neuroscience.

The '''Nociceptive trigeminal inhibition tension suppression system''' (abbreviated to '''NTI-TSS''', or '''NTI-tension suppression system'''),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6831/8/22&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[occlusal splint]] that is claimed to prevent [[headache]] and [[migraine]] by reducing sleep [[bruxism]] (night-time tooth clenching and grinding). Sleep bruxism is purported to lead to a hyperactivity of the [[trigeminal nerve]], often triggering typical migraine events. The hyperactivity of trigeminal neurons during trigemino-nociceptive stimulation is a proposed cause of migraine and is correlated with imaging of migraine sufferers.&lt;ref&gt;Burstein, R., Noseda, R., &amp; Borsook, D. (April 29 2015). Migraine: Multiple Processes, Complex Pathophysiology. Journal of Neuroscience, 35(17), 6619-6629.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the NTI-TSS is to relax the muscles involved in clenching and bruxing, thus supposedly diminishing the chances for migraines and [[tension headache]]s to develop through the reduction in nociceptive stimulation normally caused by parafunctional activity. It is sometimes used for [[temporomandibular joint dysfunction]] (TMD).

The NTI-TSS is a small transparent plastic device which is, in its most widely used form, worn over the front four teeth, of either arch, at night, and intended to prevent contact of the canines and molars. It is normally fitted by a dentist trained in the technique, and is constructed by a dental laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;https://nationaldentex.com/products/headache-therapy/nti-tss-plus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence and safety==
As the NTI-TSS does not cover all of the teeth, it is classed as a partial coverage occlusal splint. Partial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements if worn 24 hours a day 7 days a week with no tooth contact (which is never recommended),&lt;ref name="Wassell 2008"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Wassell R, Naru A, Steele J, Nohl F |title=Applied occlusion|year=2008|publisher=Quintessence|location=London|isbn=9781850970989|pages=73–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; which rarely can be severe. Since the patient cannot wear the NTI-tss device while chewing food, the posterior alveolar structures receive regular stimulation every day, therefore, there is no opportunity for a functional adaptation of the occlusal scheme, that is supra-eruption of the teeth&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt;. Research shows&lt;!-- Citation needed --&gt; that alveolar bone requires at least 8 days of  lack of stimulation before bone growth at the apex (supra-eruption) can initiate. Periodontal ligament that surrounds the root and holds the tooth in place - if this ligament is stimulated (exercised) it will  continue holding the teeth in correct position.

As for anterior intrusion, the lack of continuous apical force does not provide adequate opportunity to intrude an incisor. A 2010 review of scientific studies carried out to investigate the use of occlusal splints in TMD concluded the following with regards anterior bite appliances (another term for partial coverage occlusal splints that cover only the front teeth):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Other types of appliances, including [...] anterior bite appliances, have some RCT ([[randomized control trial]]) evidence of efficacy in reducing TMD pain. However, the potential for adverse events with these appliances is higher and suggests the need for close monitoring in their use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=|vauthors=Fricton J, Look JO, Wright E, ((Alencar FG Jr)), Chen H, Lang M, Ouyang W, Velly AM |title=Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating intraoral orthopedic appliances for temporomandibular disorders |journal=Journal of Orofacial Pain |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=237–54 |year=2010 |pmid=20664825}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. '''Perry Kendall''', {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of British Columbia|OBC]], [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]], [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|FRCPC]]}} (born 1943) is a [[Public health]] physician who was the first [[Medical Officer for Health|Provincial Health Officer]] (PHO) for the Canadian province of British Columbia's [[Ministry of Health (British Columbia)|health ministry]] and was awarded the [[Order of British Columbia]] for contributions to Public health field and to [[harm reduction]] policy and practice.

After about 20 years, Kendall retired from the Provincial Health Office role on Jan.31, 2018 and was replaced by Dr. Bonnie Henry.&lt;ref name="cbc2018"&gt;{{cite news|title=Longtime B.C. provincial health officer Perry Kendall announces retirement|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/perry-kendall-retirement-1.4502023|work=CBC News|date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early career ==
Born in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1943, Dr. Kendall completed his undergraduate medical training at [[UCL Medical School|University College Hospital Medical School]] in 1968 before spending a year as Senior House Officer at the University Hospital of the West Indies in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].

In 1972 he moved to [[Toronto]], Canada working in general practice at the Hassle Free Clinic. Over the next two decades, Kendall moved back and forth between the provinces of Ontario and [[British Columbia]]. He moved to [[Vancouver]] in 1974 to work for the Vancouver Health Department's Pine Free Clinic and East Health Unit while acquiring a master's degree in Health Care Planning and Epidemiology and a Fellowship in Community Medicine. He then returned to Ontario in 1984 to work as a manager with the [[Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care|Ontario Ministry of Health]] until 1987, when he returned to British Columbia as Medical Officer of Health for the [[Vancouver Island Health Authority|Capital Regional District]], in which capacity he opened one of Canada's first [[Needle exchange programme|needle exchange]] programs.

In 1989 he started a six-year career as Medical Officer of Health for the [[City of Toronto]] where he pioneered programs for [[HIV/AIDS]] and drug abuse prevention, established Harm Reduction as the official City policy for substance abuse, and city tobacco control by-laws. In 1995, Kendall was appointed President of the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario, one of six academic health science centres in Toronto and a WHO Collaborating Centre, until consolidation with other organizations occurred in 1998.

== Provincial Health Officer ==
The provincial government of [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] [[Glen Clark]] created the position of Provincial Health Officer (PHO) as an independent officer for the [[Ministry of Health (British Columbia)|Ministry of Health]] through the ''[http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/phact/ Public Health Act]''

After a year serving as Vice-President, Seniors' Health, with the [[Vancouver Island Health Authority|Capital Health Region]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Dr. Kendall was appointed as the first Provincial Health Officer for the province of British Columbia in May 3, 1999.

The Health Act outlines the role of the (PHO). As senior medical health officer for British Columbia, the PHO's responsibilities include:
* advising the Minister and senior members of the ministry on health issues in BC and on the need for legislation, policies and practices concerning those issues;
* monitoring the health of the people of BC;
* providing information and analyses on health issues;
* reporting to the public on health issues, the need for legislation, a change of policy, or practice respecting health in BC.

Dr. Kendall also participates on a number of provincial and national committees and co-chairs the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network Council. As PHO, he worked with the Chief Medical Health Officers of the regional health authorities (e.g. [[Francis John Blatherwick|Dr. John Blatherwick]] of [[Vancouver Coastal Health]]). Kendall appointed [[Evan Adams]] and [[Bonnie Henry]] as Deputy Provincial Health Officers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4350">The most well-known definition for pharmaceutical care came from Doug Hepler and Linda Strand in their article ‘''Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care''’ from 1990. This was a landmark paper because it marked the start of the international movement to make pharmaceutical care more visible, and get the term and the type of care implemented in hospital and community pharmacy practice. During the following years both authors worked to make the concept applicable in practice. The definition reads: ‘''Pharmaceutical care is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve the patients’ quality of life’''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qu.edu.qa/pharmacy/professional_development/documents/Responsibilities_Hepler_Strand.pdf Hepler CD, Strand LM. Opportunities and responsibilities in pharmaceutical care. Am J Hosp Pharm. 1990; 47(3):533-43.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition reads:  '''Pharmaceutical care''' is the direct or indirect responsible provision of [[drug therapy]] for the purpose of achieving the elimination or reduction of a patient's [[symptomatology|symptoms]]; arresting or slowing of a disease process; or preventing a disease.

In 2013, a European organization, the [http://www.pcne.org Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE)], created a new definition that could satisfy experts from a multitude of countries. After a review of existing definitions, a number of options were presented to the participants and in a one-day meeting consensus on a definition was reached.

''‘'''Pharmaceutical Care is the pharmacologist/pharmacist’s contribution to the care of individuals in order to optimize medicines use and improve health outcomes'''''’.

The ultimate goal of pharmaceutical care (optimize medicines use and improving health outcomes) exists in all practice settings and in all cultures where medicines are used. It involves two major functions: identifying potential and manifest problems in the pharmacotherapy (DRPs), and then resolving the problems and preventing the potential problems from becoming real for the patient and his therapy outcomes. This should preferably be done together with other health care professionals and the patient through a review of the medication (and diseases) and subsequent counselling and discussions

'''Ptaquiloside''' is a [[norsesquiterpene]] [[glucoside]] produced by [[bracken]] ferns (majorly ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'') during [[metabolism]]. It is identified to be the main [[carcinogen]] of the ferns and to be responsible for their biological effects, such as [[bleeding|haemorrhagic]] disease and bright blindness in livestock and [[oesophageal cancer|oesophageal]], [[gastric cancer]] in humans. Ptaquiloside has unstable chemical structure and acts as a DNA [[alkylation|alkylating agent]] under physiological conditions. It was first isolated and characterized by Yamada and co-workers in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Niwa |first1=Haruki |last2=Ojika |first2= Makoto |last3=Wakamatsu |first3=Kazumasa |last4=Yamada |first4=Kiyoyuki |last5=Ohba |first5=Shigeru |last6=Saito |first6= Yoshihiko |last7=Hirono |first7=Iwao |last8= Matsushita |first8=Kazuhiro |title= Stereochemistry of ptaquiloside, a novel norsesquiterpene glucoside from bracken, ''Pteridium aquilinum'' var. latiusculum |journal= Tetrahedron Letters |date= 1983 |volume=24 |issue=48 |pages= 5371–5372 |doi= 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)87871-5 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403900878715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niwa|first1=Haruki|last2=Ojika|first2=Makoto|last3=Wakamatsu|first3=Kazumasa|last4=Yamada|first4=Kiyoyuki|last5=Hirono|first5=Iwao|last6=Matsushita|first6=Kazuhiro |title= Ptaquiloside, a novel norsesquiterpene glucoside from bracken, Pteridium aquilinum var. latiusculum |journal= Tetrahedron Letters |date=1983 |volume=24 |issue=38 |pages=4117–4120 |doi= 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)88276-3 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040403900882763?via%3Dihub}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pure form ptaquiloside is a colorless amorphous compound. It is readily soluble in water and fairly soluble in ethyl acetate. Except in the plants, ptaquiloside has been detected in the milk and meat of affected livestock, as well as in the underground water and dry soil around bracken fern vegetation.&lt;ref name="Alonso-Amelot 1986"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Alonso-Amelot |first1= Miguel E. |last2=Castillo |first2= Uvidelio |last3=Smith |first3=Barry L. |last4= Lauren |first4=Denis R. |title= Bracken ptaquiloside in milk |journal= Nature |date=15 August 1996 |volume=382 |issue=6592 |pages= 587–587 |doi= 10.1038/382587a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jensen 5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=Pia H.|last2=Jacobsen|first2=Ole S.|last3=Hansen|first3=Hans Christian B.|last4=Juhler|first4=René K.|title=Quantification of Ptaquiloside and Pterosin B in Soil and Groundwater Using Liquid Chromatography−Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC−MS/MS)|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=12 November 2008 |volume= 56 |issue=21 |pages=9848–9854 |PMID= 18937485 |doi= 10.1021/jf801986u}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 6"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rasmussen |first1= Lars H |last2= Kroghsbo |first2=Stine |last3=Frisvad |first3=Jens C |last4= Hansen |first4= Hans Christian B |title= Occurrence of the carcinogenic Bracken constituent ptaquiloside in fronds, topsoils and organic soil layers in Denmark |journal= Chemosphere |date= April 2003 |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages= 117–127 |doi= 10.1016/S0045-6535(02)00694-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of ptaquiloside in daily sources along with its [[carcinogenic]] effects make it an increasing biological hazard in modern days.

[[File:Croziers, fronds, rhizomes of bracken fern.jpg|thumb|Croziers, fronds, rhizomes of bracken fern]]
The presence of ptaquiloside has been detected in a variety of ferns, including the species in the genera ''[[bracken|Pteridium]]'' (bracken), ''[[Pteris]]'', ''[[Microlepia]]'', and ''[[Hypolepis (plant)|Hypolepis]]''. ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' (commonly known as bracken fern) is the most common ptaquiloside-containing fern with a wide geographical and ecological distribution. It is present in all continents from [[subtropics|subtropic]] to [[subarctic]] areas. Bracken fern is a very adaptable plant and is capable of forming dense, rapidly expanding populations in course of the first phases of the [[ecological succession]] in forest cleanings and other disturbed rural areas. Its aggressive growth, characterized by an extensive [[rhizome]] system and rapidly growing [[frond]]s, sometimes enables it to be a dominant species in certain plant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kristanc|first1=Luka|last2=Kreft|first2=Samo|title=European medicinal and edible plants associated with subacute and chronic toxicity part I: Plants with carcinogenic, teratogenic and endocrine-disrupting effects|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|date=June 2016|volume=92|pages=150–164|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2016.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ptaquiloside content of bracken varies widely across species and changes with the part of the plant, the plant growing site and the collecting season. According to previous studies, the concentrations of ptaquiloside in bracken varied between 0 to 1% of the dry weight of the plant.&lt;ref name="Smith 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Barry L.|last2=Seawright|first2=Alan A.|last3=Ng|first3=Jack C.|last4=Hertle|first4=Andrew T.|last5=Tomson|first5=John A.|last6=Bostock|first6=Peter D.|title=Concentration of ptaquiloside, a major carcinogen in bracken fern (Pteridium spp.), from Eastern Australia and from a cultivated worldwide collection held in Sydney, Australia|journal=Nat.

Dorling|location=Wallingford|pages=45–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, ptaquiloside is found to occur in the highest concentrations in the young developing parts of bracken, such as the croziers and unfolding parts during the spring and early summer, while the concentrations of ptaquiloside in the rhizomes are rather low.&lt;ref name="Vetter 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vetter|first1=János|title=A biological hazard of our age: Bracken fern [(L.) Kuhn] — A Review|journal=Acta Veterinaria Hungarica|date=March 2009|volume=57|issue=1|pages=183–196|doi=10.1556/AVet.57.2009.1.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies on the concentrations of ptaquiloside in Danish bracken by Rasmussen et al. showed that the concentrations of ptaquiloside in the rhizomes were significantly higher than the previously reported values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Lars Holm|last2=Jensen|first2=Lasse Sander|last3=Hansen|first3=Hans Christian Bruun|title=Distribution of the Carcinogenic Terpene Ptaquiloside in Bracken Fronds, Rhizomes (Pteridium aquilinum), and Litter in Denmark|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=2003|volume=29|issue=3|pages=771–778|doi=10.1023/A:1022885006742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptaquiloside can pass into the milk produced by bracken-fed cows and sheep. In 1996, Alonso-Amelot, Smith and co-workers found that ptaquiloside was excreted in milk at a concentration of 8.6 ± 1.2% of the amount ingested by a cow from bracken, and was linearly dose-dependent. On the basis of their experiments and the assumption that a person drinks 0.5 litres of milk daily, they estimated that this person might ingest about 10&amp;nbsp;mg of ptaquiloside per day, although only some of that amount will be absorbed.&lt;ref name="Alonso-Amelot 1986"/&gt;  Ptaquiloside can also leach from the bracken leaves into water and soil. Numerous studies have reported the presence of ptaquiloside in the underground/surface water, and soil near bracken vegetation.&lt;ref name="Jensen 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 6"/&gt; The degradation speed of ptaquiloside in the soil is affected by the [[pH|acidity]], clay content, carbon content, temperature and presumably microbioactivity. Acidic condition (pH&lt;4) and high temperature (at least 25℃) facilitate ptaquiloside degradation, while the [[half-life]] of ptaquiloside in less acidic sandy soil is reported to be between 150 and 180 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Lars Holm|last2=Bruun Hansen|first2=Hans Christian|last3=Lauren|first3=Denis|title=Sorption, degradation and mobility of ptaquiloside, a carcinogenic Bracken (Pteridium sp.) constituent, in the soil environment|journal=Chemosphere|date=February 2005|volume=58|issue=6|pages=823–835|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2004.08.088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ways of ptaquiloside exposure===
Main routes that can lead to human exposure to the toxic effects of bracken fern include ingestion of the plant (particularly the croziers and young fronds), inhalation of the airborne [[spore]]s, consumption of the milk and meat of affected animals, and drinking ptaquiloside contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Virgilio|first1=Antonella|last2=Sinisi|first2=Annamaria|last3=Russo|first3=Valeria|last4=Gerardo|first4=Salvatore|last5=Santoro|first5=Adriano|last6=Galeone|first6=Aldo|last7=Taglialatela-Scafati|first7=Orazio|last8=Roperto|first8=Franco|title=Ptaquiloside, the Major Carcinogen of Bracken Fern, in the Pooled Raw Milk of Healthy Sheep and Goats: An Underestimated, Global Concern of Food Safety|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=20 May 2015|volume=63|issue=19|pages=4886–4892|doi=10.1021/acs.jafc.5b01937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
Ptaquiloside has unstable chemical structure and readily undergoes [[glucose]] liberation. The resulting ptaquilo[[dienone]] is the active form of ptaquiloside and accounts for the observed biological effects. The [[cyclopropyl group]] in the dienone is highly reactive as an [[electrophile]], not only because it is conjugated with the [[ketone|keto]] group, but because it also constitutes a cyclopropyl carbinol system, from which the facile formation of the stable non-classical cation is well-known.

===General mechanism===
In acidic conditions, ptaquiloside gradually undergoes [[aromatization]] with the elimination of [[glucose|D-glucose]] to afford ptaquilosin, and finally pterosin B. Under weakly alkaline conditions, ptaquiloside and its aglycone ptaquilosin are converted into an unstable conjugated [[dienone]] intermediate. This ptaquilodienone is the activated form of ptaquiloside and is regarded as the ultimate [[carcinogen]] of bracken ferns. Due to the constitution of a cyclopropyl carbinol system, ptaquilodienone is a strong [[electrophile]] and acts as a powerful [[alkylation|alkylating agent]] that reacts directly with biological [[nucleophile]]s including [[amino acid]]s, [[nucleoside]]s, and [[nucleotide]]s under weakly acidic conditions at room temperature (as shown in the scheme below).&lt;ref name="Potter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=D.

S.|title=Carcinogenic effects of ptaquiloside in bracken fern and related compounds|journal=British Journal of Cancer|date=1 October 2000|volume=83|issue=7|pages=914–920|doi=10.1054/bjoc.2000.1368|issn=0007-0920|pmid=10970694|pmc=2374682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

===Under physiological conditions===
Under physiological conditions, ptaquiloside readily liberates glucose to produce the ptaquilodienone. The alkylation of amino acids with the dienone mostly takes place at the [[thiol]] group in [[cysteine]], [[glutathione]] and [[methionine]]. The alkylation at the carboxylate group of each amino acid, forming the corresponding [[ester]], is also observed to a small extent based on the previously reported literature. The dienone reacts with both [[adenine]] (majorly at N-3) and [[guanine]] (majorly at N-7) residues of [[DNA]] to form the DNA adducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ojika|first1=Makoto|last2=Wakamatsu|first2=Kazumasa|last3=Niwa|first3=Haruki|last4=Yamada|first4=Kiyoyuki|title=Ptaquiloside, a potent carcinogen isolated from bracken fern var. : structure elucidation based on chemical and spectral evidence, and reactions with amino acids, nucleosides, and nucleotides|journal=Tetrahedron|date=January 1987|volume=43|issue=22|pages=5261–5274|doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)87702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alkylation induces spontaneous [[depurination]] and cleavage of DNA at adenine base site. In a model reaction with a deoxytetranucleotide (as shown on the right), a covalent adduct is found at a guanine residue and the N-[[glycosidic bond]] breaks to release the adduct.&lt;ref name="Potter"/&gt; In 1998, Prakash, Smith and co-workers showed that the alkylation of adenine by ptaquiloside in codon 61 followed by depurination and error in the DNA synthesis resulted in the activation of [[HRAS|H-''ras'']] proto-[[oncogene]] in the [[ileum]] of calves fed bracken.&lt;ref name="Prakash"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahin|first1=Mahmood|last2=Moore|first2=Michael R.|last3=Worrall|first3=Simon|last4=Smith|first4=Barry L.|last5=Seawright|first5=Alan A.|last6=Prakash|first6=Arungundrum S.|title=H-rasActivation Is an Early Event in the Ptaquiloside-Induced Carcinogenesis: Comparison of Acute and Chronic Toxicity in Rats|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=September 1998|volume=250|issue=2|pages=491–497|doi=10.1006/bbrc.1998.9341|pmid=9753659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndromes==
Bracken is known to have various biological effects, such as carcinogenicity and its well-defined syndromes in livestock and laboratory animals. Ptaquiloside is proved to be responsible for several of these biological effects, some of which are species specific.&lt;ref name="Vetter 2009"/&gt;

===Ruminants===
Cattle that consume bracken ferns develop acute bracken poisoning and chronic bovine enzootic haematuria (BEH). The main feature of acute bracken poisoning in cattle is the depression of bone marrow activity, which gives rise to severe [[leucopenia]] (particularly of the granulocytes), [[thrombocytopenia]], and acute [[bleeding|haemorrhagic]] crisis.&lt;ref name="Yamada Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamada|first1=Kiyoyuki|last2=Ojika|first2=Makoto|last3=Kigoshi|first3=Hideo|title=Ptaquiloside, the major toxin of bracken, and related terpene glycosides: chemistry, biology and ecology|journal=Natural Product Reports|date=2007|volume=24|issue=4|pages=798|doi=10.1039/B614160A|pmid=17653360}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the researchers believe ptaquiloside is not the direct causing agent of the acute bracken fern poisoning. The main feature of haematuria is [[bladder cancer|urinary bladder tumors]] and [[haematuria]] in cattle after prolonged exposure to bracken. Based on the extensive studies, a positive correlation is shown between the ptquiloside concentration and the incidence of BEH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=B.L.|last2=Embling|first2=P.P.|last3=Agnew|first3=M.P.|last4=Lauren|first4=D.R.|last5=Holland|first5=P.T.|title=Carcinogenicity of bracken fern                            in New Zealand|journal=New Zealand Veterinary Journal|date=June 1988|volume=36|issue=2|pages=56–58|doi=10.1080/00480169.1988.35481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinto|first1=C.|last2=Januário|first2=T.|last3=Geraldes|first3=M.|last4=Machado|first4=J.|last5=Lauren|first5=D.

===Non-ruminants===
Rats that were given a diet containing ptaquiloside for a prolonged period developed tumors in both the [[ileum]] and [[urinary bladder]]. Prakash, Smith and co-workers showed that ptaquiloside-induced carcinogenesis was initiated by the activation of the H-''ras'' oncogene.&lt;ref name="Prakash"/&gt; Other non-ruminants such as pig, rabbit, and guinea pig, also develop syndromes after ingestion of ptaquiloside, which include haematuria, tumors and organ abnormities (see the diagram).&lt;ref name="Vetter 2009"/&gt;

===Human populations===
Bracken fern increases the oncogenic risk in humans. Epidemiological survey revealed that bracken fern consumption was positively correlated with [[esophageal cancer]] and with [[gastric cancer]] in many geographical areas of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marliére|first1=C.

==Control and detection==
The use of bracken fern as human food is mainly a historical question. The rhizomes of these plants served as human food in Scotland during the First World War. In America (USA, Canada), Russia, China and Japan, fern is grown commercially for human use. The usual procedure that is performed before eating the plant is to pre-treat the fern with boiling water in the presence of different chemicals, such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] and [[wood ash]], to degrade or inactivate ptaquiloside and other toxic agents. Nevertheless, some carcinogenic activity persists even after the treatment.&lt;ref name="Vetter 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharma|first1=Rinku|last2=Bhat|first2=Tej K.|last3=Sharma|first3=Om P.|title=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology Volume 224|date=2013|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York|isbn=9781461458814|pages=53–95|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-5882-1_3|language=en|chapter=The Environmental and Human Effects of Ptaquiloside-Induced Enzootic Bovine Hematuria: A Tumorous Disease of Cattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown by Kamon and Hirayama, the risk of oesophageal cancer was increased approximately by 2.1 in men and 3.7 in women who regularly consume bracken in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kamon|first1=S.|last2=Hirayama|first2=T.|title=Epidemiology of cancer of the oesophagus in Mye, Nara and Wakayama prefecture with special reference to the role of bracken fern。|journal=Proc. Jpn. Cancer Assoc., 34th Annual Meeting|date=1975|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent researches have suggested that sulfur-containing amino acids can potentially be used under appropriate conditions as detoxifying agents for ptaquiloside &lt;ref name="Yamada Review"/&gt; and selenium supplementation can prevent as well as reverse the immunotoxic effects induced by ptaquiloside.&lt;ref name="pmid21112370"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Latorre AO, Caniceiro BD, Wysocki HL, Haraguchi M, Gardner DR, Górniak SL |title=Selenium reverses Pteridium aquilinum-induced immunotoxic effects |journal=Food Chem.

Ptaquiloside in the aqueous extract of bracken can be detected using different instrumental methods: [[thin-layer chromatography]]–densitometry (TLC-densitometry), [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC), [[gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GCMS), and [[liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS). The diagnostic tests of ptaquiloside inside cells include [[gene mutation]] detection, immunohistochemical detection of tumor biomarkers, chromosomal aberrations, oxidative stress for EBH, [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], real-time PCR and DNase-SISPA (sequence-independent single primer amplification).&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;

==Total synthesis==
In 1989 and 1993, Yamada and co-workers reported the first [[enantioselective]] total synthesis of both the [[enantiomer]]s of ptaquilosin, the [[aglycone]] of ptaquiloside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kigoshi|first1=Hideo|last2=Imamura|first2=Yoshifumi|last3=Mizuta|first3=Kazuhiro|last4=Niwa|first4=Haruki|last5=Yamada|first5=Kiyoyuki|title=Total synthesis of natural (-)-ptaquilosin, the aglycon of a potent bracken carcinogen ptaquiloside and the (+)-enantiomer, and their DNA cleaving activities|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=April 1993|volume=115|issue=8|pages=3056–3065|doi=10.1021/ja00061a003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kigoshi|first1=Hideo|last2=Imamura|first2=Yoshifumi|last3=Niwa|first3=Haruki|last4=Yamada|first4=Kiyoyuki|title=Total synthesis of ptaquilosin: the aglycon of ptaquiloside, a potent bracken carcinogen|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=March 1989|volume=111|issue=6|pages=2302–2303|doi=10.1021/ja00188a054}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step, the [[menthol|menthyl]] [[ester]] of cyclopentane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid '''1''' was partially hydrolyzed to afford the monomenthyl ester, which was later alkylated with methallyl bromide in the presence of [[Hexamethylphosphoramide|HMPA]] to selectively produce '''2'''.  The product '''2''' was then converted to the acid chloride and treated with [[Tin(IV) chloride|stannic chloride]] to effect [[Friedel-Crafts reaction|Friedel-Crafts acylation]] to give [[enone]] '''3'''. Hydride reduction, selective oxidation of the allylic alcohol, and [[silylation]] were then performed to provide compound '''4'''. On treatment with base and a chloroethyl sulfonium salt, a mixture of spiro[[cyclopropane]]s was obtained. The minor product '''5a''' can be [[isomerization|isomerized]] with [[p-toluenesulfonic acid]] to '''5b''' with 81% yield. Desaturation by selenylation/dehydroselenation and basic peroxide oxidation afforded [[epoxide]] '''6'''. Mild reduction, methyl [[Grignard reaction|Grignard addition]], and oxidation gave compound '''7'''. [[Methylation]] of the cyclopentanone under Noyori’s condition using the TASF enolate produced a mixture of isomers. The undesired isomer '''8a''' can be equilibriumed with [[potassium tert-butoxide]] in 81% yield to exclusively generate '''8b'''.{{clarify|date=June 2017|Exclusively in 81% yield? And please, can someone replace that horrid "equilibriumed" with something like "isomerized".}}  [[Redox|Reduction]], [[deprotection]], and [[oxidation]] afforded '''9'''. On treatment with oxygen in warm [[ethyl acetate]], the [[aldehyde]] on '''9''' was oxidized to the acyl radical for decarbonylation. Stereoselective trapping of the [[tertiary]] radical by oxygen gave the [[hydroperoxide]] '''10'''. Under mild reduction, the naturally occurred (-)-ptaquilosin '''11''' was obtained. The Yamada’s synthesis proceeded in 20 steps with an overall yield of 2.9%. Similarly, the unnatural (+)-enantiomer of ptaquilosin was synthesized from the [[diastereomer]] of '''2'''.
[[File:Total synthesis of (-)-ptaquilosin.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|Total synthesis of (-)-ptaquilosin]]
Multiple synthetic studies directed towards ptaquilosin '''11''' have been reported since 1989. In 1994, Padwa and co-workers described the synthesis of the core skeleton of ptaquilosin by a highly convergent approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padwa|first1=Albert|last2=Sandanayaka|first2=Vincent P.|last3=Curtis|first3=Erin A.|title=Synthetic studies toward Illudins and Ptaquilosin.

Their properly functionalized tricyclic compound would be of great utility for the synthesis of '''11'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cossy |first1=Janine |last2= Ibhi |first2=Saïd |last3=Kahn |first3= Philippe H. |last4= Tacchini |first4=Laura |title= A formal synthesis of ptaquilosin the aglycon of a potent bracken carcinogen ptaquiloside |journal=Tetrahedron Letters |date= October 1995 |volume= 36 |issue=43 |pages= 7877–7880 |doi= 10.1016/0040-4039(95)01552-S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of allergic rhinitis, the inflammation is caused by the [[degranulation]] of [[mast cell]]s in the nose. When mast cells degranulate, they release [[histamine]] and other chemicals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/532192_2 |title=Inflammatory Nature of Allergic Rhinitis: Pathophysiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting an inflammatory process that can cause symptoms outside the nose, such as fatigue and malaise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.espai-eg.org/Journal/8-1/Deraz.pdf |title=Immunopathogenesis of allergic rhinitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of infectious rhinitis, it may occasionally lead to [[pneumonia]], either [[viral pneumonia|viral]] or [[bacterial pneumonia|bacterial]]. Sneezing also occurs in infectious rhinitis to expel bacteria and viruses from the respiratory system.

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
Rhinitis is very common. Allergic rhinitis is more common in some countries than others; in the United States, about 10%–30% of adults are affected annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/472667_2 | title=Economic Impact and Quality-of-Life Burden of Allergic Rhinitis: Prevalence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixed rhinitis (MR) refers to patients with nonallergic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis. MR is a specific rhinitis subtype. It may represent between 50 and 70% of all AR patients. However, true prevalence of MR has not been confirmed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan A.|date=September 2010|title=Allergic and mixed rhinitis: Epidemiology and natural history|journal=Allergy and Asthma Proceedings|volume=31|issue=5|pages=365–369|doi=10.2500/aap.2010.31.3380|issn=1539-6304|pmid=20929601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Rhinitis is categorized into three types (although infectious rhinitis is typically regarded as a separate clinical entity due to its transient nature): (i) infectious rhinitis includes acute and chronic [[bacterial infection]]s; (ii) [[Nonallergic rhinitis|nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis]] includes idiopathic, [[hormonal]], [[atrophic]], occupational, and [[gustatory]] rhinitis, as well as [[rhinitis medicamentosa]] (drug-induced); (iii) [[allergic rhinitis]], triggered by [[pollen]], [[mold]], animal [[dander]], dust, [[Balsam of Peru]], and other inhaled allergens.&lt;ref name="meds"/&gt;

===Infectious===
{{See also|Common cold|Sinusitis}}
Rhinitis is commonly caused by a [[Biological virus|viral]] or [[bacterial]] infection, including the common cold, which is caused by [[Rhinovirus]]es, [[Coronavirus]]es, and [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza viruses]], others caused by [[Adenoviridae|adenoviruses]], [[human parainfluenza viruses]], [[human respiratory syncytial virus]], [[enterovirus]]es other than rhinoviruses, [[metapneumovirus]], and [[measles virus]], or bacterial [[sinusitis]], which is commonly caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', and ''[[Moraxella catarrhalis]]''. Symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat ([[pharyngitis]]), [[cough]], [[Nasal congestion|congestion]], and slight [[headache]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Troullos E, Baird L, Jayawardena S | title = Common cold symptoms in children: results of an Internet-based surveillance program | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = e144 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24945090 | pmc = 4090373 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.2868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Nonallergic rhinitis===
{{main|Nonallergic rhinitis}}
Nonallergic rhinitis refers to rhinitis that is not due to an allergy. The category was formerly referred to as vasomotor rhinitis, as the first cause discovered was vasodilation due to an overactive parasympathetic nerve response. As additional causes were identified, additional types of nonallergic rhinitis were recognized. Vasomotor rhinitis is now included among these under the more general classification of nonallergic rhinitis.&lt;ref name="Vasomotor rhinitis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheeler PW, Wheeler SF | title = Vasomotor rhinitis | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 1057–62 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16190503 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis is made upon excluding allergic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown KR, Bernstein JA | title = Clinically relevant outcome measures of novel pharmacotherapy for nonallergic rhinitis | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–12 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25899692 | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an umbrella term of rhinitis of multiple causes, such as occupational (chemical), smoking, gustatory, hormonal, senile (rhinitis of the elderly), atrophic, medication-induced (including rhinitis medicamentosa), local allergic rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) and idiopathic (vasomotor or non-allergic, non-infectious perennial allergic rhinitis (NANIPER), or non-infectious non-allergic rhinitis (NINAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Gerven L, Boeckxstaens G, Hellings P | title = Up-date on neuro-immune mechanisms involved in allergic and non-allergic rhinitis | journal = Rhinology | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–35 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22888478 | doi = 10.4193/Rhino11.152 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;references group="PMID 21991571" /&gt;

Non-allergic rhinitis can co-exist with allergic rhinitis, and is referred to as "mixed rhinitis".&lt;ref&gt;(Middleton's Allergy Principles and Practice, seventh edition.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pathology of vasomotor rhinitis appears to involve [[neurogenic inflammation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Knipping S, Holzhausen HJ, Riederer A, Schrom T | title = [Ultrastructural changes in allergic rhinitis vs. idiopathic rhinitis] | journal = Hno | volume = 56 | issue = 8 | pages = 799–807 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18651116 | doi = 10.1007/s00106-008-1764-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is as yet not very well understood. The role of transient receptor potential ion channels on the non-neuronal nasal epithelial cells has also been suggested. Overexpression of these receptors have influence the nasal airway hyper-responsiveness to non-allergic irritant environmental stimuli (e.g., extremes of temperature, changes in osmotic or barometric pressure).&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein JA, Singh U | title = Neural Abnormalities in Nonallergic Rhinitis | journal = Current Allergy and Asthma Reports | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 18 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 26130469 | doi = 10.1007/s11882-015-0511-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vasomotor rhinitis appears to be significantly more common in women than men, leading some researchers to believe that [[hormone]]s play a role. In general, age of onset occurs after 20 years of age, in contrast to allergic rhinitis which can be developed at any age. Individuals with vasomotor rhinitis typically experience symptoms year-round, though symptoms may be exacerbated in the spring and autumn when rapid weather changes are more common.&lt;ref name="Vasomotor rhinitis"/&gt; An estimated 17 million United States citizens have vasomotor rhinitis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Drinking alcohol may cause rhinitis as well as worsen [[asthma]] (see [[alcohol-induced respiratory reactions]]).  In certain populations, particularly those of East Asian countries such as Japan, these reactions have a nonallergic basis.&lt;ref name=AA2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams KE, Rans TS | title = Adverse reactions to alcohol and alcoholic beverages | journal = Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology | volume = 111 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–45 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24267355 | doi = 10.1016/j.anai.2013.09.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other populations, particularly those of European descent, a genetic variant in the gene that metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, ADH1B, is associated with alcohol-induced rhinitis.  It is suggested that this variant metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde too quickly for further processing by ALDH2 and thereby leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde and rhinitis symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macgregor S, Lind PA, Bucholz KK, Hansell NK, Madden PA, Richter MM, Montgomery GW, Martin NG, Heath AC, Whitfield JB | title = Associations of ADH and ALDH2 gene variation with self report alcohol reactions, consumption and dependence: an integrated analysis | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 580–93 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 18996923 | pmc = 2722191 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddn372 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, alcohol-induced rhinitis may be of the ''mixed rhinitis'' type and, it seems likely, most cases of alcohol-induced rhinitis in non-Asian populations reflect true allergic response to the non-ethanol and/or contaminants in alcoholic beverages, particularly when these beverages are wines or beers.&lt;ref name=AA2013/&gt; Alcohol-exacerbated rhinitis is more frequent in individuals with a history of rhinitis exacerbated by aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardet JC, White AA, Barrett NA, Feldweg AM, Wickner PG, Savage J, Bhattacharyya N, Laidlaw TM | title = Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms are common in patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Aspirin and other [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), particularly those that inhibit [[cyclooxygenase 1]] ([[COX1]]), can worsen rhinitis and asthma symptoms in individuals with a history of either one of these diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajan JP, Wineinger NE, Stevenson DD, White AA | title = Prevalence of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease among asthmatic patients: A meta-analysis of the literature | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 135 | issue = 3 | pages = 676–81.e1 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25282015 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2014.08.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These exacerbations most often appear due to [[NSAID hypersensitivity reactions]] rather than NSAID-induced allergic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi JH, Kim MA, Park HS | title = An update on the pathogenesis of the upper airways in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24300420 | doi = 10.1097/aci.0000000000000021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antihistamine [[azelastine]], applied as a nasal spray, may be effective for vasomotor rhinitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein JA | title = Azelastine hydrochloride: a review of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and tolerability | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 2441–52 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17723160 | doi = 10.1185/030079907X226302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluticasone propionate]] or [[budesonide]] (both are [[steroid]]s) in nostril spray form may also be used for symptomatic treatment. The antihistamine [[cyproheptadine]] is also effective, probably due to its [[Serotonin antagonist|antiserotonergic]] effects.

A systematic review on non-allergic rhinitis reports improvement of overall function after treatment with [[capsaicin]] (the active component of chili peppers). The quality of evidence is low, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gevorgyan A, Segboer C, Gorissen R, van Drunen CM, Fokkens W | title = Capsaicin for non-allergic rhinitis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = CD010591 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26171907 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010591.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergic===
{{Main|Allergic rhinitis}}
Allergic rhinitis or hay fever may follow when an allergen such as [[pollen]], dust, or [[Balsam of Peru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eReGG6UtxbcC&amp;pg=PT413&amp;dq=%22balsam+of+peru%22+allergy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22balsam%20of%20peru%22%20allergy&amp;f=false |title=The Daily Telegraph: Complete Guide to Allergies | first = Pamela | last = Brooks | name-list-format = vanc |publisher= |date=2012-10-25 |access-date=2014-04-23|isbn=9781472103949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is inhaled by an individual with a sensitized immune system, triggering [[antibody]] production. These antibodies mostly bind to [[mast cells]], which contain [[histamine]]. When the mast cells are stimulated by an allergen, histamine (and other chemicals) are released. This causes itching, swelling, and mucus production.

Symptoms vary in severity between individuals. Very sensitive individuals can experience [[hives]] or other [[rash]]es. Particulate matter in polluted air and chemicals such as [[chlorine]] and detergents, which can normally be tolerated, can greatly aggravate the condition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Characteristic physical findings in individuals who have allergic rhinitis include [[conjunctival]] swelling and [[erythema]], eyelid swelling, lower eyelid [[venous stasis]], lateral crease on the nose, swollen nasal [[turbinate]]s, and [[middle ear]] [[effusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Valet RS, Fahrenholz JM | url = http://www.consultantlive.com/display/article/10162/1465701 | title = Allergic rhinitis: update on diagnosis | journal = Consultant | date = 2009 | volume = 49 | pages = 610–613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if a person has negative [[skin allergy test|skin-prick, intradermal]] and [[RAST test|blood tests]] for allergies, they may still have allergic rhinitis, from a local allergy in the nose. This is called [[allergic rhinitis#Local allergic rhinitis|local allergic rhinitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rondón C, Canto G, Blanca M | title = Local allergic rhinitis: a new entity, characterization and further studies | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20010094 | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0b013e328334f5fb }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who were previously diagnosed with nonallergic rhinitis may actually have local allergic rhinitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rondón C, Fernandez J, Canto G, Blanca M | title = Local allergic rhinitis: concept, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach | journal = Journal of Investigational Allergology &amp; Clinical Immunology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 364–71; quiz 2 p following 371 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20945601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[patch test]] may be used to determine if a particular substance is causing the rhinitis.

===Rhinitis medicamentosa===
{{Main|Rhinitis medicamentosa}}
Rhinitis medicamentosa is a form of drug-induced nonallergic rhinitis which is associated with [[nasal congestion]] brought on by the use of certain oral medications (primarily [[sympathomimetic amine]] and [[2-imidazoline]] derivatives) and [[topical decongestant]]s (e.g., [[oxymetazoline]], [[phenylephrine]], [[xylometazoline]], and [[naphazoline]] [[nasal spray]]s) that constrict the blood vessels in the lining of the nose.&lt;ref name="rhinitis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramey JT, Bailen E, Lockey RF | title = Rhinitis medicamentosa | journal = Journal of Investigational Allergology &amp; Clinical Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 148–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16784007 | url = http://www.jiaci.org/issues/vol16issue03/1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic atrophic rhinitis===
{{main|Chronic atrophic rhinitis}}
Chronic rhinitis is a form of [[atrophy]] of the mucous membrane and glands of the nose.

===Rhinitis sicca===
Chronic form of dryness of the mucous membranes.

===Polypous rhinitis===
Chronic rhinitis associated with [[nasal polyp|polyps in the nasal cavity]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Neural abnormalities.tif|thumb|'''Pathological changes in non-allergic rhinitis'''&lt;ref name = "Bernstein_2015" /&gt;]]
[[File:Non-allergic rhinitis mechanism.tif|thumb|Mechanism of non-allergic rhinitis: Imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic components in the nasal mucous membrane&lt;ref name = "Bernstein_2015" /&gt;]]
Most prominent pathological changes observed are nasal airway '''epithelial [[metaplasia]]''' in which [[goblet cell]]s replace [[Cilium|ciliated columnar epithelial cells]] in the nasal mucous membrane.&lt;ref name="Bernstein_2015" /&gt; This results in mucin hypersecretion by goblet cells and decreased mucociliary activity. Nasal secretion are not adequately cleared with clinical manifestation of nasal congestion, sinus pressure, post-nasal dripping, and headache. Over-expression of transient receptor potential [[Transient receptor potential channel|(TRP) ion channels]], such as TRPA1 and TRPV1, may be involved in the pathogenesis of non-allergic rhinitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Millqvist E | title = TRP channels and temperature in airway disease-clinical significance | journal = Temperature | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 172–7 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 27227021 | pmc = 4843868 | doi = 10.1080/23328940.2015.1012979 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Association between rhinitis and asthma ===
Neurogenic inflammation produced by neuropeptides released from sensory nerve endings to the airways is a proposed common mechanism of association between both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis with asthma. This may explain higher association of rhinitis with asthma developing later in life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eriksson J, Bjerg A, Lötvall J, Wennergren G, Rönmark E, Torén K, Lundbäck B | title = Rhinitis phenotypes correlate with different symptom presentation and risk factor patterns of asthma | journal = Respiratory Medicine | volume = 105 | issue = 11 | pages = 1611–21 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21764573 | doi = 10.1016/j.rmed.2011.06.004 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954611111002046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental irritants acts as modulators of airway inflammation in these contiguous airways. Development of [[occupational asthma]] is often preceded by occupational rhinitis. Among the causative agents are flours, enzymes used in processing food, latex, isocyanates, welding fumes, epoxy resins, and formaldehyde. Accordingly, prognosis of [[occupational asthma]] is contingent on early diagnosis and the adoption of protective measures for rhinitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scherer Hofmeier K, Bircher A, Tamm M, Miedinger D | title = [Occupational rhinitis and asthma] | journal = Therapeutische Umschau.

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=December 2017}}

==Prevention==
In the case of infectious rhinitis, vaccination against [[influenza vaccines|influenza viruses]], [[adenovirus vaccine|adenoviruses]], [[measles]], [[rubella]], [[pneumococcal vaccine|''Streptococcus pneumoniae'']], [[Hib vaccine|''Haemophilus influenzae'']], [[diphtheria vaccine|diphtheria]], [[anthrax vaccines|''Bacillus anthracis'']], and [[pertussis vaccine|''Bordetella pertussis'']] may help prevent it.

==Management==
The management of rhinitis depends on the underlying cause.

For allergic rhinitis, intranasal [[corticosteroid]]s are recommended.&lt;ref name=Wal2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallace DV, Dykewicz MS, Oppenheimer J, Portnoy JM, Lang DM | title = Pharmacologic Treatment of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis: Synopsis of Guidance From the 2017 Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 167 | issue = 12 | pages = 876–881 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29181536 | doi = 10.7326/M17-2203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For severe symptoms intranasal [[antihistamine]]s may be added.&lt;ref name=Wal2017/&gt;

==Pronunciation and etymology==
Rhinitis is pronounced {{IPAc-en|r|aɪ|ˈ|n|aɪ|t|ɪ|s}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | title = rhinitis {{!}} Definition, meaning &amp; more {{!}} Collins Dictionary   | publisher = www.collinsdictionary.com   | url = https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/rhinitis   | access-date = 4 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while coryza is pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|aɪ|z|ə}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web   | title = coryza {{!}} Definition, meaning &amp; more {{!}} Collins Dictionary   | publisher = www.collinsdictionary.com  | url = https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/coryza   | access-date = 4 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rhinitis'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ῥίς ''rhis'', ''gen''.: ῥινός ''rhinos'' "nose". ''Coryza'' has a dubious etymology. [[Robert S. P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12956">'''Small arms ammunition pressure testing''' is used to establish standards for maximum average peak pressures of chamberings, as well as determining the safety of particular loads for the purposes of new load development.   In metallic cartridges, peak pressure can vary based on propellant used, primers used, charge weight, projectile type, projectile seating depth, neck tension, chamber throat/leade parameters.  In shotshells, the primary factors are charge weight, projectile weight, wad type, hull construction, and crimp quality.

==Modern civilian test methodologies==
The two modern standardized test methodologies in use are the [[Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives]] or C.I.P. methodology, and the [[Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute]] or SAAMI methodology.   The SAAMI methodology is widely used in the US, while C.I.P. is widely used in the mainly European C.I.P. member states.  While both modern methodologies use [[Piezoelectric sensor|piezo]] pressure transducer sensors to generate pressure readings, differences in the test setup mean that the same pressures will often generate very different readings depending on the method used.

Because C.I.P. and SAAMI maximum pressures are measured differently, it is important to know which methodology was used to measure peak pressures.  While C.I.P. pressures are often quoted in [[Pascal (unit)|megapascals]] in Wikipedia and [[Bar (unit)|bars]] by C.I.P., and SAAMI in [[pounds per square inch|psi]], it is not unusual to see C.I.P. pressures converted to psi or vice versa.&lt;ref name=kwk&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Cartridge Pressure Standards | url = http://kwk.us/pressures.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 14 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===C.I.P. method===
C.I.P. uses a drilled case to expose the pressure transducer directly to propellant gases. The piezo measuring device (transducer) is positioned at a distance of {{convert|25|mm|in}} from the breech face when the length of the cartridge case permits that, including limits. When the length of the cartridge case is too short, pressure measurement will take place at a chambering specific defined shorter distance from the breech face depending on the dimensions of the case. The defined distance for a particular chambering is published in the TDCC data sheet of the chambering.&lt;br&gt;
In a rifle cartridge case like the .308 Winchester, the TDCC M = 25.00 value denotes the transducer must be positioned at a distance of {{convert|25|mm|in}} from the breech face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cip-bobp.org/homologation/uploads/tdcc/tab-i/tabical-en-page125.pdf .308 Wincheste C.I.P. TDCC datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In a relatively short pistol cartridge case like the 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger in C.I.P. nomenclature), the TDCC M = 12.50 value denotes the transducer must be positioned at a distance of {{convert|12.5|mm|in}} from the breech face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cip-bobp.org/homologation/uploads/tdcc/tab-iv/tabivcal-en-page28.pdf 9×19mm Parabellum/9mm Luger C.I.P. TDCC datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have incorrectly concluded that C.I.P. measures pressure at the case mouth to account for the variations from SAAMI pressure.&lt;ref name=kwk /&gt;

As transducer C.I.P. almost exclusively uses one type of [[Piezoelectric sensor]] (named "channel sensor") made by the Swiss company [[Kistler Group|Kistler]] that requires drilling of the cartridge case before firing the proofing cartridge in a specially made test barrel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cip-bobp.org/homologation/uploads/annexe/annexeiii-en-cr1.pdf C.I.P. Anexxe III Proof barrels Rifled weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensorsnw.com/2010/pdf/kistershort.pdf Kistler Sensors for measuring Pressure, Fore, Acceleration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kistler.com/us/en/product/pressure/6215 Kistler ballistic pressure measurement sensor 6215]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kistler ballistic pressure measurement sensor 6215 has a maximum working pressure of {{convert|600|MPa|psi|0|abbr=on}} and is mounted recessed inside the cartridge case (the face of high-pressure sensor does not contact the cartridge case) and requires that the test cartridge case have a hole drilled in it prior to testing. The test cartridge must be inserted into the chamber in such a way that the hole in the test cartridge case lines up with a gas port hole that channels the gas pressure from the cartridge case to the face of the sensor. The measurement accuracy of the pressure measurements with 21st century high-pressure sensors is expected to be ≤ 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wsmrc2vger.wsmr.army.mil/rcc/manuals/19thtran/Xducer-00-P1.pdf Defining Parameters for Ballistic High Pressure Sensors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220230912/https://wsmrc2vger.wsmr.army.mil/rcc/manuals/19thtran/Xducer-00-P1.pdf |date=2013-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SAAMI method===
SAAMI pressure testing protocol uses a conformal Piezoelectric Quartz Transducer for pressure testing of centerfire pistol and revolver, centerfire rifle, and rimfire cartridges. The primary source of the conformal transducers is the US company [[PCB Piezotronics]]. The SAAMI pressure testing protocol uses test barrels that have a hole located in the chamber at a location specific to the cartridge. The SAAMI conformal transducer is fitted into a hole that penetrates the test barrel chamber in such a way that the transducer's face, precision machined to match curvature of the chamber wall at the mounting location a specific distance from the breech face, functions as part of the chamber wall. When the cartridge is fired the gas pressure causes the cartridge case to expand, contacting the chamber walls. The portion of the cartridge case in contact with the face of the conformal transducer exerts a pressure on the transducer which in turn generates a minute electronic impulse that is amplified and results in a reading in pounds per square inch (psi). The SAAMI conformal transducer has the benefit of not requiring a drilled cartridge case and the corresponding challenges of inserting and alignment required of drilled cartridge case. Instead it requires a simple pressure test of a sample case from the lot of cartridge cases being used in the test ammunition. This pressure test determines the gas pressure required to cause the case to expand and come in contact with the face of the conformal transducer upon firing. This measurement is referred to as the "offset" and makes allowance for the "loss" of that gas pressure prior to the cartridge case coming in contact with the transducer and generating the impulse. The offset is added to the pressure reading to arrive at the peak pressure reading. Other benefits of the SAAMI conformal transducer are: very adaptive to the high volume quality control testing demands of commercial and law enforcement ammunition production; protection of the transducer from direct exposure to the high temperature combustion gases and hence a comparatively long service life; {{convert|80000|psi|MPa|1|abbr=on}} maximum working pressure. Cartridges with the same chamber wall diameter at the mounting point of the transducer and which operate within specific chamber pressure limits may use the same transducer interchangeably reducing instrumentation costs.

===Shotshell ammunition method===
For [[shotshell]] ammunition, the technical variations are easier to solve since only one type of [[Piezoelectric sensor]] (called "tangential sensor") is available from the PCB Piezotronics and Kistler International companies to be used without drilling without variations amongst SAAMI guidelines and C.I.P. rulings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cip-bobp.org/homologation/uploads/annexe/annexeiii-en-cr4.pdf C.I.P. Anexxe III Proof barrels Shot cartridges]&lt;/ref&gt;

===External stress gauge===
A low cost method of gathering pressure data uses a resistive stress gauge attached to the exterior of the chamber.  These systems are usually calibrated to emulate the results of an existing standardized system such as the SAAMI system, so that the results will be directly comparable.  Because this system does not require a specialized test barrel, only a firearm that has an accessible external chamber wall, it is much lower cost.

==Military test methodologies==
===NATO EPVAT===
[[NATO]] defines 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm and 12.7mm using the [[NATO EPVAT testing|NATO EPVAT]] test methods, which includes pressure testing.
Unlike the civilian testing methods NATO EPVAT testing procedures for the "NATO rifle chamberings" require the pressure sensor or transducer to be mounted ahead of the case mouth. The advantage of this mounting position is that there is no need to drill the cartridge case to mount the transducer. Drilling prior to firing is always a time consuming process (fast quality control and feedback to production is essential during the ammunition manufacturing process). The disadvantage of this mount is that the pressure rises much faster than in a drilled cartridge case. This causes high frequency oscillations of the pressure sensor (approx 200 kHz for a Kistler 6215 transducer) and this requires [[Filter (signal processing)|electronic filtering]] with the drawback that filtering also affects the lower harmonics where a peak is found causing a slight error in the measurement. This slight error is not always well mastered and this causes a lot of discussion about the filter order, cutoff frequency and its type ([[Bessel filter|Bessel]] or [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a300525.pdf Technical Report ARCCD-TR-95005 5.56 MM M856 TRACER MINI ROUND ROUND ROBIN STUDY, ARDEC/CCAC, October 1995 by Lascelles A. Geddes ]&lt;/ref&gt;
For the 9mm NATO EPVAT specifies that for 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger in C.I.P. nomenclature and 9mm NATO in NATO nomenclature), the transducer must be positioned at the mid case position ({{convert|9.5|mm|in}}) from the breech face instead of C.I.P.'s {{convert|12.5|mm|in}} from the breech face.
For NATO EPVAT testing of military firearms ammunition NATO design EPVAT test barrels with Kistler 6215 channel sensor transducers are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ien.eu/uploads/tx_etim/Page_37_Kistler_39706.pdf Type 6215 Quartz High-Pressure Sensor for Ballistic Pressure Measurement to 6 000 bar]&lt;/ref&gt;

===US military SCATP===
The [[United States Armed Forces]], however, defines test procedures for 5.56mm NATO in SCATP-5.56, 7.62mm NATO in SCATP-7.62, and .45 ACP in SCATP-45.&lt;ref&gt;US Mil-spec MIL-C-9963F&lt;/ref&gt; These procedures are based on the SAAMI test methodology.

[http://www.swhap.org/ '''The Swedish Workplace HIV/AIDS Programme'''] ('''SWHAP''') is a joint initiative by the International Council of Swedish Industry (NIR) and the Swedish Industrial and Metalworkers’ Union (IF Metall). The SWHAP concept is based on close co-operation between the company [[management]], the local [[trade union]] branches and workers' representatives. The programme contributes to the establishment and support to [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] programmes at Swedish companies and their partners in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. In 2010, SWHAP supported close to 90 workplaces directly and reached out to 20,000 employees, yet benefiting far more if taking into account the families and surrounding [[community|communities]]. The programme presently operates in Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. SWHAP is financed by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]], Sida.

==The workplace as arena for HIV/Aids programmes==
With an estimated 33 million people infected,&lt;ref&gt;Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), ''2008 Report on the global AIDS epidemic''&lt;/ref&gt; the HIV and AIDS [[pandemic]] has severe humanitarian consequences as well as enormous effects on households, businesses and societies at large. HIV and AIDS is a workplace issue because it affects workers and their families, enterprises and communities which depend on them. For that reason, the workplace is one arena (out of many) to address the causes and implications of HIV and AIDS. The workplace has a vital role to play in the wider struggle to control the pandemic. Workplace programmes support prevention, expand access to care and [[Antiretroviral drug|ARV]] treatment, and promote non-discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/trav/aids/&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) has created ''[[International Labour Organization#HIV/AIDS|Code of Practice on HIV/AIDS and the World of Work]]'', a document that provides practical guidelines for HIV and Aids programmes at enterprise, community, and national levels.
SWHAP is one of several initiatives that have been taken to address HIV and AIDS at the workplace level. In particular in Sub-Saharan Africa but also in other countries both [[employers' federation]]s, trade unions, specialised business coalitions on HIV/AIDS and [[NGO]]s have increasingly addressed the issue &lt;ref&gt;For further information, see for example: World Economic Forum Global Health Initiative, ''Business &amp; HIV/AIDS: A healthier partnership?'' (2006), {{cite web |url=http://www.gbcimpact.org/hiv-aids |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710002922/http://www.gbcimpact.org/hiv-aids |archivedate=2009-07-10 |df= }} ,
{{cite web |url=http://old.global-unions.org/hiv-aids/union_action.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110726111629/http://old.global-unions.org/hiv-aids/union_action.htm |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme objectives==
The overall development goal of SWHAP is for employers and employees at Swedish related workplaces in the Sub-Saharan region to have created effective HIV and AIDS programmes that contribute to the development of a wider private sector response. In order to achieve this, the programme has three primary objectives: 

• Workplace Programmes have been initiated and improved in an expanded number of companies.

• Extensive experiences from SWHAP workplace programmes and from a broadening network of shared practice have been documented and used by other actors.

• SWHAP has influenced the global HIV and AIDS Workplace arena by sharing experience and information in a variety of contexts.

More specific goals include that management and employees should be stimulated to work hand in hand in the fight against HIV and AIDS, that already existing workplace programmes should be supported with fresh resources and that individual companies should be stimulated to increase similar HIV and AIDS activities. The programme also aims at developing an effective network between the participating workplaces. Likewise to spread information about HIV and AIDS to an external audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swhap.org/about.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and testicular sperm extraction (TESE) have reduced the need for donor sperm.

'''Vas-occlusive contraception''' is a form of male [[contraception]] that blocks [[sperm]] transport in the [[vas deferens]], the tubes that carry sperm from the [[epididymis]] to the [[ejaculatory ducts]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmalecontraception.org/archive/archives/1994paper.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various vas-occlusive contraceptive methods have been researched for human-use, with interest in both reversible and irreversible methods, with the purpose of finding a suitable alternative to [[vasectomy]] and possible hormonal contraceptive treatments that are currently being researched.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/37300{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.17219/acem/33827 |pmid=26469117 |title=Brdt Bromodomains Inhibitors and Other Modern Means of Male Contraception |journal=Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=705–14 |year=2015 |last1=Zdrojewicz |first1=Zygmunt |last2=Konieczny |first2=Radosław |last3=Papier |first3=Paulina |last4=Szten |first4=Filip }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBK279094&gt;Handelsman DJ.

==Types==

There are numerous vas-occlusive contraceptive methods and devices that have been researched. Outlined here are a few main categories and descriptions.

===Intravasal control valve (ICV)===

An intravasal control valve is a reversible valve implanted in the vas deferens with the ability to either inhibit or permit sperm passage depending on the position of the device. [[Bionyx]] has developed a T-shaped intravasal control valve composed of gold and stainless steel for use in humans.&lt;ref name=pmid16573708&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.2006.00686.x |pmid=16573708 |title=A phase II randomized controlled trial of a novel male contraception, an intra-vas device |journal=International Journal of Andrology |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=489–95 |year=2006 |last1=Song |first1=L. |last2=Gu |first2=Y. |last3=Lu |first3=W. |last4=Liang |first4=X. |last5=Chen |first5=Z. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through rotation, a perforated ball within the T can be used to obstruct sperm flow or allow sperm flow.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11404791 |url=http://www.asiaandro.com/Abstract.asp?id=1031 |year=2001 |author1=Lohiya |first1=N. K. |title=Vas deferens, a site of male contraception: An overview |journal=Asian Journal of Andrology |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=87–95 |last2=Manivannan |first2=B |last3=Mishra |first3=P. K. |last4=Pathak |first4=N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled microsurgery is required for the ICV implant.

===Chemosterilization===

Injection of non-toxic and sclerotic chemicals in the vas deferens can result in blockage of sperm transport due to scarring on the vas deferens wall. At least 26 different chemical combinations have been attempted to achieve sterilization.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmalecontraception.org/archive/archives/1994paper.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of carbolic and n-butyl alpha cyanoacrylate has resulted in complete blockage of the vas deferens through adhesion to the luminal surface. This chemical combination resulted in a 96% azoospermia and a 99% pregnancy prevention eight years follow injection in humans.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; The scar tissue created is not always compact and successful in occluding the vas deferens, which results in the 4% azoospermia failure rate.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; The injection of the chemical combination of ethanol and formaldehyde also resulted in sterility in humans.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; However, these chemical combinations are irreversible.

===Vas-Occlusive Plugs===

There are two types of ''vas-occlusive plugs'': injectable plugs and non-injectable plugs. Injection of medical polyurethane (MPU) to form a plug in the vas deferens resulted in azoospermia in 96% of men, though these result were seen 24 months after injection.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26732151&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.14310/horm.2002.1623 |pmid=26732151 |title=Male contraception: A clinically-oriented review |journal=Hormones |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=598–614 |year=2015 |last1=Kanakis |first1=George |last2=Goulis |first2=Dimitrios }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid1483736&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2605.1992.tb01140.x |pmid=1483736 |title=Safety and efficacy of percutaneous injection of polyurethane elastomer (MPU) plugs for vas occlusion in man |journal=International Journal of Andrology |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=468–72 |year=1992 |last1=Zhen-Wen |first1=Chen |last2=Yi-Qun |first2=GU |last3=Xiao-Wei |first3=Liang |last4=Zhi-Gang |first4=WU |last5=Er-Jing |first5=YIN |last6=Hong |first6=LI- }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on over 130 men following removal of the plug within five years showed successful restoration of fertility.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; The Shug, short for "silicon plug", is an example of a non-injectable plug, though there is little to no research on the Shug following 2008.&lt;ref name=pmid1483736/&gt; The Shug is composed of two silicon plugs with accompanying nylon tails that attach to the vas deferens wall. It is surgically inserted into the vas deferens and must also be removed surgically. Shug human trials showed a 97% decrease in sperm motility through the vas deferens.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; However, plugs have been shown to have a lower efficacy rate when compared to traditional vasectomy overall.&lt;ref name=NBK279094/&gt;

===Intravasal Thread (IVT) / Intravasal Device (IVD)===

Insertion of an Intravasal Thread (IVT), also known as an Intravasal Device (IVD), in the vas deferens has been shown to inhibit sperm transport via mechanical obstruction and the removal of the IVT results in restored vas deferens patency.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; However, this method has differential species-specific results: in pigs, a plastic IVT had no significant effect on sperm count; in dogs, a plastic and polyethylene IVT consistently blocked sperm transport during the experimental period and removal of the device restored sperm transport after a period of two weeks; and in human subjects, a urethane-coated nylon IVT resulted in significantly reduced sperm count but could not guarantee absolute sterility at the same rate as a vasectomy.&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBK279094/&gt;

===RISUG===

Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance ([[RISUG]]) is a non-toxic polymer gel-based contraceptive that is injected into the lumen of the vas deferens and results in infertility within 10 days following injection.&lt;ref name=pmid26732151/&gt; RISUG is composed of styrene [[maleic anhydride]] (SMA) dissolved in [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (dimethyl sulfoxide),&lt;ref name=pmid11404791/&gt; which is believed to both partially occlude the vas deferens by coating the inner walls of the vas deferens with the polymer chemical, while also deactivating the sperm that are able to pass through the partially occluded vas deferens, thereby preventing successful fertilization.&lt;ref name=pmid26732151/&gt; The exact mechanism of the deactivation effect on sperm is still unknown.&lt;ref name=NBK279094/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26732151/&gt; RISUG inhibits sperm transport but allows fluid to pass through, which prevents pressure from building up in the vas deferens.&lt;ref name=pmid26732151/&gt; RISUG has been shown successful in previous human clinical trials in India and is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials.&lt;ref name=pmid26732151/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid27030808&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=27030808 |pmc=4812607 |year=2016 |author1=Waller |first1=D |title=Azoospermia in rabbits following an intravas injection of Vasalgel |journal=Basic and Clinical Andrology |volume=26 |pages=6 |last2=Bolick |first2=D |last3=Lissner |first3=E |last4=Premanandan |first4=C |last5=Gamerman |first5=G |doi=10.1186/s12610-016-0033-8 |doi-broken-date=2018-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16573708/&gt;

===Vasalgel===

Vasalgel was inspired by RISUG and created by the [[Parsemus Foundation]] in order to be used outside of India.&lt;ref name=pmid27030808/&gt; Vasalgel is composed of 25% styrene-alt-maleic acid (SMA acid) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide.&lt;ref name=pmid27030808/&gt; The major difference between RISUG and Vasalgel is that Vasalgel is composed of SMA acid without SMA anhydride, which allows for a longer shelf-life, smaller probability of hydrolysis to an acid, and less complex production process.&lt;ref name=pmid27030808/&gt; Vasalgel was successful in achieving azoospermia in rabbits within 36 days of injection, as well as returned vas deferens patency, and is expected to begin human trials in the United States in 2016.&lt;ref name=pmid27030808/&gt;

==Side effects==
Vas-occlusive contraception methods are expected to have similar side effects to vasectomy, such as formation of sperm [[antibody|antibodies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7032642 |year=1981 |author1=Royle |first1=M. G. |title=Reversal of vasectomy: The effects of sperm antibodies on subsequent fertility |journal=British Journal of Urology |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=654–9 |last2=Parslow |first2=J.

F. |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410x.1981.tb03284.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; though with lower rates.&lt;ref name=pmid16573708/&gt;
