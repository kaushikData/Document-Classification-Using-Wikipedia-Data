An '''autoradiograph''' is an image on an [[x-ray]] film or [[nuclear emulsion]] produced by the pattern of decay emissions (e.g., [[beta particles]] or [[gamma rays]]) from a distribution of a [[radioactive]] substance. Alternatively, the autoradiograph is also available as a digital image (digital autoradiography), due to the recent development of [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] gas detectors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barthe N, Coulon P, Hennion C, Ducassou D, Basse-Cathalinat B, Charpak G |title=Optimization of a new scintillation gas detector used to localize electrons emitted by 99mTc |journal=J Nucl Med |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=868–75 |date=May 1999 |pmid=10319763 |url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10319763}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rare earth phosphorimaging systems.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Life Sciences: [http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0002973/current/html Phosphorimager]&lt;/ref&gt; The film or emulsion is apposed to the labeled tissue section to obtain the autoradiograph (also called an autoradiogram).  The ''auto-'' prefix indicates that the radioactive substance is within the sample, as distinguished from the case of [[historadiography]] or microradiography, in which the sample is X-rayed using an external source. Some autoradiographs can be examined microscopically for localization of silver grains (such as on the interiors or exteriors of cells or organelles) in which the process is termed micro-autoradiography. For example, micro-autoradiography was used to examine whether [[atrazine]] was being metabolized by the [[hornwort]] plant or by epiphytic microorganisms in the biofilm layer surrounding the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Rupassara, S. I., R.A. Larson, G.K. Sims, and K.A. Marley. 2002 Degradation of atrazine by hornwort in aquatic systems. Bioremediation Journal 6(3): 217-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In biology, this technique may be used to determine the tissue (or cell) localization of a radioactive substance, either introduced into a metabolic pathway, bound to a receptor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhar M, Yamamura HI |title=Localization of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in rat brain by light microscopic radioautography |journal=Brain Res. |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=229–43 |date=Jul 1976 |pmid=938940 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(76)90399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young WS, Kuhar MJ |title=A new method for receptor autoradiography: [3H]opioid receptors in rat brain |journal=Brain Res. |volume=179 |issue=2 |pages=255–70 |date=Dec 1979 |pmid=228806 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(79)90442-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or enzyme, or hybridized to a nucleic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jin L, Lloyd RV |title=In situ hybridization: methods and applications |journal=J Clin Lab Anal. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=2–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9021518 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2825(1997)11:1&lt;2::AID-JCLA2&gt;3.0.CO;2-F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[radioligand|radiolabeled ligands]] to determine the tissue distributions of receptors is termed either ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[in vitro]]'' '''receptor autoradiography''' if the ligand is administered into the circulation (with subsequent tissue removal and sectioning) or applied to the tissue sections, respectively. The ligands are generally labeled with &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H ([[tritium]]) or [[Iodine-125|&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I]] ([[radioiodine]]). The distribution of RNA transcripts in tissue sections by the use of radiolabeled, complementary oligonucleotides or ribonucleic acids ("riboprobes") is called [[In situ hybridization|in situ hybridization histochemistry]]. Radioactive precursors of DNA and RNA, [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-[[thymidine]] and [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-[[uridine]] respectively, may be introduced to living cells to determine the timing of several phases of the cell cycle. RNA or DNA viral sequences can also be located in this fashion. These probes are usually labeled with &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P, &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P, or &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S.  In the realm of behavioral endocrinology, autoradiography can be used to determine hormonal uptake and indicate receptor location; an animal can be injected with a radiolabeled hormone, or the study can be conducted ''in vitro''.

===Rate of DNA replication===

The rate of DNA replication in a mouse cell growing ''in vitro'' was measured by autoradiography as 33 nucleotides per second.&lt;ref name="pmid1095649"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hand R |title=Deoxyribonucleic acid fiber autoradiography as a technique for studying the replication of the mammalian chromosome |journal=J. Histochem. Cytochem. |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=475–81 |year=1975 |pmid=1095649 |doi= 10.1177/23.7.1095649|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of [[Enterobacteria phage T4|phage T4]] DNA elongation in phage-infected [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] was also measured by autoradiography as 749 nucleotides per second during the period of exponential DNA increase at 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCarthy D, Minner C, Bernstein H, Bernstein C | year = 1976 | title = DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant | url = | journal = J Mol Biol | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 963–81 | pmid = 789903 | doi=10.1016/0022-2836(76)90346-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detection of protein phosphorylation===

[[Phosphorylation]] means the posttranslational addition of a [[phosphate group]] to specific amino acids of proteins, and such modification can lead to a drastic change in the stability or the function of a protein in the cell. Protein phosphorylation can be detected on an autoradiograph, after incubating the protein in vitro with the appropriate [[kinase]] and γ-32P-ATP. The radiolabbeled phosphate of latter is incorporated into the protein which is isolated via [[SDS-PAGE]] and visualized on an autoradiograph of the gel. (See figure 3. of a recent study showing that [[CREB-binding protein]] is phosphorylated by [[HIPK2]].&lt;ref name="pmid26247811"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovacs KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cell Signaling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = Nov 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Other techniques===

This autoradiographic approach contrasts to techniques such as [[positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[SPECT]] where the exact 3-dimensional localization of the radiation source is provided by careful use of coincidence counting, gamma counters and other devices.

[[Krypton-85]] is used to inspect aircraft components for small defects. Krypton-85 is allowed to penetrate small cracks, and then its 
presence is detected by autoradiography. The method is called "krypton gas penetrant imaging". The gas penetrates smaller openings than the liquids used in [[dye penetrant inspection]] and [[fluorescent penetrant inspection]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asnt.org/publications/materialseval/solution/decsolutions/decsolutions.htm Krypton Gas Penetrant Imaging - A Valuable Tool for Ensuring Structural Integrity in Aircraft Engine Components] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720084341/http://www.asnt.org/publications/materialseval/solution/decsolutions/decsolutions.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unintentional exposure===

The fish was alive and apparently healthy when captured.]]

The task of radioactive decontamination following the ''Baker'' nuclear test at [[Bikini Atoll]] during [[Operation Crossroads]] in 1946 was far more difficult than the U.S. Navy had prepared for. Though the task's futility became apparent and the danger to cleanup crews mounted, Colonel [[Stafford Warren]], in charge of radiation safety, had difficulty persuading Vice Admiral William H. P. Blandy to abandon the cleanup and with it the surviving target ships. On August 10, Warren showed Blandy an autoradiograph made by a [[surgeonfish]] from the lagoon that was left on a photographic plate overnight. The film was exposed by alpha radiation produced from the fish's scales, evidence that plutonium, mimicking calcium, had been distributed throughout the fish. Blandy promptly ordered that all further decontamination work be discontinued. Warren wrote home, "A self x ray of a fish&amp;nbsp;... did the trick."&lt;ref name="Weisgall 1994 242"&gt;{{citation

The '''Barnes–Hut simulation''' (Josh Barnes and [[Piet Hut]]) is an [[approximation algorithm]] for performing an [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]]. It is notable for having [[Big O notation|order]] O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbon|first1=Susanne Pfalzner ; Paul|title=Many-body tree methods in physics|date=1996|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ.

The simulation volume is usually divided up into cubic cells via an [[octree]] (in a three-dimensional space), so that only [[Point particle|particles]] from nearby cells need to be treated individually, and particles in distant cells can be treated as a single large particle centered at the cell's [[center of mass]] (or as a low-order [[multipole expansion]]). This can dramatically reduce the number of particle pair interactions that must be computed.

Some of the most demanding [[high-performance computing]] projects do [[computational astrophysics]] using the Barnes–Hut treecode algorithm,&lt;ref&gt;

== Algorithm ==

=== The Barnes–Hut tree ===
In a three-dimensional [[n-body simulation|''n''-body simulation]], the Barnes–Hut algorithm [[Recursion (computer science)|recursively]] divides the ''n'' bodies into groups by storing them in an [[octree]] (or a [[quadtree|quad-tree]] in a 2D simulation). Each [[Node (graph theory)|node]] in this tree represents a region of the three-dimensional space. 
The topmost node represents the whole space, and its eight children represent the eight [[Cartesian coordinate system#Quadrants and octants|octants]] of the space. The space is recursively subdivided into octants until each subdivision contains 0 or 1 bodies (some regions do not have bodies in all of their octants). 
There are two types of nodes in the octree: internal and external nodes. An external node has no children and is either empty or represents a single body. Each internal node represents the group of bodies beneath it, and stores the [[center of mass]] and the total mass of all its children bodies.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Calculating the force acting on a body ===
To calculate the [[net force]] on a particular body, the nodes of the tree are traversed, starting from the root. If the center of mass of an internal node is sufficiently far from the body, the bodies contained in that part of the tree are treated as a single particle whose position and mass is respectively the center of mass and total mass of the internal node. If the internal node is sufficiently close to the body, the process is repeated for each of its children.

Whether a node is or isn't sufficiently far away from a body, depends on the quotient &lt;math&gt;s/d&lt;/math&gt;, where ''s'' is the width of the region represented by the internal node, and ''d'' is the distance between the body and the node’s center of mass. The node is sufficiently far away when this ratio is smaller than a threshold value ''θ''. The parameter ''θ'' determines the accuracy of the simulation; larger values of ''θ'' increase the speed of the simulation but decreases its accuracy. If ''θ'' = 0, no internal node is treated as a single body and the algorithm degenerates to a direct-sum algorithm.

Among American [[Adolescence|adolescents]], '''baseball metaphors for sex''' are often used as [[euphemism]]s for the degree of [[physical intimacy]] achieved in [[Human sexual activity|sexual encounters]] or relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Offside: Soccer and American Exceptionalism|first1=Steven L.|last1=Hellermann|first2= Andrei S.|last2=Markovits|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069107447X|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the metaphor, first prevalent in the [[aftermath of World War II]], sexual activities are described as if they are actions in a game of [[baseball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Gender|first=Suzanne|last=Romaine|year=1999| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|isbn=0-8058-2926-1|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dark Ages, Life in the United States, 1945–1960|first=Marty|last=Jezer| year=1982|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0-89608-127-3|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and popularity==
Among the most commonly used metaphors are the ''bases'' describing levels of physical intimacy (generally from a heterosexual perspective). Definitions vary, but the following are typical usages of the terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Third Base Ain't What it Used to Be: What Your Kids Are Learning About Sex Today—and How to Teach Them to Become Sexually Healthy Adults | author=Levkoff, Logan | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4qhuD3G0-8C | chapter=Sex Talk Among Teens | publisher=Open Road Media | year=2012 | isbn=9781453262924}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English | author=Dalzell, Tom | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neVBmSyNRnEC | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | isbn=9781134194780}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book | title=The Gender of Sexuality: Exploring Sexual Possibilities |author1=Rutter, Virginia  |author2=Schwartz, Pepper  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbpIbqiEy2sC | year=2012 | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn=9780742570030}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''First base'' – mouth-to-mouth [[kissing]], especially [[French kiss]]ing;
*''Second base'' – skin-to-skin touching/kissing of the [[Human breast#Sexual characteristic|breasts]]; in some contexts, it may instead refer to touching any [[erogenous zones]] through the clothes (i.e., not actually touching the skin), or [[Mutual masturbation|manual stimulation of the genitals]];
*''Third base'' – touching below the waist (without [[sexual intercourse]]); in some contexts, it may instead refer to [[oral sex|oral stimulation of the genitals]];
*''Home run'' (''home base'' or ''scoring'')&amp;nbsp;– "full" sexual intercourse.

Additionally,
*''Strikeout'' – a failure to engage in any form of [[foreplay]] or other [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]];

Additionally, there are two metaphors used to refer to [[men who have sex with men]]:
* ''Pitching '' – the man performing [[anal sex]]
* ''Catching''  – the man receiving anal sex

Other similar metaphors include:
* ''Switch hitter''  – a bisexual individual, referencing a player who can bat from either side
* ''Playing for the other team''  – usually indicating a person is gay or lesbian
* ''Playing for both teams''  – usually indicating a person is bisexual

The metaphors are found variously in popular American culture, with one well-known example in the [[Meat Loaf]] song "[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]", which describes a young couple "[[making out]]", with a [[voice-over]] [[Sports commentary|commentary]], by baseball announcer [[Phil Rizzuto]], of a portion of a baseball game as a metaphor for the couple's activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=pearlman/070816|title=Phil and Meat Loaf will always have "Paradise"|first=Jeff|last= Pearlman|authorlink=Jeff Pearlman|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2007-08-29|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example can be found in [[Billy Joel]]'s song "[[Zanzibar (Billy Joel song)|Zanzibar]]" in which he compares himself to [[Pete Rose]] and sings the lines "Me, I'm trying just to get to second base and I'd steal it if she only gave the sign. She's gonna give the go ahead, the inning isn't over yet for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Words and Music of Billy Joel|first=Ken|last=Bielen|year=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313380167|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Letterman]] chronicled many of these in his "Top Ten Baseball Euphemisms for Sex" &amp;mdash; a recurring theme on the [[Late Show Top Ten List|Top Ten Lists]] featured on the late-night talk shows he hosted before his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Letterman, David (2001-09-19).

(Search the "Top Ten" archive by the show date [http://www.cbs.com/late_night/late_show/top_ten/ here].)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex education==

Educators have found the baseball metaphor an effective instructional tool when providing sex education to [[middle school]] students.&lt;ref name=Cooperstown&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture 1998|first1=Alvin L.|last1=Hall|first2=Thomas L.|last2=Altherr|chapter=Eros at the Bat: American Baseball and Sexuality in Historical Context|pages=157–182|year= 2002|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=0-7864-0954-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leman and Bell, in their book ''A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex'', make use of it to aid parents in the discussion of [[puberty]] with their children, dividing the topics into "first base" ("Changes from the neck up"), "second base" ("Changes from the neck to the waist"), "third base" ("Changes from the waist down"), and "home plate" ("The Big 'It'").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Chicken's Guide to Talking Turkey With Your Kids About Sex|first1=Kevin|last1=Leman|first2=Kathy Flores|last2=Bell|year=2004|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=031025096X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative views==

This sequence of "running the bases" is often regarded as a script, or pattern, for young people who are experimenting with sexual relationships. The script may have slightly changed since the 1960s. Kohl and Francoeur state that with the growing emphasis in the 1990s on [[safe sex]] to expand sex beyond heterosexual penetrative intercourse, the "home run" has taken on the additional dimension of oral sex. Richters and [[Christopher Rissel|Rissel]] conversely state that "third base" is now sometimes considered to comprise oral sex as part of the accepted pattern of activities, as a precursor to "full" (i.e. penetrative) sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doing it Down Under: The Sexual Lives of Australians|author=Juliet Richters and [[Chris Rissel]]|year=2005 |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |isbn=1-74114-326-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scent of Eros: Mysteries of Odor in Human Sexuality|first1= James V.|last1=Kohl|first2=Robert T.|last2=Francoeur|year=2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=059523383X|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''breath mark''' or '''luftpause''' is a [[symbol]] used in [[musical notation]].  It directs the performer of the music passage to take a breath (for [[wind instrument]]s and [[vocalist]]s) or to make a slight pause (for non-wind [[musical instrument|instrument]]s). This pause is normally intended to shorten the duration of the preceding [[Musical note|note]] and not to alter the [[tempo]]; in this function it can be thought of as a [[grace note|grace]] [[rest (music)|rest]].  It is usually placed above the [[staff (music)|staff]] and at the ends of [[phrase (music)|phrase]]s.  Its function is analogous to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] in several [[written language]]s.  Indeed, the two symbols look identical.

A '''bridge''' is a [[nonbuilding structure|structure]] built to [[span (engineering)|span]] physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a [[body of water]], [[valley]], or [[road]], for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the [[terrain]] where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and [[stepping stones]], while [[Neolithic]] people built [[boardwalk]] bridges across marshland. The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] dating from the 13th century BC, in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.

==Etymology==
[[File:Akashi-kaikyo bridge3.jpg|thumb|The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in [[Japan]], currently the world's longest suspension span]]
[[File:Sio se pol.jpg|thumb|The [[Siosepol]] bridge over [[Zayanderud|Zayandeh River]] is an example of [[Safavid dynasty]] (1502–1722) bridge design. [[Esfahan]], [[Iran]]]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the origin of the word ''bridge'' to an [[Old English]] word ''brycg'', of the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Fowler|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary|date=1925|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be traced directly back to Proto-Indo-European ''*bʰrēw-.'' The word for the [[Contract bridge|card game of the same name]] has a different origin.

==History==
[[File:Pont mycénien de Kazarma 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] in [[Greece]] (13th century BC), one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s in existence]]
[[File:Brug 119 in de Lijnbaansgracht over de Bloemgracht foto 1.jpg|thumb|Bridges in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]]]
The simplest type of a bridge is [[stepping stones]], so this may have been one of the earliest types. [[Neolithic]] people also built a form of a [[boardwalk]] across marshes, of which the [[Sweet Track]], and the [[Post Track]] are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old.&lt;ref Name="Current_Archaeology_somerset-levels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=The Somerset Levels|pages=139–143|volume=XV (4)|issue=172 (Special issue on Wetlands)|journal=Current Archaeology|date=February 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used [[log bridge]]s; that is a [[timber bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=National Parks Conference| first= Department of the Interior| title=Proceedings of the National parks conference held at Berkeley, California March 11, 12, and 13, 1915| url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsnati01confgoog| accessdate=March 14, 2010| year=1915| publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]| location=Washington, DC| page=60| quote=(A log bridge) is a bridge composed of log beams, the logs being in natural condition or hewn, which are thrown across two abutments, and over which traffic may pass.| ref=NPC}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams.

Among the oldest [[timber bridge]]s is the [[Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden]] crossing upper [[Lake Zürich]] in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the [[Seedamm]] date back to 1523 BC. The first wooden footbridge led across [[Lake Zürich]], followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the [[Roman Empire]] built a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately {{convert|1450|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland.

The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] is one of four Mycenaean [[corbel arch]] bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate [[chariot]]s, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece. Dating to the Greek [[Bronze Age]] (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.
Several intact arched stone bridges from the [[Hellenistic age|Hellenistic era]] can be found in the Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kutz, Myer|title=Handbook of Transportation Engineering, Volume II: Applications and Technologies, Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0071614771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest bridge builders of antiquity were the [[Roman Engineering|ancient Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icomos.org/studies/bridges.htm |author=DeLony, Eric |title=Context for World Heritage Bridges |publisher=Icomos.org |year=1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221084235/http://www.icomos.org/studies/bridges.htm |archivedate=February 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built arch bridges and [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs.

The Romans also used [[cement]], which reduced the variation of strength found in natural stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubs.asce.org/WWWdisplay.cgi?0103045 |title=Lessons from Roman Cement and Concrete |publisher=Pubs.asce.org |date= |accessdate=January 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210043706/http://www.pubs.asce.org/WWWdisplay.cgi?0103045 |archivedate=February 10, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of cement, called [[pozzolana]], consisted of water, [[lime (material)|lime]], sand, and [[volcanic rock]]. [[Brick]] and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] bridges were built after the Roman era, as the technology for cement was lost (then later rediscovered).

In India, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' treatise by [[Kautilya]] mentions the construction of dams and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshitar, V.R.R. Dikshitar (1993). ''The Mauryan Polity'', Motilal Banarsidass, p. 332 {{ISBN|8120810236}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Mauryan]] bridge near [[Girnar]] was surveyed by [[James Prinsep|James Princep]].&lt;ref name=Dutt/&gt; The bridge was swept away during a flood, and later repaired by Puspagupta, the chief architect of emperor [[Chandragupta I]].&lt;ref name=Dutt&gt;Dutt, Romesh Chunder (2000).

Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the [[Warring States]], the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]], built from 595 to 605 AD during the [[Sui Dynasty]]. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest [[Spandrel|open-spandrel]] stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the [[Alconétar Bridge]] (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era [[Trajan's Bridge]] (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Inca rope bridge|Rope bridges]], a simple type of [[suspension bridge]], were used by the [[Inca]] civilization in the [[Andes]] mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.

During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by [[Hans Ulrich Grubenmann]], [[Johannes Grubenmann]], and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by [[Hubert Gautier]] in 1716.

A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of [[the Iron Bridge]] in Shropshire, England in 1779. It used [[cast iron]] for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |title= Iron Bridge |author= &lt;!--"ECPK"--&gt; |date= |website= Engineering Timelines |publisher= Engineering Timelines |access-date= November 18, 2016 |quote= |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204815/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |archivedate= March 4, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, [[truss]] systems of [[wrought iron]] were developed for larger bridges, but iron does not have the [[tensile strength]] to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a high tensile strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of [[Gustave Eiffel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1927 [[welding]] pioneer [[Stefan Bryła]] designed the first welded [[road bridge]] in the world, the [[Maurzyce Bridge]] which was later built across the river [[Słudwia River|Słudwia]] at Maurzyce near [[Łowicz]], Poland in 1929. In 1995, the [[American Welding Society]] presented the Historic Welded Structure Award for the bridge to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/welding/wh_1900-1950.html |title=Welding Timeline 1900–1950 |last=Sapp |first=Mark E. |date=February 22, 2008 |publisher=WeldingHistory.org |accessdate=April 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803060938/http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/welding/wh_1900-1950.html |archivedate=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
[[File:Ant bridge.jpg|thumb|''[[Eciton]]'' sp. forming a bridge]]
Before humans, [[ants#Locomotion|ants have been making bridges]] using their own bodies to allow others to cross.

==Types of bridges==
Bridges can be categorized in several different ways. Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.

===Structure type===
Bridges may be classified by how the forces of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], [[compression (physical)|compression]], [[bending]], [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss.

| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:BeamBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Beam bridge'''{{br}}
|[[Beam bridges]] are horizontal beams supported at each end by substructure units and can be either ''[[simply supported]]'' when the beams only connect across a single span, or ''continuous'' when the beams are connected across two or more spans. When there are multiple spans, the intermediate supports are known as [[bridge pier|piers]]. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges can range from small, wooden beams to large, steel boxes.

| A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss. This truss is a structure of connected elements forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by nineteenth and early twentieth century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct owing to its efficient use of materials.

| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:CantileverBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Cantilever bridge'''{{br}}
|[[Cantilever bridge]]s are built using [[cantilever]]s—horizontal beams supported on only one end. Most cantilever bridges use a pair of [[continuous span]]s that extend from opposite sides of the supporting piers to meet at the center of the obstacle the bridge crosses. Cantilever bridges are constructed using much the same materials &amp; techniques as beam bridges. The difference comes in the action of the forces through the bridge.

Some cantilever bridges also have a smaller beam connecting the two cantilevers, for extra strength.

The largest cantilever bridge is the {{convert|549|m|adj=on}} [[Quebec Bridge]] in Quebec, Canada.

Most bridges are fixed bridges, meaning they have no moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as [[Bailey bridge]]s, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. [[Movable bridge]]s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] in [[Hong Kong]] have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for [[MTR]] metro trains. Some double-decked bridges only use one level for street traffic; the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] in [[Minneapolis]] reserves its lower level for automobile and light rail traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the [[University of Minnesota]]). Likewise, in [[Toronto]], the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the [[Bloor–Danforth line|Bloor–Danforth]] [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line]] on its lower deck. The western span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] also has two levels.

[[Robert Stephenson]]'s [[High Level Bridge]] across the [[River Tyne]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-decked bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include [[Britannia Bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] and [[Craigavon Bridge]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Øresund Bridge|Oresund Bridge]] between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]] consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level. [[Tower Bridge]] in London is different example of a double-decked bridge, with the central section consisting of a low level [[Bascule bridge|bascule span]] and a high level [[footbridge]].

===Viaducts===

===Bridge types by use===
A bridge can be categorized by what it is designed to carry, such as trains, pedestrian or road traffic ('''road bridge'''), a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] is a bridge that carries water, resembling a viaduct, which is a bridge that connects points of equal height. A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic. Overway is a term for a bridge that separates incompatible intersecting traffic, especially road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170491612 |title=The Mile-End Crossing |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |volume=LXXXI, |issue=6,004 |location=South Australia |date=February 23, 1924 |accessdate=March 26, 2018 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the [[Storstrøm Bridge]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of [[Nový Most]] Bridge in [[Bratislava]], which features a restaurant, or a [[bridge-restaurant]] which is a bridge built to serve as a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undertimbers of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting [[suicide]], and become known as [[suicide bridge]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Stari_Most22.jpg|thumb|The World Heritage Site of [[Stari Most]] (Old Bridge) gives its name to the city of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]]
Most bridges are utilitarian in appearance, but in some cases, the appearance of the bridge can have great importance. Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbor entrance. These are sometimes known as ''signature bridges''. Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in New York.

To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a [[Moon bridge]], evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.

==Bridge maintenance==
[[File:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg|thumb|Highway bridge treated with [[high-frequency impact treatment]]]]
Bridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes e.g. an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is higher than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by [[High Frequency Impact Treatment|aftertreatment of the weld transitions]] . This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.

==Bridge failures==
&lt;!-- [[bridge failure]] and [[bridge failures]] redirect here; be sure to update them if changing the section title --&gt;
{{see also|List of bridge failures}}

The failure of bridges is of special concern for [[structural engineers]] in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the [[Victorian era]] when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.

In the United States, the [[National Bridge Inventory]] tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as "structurally deficient" and "functionally obsolete".

==Bridge monitoring==
There are several methods used to monitor the stress on large structures like bridges. The most common method is the use of an [[accelerometer]], which is integrated into the bridge while it is being built. This technology is used for long-term surveillance of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|title=The new Minnesota smart bridge|work=mnme.com|accessdate=January 30, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823002008/http://www.mnme.com/pdf/smartbridge.pdf|archivedate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another option for structural-integrity monitoring is "non-contact monitoring", which uses the [[Doppler effect]] (Doppler shift).

A '''bur''' (also spelled '''burr''')&lt;ref name=Cook68&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cook |first=J. Gordon |year=1968 |title=ABC of Plant Terms |publication-place=Watford, Herts |publisher=Merrow |oclc=223208923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[seed]] or dry [[fruit]] or [[infructescence]] that has hooks or teeth.

Some other forms of [[Diaspore (botany)|diaspores]], such as the stems of certain species of [[Cactaceae|cactus]] also are covered with thorns and may function as burs.

Bur-bearing plants such as ''Xanthium'' species are often single-stemmed when growing in dense groups, but branch and spread when growing singly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/pests-weeds/weeds/profiles/californian-burr Noogoora burr, Californian burr, Italian cockleburr and South American burr (''Xanthium'' species).] New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Burs catch on the fur of passing animals or the clothing of people. The hooks or teeth generally cause irritation, and some species commonly cause gross injury to animals, or expensive damage to clothing or to vehicle tires.

Burs serve the plants that bear them in two main ways. 
* Firstly, burs tend to repel some [[herbivore]]s, much as other [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines and prickles]] do. 
* Secondly, plants with burs rely largely on living agents to disperse their seeds; their burs are mechanisms of [[seed dispersal]] by [[Seed dispersal#By animals|epizoochory]] (dispersal by attaching to the outside of animals).&lt;ref name=sf&gt;Magee, M. B. [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/plants-burrs-26416.html Plants With Burrs.] ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most epizoochorous burs attach to hair on the body or legs of the host animal, but a special class of epizoochorous bur is known as the '''trample-bur''' (or '''trample-burr'''). Several species of ''[[Tribulus]]'', ''[[Harpagophytum]]'', and ''[[Grielum]]'' produce fruit in the form of trample-burs. As the name suggests, they attach themselves to the animal when trampled. They may hook onto the legs of animals as the large hooks of ''[[Harpagophytum]]'' do, sometimes causing serious injury, but sometimes hooking onto the leg of say, an ostrich, apparently without causing discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley, J.J. and Illing, N. Were Malagasy Uncarina fruits dispersed by the extinct elephant bird? South African Journal of Science 105, November/December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It also might penetrate a hoof or foot pad or the tires of a vehicle, only to be shed after being carried for a considerable time and distance; most ''Tribulus'' and ''Grielum'' species are specialised for such attachment, variously being flat, but with upward-directed spikes as in say, ''Grielum humifusum'',&lt;ref name="OudtshoornRooyen1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen van Rheede van Oudtshoorn|author2=Margaretha W. van Rooyen|title=Dispersal Biology of Desert Plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdTfBfsl-DcC&amp;pg=PA95|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-64886-4|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or shaped like a [[caltrop]] as in some species of ''Tribulus'' that have achieved the status of [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] weeds by sticking to the tires of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, L. et al. A geographical atlas of world weeds. Krieger 1991, {{ISBN|978-0894643576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to humans==
Burs are best known as sources of irritation, injury to livestock, damage to clothing, punctures to tires, and clogging equipment such as agricultural harvesting machinery.

Some have however been used for such purposes as fabric fulling, for which the [[Dipsacus|fuller's teasel]] is a traditional resource.

The bur of [[burdock]] was the inspiration for [[hook and loop fastener]], also known as [[Velcro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1996883,00.html|title=A Brief History of: Velcro|first=Claire|last=Suddath|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=17 October 2018|publisher=[[Time_(magazine)|Time]]|via=content.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[semiotics]], the '''commutation test''' is used to analyze a signifying system. The test identifies signifiers as well as their signifieds, [[value (Semiotics)|value]] and significance.

==The commutation test==
This test is a metalingual subjective system for analysing textual or other material. It has evolved from a limited method for investigating the structure of individual signs (per [[Roman Jakobson]]). Its primary uses are to: 
*identify distinctive signifiers,
*define their significance, and
*divide material into paradigmatic classes and identify the codes to which the signifiers belong ([[Roland Barthes]]).
The initial assumption is that the communication to be analysed represents both a cognitive use of the sign system and a statement that refers to the values of the addresser. The purpose of the test is therefore to illuminate the addresser's intention in using the code in this particular way. It works through a process of substitution, assessing the extent to which a change in the signifier leads to a change in the signified. The first step, therefore, is to exclude one signifier from the material to be analysed. This is a test of redundancy: to identify what meaning is lost (if any) by omitting that sign. It will be relatively unusual to find that one sign is completely superfluous, but more common to find that the contribution of the one sign to the whole meaning is relatively weak. The weakness or strength of its contribution can be calibrated more exactly by placing alternate (synonymous and antonymous) signs in the context. This will enable the analyst to make a judgment on the distinctiveness of the particular signifier chosen by the author/artist and of its value to the meaning, i.e. as more or less necessary for maintaining the meaning and/or rule structure in different occurrences. By changing the collocation between two of the existing signifiers, and so changing their original relationship, the relative significance of each signifier can be considered. Further, by also placing the original sign into different contexts, it can be seen whether the sign becomes more or less distinctive.

==The process==
The nature of the process will be determined by the form of the media to be analysed. In textual or pictorial media where individuals are the theme of the content, this might involve a substitution of words that are synonymous, or of imagery parallel in classes representing age, gender, ethnicity, religion, ability, etc. to assess the extent to which overall meaning is affected. In visual media generally, substituting different [[mise en scène]]s or backgrounds may change the significance of objects or people in the foreground. Colour selections may affect the perceived attractiveness of the scene or of individuals whose clothing is changed. The presence or absence of branded or generic goods, of stylish or outmoded clothing, etc. may help to suggest the contribution of the original signifier.

According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:
*Paradigmatic transformations
**[[:wikt:substitution|substitution]];
**[[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]
*Syntagmatic transformations
**[[addition]];
**[[wikt:deletion|deletion]].

==An example==
Take the phrase:
:the man hit the boy.
Now substitute "boy" with "baby", "girl", "child", "pansy", "thief". Each of these alternatives affects the implication of the phrase. A "man" rather than a father or parent randomly striking a baby or girl might be considered sexist and a crime. If the boy was a thief, this would explain but not excuse the man's behaviour as retaliation or revenge. If the boy is a pansy which has [[pejorative]] connotations of cowardice or homosexuality, the man may be intolerant or overly judgemental but the victim is also presented in a less sympathetic way. The use of child not differentiated by gender is a more common usage in the context of paedophilia. When the signifiers of boy and man are transposed, the relative inequality in strength is also reversed and the interpretation shifts to more playful and less threatening images. Hence, the subjective view may be that the phrase as originally conceived was the most neutral of the possible formulations given the original form. 

If we now contextualise the image in a school, seminary, prison, training gym or home environment different sets of meanings emerge depending on the presence or absence of other signifiers demonstrating the relationship between the protagonists, the time the image was created (a Victorian image of corporal punishment in a school would have a different significance from a more recent image of judicial caning in Britain, Canada or Singapore), the nature of the activity (e.g. a boxing training session or a game of tennis in which the blow is struck accidentally, etc.), the presence or absence of other people, etc.. The values are therefore added or subtracted according to the presence or absence of other signifiers.

==Discussion==
The first stage of development in semiotics related to the spoken and/or written form of [[language]]. Later, it was expanded to cover all [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] systems that have an [[information]]al content. As [[Umberto Eco]] says, "A sign is everything which can be taken as significantly substituting for something else." (1976)

Semiotics studies the relationship between the form of the sign (the ''signifier'') and the [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] expressed (the ''signified''), and thereby attempts to reveal the process of communicating [[understanding]]. In each case, a message is to be sent by an addresser to an addressee. For this to occur, the addresser and addressee must use a common [[code (semiotics)|code]], Hence, language evolves dynamically. The [[community]] will identify a [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] thing that needs to be referred to in their language. By common agreement, a sign (sometimes called a ''signal'') will be selected. Of the many possible shades of meanings that it can be used to convey, one or more will be selected and ''encoded'', i.e. the chosen meaning(s) will be [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] or associated with the sign within the broader framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] systems available within the community. When the [[audience]] is exposed to the sign, the expectation is that they will be able to decode the meaning. As [[Roman Jakobson]] adds, there will also be an [[emotion]]al element or [[value (Semiotics)|value]] which represents the addresser's [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards the ''thing''. This will either become a [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning attached directly to the sign itself, or it will be communicated by the context in which the sign is used by the addresser. 

In [[lexicography]], the fact that a  [[neologism]] is used marks its acceptance into the language. This will not be a difficult process so long as each sign has a limited and immediately useful meaning. The problem arises when several possible meanings or shades of meaning become associated with the sign. This is a shift from denotational to connotational meanings. Rules of interpretation are required to resolve uncertainty. Within the community, such rules are, for the most part, experiential and applied without conscious control. Members of a [[community]] have a shared [[memory]] of language [[pattern]]s and [[norm (philosophy)|norm]]s which, for the most part, are stable over long periods of time. [[Individual]]s are therefore able to build up a [[cognitive]] framework which identifies the possible meanings from any grouping of signs and selects one considered the most appropriate from the context. This [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] system is continuously tested through the audience's responses. If the responses are satisfying, intuition prevails. If the responses are obviously inappropriate, the audience will consciously review the thought process and decide whether to modify the framework. Semiotics has developed a more precise methodology for this interpretive process, seeking to expose the unstated habitual practices for interpreting signifiers.

A '''corm''', '''bulbo-tuber''', or '''bulbotuber''' is a short, vertical, swollen underground [[plant stem]] that serves as a [[storage organ]] that some plants use to survive winter or other adverse conditions such as summer drought and heat ([[perennation]]).

The word ''cormous'' usually means plants that grow from corms, parallel to the terms ''tuberous'' and ''bulbous'' to describe plants growing from [[tuber]]s and [[bulb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pate, John |author2=Dixon, Kingsley |author3=Pate, J. S. | title = Tuberous, Cormous and Bulbous Plants | publisher = [[University of Western Australia Press]] | location = Perth | year = 1982 | isbn = 978-0-85564-201-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

[[File:CormAnatomy5686.jpg|thumb|''Crocosmia'' corm anatomy, showing tunic, [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of storage tissue, central medulla, and emergence of a new corm from a bud near the top.]]
[[File:Corm stolons5680.jpg|left|thumb|''Crocosmia'' corm with [[stolon]]s emerging through the tunic. The stolons originate at the axillary buds of the corm scales, and generally produce new corms at their tips]]
A corm consists of one or more [[Internode (botany)|internodes]] with at least one growing point, generally with protective leaves modified into skins or [[Tunica (biology)|tunics]]. The tunic of a corm forms from dead [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] sheaths—remnants of leaves produced in previous years. They act as a covering, protecting the corm from insects, digging animals, flooding, and water loss. The tunics of some species are thin, dry, and papery, at least in young plants, however, in some families, such as ''Iridaceae'', the tunic of a mature corm can be formidable protection. For example, some of the larger species of ''[[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonia]]'' accumulate thick, rot-resistant tunics over a period of years, producing a structure of tough, reticulated fibre. Other species, such as many in the genus ''[[Lapeirousia]]'', have tunics of hard, woody layers.&lt;ref name = "Dyer"&gt;Dyer, R. Allen, ''The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants''. {{ISBN|0-621-02854-1}}, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, a typical corm mostly consists of [[parenchyma]] cells, rich in starch, above a circular basal node from which roots grow.

Long-lived cormous plants vary in their long-term development. Some regularly replace their older corms with a stack of younger corms, increased more or less seasonally. By splitting such a stack before the older corm generations wither too badly, the horticulturist can exploit the individual corms for propagation. Other species seldom do anything of that kind; their corms simply grow larger in most seasons. Yet others split when multiple buds or [[stolon]]s on a large corm sprout independently, forming a tussock.

Corms can be dug up and used to propagate or redistribute the plant (see, for example, [[taro]]). Plants with corms generally can be propagated by cutting the corms into sections and replanting. Suitably treated, each section with at least one bud usually can generate a new corm.

=== Comparison to bulbs ===
Corms are sometimes confused with true [[bulb]]s; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, and thus erroneously called bulbs. Corms are stems that are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales that are modified leaves. As a result, a corm cut in half appears solid inside, but a true bulb cut in half reveals that it is made up of layers.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2009-12-25
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Corms are structurally plant stems, with nodes and internodes with buds and produce [[adventitious]] roots. On the top of the corm, one or a few buds grow into shoots that produce normal leaves and flowers.
[[File:corm.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''[[Gladiolus]]'' corm, showing the formation of small cormels at the ends of short stolons]]

== Cormels ==
Corms can form many small cormlets called '''cormels''', from the basal areas of the new growing corms, especially when the main growing point is damaged. These propagate corm-forming plants. A number of species replace corms every year by growing a new corm. This process starts after the shoot develops fully expanded leaves. The new corm forms at the shoot base just above the old corm. As the new corm grows, short [[stolon]]s appear that end with the newly growing small cormels. As the plants grow and flower, they use up the old corm, which shrivels away. The new corm that replaces the old corm grows in size, especially after flowering ends.

The old corm produces the greatest number of cormels when close to the soil surface. Small cormels normally take one or two more years of growth before they are large enough to flower.

Cormels do have a reproductive function, but in the wild they also are important as a survival strategy. In most countries where [[Storage organ|geophytes]] are common, so are animals that feed on them, whether from above like pigs, or from below like bulb weevils, [[blesmol|mole rats]], or [[pocket gopher]]s. Such animals eat through protective tunics, but they generally miss several cormels that remain in the soil to replace the consumed plant. Plants such as ''[[Homeria]]'', ''Watsonia'' and ''Gladiolus'', genera that are vulnerable to such animals, are probably the ones that produce cormels in the greatest numbers and most widely distributed over the plant. ''Homeria'' species produce bunches of cormels on underground stem nodes, and ''[[Watsonia meriana]]'' for example actually produces cormels profusely from under
[[bract]]s on the [[inflorescence]]s.&lt;ref name= "Manning"&gt;{{cite book | last = Manning | first = John | title = Field Guide to Fynbos | publisher = [[Struik Publishers]] | location = Cape Town | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-77007-265-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roots ==
Many corms produce two different types of roots. Those growing from the bottom of the corm are normal fibrous roots, they are formed as the shoots grow, and are produced from the basal area at the bottom of the corm. The second type of roots are thicker layered roots that form as the new corms are growing, they are called [[contractile root]]s and they pull the corm deeper into the soil. In some species contractile roots are produced in response to fluctuating soil temperatures and light levels. In such species, once the corm is deep enough within the soil where the temperature is more uniform and there is no light, the contractile roots no longer grow and the corm is no longer pulled deeper into the soil. In some other species however, contractile roots seem to be a defence against digging animals and can bury the corm surprisingly deeply over the years. ''Wurmbea marginata''&lt;ref name= "Manning"/&gt; is one example of a small plant that can be challenging to dig unharmed out of a hard, clayey hillside.

'''''Deinococcus radiodurans''''' is an [[extremophile|extremophilic]] [[bacterium]], one of the most [[radioresistance|radiation-resistant]] organisms known. It can survive cold, dehydration, vacuum, and [[acid]], and is therefore known as a [[polyextremophile]] and has been listed as the world's toughest bacterium in ''[[Guinness World Records|The Guinness Book Of World Records]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/07_02/deinococcus.shtml | author= Sarah DeWeerdt | title=The World's Toughest Bacterium }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and classification==
The name ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] δεινός (''deinos'') and κόκκος (''kokkos'') meaning "terrible grain/berry" and the [[Latin]] ''radius'' and ''durare'', meaning "radiation surviving". The species was formerly called ''Micrococcus radiodurans''. As a consequence of its hardiness, it has been nicknamed [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Bacterium]].&lt;ref name=huyghe&gt;{{Cite journal

Initially, it was placed in the genus ''[[Micrococcus]]''. After evaluation of [[ribosome|ribosomal]] [[RNA]] sequences and other evidence, it was placed in its own genus '''''[[Deinococcus]]''''', which is closely related to the genus ''[[Thermus]]''. The term "''[[Deinococcus-Thermus]]'' group" is sometimes used to refer to members of ''Deinococcus'' and ''Thermus''.&lt;ref name=makarova&gt;{{Cite journal

''Deinococcus'' is one genus of three in the order '''''Deinococcales'''''. ''D. radiodurans'' is the [[type species]] of this genus, and the best studied member. All known members of the genus are radioresistant: ''D. proteolyticus'', ''D. radiopugnans'', ''D. radiophilus'', ''D. grandis'', ''D. indicus'', ''D. frigens'', ''D. saxicola'', ''D. marmoris'', ''D. deserti'',&lt;ref name="Ddeserti"&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
''D. radiodurans'' was discovered in 1956 by Arthur W. Anderson at the Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station in [[Corvallis, Oregon]].&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 575–577 | last = Anderson | first = A W |author2=H C Nordan |author3=R F Cain |author4=G Parrish |author5=D Duggan  | title = Studies on a radio-resistant micrococcus. I. Isolation, morphology, cultural characteristics, and resistance to gamma radiation | journal = Food Technol. | year = 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments were being performed to determine whether canned food could be sterilized using high doses of [[gamma radiation]]. A tin of meat was exposed to a dose of radiation that was thought to kill all known forms of life, but the meat subsequently spoiled, and ''D. radiodurans'' was isolated.

The complete DNA sequence of ''D. radiodurans'' was published in 1999 by [[The Institute for Genomic Research|TIGR]]. A detailed annotation and analysis of the genome appeared in 2001.&lt;ref name="makarova"/&gt; The sequenced strain was ATCC BAA-816.

''Deinococcus radiodurans'' has a unique quality in which it can repair both single- and double-stranded DNA. When damage is apparent to the cell, it brings it into a compartmental ring-like structure, where the DNA is repaired and then is able to fuse the nucleoids from the outside of the compartment with the damaged DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D.P, Dunlap, P.V., Madigan, M.T., Martinko, J.M. Brock Biology of Microorganisms. San Francisco: Pearson; 2009. 481 p&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''D. radiodurans'' is a rather large, spherical bacterium, with a diameter of 1.5 to 3.5 [[micrometre|µm]].&lt;ref name="Jena"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jena|first1=Sidhartha S.|last2=Joshi|first2=Hiren M.|last3=Sabareesh|first3=K.P.V.|last4=Tata|first4=B.V.R.|last5=Rao|first5=T.S.|title=Dynamics of Deinococcus radiodurans under Controlled Growth Conditions|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=91|issue=7|pages=2699–2707|doi=10.1529/biophysj.106.086520|url=https://doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.106.086520|bibcode=2006BpJ....91.2699J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four cells normally stick together, forming a tetrad. The bacteria are easily cultured and do not appear to cause disease.&lt;ref name="makarova"/&gt; Under controlled growth conditions, cells of dimer, tetramer, and even multimer morphologies can be obtained.&lt;ref name="Jena" /&gt;  Colonies are smooth, convex, and pink to red in color. The cells stain [[Gram positive]], although its cell envelope is unusual and is reminiscent of the cell walls of [[Gram negative]] bacteria.&lt;ref name="battista"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''D. radiodurans'' does not form [[endospore]]s and is nonmotile. It is an [[aerobic organism|obligate aerobic]] [[Chemoorganoheterotrophy|chemoorganoheterotroph]], i.e., it uses [[oxygen]] to derive energy from organic compounds in its environment. It is often found in habitats rich in organic materials, such as soil, feces, meat, or sewage, but has also been isolated from dried foods, room dust, medical instruments and textiles.&lt;ref name="battista"/&gt;

It is extremely resistant to [[ionizing radiation]], [[ultraviolet]] light, [[desiccation]], and oxidizing and [[electrophile|electrophilic]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slade | first1 = D | last2 = Radman | first2 = M | year = 2011 | title = Oxidative stress resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 133–91 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00015-10 | pmid = 21372322 | pmc=3063356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its genome consists of two circular [[chromosome]]s, one 2.65 million base pairs long and the other 412,000 base pairs long, as well as a [[plasmid|megaplasmid]] of 177,000 base pairs and a [[plasmid]] of 46,000 base pairs. It has about 3,195 [[gene]]s. In its stationary phase, each bacterial cell contains four copies of this genome; when rapidly multiplying, each bacterium contains 8-10 copies of the genome.

==Ionizing-radiation resistance==
''D. radiodurans'' is capable of withstanding an acute dose of 5,000&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|grays]] (Gy), or 500,000&amp;nbsp;rad, of [[ionizing radiation]] with almost no loss of viability, and an acute dose of 15,000&amp;nbsp;Gy with 37% viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moseley BE, Mattingly A | year = 1971 | title = Repair of irradiated transforming deoxyribonu- cleic acid in wild type and a radiation- sensitive mutant of Micrococcus radiodu- rans | url = | journal = J.

Chem. | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1239–47 | doi=10.1271/bbb1961.47.1239}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dose of 5,000&amp;nbsp;Gy is estimated to introduce several hundred double-strand breaks (DSBs) into the organism's DNA (~0.005&amp;nbsp;DSB/Gy/Mbp (haploid genome)). For comparison, a chest X-ray or Apollo mission involves about 1&amp;nbsp;mGy, 5&amp;nbsp;Gy can kill a human, 200-800&amp;nbsp;Gy will kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', and over 4,000&amp;nbsp;Gy will kill the radiation-resistant [[tardigrade]].

Several bacteria of comparable radioresistance are now known, including some species of the genus ''[[Chroococcidiopsis]]'' (phylum [[cyanobacteria]]) and some species of ''[[Rubrobacter]]'' (phylum [[actinobacteria]]); among the [[archaea]], the species ''[[Thermococcus]] gammatolerans'' shows comparable radioresistance.&lt;ref name=battista2/&gt;  ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' also has a unique ability to repair damaged DNA.  It isolates the damaged segments in a controlled area and repairs it. This bacteria can also repair many small fragments from an entire chromosome.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D.P., Dunlap, P.V., Madigan, M.T., Martinko, J.M. Brock Biology of Microorganisms. San Francisco: Pearson. 2009. 281 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of ionizing-radiation resistance==
''Deinococcus'' accomplishes its resistance to radiation by having multiple copies of its [[genome]] and rapid [[DNA repair]] mechanisms. It usually repairs breaks in its chromosomes within 12–24 hours by a 2-step process. First, ''D. radiodurans'' reconnects some chromosome fragments by a process called [[Single-stranded DNA|single-stranded]] annealing. In the second step, multiple proteins mend double-strand breaks through [[homologous recombination]]. This process does not introduce any more mutations than a normal round of replication would.

[[Electron microscopy#Scanning electron microscope .28SEM.29|Scanning electron microscopy]] analysis has shown that DNA in ''D. radiodurans'' is organized into tightly packed [[toroid]]s, which may facilitate DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Levin-Zaidman S, Englander J, Shimoni E, Sharma AK, Minton KW, Minsky A | title=Ringlike structure of the Deinococcus radiodurans genome: a key to radioresistance? | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | year=2003 | volume=299 | issue=5604 | pages=254–256 | pmid=12522252 | doi=10.1126/science.1077865|bibcode = 2003Sci...299..254L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of Croatian and French researchers led by [[Miroslav Radman]] have bombarded ''D. radiodurans'' to study the mechanism of DNA repair. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]]. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of [[Homology (biology)#Homology of sequences in genetics|homologous]] regions through a moving [[D-loop]] that can continue extension until they find [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] partner strands. In the final step, there is [[Chromosomal crossover|crossover]] by means of [[RecA]]-dependent [[Chromosomal crossover|homologous recombination]].&lt;ref name="MRadman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Zahradka K, Slade D, Bailone A, Sommer S, Averbeck D, Petranovic M, Lindner AB, Radman M | author8-link=Miroslav Radman | title=Reassembly of shattered chromosomes in Deinococcus radiodurans | journal=Nature | volume=443 | issue=7111 | year=2006 | pages=569–573 | pmid=17006450 | doi=10.1038/nature05160 | bibcode=2006Natur.443..569Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''D. radiodurans'' is capable of genetic transformation, a process by which DNA derived from one cell can be taken up by another cell and integrated into the recipient genome by homologous recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moseley | first1 = BE | last2 = Setlow | first2 = JK | year = 1968 | title = Transformation in Micrococcus radiodurans and the ultraviolet sensitivity of its transforming DNA | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 176–183 | pmid = 5303325 |pmc = 285920 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.1.176|bibcode = 1968PNAS...61..176M }}&lt;/ref&gt;   When DNA damages (e.g. pyrimidine dimers) are introduced into donor DNA by UV irradiation, the recipient cells efficiently repair the damages in the transforming DNA as they do in cellular DNA when the cells themselves are irradiated.

A team of Russian and American scientists proposed that the radioresistance of ''D. radiodurans'' had a [[Mars|Martian]] origin. Evolution of the microorganism could have taken place on the Martian surface until it was delivered to Earth on a [[meteorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2009, [[nitric oxide]] was reported to play an important role in the bacteria's recovery from radiation exposure: the gas is required for division and proliferation after DNA damage has been repaired. A gene was described that increases nitric oxide production after UV radiation, and in the absence of this gene, the bacteria were still able to repair DNA damage, but would not grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news175197704.html|title=Research reveals key to world's toughest organism|author=Krishna Ramanujan|date=October 19, 2009|work=Physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of ionizing-radiation resistance==

A persistent question regarding ''D. radiodurans'' is how such a high degree of radioresistance could evolve. Natural [[background radiation]] levels are very low—in most places, on the order of 0.4&amp;nbsp;mGy per year, and the highest known background radiation, near [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], [[Iran]] is only 260&amp;nbsp;mGy per year. With naturally occurring background radiation levels so low, organisms evolving mechanisms specifically to ward off the effects of high radiation are unlikely.

Valerie Mattimore of [[Louisiana State University]] has suggested the radioresistance of ''D. radiodurans'' is simply a side effect of a mechanism for dealing with prolonged cellular [[desiccation]] (dryness). To support this hypothesis, she performed an experiment in which she demonstrated that mutant strains of ''D. radiodurans'' which are highly susceptible to damage from [[ionizing radiation]] are also highly susceptible to damage from prolonged desiccation, while the wild-type strain is resistant to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattimore V, Battista JR | title=Radioresistance of Deinococcus radiodurans: functions necessary to survive ionizing radiation are also necessary to survive prolonged desiccation | journal=Journal of Bacteriology | date=1 February 1996| volume=178 | issue=3 | pages=633–637 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/178/3/633?view=long&amp;pmid=8550493 |pmid=8550493 | pmc=177705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to DNA repair, ''D. radiodurans'' use LEA proteins ([[Late Embryogenesis Abundant proteins]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goyal K, Walton LJ, Tunnacliffe A | title=LEA proteins prevent protein aggregation due to water stress | journal=Biochemical Journal | year=2005 | volume=388 | issue=Pt 1 | pages=151–157 |url=http://www.biochemj.org/bj/388/0151/bj3880151.htm | doi=10.1042/BJ20041931 | pmid=15631617 | pmc=1186703}}&lt;/ref&gt; expression to protect against desiccation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Battista JR, Park MJ, McLemore AE | title=Inactivation of two homologues of proteins presumed to be involved in the desiccation tolerance of plants sensitizes Deinococcus radiodurans R1 to desiccation | journal=Cryobiology | year=2001 | volume=43 | issue=2 | pages=133–139  |pmid=11846468 | doi=10.1006/cryo.2001.2357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
''Deinococcus radiodurans'' has shown to have a great potential to be used in different fields of investigation. Not only ''D.radiodurans'' has been genetically modified for [[bioremediation]] applications, but also it has been discovered that it could perform a major role in biomedical research and in [[Nanotechnology]].

[[Bioremediation]] refers to any process that uses microorganisms, fungi, plants or the enzymes derived from them to return an environment altered by contaminants to its natural condition. Large areas of soils, sediments and groundwater are contaminated with [[radionuclides]], [[heavy metals]] and toxic solvents. There are microorganisms that are able to decontaminate soils with [[heavy metals]] by immobilizing them, but in the case of nuclear waste, [[ionizing radiation]] limits the amount of microorganisms that can be useful. In this sense, ''D. radiodurans'', due to its characteristics, can be used for the treatment of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] waste. ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' has been [[genetically engineered]] to consume and digest solvents and heavy metals in these radioactive environments.

In the biomedical field, ''Deinococcus radiodurans'' could be used as a model to study the processes that lead to [[aging]] and [[cancer]]. The main causes of these physiological changes are related to the damage in [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[proteins]] resulting from [[oxidative stress]], the weakening of antioxidant defence and the inability of repair mechanisms to deal with the damage originated by [[reactive oxygen species]], also known as ROS. To this extent, ''D.radiodurans'' mechanisms of protection against oxidative damage and of DNA reparation could be the starting points in research aimed to develop medical procedures to prevent [[aging]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Slade|first1=Dea|last2=Radman|first2=Miroslav|title=Oxidative Stress Resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans|pmc=3063356|website=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews : MMBR|pages=133–191|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00015-10|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lines of investigation are focused on the application of ''D. radiodurans'' antioxidant systems in human cells to prevent ROS damaging and the study of the development of resistance to radiation in tumoral cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rew|first1=D.

Whereas chemical and physical methods to produce these [[nanoparticles]] are expensive and generate a huge amount of [[pollutants]], biosynthetic processes represent an ecofriendly and cheaper alternative. The importance of these [[nanoparticles]] relies on their medical applications as they have been demonstrated to exhibit activity against pathogenic bacteria, [[antifouling]] effects and [[cytotoxicity]] to tumoral cells.

Moreover, there are other uncommon applications of ''Deinococcus radiodurans''. The [[J. Craig Venter Institute|Craig Venter Institute]] has used a system derived from the rapid DNA repair mechanisms of ''D. radiodurans'' to assemble synthetic DNA fragments into [[chromosomes]], with the ultimate goal of producing a synthetic organism they call ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/craig_venter_on_dna_and_the_sea Craig Venter's TED talk] (February 2005) mentions ''D. radiodurans'' as the ultimate genome assembly machine&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, U.S. scientists demonstrated ''D. radiodurans'' could be used as a means of information storage that might survive a nuclear catastrophe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7170">The '''evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis''' was first proposed by Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold in 1995 as a way to explain the success of invasive, [[non-indigenous species]] (in particular, plants). Observing that:
# there is usually a lag period between the time of introduction of an [[invasive species]] and the point at which it is considered invasive, and
# invasive plants seem to be more virulent in habitats into which they have been introduced (as compared to their native habitats), the scientists presumed a sort of [[naturalization]] through modification for non-indigenous plants.
Because of a lack of native [[predation]], the scientists reasoned, introduced plants are able to reallocate resources from defense mechanisms into growth and development. Introduced plants can thereby [[evolution|evolve]] to grow taller, produce more [[biomass]], and yield more [[:wikt:viable|viable]] offspring than their native counterparts, according to the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/Blossey_Notzold_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Blossey and Nötzold tested their hypothesis on ''[[Lythrum salicaria]]'' (purple loosetrife) by potting seeds from plants growing in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., and Lucelle, Switzerland. The seeds were allowed to [[germinate]] in a lab at Christian-Albrechts University in Kiel, northern Germany, and observed for two years. True to the predictions of the EICA Hypothesis, the plants derived from Ithaca produced significantly more biomass that the plants derived from Lucelle. The ''Lythrum salicaria'' plants derived from Ithaca also grew taller and were significantly less resistant to the root-feeding [[weevil]] present over its native range.

==Significance==

Unlike the notable ideas (concerning the success of invasive non-indigenous organisms) that preceded it, such as the [[enemy release hypothesis]] (ERH) and [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Habituation Hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles. On the Origin of Species. Pg. 114–116. Harvard University Press: eighteenth printing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the EICA hypothesis [[postulate]]s that an invasive species is ''not'' as fit (in its introduced habitat) at its moment of introduction as it is at the time that it is considered invasive. As suggested by the name of the hypothesis (Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability), the hypothesis predicts that much of the invasive potential of an invasive species is derived from its ability to evolve to reallocate its resources.

This idea is troubling{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} in that it adds a new variable to "invasive potential", making it harder to predict whether or not a species will become invasive if it is introduced into a new area. In other words, the EICA hypothesis presents a new environmental safety concern. If its postulates hold, in the long run, [[introduced species]] may have to be more highly regulated than they are at present, because no set of [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] or pattern of introduction can predict the extent to which an organism can reallocate its resources in response to a release from stress.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Scientific support and revision==

Since its debut in 1995, Bernd Blossey and Rolf Nötzold's paper, "Evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive nonindigenous plants: a hypothesis" has been met with varying degrees of enthusiasm. The paper has been cited in over 368 articles in [[scientific journals]], including [[review articles]], tests of the hypothesis using different [[model species]], and expansions and reformulations of the hypothesis. Among the model species on which the hypothesis has been evaluated most recently (in its original form) are ''[[Solidago gigantea]]'' (giant goldenrod),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/e5v2m075252j1202/ Altered patterns of growth, physiology and reproduction in invasive genotypes of Solidago gigantea (Asteraceae)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sapium sebiferum]]'' (Chinese Tallow),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l847377740371176/ Increased competitive ability and herbivory tolerance in the invasive plant Sapium sebiferum]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lepidium draba]]'' (whitetop).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a0402043431336n7/ No difference in competitive ability between invasive North American and native European Lepidium draba populations]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these three model species, the success and behavior of ''Sapium sebifurum'' agreed most closely with the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, according to the researches conducting the study. In its study, the success and behavior of ''Solidago gigantea'' was only partially explained by the EICA hypothesis, according to its researchers. ''Lepidium draba'' did not seem to follow any of the postulates of the EICA Hypothesis, as the researchers of the study understood them.

Through most of the studies done on the EICA Hypothesis (see examples above), it holds that the introduced populations of invasive plant species are less able to cope with the pressures of specialist [[herbivores]] than native populations of the same species are, suggesting that invasive species ''do'' respond to accelerated [[natural selection]] after being released from the [[selective pressure]] of specialist herbivores and ''do'' have the potential to reallocate resources away from specific forms of defense. However, not all of these introduced populations produce significantly more biomass than the native populations of the same species under laboratory conditions. A study conducted by Bossdorf et al. in 2004 on ''Alliaria petiolata'' (garlic mustard) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00583.x Blackwell Synergy – Ecol Letters, Volume 7 Issue 4 Page 346-353, April 2004 (Article Abstract)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; may lend some insight into this discrepancy. Bossdorf et al. potted seeds from native and introduced populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' and put them in direct competition with one another in a laboratory setting (i.e. the native and introduced populations were grown on in the same pot of soil, and subjected to the same treatments), and found that in direct competition, the native populations were able to out-compete the invasive populations. Bossdorf et al. proposed that this observation could result from the fact that there is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] cost to traits that increase so-called "competitive ability". Under this assumption, invasive populations of ''Alliaria petiolata'' had evolved a higher fitness (similar to ''Lythrum Salicaria'') in their introduced ranges at the cost of certain defense mechanisms ''and'' at the cost of certain aspects of growth and development (dissimilar to ''Lythrum Salicaria''). It could be, therefore, that the EICA Hypothesis is too narrow in scope, and should be reworded to place an emphasis on an invasive species' ability to reallocate its resources in order to procure a fitness advantage that may or may not involve more vigorous growth and development.

The '''Finno-Ugrian suicide hypothesis''' proposes to link genetic ties originating among [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] [[culture]]s and [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]] to high rate of [[suicide]], claiming an [[allele]] common among them is responsible.

[[Mari people|Mari]] and [[Udmurt people|Udmurts]] have been found to have a three times higher suicide rate than Finns and Hungarians. It has been thus theorized that such a possible allele may have arisen in those populations.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990–1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/103/2/543.full.pdf|title=Ancestry, genes, and suicide: a test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis in the United States|journal=Percept Mot Skills|year=2006|volume=103|issue=2|pages=543–50|pmid=17165419|author=Voracek M|doi=10.2466/pms.103.2.543-550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global concerns about the '''gender disparity in computing''' occupations have gained more importance with the emerging [[information age]]. These concerns motivated [[public policy]] debates addressing [[gender equality]] as computer applications exerted increasing influence in society. This dialogue helped to expand information technology innovations and to reduce the consequences of [[sexism]].

In the early days of computers and computing, women were well-represented in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-“computer-geeks”-replaced-“computergirls”|title=Researcher reveals how “Computer Geeks” replaced “Computer Girls”|last=Frink|first=Brenda D.|date=1 June 2011|website=Gender News|publisher=Stanford University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312130252/http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D#|archive-date=2015-03-12|dead-url=no|access-date=22 October 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often worked as "human computers," making complicated calculations and working in large groups, such as the [[Harvard Computers]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} Women also worked on ballistics calculations and cryptography.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=Fessenden|first=Marissa|work=Smithsonian|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human computers who were women could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, the majority of human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Many early programmers on machines such as [[ENIAC]], were mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reason that women were involved as programmers and human computers was because "they expected programming to be a low skill clerical function," and that the difficult work was the creation of the hardware, which male engineers largely worked on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The programmers of the ENIAC, six women who designed the public demonstrations and prepared the machine for its public debut were not fully recognized for their contributions by the media.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=51}}

By the 1960s, while computer programming was still touted as a good field for women to go into, major shifts were beginning to take place that would help push women out of the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men who were programming started to make the field more "prestigious," creating professional associations, education requirements for work and by actively discouraging hiring women in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hiring tools were introduced in which answers were shared among all-male groups and clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way to push women out of the field was to use [[Personality test|personality tests]] that favored people who were not interested in working with others, which was slanted towards a certain type of male applicant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After these trends were entrenched in the industry, it has continued to perpetuate itself into the modern day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some computer science programs, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], in the mid-1960s wouldn't even admit women into their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4892094/google-diversity-history-memo/|title=Women in Tech and the History Behind That Controversial Google Diversity Memo|last=Waxman|first=Olvia B.|date=8 August 2017|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender gap==
A survey, conducted by SWIFT ("Supporting Women in Information Technology") based in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, asked 7,411 participants questions about their career choices. The survey found that females tend to believe that they lack the skill set needed to be successful in the field of computing. This study (as well as others) provides a strong base for a positive correlation between perceived ability and career choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chan, Vania |author2=Stafford, Katie |author3=Klawe, Maria |author4=Chen, Grace |title=Gender Differences in Vancouver Secondary Students' Interests Related to Information Technology Careers |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia |year=2000 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc |access-date=2016-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221164825/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc# |archive-date=2007-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A project based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society" (SIGIS) released its findings based on research conducted in 48 separate case studies all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, Wendy (2004). [http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_Final_Public.pdf "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society - Final Report"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SIGIS, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings focus on recruiting as well as retention techniques for women already studying in the field. These techniques range from the introduction of role models, advertisement campaigns, and the allocation of quotas, in order to make the computing field appear more gender neutral.&lt;ref name="sigis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Robin Williams|title=Getting More Women in Computer Science and Engineering|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225701/http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating reforms, which will increase the quality of the educating body and technological facilities, are also suggested.&lt;ref name="sigis" /&gt;

Research suggests that [[Malaysia]] has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark.&lt;ref name="mala"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Vivian Anette Lagesen |title=A Cyberfeminist Utopia?: Perceptions of Gender and Computer Science among Malaysian Women Computer Science Students and Faculty|publisher=Sage Publications|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A job in the computing industry also implies a safe work environment. Strong belief by the previous generation that IT would be a flourishing sector with many job opportunities caused parents to encourage their children to take a computing career, no matter the gender.&lt;ref name="mala" /&gt;

In India, a growing number of women are studying and taking careers in technical fields. The percentage of women engineers graduating from IIT Bombay grew from 
1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simard |first=Caroline |url=http://anitaborginstitute.org/files/womenhightechworld.pdf |format=PDF |title= The state of women and technology fields around the world |publisher= Anita Borg Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women in Arab societies|Arab women]] made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science in 2014 at government universities located in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Islam|2017|p=13}} Women in [[Eastern Europe]], especially in Bulgaria and Romania, have high rates of pursuing coding and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/women-in-tech-why-bulgaria-and-romania-are-leading-in-software-engineering/|title=Women in tech: Why Bulgaria and Romania are leading in software engineering {{!}} ZDNet|last=Fiscutean|first=Andrada|date=13 June 2017|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women remain underrepresented in information technology fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varma | first1 = Roli | year = 2010 | title = Computing self-efficiency among women in India | url = http://www.unm.edu/~varma/print/JWMSE_CS%20Self%20Efficacy.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 257–274 | doi=10.1615/jwomenminorscieneng.v16.i3.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics in education===
In the United States, the proportion of women represented in undergraduate [[computer science]] education and the white-collar [[information technology]] workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of [[Computer Science]] degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy (2001). [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~women/resources/aroundTheWeb/hostedPapers/Syllabus-Camp.pdf "Women in Computer Science: Reversing the Trend"]. Colorado School of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[Computing Research Association]] Taulbee Survey indicate that fewer than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at U.S. PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_Degree_and_Enrollment_Trends_2010-11.pdf "Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends"], 2010-2011 CRA Taulbee Survey. The Computing Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although teenage girls are now using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers, they are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes.&lt;ref&gt;Melkymuka, Kathleen (8 January 2001). [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590257/it-personnel/if-girls-don-t-get-it---it-won-t-get-girls.html "If Girls Don't Get IT, IT Won't Get Girls"], Computer World.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]] (NCWIT) reports that of the [[SAT]] takers who intend to major in computer and information sciences, the proportion of girls has steadily decreased relative to the proportion of boys, from 20 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, Randall  (15 November 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16digi.html?_r=0 "What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?"], The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this number has been decreasing, in 2001, the total number of these students (both boys and girls) reached its peak at 73,466.

According to a [[College Board]] report, in 2006 there were slightly more girls than boys amongst SAT takers that reported to having "course work or experience" in [[computer literacy]], word processing, internet activity, and creating spreadsheets/databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2006/national-report.pdf 2006 College-Bound Seniors - Total Group Profile Report], CollegeBoard SAT.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also determined that more boys than girls (59% vs 41%) reported course work or experience with [[computer programming]], although this may likely be caused by false reporting. Of the 146,437 students (13%) who reported having ''no'' course work or experience, 61% were girls and 39% were boys.

More boys than girls take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) Computer Science exams. According to the College Board in 2006, 2,594 girls and 12,068 boys took the AP Computer Science A exam, while 517 girls and 4,422 boys took the more advanced AP Computer Science AB exam. From 1996 to 2004, girls made up 16–17% of those taking the AP Computer Science A exam and around 10% of those taking AP Computer Science AB exam.

===Statistics in the workforce===
Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling from a peak of 38% in the mid-1980s. From 1993 through 1999, NSF's SESTAT reported that the percentage of women working as computer/information scientists (including those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher in an S&amp;E field or have a bachelor's degree or higher and are working in an S&amp;E field) declined slightly from 33.1% to 29.6% percent while the absolute numbers increased from 170,500 to 185,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/us-workforce/ "Characteristics of Scientists and Engineers in the US"], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Catalyst in 2006 indicated that women comprise 27-29% of the computing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Misa, ed. (2010). ''Gender Codes: Why Women Are Leaving Computing''. Wiley/IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; A [[National Public Radio]] report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Benefits of gender diversity==
A gender-diverse team is more likely to create products that meet people's requirements. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on men's experiences, opinions, and judgement, resulting in a male-slanted bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/|title=Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women's Success in Engineering and Computing|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/impactgenderdiversitytechbusinessperformance_print.pdf|title=What Is the Impact of Gender Diversity on Technology Business Performance?: Research Summary|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non-linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/16372408/received-wisdom-relationship-between-diversity-organizational-performance|title=RECEIVED WISDOM AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research conducted by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity|title=Is there a payoff from top-team diversity?|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast analysis of sample major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance, these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the benefits of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x/abstract|title=The Gender and Ethnic Diversity of US Boards and Board Committees and Firm Financial Performance|accessdate=25 August 2015 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x|volume=18|journal=Corporate Governance: An International Review|pages=396–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide'' states that the lack of participation of females in computing excludes them from the "new economy", which calls for sophisticated computer skills in exchange for high salary positions.&lt;ref name="digital divide"&gt;Cooper, J.; Weaver, K. (2003). ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors contributing to lack of female participation==

===Education===
Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science dates from about 1984&lt;ref name=NSFstatistics&gt;{{cite web|title=TABLE 33. Computer sciences degrees awarded, by degree level and sex of recipient: 1966–2010|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/pdf/tab33.pdf|publisher=NSF|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games. Fiddling with computers by boys resulted in increased interest and readiness for computer science classes by young men.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Henn|title=When Women Stopped Coding|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding|accessdate=December 26, 2014|work=Morning Edition|publisher=NPR|date=October 21, 2014|quote=The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of over 7000 high school students in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]] showed that the degree of interest in the field of [[computer science]] for young women is comparably lower than that of young men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Handcock, Mark S. et al. (2004). [https://www.webcitation.org/67YOr88gp?url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html "Focus on Women in Computer Science"], University of British Columbia. Archived from [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html the original] on 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is seen in higher education; for instance, only 4% of female college freshmen expressed intention to major in computer science in the US.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Research has shown that some aspects about computing may discourage women. One of the biggest turn-offs is the "geek factor". High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubicle writing code. The "geek factor" affects both male and female high school students, but it seems to have more of a negative effect on the female students.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Computer Science Takes Steps to Bring Women to the Fold|work=[[New York Times]]|date=17 April 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/science/17comp.html?_r=2&amp;8dpc=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male, contributing to an absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers.  However, in 2015, computer science has for the first time become the most popular major for female students at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=stanfordcs&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Sarah|title=Computer science now top major for women at Stanford University|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-technology-stanford-idUSKCN0S32F020151009|website=Reuters US Edition|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to qualify for federal education funding distributed through the states, most U.S. states and districts now focus on ensuring that all students are at least "proficient" in mathematics and reading, making it difficult for teachers to focus on teaching concepts beyond the test. According to a Rand Corporation study, such a concentration on testing can cause administrators to focus resources on tested subjects at the expense of other subjects (e.g., science) or distract their attention from other needs.&lt;ref&gt;Stecher, B. M. (2002).  "Consequences of large-scale, high-stakes testing on school and classroom practice". In: Hamilton, L. S., B. M. Stecher, and S. P. Klein (Eds.). ''Making sense of test-based accountability in education''. Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, computational thinking is unlikely to be taught either standalone or as integrated into other areas of study (e.g., mathematics, biology) anytime in the near future. The National Center for Women &amp; IT distributes free resources for increasing awareness of the need for teaching computer science in schools, including the "Talking Points" card, "Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529040434/http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}, [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female and male perspectives===
[[File:Not_boyfriends_computer.jpg|thumb|The sticker reads, "No, this is not my boyfriend's computer."]]
According to a 1998–2000 ethnographic study by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], men and women viewed computers very differently. Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, J. et al. (1999). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 ''Unlocking the Clubhouse''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713080000/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 |date=July 13, 2012 }}. The MIT Press. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were "geeks," with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers "become their life."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.

A two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that "Girls approach the computer as a "tool" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a "toy" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse "real" power and power on a screen. "I see a computer as a tool," a high school girl declares. "You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way."&lt;ref&gt;AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). [http://history.aauw.org/files/2013/01/TechSavvy.pdf "Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age"], p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes.

Nearly 1000 students in [[University of Akron]] were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in [[University of Winnipeg]] and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="digital divide" /&gt;

This is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt;

===Barriers to advancement===
Research on the barriers that women face in undergraduate computing&lt;ref&gt;Cohoon, J. McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted such factors as:

* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the "weedout" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.
* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.
* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that "women can do computing as well as men".
* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.

Just like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need "extra help" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the "extra help" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.

===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===
Women in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: "I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

However, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"&gt;(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies "Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.

===Stereotyping computer scientists===
Other research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it has been found that a women’s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors. (Research).|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|date=2002|volume=80|issue=4|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases that subvert the stereotype of typical people in computing include the person coming from a family that is already involved in computing or a related field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kekelis|first1=Linda S.|last2=Ancheta|first2=Rebecca Wepsic|last3=Heber|first3=Etta|title=Hurdles in the pipeline: girls and technology careers.|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic status is correlated to a higher likelihood of women choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002" /&gt; Yet, many computing companies only search for employees from prestigious schools, which leaves fewer opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017" /&gt;

===Fraternity-like startup environments===
The disproportionate number of startups in the computing industry, and the disproportionate hiring of primarily young workers, have created an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are recent college graduates, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism]] that discourages female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/18/heres-the-conversation-men-need-to-have-about-sexism-as-told-by-a-man/|title=Sexism In Startups: The Frank Conversation We Need To Be Having|first=Joseph|last=Steinberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of fraternity-like environments among technology teams of startup firms has been termed ''brogrammer culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer|title=The Rise of the 'Brogrammer'|first=Douglas MacMillan|last=dmac1|date=2 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bringing women into computing==
[[File:Computer_Repairing_Lilongwe_Malawi.jpg|thumb|Computer Repairing Lilongwe Malawi]]
The majority of data collected about women in IT has been qualitative analysis such as interviews and case studies. This data has been used to create effective programs addressing the underrepresentation of women in IT.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J W; Beise, C M; Woszczynski, A B; Myers, M E. (2003).

The number of female college entrants expressing interest in majoring in computer science decreased in the 2000s to pre-1980's levels.&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Eggers |title=Interest in computer science is volatile |url=http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |publisher=The Institute of Quantitative Social Science |date=17 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67YOs9Pdz?url=http://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study was initialized by Allan Fisher, then Associate Dean for Undergraduate Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon University, and Jane Margolis, a social scientist and expert in gender equity in education, into the nature of this problem.

[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lblum/PAPERS/women_in_computer_science.pdf "Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience"], Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities across North America are changing their computer science programs to make them more appealing to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358238982/to-get-women-to-work-in-computer-science-schools-get-them-to-class | title=To Get Women To Work In Computer Science, Schools Get Them To Class | publisher=NPR | date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proactive and positive exposures to early computer experiences, such as The Alice Project,&lt;ref name="Alice"&gt;[http://www.alice.org/index.php The Alice Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508000054/http://alice.org/index.php# |date=2012-05-08 }}, Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the late [[Randy Pausch]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], are thought to be effective in terms of retention and creation of enthusiasm for women who may later consider entering the field. Institutions of higher education are also beginning to make changes regarding the process and availability of mentoring to women that are undergraduates in technical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|author2=Kristen Moore |title=Time Talk: On Small Changes that Enact Infrastructural Mentoring for Undergraduate Women in Technical Fields|journal=Journal of Technical Writing &amp; Communication|year=2013|volume=43|issue=3|pages=333–354|doi=10.2190/TW.43.3.f|url=http://0-pq9se9hp4e.search.serialssolutions.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/?genre=article&amp;issn=00472816&amp;title=Journal+of+Technical+Writing+%26+Communication&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=3&amp;date=20130901&amp;atitle=Time+Talk%3a+On+Small+Changes+that+Enact+Infrastructural+Mentoring+for+Undergraduate+Women+in+Technical+Fields.&amp;spage=333&amp;pages=333-354&amp;sid=EBSCO:Academic+Search+Complete&amp;aulast=Sullivan%2c+Patricia|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy for addressing this issue has been early outreach to elementary and high-school girls. Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cips.ca/women "Women in IT"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.

Additionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.

=== 2000s efforts ===

====National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology====
[[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology|The National Center for Women &amp; IT]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or "fitting in" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;DuBow, Wendy M., et al.

====Postsecondary education organization====
Numerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC). The organization aims to promote women in computing across a variety of schools and industries, educate women on the profession of computer science, and provide opportunities for women in technical fields. WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacesetters====
In an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called "Pacesetters". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 "Net New Women" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&amp;T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:

*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.
*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,
*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.

''Athena Unbound - The advancement of women in science and technology'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-511-03833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in the sciences from an early childhood interest, through university, to graduate school and finally into the academic workplace.

According to J. McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72–80 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72–79 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that "...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing according to Paul De Palma. In his article Why Women Avoid Computer Science, he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who usually are given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other "boy-related" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore more participation of women in the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;De Palma, Paul.

&lt;/ref&gt; The table below lists the scores of the PISA 2009 assessment in mathematics and reading by country, as well as the difference between boys and girls. Gaps in bold font mean that the gender gap is [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] ([[p value|p]]&lt;0.05). A positive mathematics gap means that boys outperform girls, a negative mathematics gap means that girls outperform boys. A positive reading gap means that girls outperform boys (no country has a negative reading gap). There is a negative [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the mathematics and reading gender gaps, that is, nations with a larger mathematics gap have a smaller reading gap and vice versa.&lt;ref name="stoetgeary2013-se"/&gt;

[[Glass-to-metal seal]]s have been around for many years, with one of the most common uses being lamp bulb seals. A more recent invention is '''glass-ceramic-to-metal seals'''.

==Properties==
''Glass-ceramics'' are polycrystalline [[ceramic]] materials prepared by the controlled crystallization of suitable glasses, normally [[silicate]]s. Depending on the starting glass composition and the heat-treatment schedule adopted, glass-ceramics can be prepared with tailored [[thermal expansion]] characteristics. This makes them ideal for sealing to a variety of different metals, ranging from low expansion [[Tungsten|tungsten (W)]] or [[Molybdenum|molybdenum (Mo)]] to high expansion [[stainless steel]]s and [[nickel]]-based [[superalloys]].

Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals offer superior properties over their glass equivalents including more [[refractory]] behaviour, in addition to their ability to seal successfully to many different metals and alloys. They have been used in electrical feed-through seals for such applications as [[vacuum]] interrupter envelopes and pyrotechnic [[actuator]]s, in addition to many applications where a higher temperature capability than is possible with [[glass-to-metal seal]]s is required, including solid [[oxide]] [[fuel cell]]s.

==Process==
In the formation of a glass-ceramic-to-metal seal, the parts to be joined are first heated, normally under [[Inert gas|inert]] atmosphere, in order to melt the glass and allow it to wet and flow into the metal parts, in much the same way as when preparing a more conventional [[glass-to-metal seal]]. The temperature is then normally reduced into a temperature regime where many microscopic nuclei are formed in the glass. The temperature is then raised again into a regime where the major [[crystallinity|crystalline]] [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s can form and grow to create the polycrystalline ceramic material with thermal expansion characteristics matched to that of the particular metal parts.

== Examples ==
The white opaque "glue" between the panel and the funnel of a colour TV [[cathode ray tube]] is a
devitrified [[solder glass]] based on the system {{chem|PbO}}-{{chem|ZnO}}-{{chem|B|2|O|3}}. While
this is a glass-ceramic-to-glass seal, the basic patent of S.A. Claypoole considers
glass-ceramic-to-metal seals as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Green Hour''' is a core concept of the U.S. [[National Wildlife Federation]]'s '''Be Out There''' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Be Out There" program website]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was created in response to a growing disconnect between nature and children, a condition dubbed [[nature deficit disorder]] by Richard Louv&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardlouv.com/ Author Richard Louv's website]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[Last Child in the Woods]]''. One of the primary symptoms of nature deficit disorder, according to Louv, is the replacement of outdoor activities (or "green time") with "screen time"—hours that are spent in front of computers, televisions and other electronic devices.

The [[National Wildlife Federation]] recommends that parents give their kids a "Green Hour" every day, a time for unstructured play and interaction with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There/Why-Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Why Be Out There" web page]&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of NWF's strategy called [[Reversing Nature Deficit]]. The Green Hour program teaches that unstructured play can take place in a garden, a backyard, a nearby park, or any place that provides safe and accessible green spaces where children can learn and play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/360/story/551908.html Miami Herald article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Hour's web site was launched by NWF's Education department in March 2007 as a resource for parents and caregivers, attempting to provide the information, inspiration, tools and community needed to make "green hours" part of every family's daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/18/AR2007061801808_pf.html Washington Post article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt; Green Hour cites a Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/ Kaiser Family Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; study which found the average American child spends 44 hours per week-more than six hours per day-staring at some kind of electronic screen. Studies have also linked excessive television viewing to obesity, violence, and even lower intelligence in kids.

Each week, Green Hour publishes a new issue of its Discovery Journal with a new outdoor theme. The Journal has several tabs: "Book Nook," which provides reading for kids of different ages, "Make &amp; Do," which provides outdoor activities and crafts and "Did You Know." which provides facts about nature.

The Green Hour blog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/blog NWF's Green Hour Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; presents different perspectives on the rise in children's "screen-time" and practical ways of reconnecting youth to nature. The Green Hour Community Corner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/community NWF's Green Hour Community Corner]&lt;/ref&gt; allow users to sign up as members and talk with other parents and caregivers. NatureFind&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/NatureFind.aspx NWF's Green Hour NatureFind]&lt;/ref&gt; is a feature on the site that allows users to submit their zip code and find all the parks, trails and other natural areas nearby.

[[File:Trientalis borealis 1177.JPG|right|thumb|''[[Trientalis latifolia]]'' (Broadleaf Starflower) is a perennial herbaceous plant of the ground layer of forests in western North America.]]
'''Herbaceous plants''' (in [[Botany|botanical]] use frequently simply '''herbs''') are [[plant]]s that have no persistent [[wood]]y stem above ground.&lt;ref&gt;''Flora of the British Isles'', Clapham, Tutin, and Warburg, 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is mainly applied to [[Perennial plant|perennial]]s,&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society encyclopedia of gardening |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=9781405303538 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pulnPwAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- glossary p679 --&gt; but in botany it may also refer to [[Annual plant|annual]]s or [[Biennial plant|biennial]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Solomon, E.P. |author2=Berg, L.R. |author3=Martin, D.W. |year=2004|title=Biology|publisher=Brooks/Cole Thomson Learning|isbn=978-0-534-49547-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCUxpgfcoNsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include both [[forb]]s and [[graminoid]]s.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Annual herbaceous plants die completely at the end of the growing season or when they have flowered and fruited, and they then grow again from seed.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Carol. 1995. ''A guide to wildflowers in winter: herbaceous plants of northeastern North America''. New Haven: Yale University Press. page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbaceous perennial and biennial plants may have [[Plant stem|stem]]s that die at the end of the growing season, but parts of the plant survive under or close to the ground from season to season (for biennials, until the next growing season, when they flower and die). New growth develops from living tissues remaining on or under the ground, including [[root]]s, a [[caudex]] (a thickened portion of the stem at ground level) or various types of [[underground stem]]s, such as [[bulb]]s, [[corm]]s, [[stolon]]s, [[rhizome]]s and [[tuber]]s. Examples of herbaceous biennials include [[carrot]], [[parsnip]] and [[Senecio jacobaea|common ragwort]]; herbaceous perennials include [[potato]], [[peony]], [[hosta]], [[Mentha|mint]], most [[fern]]s and most [[Poaceae|grasses]]. By contrast, non-herbaceous perennial plants are [[woody plant]]s which have stems above ground that remain alive during the dormant season and grow shoots the next year from the above-ground parts &amp;ndash; these include [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[vine]]s.

Some relatively fast-growing herbaceous plants (especially annuals) are [[Pioneer species|pioneers]], or early-successional species.  Others form the main vegetation of many stable habitats, occurring for example in the ground layer of [[forest]]s, or in naturally open [[habitat]]s such as [[meadow]], [[salt marsh]] or [[desert]].

Some herbaceous plants can grow rather large, such as the genus ''[[Musa (genus)|Musa]]'', to which the [[banana]] belongs.&lt;ref name=PicqINIB00&gt;{{Cite book |date=2000 |editor-last=Picq |editor-first=Claudine |editor2-last=INIBAP |title=Bananas |edition=English |publication-place=Montpellier |publisher=International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantains/International Plant Genetic Resources Institute |isbn=978-2-910810-37-5 |url=http://www.musalit.org/pdf/info09.1_en.pdf |accessdate=2013-01-31 |lastauthoramp=yes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411222515/http://www.musalit.org/pdf/info09.1_en.pdf |archivedate=April 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of some herbaceous perennial plants can be determined by [[herbchronology]], the analysis of annual growth rings in the secondary root xylem.

'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]].

While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.&lt;ref name=beall07 /&gt; This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]]. Though the physical growth in body size is [[stunted growth|delayed]], growth in lung volumes is accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frisancho|first1=A.

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.&lt;ref name=mue /&gt; Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.&lt;ref name=bea00 /&gt;

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC |year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/39/14300 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101|last2=Song |last3=Elston |last4=Goldstein |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.&lt;ref name=yi /&gt; [[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R |year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/72 |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406|last2=Yang |last3=Huff |last4=Yun |last5=Qin |last6=Witherspoon |last7=Bai |last8=Lorenzo |last9=Xing |last10=Jorde |last11=Prchal |last12=Ge |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Sherpas]], known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the ''EPAS1'' gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under [[Selection (biology)|selection]] for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanaoka M, Droma Y, Basnyat B, Ito M, Kobayashi N, Katsuyama Y, Kubo K, Ota M |year=2012 |title=Genetic variants in EPAS1 contribute to adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Sherpas | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050566 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12|pages=e50566|pmid=23227185 |pmc=3515610|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050566|last2=Droma |last3=Basnyat |last4=Ito |last5=Kobayashi |last6=Katsuyama |last7=Kubo |last8=Ota |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750566H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant ''[[EPAS1]]'' gene could have been inherited from archaic [[hominin]]s, the [[Denisovans]].&lt;ref name="Huerta-Sanchez et al. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huerta-Sánchez|first1=Emilia |last2=Jin |first2=Xin |last3=Asan |last4=Bianba |first4=Zhuoma|last5=Peter|first5=Benjamin M. |last6=Vinckenbosch|first6=Nicolas|last7=Liang|first7=Yu|last8=Yi|first8=Xin|last9=He|first9=Mingze|last10=Somel|first10=Mehmet|last11=Ni|first11=Peixiang|last12=Wang|first12=Bo|last13=Ou|first13=Xiaohua|last14=Huasang|last15=Luosang|first15=Jiangbai|last16=Cuo|first16=Zha Xi Ping |last17=Li |first17=Kui |last18=Gao |first18=Guoyi |last19=Yin |first19=Ye |last20=Wang|first20=Wei |last21=Zhang |first21=Xiuqing |last22=Xu |first22=Xun|last23=Yang |first23=Huanming |last24=Li |first24=Yingrui |last25=Wang |first25=Jian |last26=Wang |first26=Jun |last27=Nielsen |first27=Rasmus |title=Altitude adaptation in Tibetans caused by introgression of Denisovan-like DNA |journal=Nature |date=2014 |volume=512 |issue=7513 |pages=194–197 |doi=10.1038/nature13408 |pmid=25043035 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..194H |display-authors=8 |pmc=4134395}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''EPAS1'' and ''EGLN1'' are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peng Y, Yang Z, Zhang H, Cui C, Qi X, Luo X, Tao X, Wu T, Ouzhuluobu, Basang, Ciwangsangbu, Danzengduojie, Chen H, Shi H, Su B|year=2011 |title=Genetic variations in Tibetan populations and high-altitude adaptation at the Himalayas | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/2/1075.full |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=28|issue=2|pages=1075–81|pmid=21030426 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq290|last2=Yang |last3=Zhang |last4=Cui |last5=Qi |last6=Luo |last7=Tao |last8=Wu |last13=Chen |last14=Shi |last15=Su }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage.

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, ''EGLN1'' appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.&lt;ref name=bigh /&gt; Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between ''EPAS1'' or ''EGLN1'' SNP [[genotype]]s and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bigham AW, Wilson MJ, Julian CG, Kiyamu M, Vargas E, Leon-Velarde F, Rivera-Chira M, Rodriquez C, Browne VA, Parra E, Brutsaert TD, Moore LG, Shriver MD |year=2013 |title=Andean and Tibetan patterns of adaptation to high altitude | journal=Am J Hum Biol|volume=25|issue=2|pages=190–197|pmid=23348729 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22358|last2=Wilson |last3=Julian |last4=Kiyamu |last5=Vargas |last6=Leon-Velarde |last7=Rivera-Chira |last8=Rodriquez |last9=Browne |last10=Parra |last11=Brutsaert |last12=Moore |last13=Shriver }}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou D, Udpa N, Ronen R, Stobdan T, Liang J, Appenzeller O, Zhao HW, Yin Y, Du Y, Guo L, Cao R, Wang Y, Jin X, Huang C, Jia W, Cao D, Guo G, Gamboa JL, Villafuerte F, Callacondo D, Xue J, Liu S, Frazer KA, Li Y, Bafna V, Haddad GG |title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders |journal=Am J Hum Genet |volume=93|issue=S0002–9297(13)00331–5 | pages=452–62|year=2013 |pmid=23954164 |pmc=3769925 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|last2=Udpa |last3=Ronen |last4=Stobdan |last5=Liang |last6=Appenzeller |last7=Zhao |last8=Yin |last9=Du |last10=Guo |last11=Cao |last12=Wang |last13=Jin |last14=Huang |last15=Jia |last16=Cao |last17=Guo |last18=Gamboa |last19=Villafuerte |last20=Callacondo |last21=Xue |last22=Liu |last23=Frazer |last24=Li |last25=Bafna |last26=Haddad }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10437-006-9000-7|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|pmid=|author=Pleurdeau D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|last2=Beall |last3=Witonsky |last4=Gebremedhin |last5=Pritchard |last6=Di Rienzo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''. Two of these genes (''THRB'' and ''ARNT2'') are known to play a role in the [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1 pathway]], a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies. This supports the concept that adaptation to high altitude arose independently among different highlanders as a result of [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scheinfeldt LB, Soi S, Thompson S, Ranciaro A, Woldemeskel D, Beggs W, Lambert C, Jarvis JP, Abate D, Belay G, Tishkoff SA|year=2012 |title=Genetic adaptation to high altitude in the Ethiopian highlands | url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110 |journal=Genome Biol |volume=13|issue=1|pages=R1 |pmid=22264333| pmc=3334582 |doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-1-r1|last2=Soi |last3=Thompson |last4=Ranciaro |last5=Woldemeskel |last6=Beggs |last7=Lambert |last8=Jarvis |last9=Abate |last10=Belay |last11=Tishkoff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hormonal contraception''' refers to [[birth control]] methods that act on the [[endocrine system]]. Almost all methods are composed of [[steroid hormones]], although in [[India]] one [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] is marketed as a contraceptive. The original hormonal method—the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]—was first marketed as a contraceptive in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Susan Scott Ricci |author2=Terri Kyle |year=2009 |chapter=Common Reproductive Issues|title=Contraception |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing decades many other delivery methods have been developed, although the oral and injectable methods are by far the most popular. Altogether, 18% of the world's contraceptive users rely on hormonal methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, Rachel K. |year=2011 |title= Beyond Birth Control: The Overlooked Benefits Of Oral Contraceptive Pills|journal=Guttmacher Institute |volume=November|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Beyond-Birth-Control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hormonal contraception is highly effective: when taken on the prescribed schedule, users of steroid hormone methods experience pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year. Perfect-use pregnancy rates for most hormonal contraceptives are usually around the 0.3% rate or less.&lt;ref name="npsnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/publications/nps_news/current/hormonal_contraception_tailoring_for_the_individual |title=NPS News 54: Hormonal contraceptives - tailoring for the individual |author=National Prescribing Service |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently available methods can only be used by women; the development of a [[male hormonal contraceptive]] is an active research area.

There are two main types of hormonal contraceptive formulations: ''combined methods'' which contain both an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and a [[progestin]], and ''progestogen-only methods'' which contain only [[progesterone]] or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). Combined methods work by suppressing [[ovulation]] and thickening [[cervical mucus]]; while progestogen-only methods reduce the frequency of ovulation, most of them rely more heavily on changes in cervical mucus. The incidence of certain side effects is different for the different formulations: for example, [[breakthrough bleeding]] is much more common with progestogen-only methods. Certain serious complications occasionally caused by estrogen-containing contraceptives are not believed to be caused by progestogen-only formulations: [[deep vein thrombosis]] is one example of this.

==Medical uses==
Hormonal contraception is primarily used for the prevention of [[pregnancy]], but is also prescribed for the treatment of [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], menstrual disorders such as [[dysmenorrhea]] and [[menorrhagia]], and [[hirsutism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hormonal Contraceptives Offer Benefits Beyond Pregnancy Prevention|url=http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2009/Hormonal_Contraceptives_Offer_Benefits_Beyond_Pregnancy_Prevention|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polycystic ovary syndrome===
Hormonal treatments, such as hormonal contraceptives, are frequently successful at alleviating symptoms associated with [[polycystic ovary syndrome]]. [[Birth control pills]] are often prescribed to reverse the effects of excessive [[androgen]] levels, and decrease ovarian hormone production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dysmenorrhea===
Hormonal birth control methods such as [[birth control pills]], the [[contraceptive patch]], [[vaginal ring]], [[contraceptive implant]], and [[hormonal IUD]] are used to treat cramping and pain associated with primary [[dysmenorrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noncontraceptive Benefits of Birth Control Pills|url=http://www.reproductivefacts.org/Noncontraceptive_Benefits_of_Birth_Control_Pills_factsheet/|work=Reproductivefacts.org|publisher=The American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dysmenorrhea|url=http://www.acog.org/~/media/For%20Patients/faq046.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20130509T0012463128|work=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menorrhagia===
[[Oral contraceptives]] are prescribed in the treatment of [[menorrhagia]] to help regulate menstrual cycles and prevent prolonged menstrual bleeding. The [[hormonal IUD]] ([[Mirena]]) releases [[levonorgestrel]] which thins the uterine lining, preventing excessive bleeding and loss of iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Menorrhagia (Heavy Menstrual Bleeding)|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/menorrhagia/DS00394/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs|work=The Mayo Clinic|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hirsutism===
Birth control pills are the most commonly prescribed hormonal treatment for [[hirsutism]], as they prevent [[ovulation]] and decrease [[androgen]] production by the [[ovaries]]. Additionally, [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] in the pills stimulates the liver to produce more of a protein that binds to androgens and reduces their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hirsutism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_Info_Booklets/hirsutismPCOS.pdf|work=American Society for Reproductive Medicine|accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===

==Side effects==

===Cancers===
*There is a mixed effect of combined hormonal contraceptives on the rates of various cancers, with the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) stating: "It was concluded that, if the reported association was causal, the excess risk for breast cancer associated with typical patterns of current use of combined oral contraceptives was very small."&lt;ref name=IARC99 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IARC2007&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] | work = IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans | volume = 91 | year = 2007 | title = Combined Estrogen-Progestogen Contraceptives | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | url = http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol91/mono91-6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also saying that "there is also conclusive evidence that these agents have a protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium":&lt;ref name=IARC99&gt;{{cite book | author=International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) | title=Oral Contraceptives, Combined | edition=Vol. 72 | year=1999 | chapter=5. Summary of Data Reported and Evaluation | chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-1.html | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The (IARC) notes that "the weight of the evidence suggests a small increase in the relative risk for breast cancer among current and recent users" which following discontinuation then lessens over a period of 10 years to similar rates as women who never used them, as well as "The increase in risk for breast cancer associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives in younger women could be due to more frequent contacts with doctors" &lt;ref name=IARC2007/&gt;
* Small increases are also seen in the rates of [[cervical cancer]] and [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|hepatocellular (liver) tumours]].
* [[Endometrial cancer|Endometrial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endometrial cancer and oral contraceptives: an individual participant meta-analysis of 27 276 women with endometrial cancer from 36 epidemiological studies|journal=Lancet|date=Aug 4, 2015|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00212-0|volume=16|pages=1061–1070|pmid=26254030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ovarian cancer]] risks are approximately halved and persists for at least 10 years after cessation of use; although "sequential oral contraceptives which were removed from the consumer market in the 1970s was associated with an increased risk for endometrial cancer".
* Studies have overall not shown effects on the relative risks for colorectal, malignant melanoma or thyroid cancers.
* Information on progesterone-only pills is less extensive, due to smaller sampling sizes, but they do not appear to significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=iarc72&gt;{{cite book |author=IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans |title=Hormonal contraception and post-menopausal hormonal therapy; IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans, Volume 72 |year=1999 |publisher=IARC Press |location=Lyon |isbn=92-832-1272-X |pages=339&amp;ndash;397 |chapter=Hormonal contraceptives, progestogens only |chapterurl=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol72/vol72-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most other forms of hormonal contraception are too new for meaningful data to be available, although risks and benefits are believed to be similar for methods which use the same hormones; e.g., risks for combined-hormone patches are thought to be roughly equivalent to those for combined-hormone pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate=2007-07-13| url=http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/Handouts/orthoevra_patch.html| title=McKinley Health Center, University of Illinois: OrthoEvra Contraceptive Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular disease===
Combined oral contraceptives can increase the risk of certain types of cardiovascular disease in women with a pre-existing condition or already-heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Smoking (for women over 35), metabolic conditions like diabetes, obesity and family history of heart disease are all risk factors which may be exacerbated by the use of certain hormonal contraceptives.&lt;ref name="npsnews" /&gt;

===Blood Clots===
Hormonal contraception methods are consistently linked with the risk of developing blood clots. However, the risk does vary depending on the hormone type or birth control method being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood Clots with Hormonal Contraception|url=http://www.hormonesmatter.com/blood-clots-hormonal-contraception/|website=Hormones Matter|date=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are two main classes of hormonal contraceptives: ''combined contraceptives'' contain both an estrogen (usually [[ethinylestradiol]]) and a [[progestin]]. ''Progestogen-only contraceptives'' contain only [[progesterone]] or a synthetic analogue (progestin). Also marketed is [[ormeloxifene]]; while not a hormone, ormeloxifene acts on the hormonal system to prevent pregnancy.

===Combined===
The most popular form of hormonal contraception, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is known colloquially as ''the pill''. It is taken once a day, most commonly for 21 days followed by a seven-day break, although other regimens are also used. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, COCPs may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]: this is known as the [[Yuzpe regimen]]. COCPs are available in [[oral contraceptive formulations|a variety of formulations]].

The [[contraceptive patch]] is applied to the skin and worn continuously. A series of three patches are worn for one week each, and then the user takes a one-week break. [[NuvaRing]] is worn inside the vagina. A ring is worn for three weeks. After removal, the user takes a one-week break before inserting a new ring. As with COCPs, other regimens may be used with the contraceptive patch or NuvaRing to provide [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraception]].

Some [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s can be administered as one injection per month.

===Progestogen-only===
The [[progestogen only pill]] (POP) is taken once per day within the same three-hour window. [[Oral contraceptive formulations#Progestogen only pills|Several different formulations]] of POP are marketed. A low-dose formulation is known as ''the minipill''. Unlike COCPs, progestogen-only pills are taken every day with no breaks or placebos. For women not using ongoing hormonal contraception, progestogen-only pills may be taken after intercourse as [[emergency contraception]]. There are a number of [[Emergency contraceptive availability by country|dedicated products]] sold for this purpose.

Hormonal intrauterine contraceptives are known as [[intrauterine system]]s (IUS) or Intrauterine Devices (IUD). An IUS/IUD must be inserted by a health professional. The copper IUD does not contain hormones. While a copper-containing IUD may be used as emergency contraception, the IUS has not been studied for this purpose.

[[Depo Provera]] is an injection that provides three months of contraceptive protection. Noristerat is another injection; it is given every two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stacey |first=Dawn |title=Noristerat Injection |work=About.com |date=2009-07-28 |url=http://contraception.about.com/od/prescriptionoptions/g/Noristerat.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Contraceptive implants]] are inserted under the skin of the upper arm, and contain progesterone only. [[Jadelle]] (Norplant 2) consists of two rods that release a low dose of hormones. It is effective for five years. Nexplanon has replaced the former [[Implanon]] and is also a single rod that releases etonogestrel (similar to the body's natural progesterone). The only difference between Implanon and Nexplanon is Nexplanon is radio opaque and can be detected by x-ray. This is needed for cases of implant migration. It is effective for three years and is usually done in office. It is over 99% effective. It works in 3 ways: 
1. Prevents ovulation- usually an egg does not mature
2. thickens cervical mucus so to prevent sperm from reaching the egg
3. If those 2 fail, the last is the progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to be too thin for implantation.

===Ormeloxifene===
[[Ormeloxifene]] is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] (SERM). Marketed as Centchroman, Centron, or Saheli, it is pill that is taken once per week. Ormeloxifene is legally available only in [[India]].&lt;ref name="centron"/&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
The effect of hormonal agents on the reproductive system is complex. It is believed that combined hormonal contraceptives work primarily by preventing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. Progestogen-only contraceptives can also prevent ovulation, but rely more significantly on the thickening of cervical mucus. Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation, and its mechanism of action is not well understood.

===Combined===
Combined hormonal contraceptives were developed to prevent [[ovulation]] by suppressing the release of [[gonadotropin]]s. They inhibit [[follicular phase|follicular development]] and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Anita L.|last2=Cwiak|first2=Carrie|year=2011|chapter=Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)|editor1-last=Hatcher|editor1-first=Robert A.|editor2-last=Trussell|editor2-first=James|editor3-last=Nelson|editor3-first=Anita L.|editor4-last=Cates|editor4-first=Willard Jr.|editor5-last=Kowal|editor5-first=Deborah|editor6-last=Policar|editor6-first=Michael S.

There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. Cycle control is enhanced by the estrogen.&lt;br/&gt;Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speroff|first1=Leon|last2=Darney|first2=Philip D.|year=2011|chapter=Oral contraception|title=A clinical guide for contraception|edition=5th|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|pages=19–152|isbn=978-1-60831-610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levin|first=Ellis R.|last2=Hammes|first2=Stephen R.|year=2011|chapter=Estrogens and progestins|editor1-last=Brunton|editor1-first=Laurence L.|editor2-last=Chabner|editor2-first=Bruce A.|editor3-last=Knollmann|editor3-first=Björn C.|title=Goodman &amp; Gilman's pharmacological basis of therapeutics|edition=12th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|pages=1163–1194|isbn=978-0-07-162442-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glasier|first=Anna|year=2010|chapter=Contraception|editor1-last=Jameson|editor1-first=J.

Progestogen [[negative feedback]] decreases the pulse frequency of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) release by the [[hypothalamus]], which decreases the release of [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and greatly decreases the release of [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) by the [[anterior pituitary]]. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in [[estradiol]] levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen [[positive feedback]] on LH release prevent a [[menstrual cycle|mid-cycle]] LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Estrogen was originally included in oral contraceptives for better cycle control (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby reduce the incidence of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speroff 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin 2011"/&gt;

Another primary mechanism of action of all progestogen-containing contraceptives is inhibition of [[spermatozoon|sperm]] penetration through the [[cervix]] into the upper [[female reproductive system (human)|genital tract]] ([[uterus]] and [[fallopian tube]]s) by decreasing the amount of and increasing the [[viscosity]] of the [[cervical mucus]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

The estrogen and progestogen in combined hormonal contraceptives have other effects on the reproductive system, but these have not been shown to contribute to their contraceptive efficacy:&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;
* Slowing tubal motility and ova transport, which may interfere with [[human fertilization|fertilization]].
* [[Endometrium|Endometrial]] atrophy and alteration of [[metalloproteinase]] content, which may impede sperm motility and viability, or theoretically inhibit [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].
* Endometrial edema, which may affect implantation.

Insufficient evidence exists on whether changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation. The primary mechanisms of action are so effective that the possibility of fertilization during combined hormonal contraceptive use is very small. Since pregnancy occurs despite endometrial changes when the primary mechanisms of action fail, endometrial changes are unlikely to play a significant role, if any, in the observed effectiveness of combined hormonal contraceptives.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2011"/&gt;

===Progestogen-only===
The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the [[progestogen]] activity and dose.&lt;ref name="Glasier 2010"/&gt;

Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives include traditional progestogen-only pills, the subdermal implant [[Jadelle]] and the [[intrauterine system]] Mirena. These contraceptives inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the [[cervical mucus]] and thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration.

Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant [[Implanon]]), allow some follicular development but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with low dose progestogens.

High dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables [[Depo-Provera]] and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low dose and intermediate dose progestogens.

In [[anovulation|anovulatory cycles]] using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).

===Ormeloxifene===
Ormeloxifene does not affect ovulation. It has been shown to increase the rate of [[blastocyst]] development and to increase the speed at which the blastocyst is moved from the [[fallopian tube]]s into the uterus. Ormeloxifene also suppresses proliferation and [[decidualization]] of the [[endometrium]] (the transformation of the endometrium in preparation for possible implantation of an embryo).&lt;ref name="centron"&gt;{{cite web |title=Centchroman |work=Reproductive Health Online |year=2003 |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/1fp/1advances/old/1centch/ceorvw.htm |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are believed to prevent [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] rather than [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], exactly how these effects operate to prevent pregnancy is not understood.

==Frequency of use==
Pills—combined and progestogen-only—are the most common form of hormonal contraception. Worldwide, they account for 12% of contraceptive use. 21% of users of reversible contraceptives choose COCPs or POPs. Pills are especially popular in more developed countries, where they account for 25% of contraceptive use.&lt;!--

In 1921, [[Ludwig Haberlandt]] demonstrated a temporary hormonal contraception in a female rabbit by transplanting ovaries from a second, pregnant, animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Müller-Jahncke WD | title = Ludwig Haberlandt (1885-1932) and the development of hormonal contraception | language = German| journal = Z Gesamte Inn Med | volume = 43 | issue = 15 | pages = 420–2 | date = Aug 1988 | pmid = 3051743 | url = | laysummary = | oclc = | id = | bibcode = | accessdate = | location = GERMANY, EAST | laydate = | format = | quote = | publisher = | issn = 0044-2542 | laysource = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, scientists had isolated and determined the structure of the [[steroid hormones]] and found that high doses of [[androgens]], [[estrogen]]s, or [[progesterone]] inhibited [[ovulation]].&lt;!--

In 1957 [[Enovid]], the first COCP, was approved in the [[United States]] for the treatment of menstrual disorders. In 1960, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved an application that allowed Enovid to be marketed as a contraceptive.&lt;!--

Combined contraceptives have also been made available in a variety of forms. In the 1960s a few [[combined injectable contraceptive]]s were introduced, notably Injectable Number 1 in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and Deladroxate in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Research and regulatory approval (of injectable contraceptives) |journal=Population Reports |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=1995-08-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-17773564/research-and-regulatory-approval.html |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third combined injection, Cyclo-Provera, was reformulated in the 1980s by lowering the dose and renamed Cyclofem (also called Lunelle).

In 1991, [[ormeloxifene]] was introduced as a contraceptive in [[India]].&lt;ref name="pmid11410933"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singh MM | title = Centchroman, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, as a contraceptive and for the management of hormone-related clinical disorders | journal = Medical Research Reviews | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 302–47 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11410933 | doi = 10.1002/med.1011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it acts on the estrogen hormonal system, it is atypical in that it is a [[selective estrogen receptor modulator]] rather than an estrogen, and has the capacity for both estrogenic and [[antiestrogen]]ic effects.&lt;ref name="pmid11410933" /&gt;

The '''Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia''' ('''HILDA''')  [[statistical survey|survey]] is an Australian household-based [[panel study]] which began in 2001. It has been used for examining issues such as the incidence of persistent poverty; assets and income in the transition to retirement; the correlates and impact of changes in physical and mental health; and an international comparison of wealth and happiness. The survey is widely used by Australian and international researchers in the fields of [[economics]], [[social science]] and [[social policy]] and by the [[Australian Government]]. The HILDA survey is managed by a small team from [[the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] and the national fieldwork is carried out by [[ACNielsen]] and [[Roy Morgan Research]]. The survey is funded by the Australian Government through the [[Department of Social Services (Australia)|Department of Social Services]].

HILDA has the following key features: 

*It collects information about [[economic]] and subjective [[quality of life|well-being]], [[labor market|labour market]] dynamics and family dynamics. 
*Special questionnaire modules are included each wave and have covered topics such as [[wealth]], [[retirement]] and [[fertility]] intentions. 
*The wave 1 panel consisted of 7,682 [[households]] and 19,914 individuals. In wave 11 this was topped up with an additional 2,153 households and 5,477 individuals
*Interviews are conducted annually with all adult members of each household. Children are interviewed once they turn 15.
*The panel members are followed over time. 
*Funding has been guaranteed for 18 waves, and the survey is expected to continue beyond wave 18.
*Data releases occur at the start of December. The release in December 2017 was for data collected from 2001 (wave 1) to 2016 (wave 16).

HILDA data, when weighted, describe the Australian population (excluding those not living in households). The datasets ([[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]] and [[Stata]] files) are available for legitimate research purposes and application can be made from the HILDA website. The data are confidentialised by suppression of geographic and other identifying information. A bibliography of published research, the survey [[methodology]], the [[questionnaires]] and a user manual are available from the HILDA website.

HILDA data are integrated into the [[Cross-National Equivalent File]] (CNEF) which contains population panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, Switzerland, Russia and the United States.

'''Limbitless Solutions''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in the [[United States]] that uses additive manufacturing ([[3D printing]]) to advance affordable personalized bionics and [[prostheses|prosthetic]] partial arms for children with disabilities.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/about-us/ Our Limitless Mission] Our Limitless Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The organization claims their limbitless’ bionic arms are manufactured for under $400, 1% of traditional prostheses.&lt;ref name=" Huffington Post "&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSNyjnVQScA Huffington Post] Huffington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[Orlando, Florida]],&lt;ref name=" Florida Department of State Division of Corporations"&gt;[http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=Initial&amp;searchNameOrder=LIMBITLESSSOLUTIONS%20N140000094090&amp;aggregateId=domnp-n14000009409-652f57c1-6b2b-4470-b04d-9753bc6a0e67&amp;searchTerm=limbitless%20solutions&amp;listNameOrder=LIMBITLESSSOLUTIONS%20N140000094090 Florida Department of State Division of Corporations] Florida Department of State Division of Corporations&lt;/ref&gt; the organization was founded by a team of [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, led by executive director Albert Manero.&lt;ref name="Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives"&gt;[http://www.ucf.edu/pegasus/kid-approved Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives] Kid-Approved How one prosthetic arm is changing many lives&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

As [[University of Central Florida]] engineering students, the Limbitless Solutions team began the first project at the [[university]] campus manufacturing lab in 2014. The organization used a donated [[Stratasys]] Dimension 3D Printer and other supplies to create an affordable prosthetic, to minimize cost and time of traditional manufacturing processes like [[CNC milling]].&lt;ref name=" Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm "&gt;[http://blog.stratasys.com/2015/08/05/3d-printed-prosthetic-arm/ Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm] Stratasys, 3d printed prosthetic arm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/health/ucf-3d-printed-arms-for-kids/ CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids] CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids&lt;/ref&gt; Built in the student's free time, their first arm used a 3D printer running with off-the-shelf [[servos]] and batteries that were activated by the [[electromyography]] muscle energy on a child’s limb.&lt;ref name=" UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm "&gt;[http://today.ucf.edu/fulfilling-6-year-olds-dream-ucf-students-design-build-arm/ UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm] UCF, Fulfilling 6 years olds dream ucf students design build arm&lt;/ref&gt; Most prosthetic arms are [[machine (mechanical)|mechanical]], which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their [[biceps]].&lt;ref name=" CNN, UCF 3D printed arms for kids "/&gt;

== Production ==

When producing a prosthesis, the child is measured (size of residual limb, length of limb, etc.) and the model of the arm is then appropriately scaled and adjusted before being printed, assembled, and fitted. [[Electromyography]] (EMG) sensors are calibrated before the arm is ready for use.&lt;ref name="What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless"&gt;[http://limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421094737/http://www.limbitless-solutions.org/faqs/ |date=2015-04-21 }} What is the general process of making an arm FAQ Limbitless&lt;/ref&gt;
The time to fabricate one bionic arm ranges depending on several factors, the most influential being the type of [[amputation]]. The time to build a helper hand is 4–6 weeks, and a bionic arm without an elbow is 8–12 weeks. In addition to partial arms, Limbitless has said it has plans to make full arms with elbows as well as legs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6074">The '''lining of paintings'''  is a process of restoration used to strengthen,  flatten or consolidate  oil or tempera paintings on canvas by attaching a new canvas to the back of the existing one.The process is sometimes referred to as relining. In cases of extreme decay, the original canvas may be completely removed and replaced.

==Purpose==
The purpose of lining a painting is to flatten or consolidate its surface or strengthen its support by attaching a new canvas to the back of the existing one.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; The process has sometimes been referred to as relining.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; In cases of extreme decay, the original layer canvas may be completely removed, and the new canvas fixed to the priming on the reverse of the paint layer.&lt;ref name=fielding/&gt;

Lining has been very widely practiced, and during the 19th century, some painters had their works lined immediately after, or sometimes even before, completion.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt; There have been some doubts concerning its benefits more recently, especially since the Greenwich Comparative Lining Conference of 1974.&lt;ref name=hackney&gt;{{cite web|title=Tate Papers – Paintings on Canvas: Lining and Alternatives |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7412 |publisher=Tate Gallery|author=Hackney, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
The procedure as carried out in the 19th century is described by [[Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding|Theodore Henry Fielding]] in his ''Knowledge and Restoration of Old Paintings'' (1847). The picture was removed from the stretcher and laid on a flat surface.  The edges of the canvas were trimmed,  leaving the original support  smaller than the new lining. A sheet of paper covered in thin paste was laid on the surface of the painting, which was then placed face-down on a board or table. The back of the picture was then coated with paste, copal varnish, or a glue made from cheese. The new lining canvas was pressed down onto the back of the picture by hand;  then the outer edges of the lining cloth were fastened to the table by means of a large number of tacks, and a piece of wood with a rounded edge was passed over the back of the cloth, to ensure perfect adhesion.  When the glue had dried sufficiently, the lining was smoothed with a moderately hot iron. Fielding cautions that "the greatest care must be taken that the hand does not stop for an instant, or the mark of the iron will be so impressed on the painting, that nothing can obliterate it." The picture was then nailed to a new stretcher, and the paper was washed off with a sponge and cold water.&lt;ref name=fielding&gt;{{cite book|first=Theodore Henry|last= Fielding|title=Knowledge and Restoration of Old Paintings |location=London|year=1847|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/download/The_Knowledge_and_Restoration_of_Old_Pai.pdf?id=n8hAAAAAYAAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0YWE3oRKsOgru4rR6CmEv5v-HthQ|publisher=R. Ackermann &amp; Co| pages=56–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fielding also describes the process for the complete removal and replacement of the canvas. In this, the picture was covered with paper, as if for lining, then fastened to a board or table, after which the old cloth was rubbed away with a small rasp with very fine teeth; when the restorer had gone "as far as may be prudent", the remainder of the cloth could be taken off with a [[pumice stone]], until the ground on which the picture was painted became visible. It was then ready to receive its new cloth, which had previously been covered with [[copal varnish]], glue, or paste. In this procedure, the hot iron was not used.&lt;ref name=fielding/&gt;

The use of hand-ironing is liable to produce a flattening of [[impasto]]. This problem was mitigated by the introduction in the 1950s of vacuum hot-table processes, designed for use with wax-resin adhesives, which exerted a more even pressure on the paint surface; however the longer periods of heating and high temperatures involved often led to other types of textural alteration.&lt;ref name=ackroyd&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ackroyd, Paul|title=The Structural Conservation of Canvas Paintings: Changes in Attitude and Practice since the Early 1970's|journal= Reviews in Conservation|issue=3|year= 2002|pages=3–14|url=http://www.viks.sk/chk/revincon13.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wax-based adhesives seem to have been in use for lining from the 18th century, although the earliest well-documented case of their employment is in the lining of Rembrandt's ''[[The Night Watch|Night Watch]]'' in 1851. Although, initially, pure [[beeswax]] was used, mixtures incorporating resins such as [[dammar]] and mastic, or balsams such as Venice turpentine, were soon found preferable.&lt;ref name=bomford/&gt; During the 20th century, it came to be realised that the impregnation of the paint layer with wax could have deleterious effects, including darkening of the picture, especially where canvas or ground were exposed.&lt;ref name=bomford&gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Gallery Technical Bulletin|volume=5|year=1981|title=Wax-Resin Lining and Colour Change: An Evaluation|first1=David|last1= Bomford|first2= Sarah|last2= Staniforth|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/technical-bulletin/bomforth_staniforth1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although experiments with synthetic fabrics were carried out during the 1960s and 1970s, traditional linen cloths are still usually used for lining.&lt;ref name=ackroyd/&gt; However [[polyester]] canvas is often used for strip-lining, where only the edges of the painting are backed, and for loose-lining, in which no adhesive is used. This latter technique helps protect the painting from atmospheric pollution, but does not flatten or consolidate the paint surface.&lt;ref name=hackney/&gt;

'''Mud''' is a liquid or semi-liquid mixture of [[water]] and any combination of different kinds of [[soil]] ([[loam]], [[silt]], and [[clay]]). It usually forms after rainfall or near water sources. Ancient mud deposits harden over geological time to form sedimentary rock such as [[shale]] or [[mudstone]] (generally called [[lutite]]s). When geological deposits of mud are formed in [[estuaries]], the resultant layers are termed [[bay mud]]s.

=== Adhesive ===
In the [[construction]] industry, mud is a semi-fluid material that can be used to coat, seal, or adhere materials. Depending on the composition of the mud, it can be referred by many different names, including [[slurry]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], [[plaster]], [[stucco]], and [[concrete]].

Mud, [[Cob (material)|cob]], [[adobe]], [[clay]], and many other names are historically used synonymously to mean a mixture of [[subsoil]] and water possibly with the addition of stones, gravel, straw, lime, and/or bitumen. This material was used a variety of ways to build walls, floors and even roofs. For thousands of years it was common in most parts of the world to build walls using [[mudbrick]]s or the [[wattle and daub]], [[rammed earth]] or [[cob (material)|cob]] techniques and cover the surfaces with [[earthen plaster]].

==== Mudbrick ====
{{Main|Mudbrick}}
[[File:Amran.jpg|right|thumb|Mud house in Amran, [[Yemen]]]]
Mud can be made into mud bricks, also called [[adobe]], by mixing mud with water, placing the mixture into [[molding (process)|moulds]] and then allowing it to dry in open air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourhome.gov.au/materials/mud-brick|title=Mud brick|first=|last=admin_666|date=29 July 2013|work=yourhome.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw is sometimes used as a binder within the bricks, as it adds a support lattice. When the brick would otherwise break, the straw will redistribute the force throughout the brick, decreasing the chance of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. ''The Cobber’s Companion: How to Build Your Own Earthen Home''. Cottage Grove: Cob Cottage, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such buildings must be protected from groundwater, usually by building upon a masonry, fired brick, rock or rubble foundation, and also from wind-driven rain in damp climates, usually by deep roof overhangs. In extremely dry climates a well drained flat roof may be protected with a well-prepared ([[Puddling (engineering)|puddled]]) and properly maintained dried mud coating, viable as the mud will expand when moistened and so become more water resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/5-adobe-buildings.htm|title=Preservation Brief 5: Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings|work=nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe mudbricks were commonly used by the [[Pueblo]] Indians to build their homes and other necessary structures.

==== Fired brick ====
Mud that is mostly clay, or a mixture of clay and sand may be used for [[ceramic]]s, of which one form is the common fired [[brick]]. Fired brick are more durable but consume much more energy to produce.

==== Stabilized mud ====
Stabilized mud (earth, soil) is mud which has had a binder such as cement or bitumen added. Examples are [[mudcrete]], landcrete, and [[soil cement]].

== Pottery ==
{{Main|Pottery}}

Pottery is made by forming a [[List of pottery terms#Clay body|clay body]] into objects of a required shape and heating them to high temperatures in a [[kiln]] which removes all the water from the [[clay]], which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be [[Pottery#Decorating and glazing|decorated]] before or after firing. Prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. [[List of pottery terms#K|Kneading]] helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished by a machine called a vacuum [[List of pottery terms#pug|pug]] or manually by [[List of pottery terms#W|wedging]]. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping it is dried and then fired.

In ceramics, the making of liquid mud (called [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]]) is a stage in the process of refinement of the materials, since larger particles will settle from the liquid.

== Habitat ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}

=== Land ===
Mud can provide a home for numerous types of animals, including varieties of [[worm]]s, [[frog]]s, [[snail]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[crayfish]]. Other animals, such as [[hippopotamus]]es, [[pig]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[water buffalo]] and [[elephant]]s, bathe in mud in order to cool off and protect themselves from the [[sun]]. Submerged mud can be home to [[larvae]] of various [[insects]].

=== Marine life ===
Mud plays an important role in the [[marine ecosystem]]. The activities of burrowing animals and fish have a dramatic churning effect on muddy seabeds. This allows the exchange and cycling of oxygen, nutrients, and minerals between water and sediment.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A summary of the ‘Burrowed Mud’ MPA search feature. (n.d.). Retrieved January 13, 2015, from http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4-c-IWKEf1kJ:www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0039/00394205.doc &amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the surface, the burrows of some species form intricate lattice-like networks and may penetrate a meter or more downwards. This means that the burrowed mud is a productive habitat, providing food and shelter for a wide range of mud-dwellers and other animals that forage in and over the mud.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Problems ==
[[File:Glenwood mud slide (6089986106).jpg|thumb|A landslide on a railroad]]
Mud can pose problems for motor traffic when moisture is present, because every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface, so a layer of mud on the surface of the road or tires can cause the vehicle to [[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]].

Heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or high levels of ground water may trigger a movement of soil or sediments, possibly causing [[mudslides]], [[landslides]], [[rockslide|avalanches]], or [[sinkholes]].

Mudslides in volcanic terrain (called [[lahar]]s) occur after eruptions as rain remobilizes loose ash deposits.&lt;ref&gt;"Mud on the Move." Earth: The Definitive Visual Guide. London: Dorling Kindersley, 2013. 98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mudslides]] are also common in the western United States during [[El Niño]] years due to prolonged rainfall.

== As food ==
[[File:Pohnpeian kava (32834047675).jpg|thumb|A bowl of [[kava]] tea.]]
There are numerous [[dysphemism]]s for poor-tasting food such as "tastes like dirt". [[Kava]] tea is often described this way, as it is bitter, brown, and contains sediments. 

There also exist children's recipes for "mud", which is generally a chocolate or cornstarch-based sludge used more for visual appeal than actual taste. Never does this confectionery mud actually contain real mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookadvice.com/recipes/magic_mud-36597-recipe.htm |title=Magic mud food recipe – Magic mud ingredients &amp; cooking | publisher=Cookadvice.com | date=2 September 2012 | accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophagia===
{{main|Geophagia}}
The practice of eating earth or soil-like substances is geophagia.

== Recreation ==

=== Mud bath ===
{{Main|Mud bath}}
A mud bath is a bath of mud, commonly from areas where hot spring water can combine with volcanic ash. Mud baths have existed for thousands of years, and can be found now in high-end spas in many countries of the world.

=== Mud wallow ===

Mud wallows are a common source of entertainment for kids. Mud wallows can be any shape, size, depth and some can have water as well as mud. Usually wallows are shallow dips in the ground that have been flooded and were full of dirt and those two have mixed to make a squishy mud wallow.

=== Mudding ===
{{Main|Mud bogging}}
Mud bogging is a form of off-road motorsport popular in Canada and the United States in which the goal is to drive a vehicle through a pit of mud or a track of a set length. Winners are determined by the distance traveled through the pit. However, if several vehicles are able to travel the entire length, the time taken to traverse the pit will determine the winner.

=== Mud run ===
Mud runs are a popular activity involving mud.  Participants run a distance of 3 miles to as long as 10 miles, while crawling through mud bogs, and battling other obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toughmudder.com|title=Mud Run – Obstacle Races – Tough Mudder|work=Tough Mudder|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerebrun.com|title=Cerebrun – Get Mental|work=Cerebrun|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriordash.com|title=Warrior Dash – The World's Largest Obstacle Race Series|work=Warrior Dash|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
* Mud is used in mud wrestling as a form of entertainment.
* Mud can be used in a [[dunk tank]].
* [[Dirt biking]] involves biking through muddy tracks and courses.
* [[Baseball Rubbing Mud]] is used to remove the sheen from new baseballs.

[[File:Oxalis Triangularis Photonasty Timelapse.ogv|thumb|right|300px|Photonastic movement of ''[[Oxalis triangularis]]'' in response to light. At lowered light levels the leaves fold down; timelapse recorded at ~750x actual speed and covering a 1.5 hr period of time.]]

'''Nastic movements''' are non-directional [[Stimulus (psychology)|responses]] to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (e.g. [[temperature]], [[humidity]], light [[irradiance]]), and are usually associated with [[plant]]s. The movement can be due to changes in [[turgor]] or changes in growth . Nastic movements differ from [[Tropism|tropic movements]] in that the direction of tropic responses depends on the direction of the stimulus, whereas the direction of nastic movements is independent of the stimulus's position. The tropic movement is growth movement but nastic movement may or may not be growth movement. The rate or [[frequency]] of these responses increases as intensity of the stimulus increases. An example of such a response is the opening and closing of flowers (photonastic response), movement of euglena, chlamydomonas towards the source of light. They are named with the suffix "-nasty" and have prefixes that depend on the stimuli:
* Epinasty: downward-bending from growth at the top, for example, the bending down of a heavy flower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://botanydictionary.org/epinasty.html epinasty - Dictionary of botany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hyponastic response|Hyponasty]]
* Photonasty: response to light
* [[Nyctinasty]]: movements at night or in the dark
* Chemonasty: response to chemicals or nutrients
* Hydronasty: response to water
* Thermonasty: response to temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermonasty in Tulip and Crocus Flowers|url = http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/1/65|journal = Journal of Experimental Botany|date = 1953-01-01|issn = 0022-0957|pages = 65–77|volume = 4|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/jxb/4.1.65|language = en|first = W. M. L.|last = Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geonasty/gravinasty: response to gravity
* [[Thigmonasty]]/seismonasty/haptonasty: response to contact

The suffix may come from Greek νάσσω = "I press", ναστός = "pressed", ἐπιναστια = "the condition of being pressed upon".

The '''National Churches Trust''', formerly the '''Historic Churches Preservation Trust''', is a British [[Charitable organization#United Kingdom|registered charity]] whose aim is "promoting and supporting church buildings of historic, architectural and community value across the UK".&lt;ref name=whoweare&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/who-we-are.php | title = About us| accessdate = 28 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It carries out this aim by providing financial grants to repair and modernise church buildings, supporting projects to enable churches to remain open, collaborating with local Churches Trusts and volunteer bodies, providing practical advice, support and information, and working to promote public awareness of the needs of churches.  Its forerunner was the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, whose  functions it has taken over, together with those of the Incorporated Church Building Society.&lt;ref name=whoweare/&gt;

==History==

By the middle of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, the fabric of many British church buildings was in a poor state of repair.  This had followed socioeconomic changes in the late 19th and early 20th&amp;nbsp;centuries, including population changes, followed by neglect during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  Matters came to a head in 1950 with public statements, including an [[editorial]] in ''[[The Times]]''.  About this time the [[Pilgrim Trust]] declared that it was ceasing to give grants for repairs to individual churches.&lt;ref name=ch108&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|pp=108–111.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church of England Assembly (now the [[General Synod of the Church of England]]) established the Repair of Churches Commission to decide what should be done about the problem.  This resulted in the creation of the Historic Churches Preservation Trust, which was registered as a charity in 1953.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;&lt;ref name=ch108/&gt;  Its first Secretary and Executive Committee Chairman was [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas]], a [[Conservatism|Conservative]] politician, the role of Secretary being taken over later in 1953 by Hugh Llewellyn Jones.  In order to ensure that the grants it gave were appropriate, local advisory panels of architects were established, later replaced by the Committee of Honorary Consultant Architects, who continued to advise the Trust until 2002.  At the time of its foundation, it was estimated that a total of £4 million was necessary to fulfil its aims.  Money was raised in a variety of ways, including appeals on radio and television, exhibitions, concerts, individual and corporate donations, and a benefit dinner.  Support was received from charitable trusts, including the Pilgrim Trust, the Dulverton Trust, the [[Manifold Trust]], and the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]].&lt;ref name=hcpt&gt;{{Citation | url = | title = Keeping Churches Alive — a brief history of the Trust| accessdate = | publisher = Historic Churches Preservation Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of its creation, the Trust gave grants for the repair of both active and [[redundant church|redundant]] churches, although the care of redundant churches was strictly beyond its remit.  In 1960 the Bridges Commission recommended that "a new fund be set up under a new Pastoral Measure to preserve churches of acknowledged historic or architectural worth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|p=227.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pastoral Measure of 1968 led to the creation of the Redundant Churches Fund (later the [[Churches Conservation Trust]]), which provided money from both the Church of England and the State for the preservation of redundant churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|2006|pp=227–229.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1984 to raise the first £4&amp;nbsp;million.  After that the size of donations tended to be larger. and by the end of 2005 a total of over £27&amp;nbsp;million had been raised.  In 2000 alone over £2.2&amp;nbsp;million was received.  The size of grants made to churches has varied greatly.  Up to 2005 the smallest grant had been £33&amp;nbsp;4[[Shilling|s]]&amp;nbsp;4[[Penny|d]] to a church in [[Mileham]], [[Norfolk]], in 1957, and the largest grants were of £100,000 each to a church in [[Portsea, Portsmouth]], [[Hampshire]], in 2000, and to [[Selby Abbey]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  The criterion for the award of a grant was "for essential repairs to any place of worship (with the exception of cathedrals) over 100 years old which is of a recognized Christian denomination and is open for public worship".&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt; Initially available only to churches in England, the scheme was extended to churches and chapels in Wales in 1987.  The decision to award a grant is made by the Trust's Grants committee.  Some of the churches that have been helped are now closed and have been declared [[redundant church|redundant]].  These are now cared for by the [[Churches Conservation Trust]].  In 1983 the Historic Churches Preservation Trust took over the management of the Incorporated Church Building Society.  This had been founded in 1818 to assist [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches of any age, sometimes giving grants for new churches.    In the early 1990s a Friends' scheme was instituted.  In 2006 the Trust took over the functions of the Open Churches Trust.&lt;ref name=hcpt/&gt;  The Historic Churches Preservation Trust was succeeded by the National Churches Trust in 2007.&lt;ref name=whoweare/&gt;

==Present day==

The National Churches Trust is a registered charity.  The full definition of its objectives and activities are "to promote the conservation, repair, maintenance, improvement, and reconstruction of churches (to mean any recognised Christian places of worship, chapel or meeting house in the UK), and of such monuments, fittings, stained glass, furniture, organs, bells, in such churches and to promote the building, development of churches in the United Kingdom".&lt;ref name=charity&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1119845&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0| title = The National Churches Trust| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = [[Charity Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the year ending 31 December 2009 its income was £1,895,258, of which 87.4% came from voluntary sources, and it spent £2,712,564, of which 89.4% was used for its charitable activities.  It employed eight people.&lt;ref name=charity/&gt;  The Trust is managed by a board of Trustees, and decisions to award grants are decided by the Grants Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/our-people.php | title = Our People and Partners| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grants of £10,000 and above are made for urgent structural repairs, and grants of between £5,000 and £25,000 are made towards the installation of facilities for such functions as toilets and catering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/supporting-you/grants/overview.php| title = Our Grants Programme| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120215013949/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/supporting-you/grants/overview.php| archivedate = 15 February 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2005, the Trust has distributed over £9&amp;nbsp;million to over 1,000 churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/statistics-and-key-facts.php| title = Key Facts| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110926024838/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/statistics-and-key-facts.php| archivedate = 26 September 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It supports church buildings of any denomination that are members of [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]], and covers the whole of the United Kingdom.  It does not own churches, and does not support [[redundant church]]es.  It receives no funding from the Government or from church authorities.  Its income is derived from individual donations, and from parishes, Trusts and Foundations, and from investment income.  As of 2011 the Trust is not contributing towards the building of new places of worship.  The Trust works in conjunction with a network of Local Churches Trusts that cover most of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =http://nationalchurchestrust.org/about-us/faqs/faq.php#49 | title = Frequently Asked Questions| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public can become a Friend of the National Churches Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url = http://nationalchurchestrust.org/how-you-can-help/donate.php| title = How you can help| accessdate = 30 June 2011| publisher = National Churches Trust| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110830084843/http://nationalchurchestrust.org/how-you-can-help/donate.php| archivedate = 30 August 2011| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 BBC journalist [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] was appointed as Vice-President of the trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalchurchestrust.org/news/huw-edwards-appointed-vice-president]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 the trust launched an online competition, ''Sacred Wales - Cymru Sanctaidd'', to find the favourite church or chapel in Wales from a list of 50 buildings suggested by religious and heritage organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search is on for Wales’ favourite church/chapel|url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/news/2017/07/search-is-on-for-wales-favourite-churchchapel/|website=The Church in Wales|accessdate=13 August 2017|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was devised to "celebrate and raise awareness of Wales’ religious heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Wales: Vote for Your Favourite Church or Chapel|url=https://rcahmw.gov.uk/sacred-wales-vote-for-your-favourite-church-or-chapel/|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=13 August 2017|date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Green Corps''' is a programme of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] of [[Government of India]] covering around 1,20,000 schools in [[India]] with [[NGC School Eco Clubs]]. Environmental activity in schools in India is promoted through the National Green Corps. Each NGC School Eco Club has 30 to 50 NGC Students or NGC Cadets who form the National Green Corps. These NGC Students participate in activities related to [[Biodiversity conservation|Biodiversity Conservation]], [[Water conservation|Water Conservation]], [[Energy conservation|Energy Conservation]], [[Waste management|Waste Management]] and [[Land use planning|Land Use Planning]] and [[Resource management|Resource Management]]. Locale specific issues are focused by the NGC Eco Clubs. When young girls and boys from NGC take up the [[environmental awareness]] activities and [[outreach]] activities, they attract huge public attention which eventually becomes public support for an environmental cause or environmental intervention. Water Harvesting, Plantation, [[Composting]] of [[biodegradable waste]] are most popular activities in the NGC School Eco Clubs. These NGC School Eco Clubs promote [[environmental discipline]] and [[environmental responsibility]] through the selected schools in India using environmental awareness as the medium. Each of the 250 districts in India has about 250 NGC Eco Clubs. These NGC Eco Clubs are provided with an annual grant of Rs2500. Each of the Indian State has a State Nodal Officer who implements this programme.

The NGC Children are making a huge impact in the country. [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Kerala]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Assam]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] are some of the states where this programme is making huge impact on the society. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have a separate Directorates for conducting this programme, while all other states conduct this programme through one of those organisations which is interested in environmental awareness and [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] aspects. Telangana has much more involvement than any other state. They even own a [http://www.ngc.ap.gov.in/ website]. In Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh the eco-club schools participate in the Green Schools Programme conducted by the Environment Education Unit of the [[Centre for Science and Environment]]. The eco-club schools that win awards at the state level go on to compete for the National Awards organised by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi.

Since school children are involved, most of the activities of National Green Corps children are linked to the culture and cultural aspects of conservation of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environment]]. There are Master Trainers trained by the State Nodal Agencies with the help of the State Resource Agencies who train the Teachers-In-Charge of the NGC Eco Clubs.Each district has the District Implementation and Monitoring Committee which is supported by the District Coordinator, while at the state level the State Nodal Officer is guided by the state level Committee.

This is the largest such programme anywhere in the world. When these trained NGC Students grow up and take the environmental challenges of this second the most populous country, it is expected that there will be huge difference made to the way the resources are consumed and conserved. Andhra Pradesh is trying to groom the NGC Cadets as an environmentally disciplined force. It has introduced Uniform and Band along with a structured programme of formation of five teams of [[cadet]]s exclusively in all NGC School Eco Clubs. These NGC Cadets are the Green Brigade of the school, protecting the natural resources from misuse and promoting the conservation of the natural resources. These NGC Cadets are getting the pride place during the National Days when they participate in full NGC Uniform during the ceremonial parades along with other uniformed forces of the country.

The first ever National Conference of National Green Corps Eco Clubs is at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] from 26 to 29 August 2010.

The '''New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station''' (or NJAES) is an entity currently operated by [[Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey]] in conjunction with the [[New Jersey|State of New Jersey]] in the university's role as the state's sole [[land-grant university]]. Today, it conducts research in agriculture, horticulture and turf grass science, and through the [[Rutgers Cooperative Extension]] aids New Jersey farmers, landscapers, and residents in each of the state's twenty-one counties.

==History==
In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College as their sole [[Land-grant university|land grant college]]. Pursuant to the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]], this designation gave federal lands to the state that the state could then sell to raise money to develop practical education in agriculture, science, military science and engineering.&lt;ref name="McCormickBicenHistory"&gt;McCormick, Richard P. ''Rutgers: A Bicentennial History''. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp.87–88}}&lt;ref&gt;The Morrill Act of 1862 (P.L. 1862 ch. 130; 12 Stat. 504) was codified as [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/304 United States Code, Title 7, Chapter 13,  Subchapter I, § 304 — "Investment of proceeds of sale of land or scrip"]. Retrieved 25 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Hammell Cook]] (1818-1889), a professor of chemistry and natural sciences, influenced the state to select Rutgers over the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). Cook was appointed state geologist in 1864 and later became the college's vice president. With the college's land grant status and new funding for scientific studies, Cook expanded his research and teaching into geology and agriculture.&lt;ref name="McCormickBicenHistory" /&gt;{{rp|pp.87–88}}&lt;ref name="CampbellMemorial1894"&gt;David Murray (compiler).

(Trenton, New Jersey: State Gazette Publishing Company, 1916).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.27}}

The Agricultural Experiment Station began with agriculture instruction in the college's [[Geology Hall]], built in 1872, until [[New Jersey Hall]] was built in 1889. The New Jersey state legislature provided funds to construct an "Agricultural Hall" to house the station, and Rutgers built the Richard Romanesque style building in 1889. The university operated the station from that facility and through its college farm located on what became the college's [[Cook College|Cook Campus]] where it remains today at 102 Ryders Lane in [[North Brunswick, New Jersey]].

Through the station's Office of Continuing Professional Education (OCPE), the NJAES provides [[continuing education]] programmes to residents and professionals throughout the state of New Jersey. OCPE offers courses in topic areas like Wetlands preservation, Professional Golf Course Turf Management, Food Science, Food Safety, Public Health and Safety, Landscape construction and architecture, environmental sciences, and recycling. The station aims to increase coursework and research in planned agricultural production and competitiveness; food science and engineering; nutrition, health and safety; marine and coastal resources; natural resources and the environment; and human and community resource development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cookce.rutgers.edu/main/mission.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Nitrifying bacteria are a narrow taxonomic group in the environment, and are found in highest numbers where considerable amounts of ammonia are present (areas with extensive protein decomposition, and sewage treatment plants).&lt;ref name="pmid386925"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Belser LW |title=Population ecology of nitrifying bacteria |journal=Annu. Rev.

==Oxidation of ammonia to nitrate==
[[Nitrification]] in nature is a two-step oxidation process of ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) catalyzed by two ubiquitous bacterial groups. The first reaction is oxidation of ammonium to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) represented by the "Nitrosomonas" genus. The second reaction is oxidation of nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitrate by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), represented by the "Nitrobacter" genus.&lt;ref name="p2"&gt;Schaechter M. „Encyclopedia of Microbiology", AP, Amsterdam 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ward BB |title=Nitrification and ammonification in aquatic systems |journal=Life Support &amp; Biosphere Science : International Journal of Earth Space |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–9 |year=1996 |pmid=11539155 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First step nitrification - molecular mechanism ===
[[File:Ammonia oxidation.tif|thumb|Ammonia oxidation|framed|right|Figure 1. Molecular mechanism of ammonium oxidation by AOB|x200px]]

Ammonia oxidation in autotrophic nitrification is a complex process that requires several enzymes, proteins and presence of oxygen. The key enzymes, necessary to obtaining energy during oxidation of ammonia to nitrite are [[ammonia monooxygenase]] (AMO) and [[hydroxylamine oxidoreductase]] (HAO). First is a transmembrane copper protein which catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine (1.1) taking two electrons directly from the quinone pool. This reaction requires O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second step of this process has recently fallen into question.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caranto|first=Jonathan D.|last2=Lancaster|first2=Kyle M.|date=2017-07-17|title=Nitric oxide is an obligate bacterial nitrification intermediate produced by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/11/1704504114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|pages=8217-8222|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704504114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28716929|volume=114|issue=31|pmc=5547625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past few decades, the common view was that a trimeric multiheme c-type HAO converts hydroxylamine into nitrite in the periplasm with production of four electrons (1.2). The stream of four electron are channelled through cytochrome c&lt;sub&gt;554&lt;/sub&gt; to a membrane-bound cytochrome c&lt;sub&gt;552&lt;/sub&gt;. Two of the electrons are routed back to AMO, where they are used for the oxidation of ammonia (quinol pool). The remaining two electrons are used to generate a proton motive force and reduce NAD(P) through reverse electron transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Byung Hong Kim, Geoffrey Michael Gadd | title= Bacterial Physiology and Metabolism |year=2008 |publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent results, however, show that HAO does not produce nitrite as a direct product of catalysis. This enzyme instead produces nitric oxide and three electrons. Nitric oxide can then be oxidized by other enzymes (or oxygen) to nitrite. In this paradigm, the electron balance for overall metabolism needs to be reconsidered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Second step nitrification - molecular mechanism ===

Nitrite produced in the first step of autotrophic nitrification is oxidized to nitrate by nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR)(2). It is a membrane-associated iron-sulfur molybdoprotein, and is part of an electron transfer chain which channels electrons from nitrite to molecular oxygen.{{citation needed|reason=Contrary to chem eq below, which shows water as the source of oxygen|date=November 2017}} The molecular mechanism of oxidation nitrite is less described than oxidation ammonium. In new research (e.g. Woźnica A. et al., 2013)&lt;ref name="p1"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Woznica A, etal | title = Stimulatory Effect of Xenobiotics on Oxidative Electron Transport of Chemolithotrophic Nitrifying Bacteria Used as Biosensing Element | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8| issue = 1| year = 2013 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053484 | pages=e53484 | pmid=23326438 | pmc=3541135}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed new hypothetical model of NOB electron transport chain and NXR mechanism (Figure 2.). It should be noted that, in contrast to earlier models &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ferguson SJ, Nicholls DG |title = Bioenergetic III|year=2002 |publisher= Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NXR acts on the outside of the plasma membrane, directly contributing to postulated by Spieck &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Spieck E, etal |title= Isolation and immunocytochemical location of the nitrite-oxidizing system in Nitrospira moscoviensis | journal = Arch Microbiol|volume= 169 |pages=225–230 |year=1998 |doi=10.1007/s002030050565 |pmid=9477257 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coworkers mechanism of proton gradient generation.

'''Personally information management''' ('''PIM''') is the activities people perform in order to acquire, organize, maintain, retrieve and use personal information items such as documents (paper-based and digital), web pages and email messages for everyday use to complete tasks (work-related or not) and fulfill a person's various roles (as parent, employee, friend, member of community, etc.).&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=William |date=2008 |title=Keeping Found Things Found |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers |isbn=978-0-12-370866-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, ''PIM is the art of getting things done in our lives through information.''&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2012). [http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00411ED1V01Y201203ICR021 The Future of Personal Information Management, Part 1: Our Information, Always and Forever]. San Rafael, Calif.: Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers. page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically, PIM is concerned with how people organize and maintain personal information collections, and methods that can help people in doing so.  People may manage information in a variety of settings, for a variety of reasons, and with a variety of types of information.  For example, an office worker might manage physical documents in a filing cabinet by placing them in folders organized alphabetically by project name, or might manage digital documents in folders in a hierarchical file system.  A parent might collect and organize photographs of their children into a photo album using a temporal organization scheme, or might tag digital photos with the names of the children.

PIM considers not only the methods used to store and organize information, but also is concerned with how people retrieve information from their collections for re-use.  For example, the office worker might re-locate a physical document by remembering the name of the project and then finding the appropriate folder by an alphabetical search.  On a computer system with a hierarchical file system, a person might need to remember the top-level folder in which a document is located, and then browse through the folder contents to navigate to the desired document.  Email systems often support additional methods for re-finding such as fielded search (e.g., search by sender, subject, date).  The characteristics of the document types, the data that can be used to describe them (meta-data), and features of the systems used to store and organize them (e.g. fielded search) are all components that may influence how users accomplish personal information management.

Studying, understanding, and practicing PIM can help individuals and organizations work more effectively and efficiently, can help people deal with "information overload", and can highlight useful strategies for archiving, organizing, and facilitating access to saved information.

==Overview==
There are six ways in which information can be personal:&lt;ref name="Jones"/&gt; 
#Owned by "me"
#About "me"
#Directed toward "me"
#Sent/Posted by "me"
#Experienced by "me"
#Relevant to "me"

One ideal of PIM is that people should always have the right information in the right place, in the right form, and of sufficient completeness and quality to meet their current need. Technologies and tools such as [[personal information manager]]s  help people spend less time with time-consuming and error-prone activities of PIM (such as looking for and organising information). They then have more and better insight in making creative, intelligent use of their time, or to simply enjoy the information itself.

== History and background ==
PIM is a new field with ancient roots. When the oral rather than the written word dominated, human memory was the primary means for information preservation.&lt;ref name="yates1966"&gt;F. A. Yates, The art of memory. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; As information was increasingly rendered in paper form, tools were developed over time to meet the growing challenges of management. For example, the vertical filing cabinet, now such a standard feature of home and workplace offices, was first commercially available in 1893.&lt;ref name="yates1989"&gt;J. Yates, Control through communication: The rise of system in American management. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasing availability of computers in the 1950s came an interest in the computer as a source of metaphors and a test bed for efforts to understand the human ability to process information and to solve
problems. [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] pioneered the computer's use as a tool to model human thought.&lt;ref name="newell1972"&gt;A. Newell and H. A. Simon, Human problem solving. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1972.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simon1958"&gt;H. A. Simon and A. Newell, "[https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.6.1.1 Heuristic problem solving: The next advance in operations research]," Oper. Res., vol. 6, pp. 1–10., 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; They produced "The [[Logic Theorist]]," generally thought to be the first running artificial intelligence (AI) program. The computer of the 1950s was also an inspiration for the development of an information processing approach to human behavior and performance.&lt;ref name="broadbent1958"&gt;D. E. Broadbent, Perception and communication. London, U.K.: Pergamon Press, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1950s research showed that the computer, as a symbol processor, could "think" (to varying degrees of fidelity) like people do, the 1960s saw an increasing interest in the use of the computer to help people to think better and to process information more effectively. Working with [[Andries van Dam]] and others, [[Ted Nelson]], who coined the word "[[hypertext]]",&lt;ref name="nelson1965"&gt;T. H. Nelson, "[http://rogerclarke.com/II/Nelson-1965.pdf File structure for the complex, the changing, and the indeterminate]," in Proceedings
of the 1965 20th ACM/CSC-ER national conference, Cleveland, OH, 1965, pp. 84–100.&lt;/ref&gt; developed one of the first hypertext systems, The Hypertext Editing System, in 1968.&lt;ref name="carmody1969"&gt;S. Carmody, W. Gross, T. Nelson, D. Rice, and A. Van Dam, "A hypertext editing system for the /360," in Pertinent concepts in computer graphics, Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1969, pp. 291–330.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[Douglas Engelbart]] also completed work on a hypertext system called NLS (oN-Line System).&lt;ref name="engelbart1968"&gt;D. C. Engelbart and W. K. English, "[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/BBAIKM.pdf A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect]," in
Proceedings of the December 9–11, 1968, Fall Joint Computer Conference, Part I, New York, NY, USA, 1968, pp. 395–410.&lt;/ref&gt; Engelbart advanced the notion that the computer could be used to augment the human intellect.&lt;ref name="engelbart1962"&gt;D. Engelbart, "[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0289565 Augmenting human intellect: A conceptual framework].," SRI Rep., 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engelbart1961"&gt;D. C. Engelbart, "Special considerations of the individual as a user, generator and retriever of information," Am. Doc., vol. 12, no. 2, pp. 121–125, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As heralded by the publication of [[Ulric Neisser]]'s book Cognitive Psychology,&lt;ref name="neisser1967"&gt;U. Neisser, Cognitive psychology. New York: Appleton-Century Crofts, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1960s also saw the emergence of cognitive psychology as a discipline that focused primarily on a better understanding of the human ability to think, learn, and remember.

The computer as aid to the individual, rather than remote number cruncher in a refrigerated room, gained further validity from work in the late 1970s and through the 1980s to produce personal computers of increasing power and portability. These trends continue: computational power roughly equivalent to that of a desktop computer of a decade ago can now be found in devices that fit into the palm of a hand.
The phrase "Personal Information Management" was itself apparently first used in the 1980s in the midst of general excitement over the potential of the personal computer to greatly enhance the human ability to process and manage information.&lt;ref name="lansdale1988"&gt;M. Lansdale, "The psychology of personal information management," Appl Ergon, vol. 19, no. 1,
pp. 55–66, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the advent of so-called "PIM tools" that provided limited support for the management of such things as appointments and scheduling, to-do lists, phone numbers, and addresses. A community dedicated to the study and improvement of human–computer interaction also emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="card1983"&gt;S. K. Card, T. P. Moran, and A. Newell, The psychology of human-computer interaction. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="norman1988"&gt;D. A. Norman, The psychology of everyday things. New York: Basic Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

As befits the "information" focus of PIM, PIM-relevant research of the 1980s and 1990s extended beyond the study of a particular device or application towards larger ecosystems of information management to
include, for example, the organization of the physical office and the management of paperwork.&lt;ref name="cole1982"&gt;Cole, "Human aspects of office filing: implications for the electronic office," in Human Factors

Case, "Collection and organization of written information by social scientists and humanists: a review and exploratory study," J Inf Sci, vol. 12, no. 3, pp. 97–104, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Malone characterized personal organization strategies as 'neat' or 'messy' and described 'filing' and 'piling' approaches to the organization of information.&lt;ref name="malone1983"&gt;T. W. Malone, "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Malone2/publication/220515815_Malone_T_How_Do_People_Organize_Their_Desks_Implications_for_the_Design_of_Office_Information_Systems_ACM_Transactions_on_Office_Information_Systems_11_99-112/links/09e4151027f9d032b1000000.pdf How do people organize their desks: implications for the design of office information-systems]," ACM Trans.

PIM, as a contemporary field of inquiry with a self-identified community of researchers, traces its origins to a Special Interest Group (SIG) session on PIM at the CHI 2004 conference and to a special National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored workshop held in Seattle in 2005.&lt;ref name="sig2004"&gt;O. Bergman, R. Boardman, J. Gwizdka, and W. Jones, "A special interest group session on personal information management," 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sig2005"&gt;W. Jones and H. Bruce, "A Report on the NSF-Sponsored Workshop on Personal Information Management, Seattle, WA, 2005," in Personal Information Management 2005: A Special Workshop Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Seattle, WA, USA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study ==
Interest in the study of PIM has increased in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} One goal in the study of PIM is to identify ways to introduce new tool support without inadvertently increasing the complexity of a person's information management challenge. The study of PIM means understanding better how people manage information across tools and over time. It is not enough simply to study, for example, [[e-mail]] use in isolation. A related point is that the value of a new tool must be assessed over time and in a broader context of a person's various PIM activities.

PIM research can be organized according to the three main PIM activities:

===Finding/re-finding===
Finding and re-finding information can take place in a public space (e.g. the Internet) or private (e.g. a person's hard drive).
Research on finding is largely focused on finding public information (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Looking for Information / Case (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;) and on how people search and use information (human information behavior).&lt;ref&gt;Information Behavior Research: Where Have We been, Where are We Going / Julien &amp; O'Brien (2014&lt;/ref&gt; For re-finding a person has to a) remember (to look), recall and recognize, and repeat.&lt;ref&gt;The Psychology of Personal Information Management / Lansdale (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Remembering to look is difficult even when using online bookmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Saving and Using Encountered Information / Marshall &amp; Bly (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Recall and recognize is what typically happens when people do a (desktop) search by typing in [[search term]]s and then scanning the list of results until they recognize what they are looking for. The whole process of remembering, recalling and recognizing is repeated in case the information sought consists of multiple parts.

===Keeping===
When people encounter information it can be consumed immediately (e.g. a game score) or keep it for later use in which case a decision needs to be made of how and where to keep it so it can be found again. This process is error prone. Filing and tagging information is difficult&lt;ref&gt;Information Behavior That Keeps Found Things Found / Bruce, Jones, &amp; Dumais (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; because people often fail to remember existing folders and tags and create new instances leading to information dispersion.

===Meta activities===
Meta activities are strategic activities that consider a person's information collections, how their information is organized and how well this organization is working, and whether the [[information security|information is secure]] and [[backup|backed up]]. Making sense of and using information after it has been found is also part of these activities. Generally people struggle to organize their information,&lt;ref&gt;Getting Lost in Email: How and Why Users Spend More Time in Email Than Intended / Hanrahan (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and usually don't have reliable backup routines.&lt;ref&gt;The Long Term Fate of Digital Belongings: Toward A Service Model for Personal Archives / Marshall, Bly, &amp; Brun-Cottan (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
A challenge in PIM research is to develop more practical methods for study of current PIM practices with more practical implications for the development of improved tools, techniques and training in support of better PIM. PIM requires the study of people, with a diversity of backgrounds and needs, over time as they work in many different situations, with different forms of information and different tools of information management.  This scope of PIM inquiry brings a need for practical, cost-effective methodologies that can scale. Further, there is a need  not only for descriptive studies aimed at better understanding how people currently practice PIM but also for prescriptive studies aimed both at evaluation and also towards the recommendation of proposed solutions in the form of new, improved tools, techniques and strategies of PIM.

It has been noted that the nature of PIM makes its study challenging in the extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = W | year = 2015 | title = Building a Better World with our Information: The Future of Personal Information Management, Part 3 | url = | journal = Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services | volume = 7 | issue = 4| pages = 1–203 | doi = 10.2200/S00653ED1V01Y201506ICR042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers seek to understand how people manage information using tools of information management. But it is important that the information managed be "personal".  Traditional laboratory tasks risk abstracting away the "personal" from PIM. Furthermore, people don't just keep information; they keep information within the established organizations of their personal spaces of information (PSIs) – the folder structure of their laptop, or the drawers and layout of their physical desktop or a Facebook timeline.

== Tools ==
There are a number of tools available for managing personal information, but these tools can become a part of the problem leading to "information fragmentation". Different devices and applications often come with their separate ways of storing and organizing information. ''NOTE:'' Many people confuse PIM tools with the study and practice of personal information management itself. See [[personal information manager]] for information about tools for personal information management.

== Related activities and areas ==
PIM shares considerable, potentially synergistic overlap with disciplines such as [[cognitive science]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], [[information science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[Database Management|database management]] and [[information retrieval]]. PIM relates to but differs from other fields of inquiry that study the interactions between people, information and technology, personal network management.

===Cognitive psychology and cognitive science===
[[Cognitive psychology]], as the study of how people learn and remember, problem solve, and make decisions, necessarily also includes the study of how people make smart use of available information. The related field of [[cognitive science]], in its efforts to apply these questions more broadly to the study and simulation of intelligent behavior, is also related to PIM.  Cognitive science has strong connections to, some would say subsumes, the field of [[artificial intelligence]].

There is great potential for a mutually beneficial interplay between cognitive science and PIM. Sub-areas of cognitive science of clear relevance to PIM include [[problem solving]] and [[decision making]]. For example, folders created to hold information for a big project such as "plan my wedding" may sometimes resemble a [[Decomposition (computer science)|problem-decomposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W., Phuwanartnurak, A. J., Gill, R., &amp; Bruce, H. (2005, April 2–7). [https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace/handle/1773/2031 Don't take my folders away!  Organizing personal information to get things done]. Paper presented at the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2005), Portland, OR.&lt;/ref&gt; To take another example, [[Detection theory|signal detection task]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, W. W., Birdsall, T. G., &amp; Fox, W. C. (1954). [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1057460/ The theory of signal detectability]. Institute of Radio Engineers Transactions, PGIT-4, 171-212.&lt;/ref&gt; has long been used to frame and explain human behavior and has recently been used as a basis for analyzing our choices concerning what information to keep and how – a key activity of PIM.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2004).[http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1123 Finders, keepers? The present and future perfect in support of personal information management]. First Monday.&lt;/ref&gt;

Or consider [[categorization]] and [[concept formation]]. How are categories and concepts learned and used? Categories and concepts cannot be seen directly but may be reflected in the tags and folders people use to organize their information. Or consider the activities of [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]]. Both are areas of study in cognitive psychology with clear relevance to the study of PIM.

Now large portions of a document may be the product of [[cut, copy, and paste|"copy-and-paste" operations]] (from our previous writings) rather than a product of original writing. Certainly, management of text pieces pasted for re-use is a PIM activity, and this raises several interesting questions. How do we go about deciding when to re-use and when to write from scratch? We may sometimes spend more time chasing down a paragraph we have previously written than it would have taken to simply write a new paragraph expressing the same thoughts. Beyond this, we can wonder at what point a reliance on an increasing (and increasingly available) supply of previously written material begins to impact our creativity.

As people do PIM they work in an external environment that includes other people, available technology and organizational setting. This means that  [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], and [[social cognition]] all relate to the study of PIM.

=== Human–computer and human–information interaction ===
The study of PIM is also related to the field of [[human–computer interaction|human–computer interaction (HCI)]]. But PIM research puts emphasis on the broader study of how people manage their information over time using a variety of tools – some computer-based, some not.

The [[user-subjective approach]] is the first approach dedicated specifically to PIM systems design. Its theoretical foundations were first published in a ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' paper in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asi.10283 | volume=54 | title=The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems | year=2003 | journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | pages=872–878 | last1 = Bergman | first1 = Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another JASIST paper with evidence and implementation for the approach was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/asi.20738 | volume=59 | title=The user-subjective approach to personal information management systems design: Evidence and implementations | year=2007 | journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | pages=235–246 | last1 = Bergman | first1 = Ofer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper had won the Best JASIST Paper award in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asis.org/awards/jasis_paper.html Best JASIST Paper Award]. Asis.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The first user-subjective design scheme was developed and positively evaluated in a [[Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems]] paper published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518745 It's not that important]. Portal.acm.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group information management===
[[Group information management]] (GIM, usually pronounced with a soft "G") has been written about elsewhere in the context  of PIM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1107458.1107495&amp;coll=DL&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=559941162&amp;CFTOKEN=82585874 From PIM to GIM: personal information management in group contexts]&lt;/ref&gt; The study of GIM, in turn, has clear relevance to the study of [[computer-supported cooperative work]] (CSCW). As a useful way to relate acronyms we can say that GIM is to CSCW as PIM is to HCI (human–computer interaction). Concerns of PIM substantially overlap with but are not fully subsumed by concerns of HCI (nor vice versa). Indeed, some of the more influential papers on PIM over the years have been published in HCI journals and conference  proceedings .

However, the "I" in PIM is for information – how can we as individuals (the "P"), better manage (the "M") our information (in all 6 senses as listed above) regardless of the form it takes – papers and books, digital documents and emails or even the letter magnets on a refrigerator in the kitchen. The "I" in HCI stands for "interaction" as this relates to the "C" – computers. 
A similar distinction can be made with respect to GIM and CSCW.

=== Management of data, information, knowledge, time and tasks ===
The study of [[information management]] and [[knowledge management]] in organizations relates to the study of PIM. Jones notes that issues seen first at an organizational level often migrate to the PIM domain.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. (2007). Personal information management. In B. Cronin (Ed.), [http://www.asis.org/Publications/ARIST/vol41.php Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) (Vol. 41)]. Medford, NJ: Information Today.&lt;/ref&gt;

PIM can help to motivate and will also benefit from work in [[information retrieval]] and [[database management system|database management]]. For example, [[data mining|data mining techniques]] might be applied to mine and structure personal information.

=== Relation to time management and productivity ===
By similar argument, a discussion of [[time management]] or [[task management]] on a personal level quickly takes us back to a discussion of PIM. Both time and task management make heavy use of information tools and external forms of information such as to-do lists, calendars, timelines, Gantt charts, etc.; this information, to be managed like other information.

=== Personal network management ===
[[Personal network]] management (PNM) is a crucial aspect of PIM and can be understood as the practice of managing the links and connections for social and professional benefits.

[[File:M87 jet.jpg|right|thumb|Only a single jet is visible in M87.]]
[[File:Radio galaxy 3C31.png|thumb|Two jets are visible in 3C31]]

'''Relativistic beaming''' (also known as '''Doppler beaming, Doppler boosting,''' or the '''headlight effect''') is the process by which [[Special Relativity|relativistic effects]] modify the apparent luminosity of emitting matter that is moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]. In an astronomical context, relativistic beaming commonly occurs in two oppositely-directed [[relativistic jet]]s of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that originate from a central [[Compact star|compact object]] that is [[Accretion disc|accreting]] matter.  Accreting compact objects and relativistic jets are invoked to explain the following observed phenomena: [[X-ray binary|x-ray binaries]], [[gamma-ray burst]]s, and, on a much larger scale, [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN).  ([[Quasar]]s are also associated with an accreting compact object, but are thought to be merely a particular variety of [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]].)

Beaming (short for relativistic beaming) affects the apparent brightness of a moving object just as a [[lighthouse]] affects the appearance of its light source: the light source appears dim or unseen to a ship except when the rotating lighthouse beacon is directed towards a ship, where it then appears very bright. This so-called lighthouse effect illustrates how important the direction of motion (relative to the observer) is in relativistic beaming: if a blob of gas emitting electromagnetic radiation is moving towards the observer then it will be brighter than if it were at rest, but if the gas isn't moving towards the observer it may (in some cases) appear much fainter than if it were at rest.  The importance of this effect in astronomy is illustrated by comparing the [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]] jets detected in the galaxy [[Messier 87#Jet|M87]] and 3C31 (see figures on the right).  The twin jets in M87 show how beaming affects their appearance when one jet moves almost directly towards Earth and the other jet moves in the opposite direction; while M87's jet moving towards Earth is clearly visible to telescopes (the long and thin blue-ish feature in the top image) and is many times brighter due to beaming, M87's other jet is moving away from us and is, due to beaming, so much fainter than the jet directed towards us that it is rendered invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  3C31 is different from M87 because both jets (labeled in the figure directly below M87's image) are directed at roughly right angles to our line of sight and are therefore subject to the same amount of beaming.  Thus, unlike the case of M87, both of 3C31's jets are visible.  The jet displayed on the upper part of the image of 3C31 is actually pointing slightly more in Earth's direction than the other jet and is therefore the brighter of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Relativistically moving objects are beamed due to a variety of physical effects.  [[Relativistic aberration|Light aberration]] causes most of the photons to be emitted along the object's direction of motion.  The [[Relativistic Doppler effect|Doppler effect]] changes the energy of the photons by red- or blueshifting them.  Finally, time intervals as measured by clocks moving alongside the emitting object are different from those measured by an observer on Earth due to [[time dilation]] and photon arrival time effects.  How all of these effects modify the brightness, or apparent luminosity, of a moving object is determined by the equation describing the [[relativistic Doppler effect]] (which is why relativistic beaming is also known as Doppler beaming).

== A simple jet model ==
The simplest model for a jet is one where a single, homogeneous sphere is travelling towards the Earth at nearly the speed of light. This simple model is also an unrealistic one, although it does illustrate the physical process of beaming quite well.

=== Synchrotron spectrum and the spectral index ===
[[Relativistic jet]]s emit most of their energy via [[synchrotron emission]]. In our simple model the sphere contains highly relativistic electrons and a steady magnetic field. Electrons inside the blob travel at speeds just a tiny fraction below the speed of light and are whipped around by the magnetic field. Each change in direction by an electron is accompanied by the release of energy in the form of a photon. With enough electrons and a powerful enough magnetic field the relativistic sphere can emit a huge number of photons, ranging from those at relatively weak radio frequencies to powerful X-ray photons.

The figure of the sample spectrum shows basic features of a simple synchrotron spectrum. At low frequencies the jet sphere is opaque. The amount luminosity increases with frequency until it peaks and begins to decline. In the sample image this ''peak frequency'' occurs at &lt;math&gt;\log \nu = 3&lt;/math&gt;. At frequencies higher than this the jet sphere is transparent. The luminosity decreases with frequency until a ''break frequency'' is reached, after which it declines more rapidly. In the same image the break frequency occurs when &lt;math&gt;\log \nu = 7&lt;/math&gt;. The sharp break frequency occurs because at very high frequencies the electrons which emit the photons lose most of their energy very rapidly. A sharp decrease in the number of high energy electrons means a sharp decrease in the spectrum.

The changes in slope in the synchrotron spectrum are parameterized with a ''spectral index''. The spectral index, α, over a given frequency range is simply the slope on a diagram of &lt;math&gt;\log S&lt;/math&gt; vs. &lt;math&gt;\log \nu&lt;/math&gt;. (Of course for α to have real meaning the spectrum must be very nearly a straight line across the range in question.)

=== Beaming equation ===
In the simple jet model of a single homogeneous sphere the observed luminosity is related to the intrinisic luminosity as

:&lt;math&gt;S_o = S_e D^p\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;p = 3 - \alpha\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The observed luminosity therefore depends on the speed of the jet and the angle to the line of sight through the Doppler factor, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, and also on the properties inside the jet, as shown by the exponent with the spectral index.

The beaming equation can be broken down into a series of three effects:
* Relativistic aberration
* Time dilation
* Blue- or redshifting

==== Aberration ====
Aberration is the change in an object's [[Aberration of light#Apparent and true positions|apparent direction]] caused by the relative transverse motion of the observer. In inertial systems it is equal and opposite to the [[light time correction]].

In everyday life aberration is a well-known phenomenon. Consider a person standing in the rain on a day when there is no wind. If the person is standing still, then the rain drops will follow a path that is straight down to the ground. However, if the person is moving, for example in a car, the rain will appear to be approaching at an angle. This apparent change in the direction of the incoming raindrops is aberration.

The amount of aberration depends on the speed of the emitted object or wave relative to the observer. In the example above this would be the speed of a car compared to the speed of the falling rain. This does not change when the object is moving at a speed close to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.  Like the classic and relativistic effects, aberration depends on: 1) the speed of the emitter at the time of emission, and 2) the speed of the observer at the time of absorption.

In the case of a relativistic jet, beaming (emission aberration) will make it appear as if more energy is sent forward, along the direction the jet is traveling. In the simple jet model a homogeneous sphere will emit energy equally in all directions in the rest frame of the sphere. In the rest frame of Earth the moving sphere will be observed to be emitting most of its energy along its direction of motion. The energy, therefore, is ‘beamed’ along that direction.

Quantitatively, aberration accounts for a change in luminosity of

: &lt;math&gt;D^2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Time dilation ====
Time dilation is a well-known consequence of [[special relativity]] and accounts for a change in observed luminosity of
:&lt;math&gt;D^1\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Blue- or redshifting ====
[[Blueshift|Blue-]] or [[Redshift|redshifting]] can change the observed luminosity at a particular frequency, but this is not a beaming effect.

Blueshifting accounts for a change in observed luminosity of

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{D^\alpha}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Lorentz invariants ====
A more-sophisticated method of deriving the beaming equations starts with the quantity &lt;math&gt;\frac{S}{\nu^3}&lt;/math&gt;. This quantity is a Lorentz invariant, so the value is the same in different reference frames.

== Terminology ==
; beamed, beaming : shorter terms for ‘relativistic beaming’
; beta : the ratio of the jet speed to the speed of light, sometimes called ‘relativistic beta’
; core : region of a galaxy around the central [[supermassive black hole|black hole]]
; counter-jet : the jet on the far side of a source oriented close to the line of sight, can be very faint and difficult to observe
; Doppler factor : a mathematical expression which measures the strength (or weakness) of relativistic effects in [[Active galactic nucleus|AGN]], including beaming, based on the jet speed and its angle to the line of sight with Earth
; flat spectrum : a term for a non-thermal [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] that emits a great deal of energy at the higher frequencies when compared to the lower frequencies
; intrinsic luminosity : the [[luminosity]] from the jet in the rest frame of the jet
; jet (often termed '[[relativistic jet]]'): a high velocity (close to c) stream of plasma emanating from the polar direction of an AGN
; observed luminosity : the [[luminosity]] from the jet in the rest frame of Earth
; spectral index :a measure of how a non-thermal [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] changes with frequency. The smaller [[Alpha|α]] is, the more significant the energy at higher frequencies is. Typically α is in the range of 0 to 2.
; steep spectrum : a term for a non-thermal [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] that emits little energy at the higher frequencies when compared to the lower frequencies

=== Physical Quantities ===

; angle to the line-of-sight with Earth : &lt;math&gt;\theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
; jet speed : &lt;math&gt;v_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
; intrinsic luminosity : &lt;math&gt;S_e\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes called emitted luminosity)
; observed Luminosity : &lt;math&gt;S_o\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
; spectral index : &lt;math&gt;\alpha\,\!&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;S \propto \nu^{\alpha}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
; [[Speed of light]] : &lt;math&gt;c\,\! = 2.9979 \times 10^{8}&lt;/math&gt; m/s

=== Mathematical Expressions ===

; relativistic beta : &lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{v_j}{c}&lt;/math&gt;
; Lorentz factor : &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
; Doppler factor : &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{1}{\gamma (1 - \beta \cos\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

The museum was originally established as {{Nihongo|Sakitama Museum|さきたま資料館}} in 1969 as part of the construction of {{Nihongo|Sakitama Fudoki  Hills|さきたま風土記の丘}}, an archeological preserve encompassing the Sakitama [[Kofun]] Cluster.  In 2006, Saitama Prefecture renamed the museum as Museum of the Sakitama Ancient Burial Mounds and made its goals the research, collection, preservation of the site's archeological data as well as educating the site’s cultural and historical value to its visitors.

Nearly 100,000 visitors come to the museum every year to learn about Sakitama Kofun Cluster and its artifacts, including a national treasure, [[Inariyama Sword]]. The museum consists of two buildings, Sakitama Shiseki Hall and Shōgunyama Kofun Exhibit Hall, which opened in 1997 and allows visitors to walk inside of the reconstructed stone chamber of the Shōgunyama Kofun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sakitama-muse.spec.ed.jp/top-page/organization.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226002902/http://www.sakitama-muse.spec.ed.jp/top-page/organization.html |date=December 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Politics and International Relations''' is an academic department at the [[University of Nottingham]], England housed in the Law and Social Sciences Building (LASS) together with Law and Sociology. 

The school runs nine undergraduate programmes, nine postgraduate programmes and have a 40-strong PhD community.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nottspolitics.org/about/|title=About – Ballots &amp; Bullets - School of Politics &amp; International Relations, University of Nottingham|website=Nottspolitics.org|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research activity in the school is ranked around 7 Institutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/research/index.aspx|title=Research - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}} the Head of School was Matthew Humphrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/index.aspx|title=About Us - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the department was chosen along with the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Manchester]] to host the 2015 British Election Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2013/march/consortium-plays-host-to-british-election-study.aspx|title=Consortium plays host to British Election Study - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the Department's research was ranked in the top 10 departments of Politics in the country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/history.aspx School History - The University of Nottingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324050255/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Politics/About-the-School/History.aspx |date=2010-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 85% of the research was considered of international standard.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The department ranks 12th in The Guardian's 2013 league table of Politics departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2012/may/22/university-guide-politics|title=University guide 2013: league table for politics|date=22 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Complete University Guide ranked Nottingham 10th for Politics in 2013 and 13th for Politics in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Politics|title=Politics - Top UK University Subject Tables and Rankings 2019|website=Thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The School of Politics and International Relations at Nottingham was established in 1965 and was initially housed in the old Engineering Building. Richard Pear was the first Professor of Politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/politics/about-the-school/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324050255/http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/Politics/About-the-School/History.aspx |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics had previously been taught as early as 1959 as part of the Department of Social Science where Politics formed part of a joint degree in Politics and Economics.

In 1971 the Sir Francis Hill chair was established following an endowment from the Municipal Mutual Insurance Company and Frank Stacey, an expert in local government was appointed. In 1981 [[Dennis Kavanagh]] joined the school. Kavanagh is best known for his work on the [[Nuffield Election Studies]]. The School moved to the 'Orchards' Building during the 1980s. Several new degrees were introduced during the 1980s including an MA in Political Economy and Political Culture and a joint BA in Politics and History and an MA in International Relations.

In 1994 the head of department Dr David Regan committed suicide by [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]  and cited his treatment by the University of Nottingham in a suicide note. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/pressure-for-nottingham-suicide-inquiry-continues/98080.article|title=Pressure for Nottingham suicide inquiry continues|date=3 February 1995|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999 moved to the Law and Social Sciences Building (LASS) and changed its name to the ‘School of Politics and International Relations' in 2005.
In 2011 the school gained national media attention following the arrest of two  student one of whom was completing a PhD related to terrorism.  Dr Rod Thornton published a paper critical of the department’s handling of the incident and was subsequently suspended. Thornton later left by “mutual consent”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-06-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307143141/http://www.impactnottingham.com/2012/06/dr-rod-thornton-leaves-the-university-after-mutual-agreement/# |archive-date=2014-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===David Regan===
In 1994 the then head of the department [[David Regan (academic)|David Regan]] killed himself in a protest against decisions made by management at the University of Nottingham which he disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/suicide-was-sacrificial-1448829.html|title=Suicide 'was sacrificial'|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University rejected calls for a public inquiry into the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/academics-call-for-inquiry-into-sacrificial-suicide-1571725.html|title=Academics call for inquiry into `sacrificial' suicide|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nottingham Two===
{{main|Nottingham Two}}
The School received international media attention in 2011 when an academic in the department [[Rod Thornton]] published an academic paper critical of the department and the [[University of Nottingham]]'s handling of the arrest of a student called [[Rizwaan Sabir]] who was completing a PhD thesis on terrorism. Mr Sabir downloaded a copy of an Al-Qaeda training manual from a US government website and was wrongly arrested on terrorism charges. The University of Nottingham described the paper as defamatory to a number of Thornton's colleagues in the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-13350702|title=Chomsky concern over 'suspension'|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=18 October 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton later apologized for inaccuracies in his paper and left his job by mutual consent.

===Miwa Hirono visa controversy===
In 2015 [[Times Higher Education]] reported that the Home Office had refused a visa for the academic [[Miwa Hirono]], an expert on Chinese foreign policy,  on the basis she had spent around 200 days in the past five years resident in China researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. Matthew Humphrey, head of Nottingham’s School of Politics and International Relations said that the policy was “vindictive and bone-headed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/visa-refusal-for-china-expert-miwa-hirono-is-pure-madness/2019182.article#.VQo4JuTMIac.twitter|title=Visa refusal for China expert Miwa Hirono is ‘pure madness’|date=19 March 2015|website=Timeshighereducation.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
The Department currently hosts four leading politics journals.

[[File:ChineseJadePlaques.JPG|thumb|250px|Chinese [[jade]] and [[steatite]] plaques, in the [[Scythian]]-style animal art of the steppes. 4th-3rd century BCE. [[British Museum]].]]
Many artistic influences transited along the [[Silk Road]], especially through the [[Central Asia]], where [[Hellenistic]], [[Iran]]ian, [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] influence were able to interact. In particular [[Greco-Buddhist art]] represent one of the most vivid examples of this interaction.
As shown on the 1st century CE Silk Road map, there is no single road but a whole network of long-distance routes: mainly two land routes and one sea route.

==Scythian art==
Following contacts of metropolitan China with nomadic western and northwestern border territories in the 8th century BCE, [[gold]] was introduced from [[Central Asia]],  and Chinese [[jade]] carvers began to make imitation designs of the [[steppe]]s, adopting the [[Scythian]]-style animal art of the steppes (descriptions of animals locked in combat). This style is particularly reflected in the rectangular belt plaques made of [[gold]] and [[bronze]] with alternate versions in [[jade]] and [[steatite]].&lt;ref&gt;''"There is evidence of gold belt-plaques with "Scythian" "animal style" art, greaves, barrows and other indications of the penetration of steppe cultures south of the Yangzi before the Han period"'' (Mallory and Mair "The Tarim Mummies", p.329)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though that happened, the correspondence between the "Scythians" as an ethnic group and their material culture is still subject to discussion and research. The subject is  part of the broader "nomadic" and "sedentary"  debate.

==Hellenistic art==

Following the expansion of the [[Greco-Bactrian]]s into Central Asia, Greek influences on Han art have often been suggested ([[Hirth]], [[Rostovtzeff]]). Designs with [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] flowers, geometric lines, and glass inlays, suggestive of Hellenistic influences, can be found on some early [[Han dynasty]] bronze mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou bowl: ''"RED EARTHENWARE BOWL, DECORATED WITH A SLIP AND INLAID WITH GLASS PASTE. Eastern Zhou period, 4th-3rd century BC. This bowl was probably intended to copy a more precious and possibly foreign vessel in bronze or even silver. Glass was little used in China. Its popularity at the end of the Eastern Zhou period was probably due to foreign influence."'' British Museum notice to the bowl (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The things which China received from the Graeco-Iranian world- the pomegranate and other "Chang-Kien" plants, the heavy equipment of the cataphract, the traces of Greeks influence on Han art (such as) the famous white bronze mirror of the Han period with Graeco-Bactrian designs (...) in the Victoria and Albert Museum"'' (W. W. Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India'', 1980, pp. 363-364)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greco-Buddhist art==

===Buddha===

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|thumb|250px|A Buddha in [[Seokguram]], South Korea. It was influenced by [[Gandhara]] art.]]

The image of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], originating during the 1st century CE in northern India (areas of [[Gandhara]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]]) was transmitted progressively through Central Asia and then China until it reached Japan in the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;''"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style"'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt;

To this day however the transmission of many iconographical details is still visible, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Japanese Buddhist temples]], or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

==Eastern iconography in the West==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:KanishkaBuddha2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Buddha (with the legend "BODDO" in Greek script) with an aureole envelopping the whole body, on a coin of the [[Kushan]] king [[Kanishka]], 2nd century AD.]] --&gt;
Some elements of western iconography were adopted from the East along the Silk Road. The [[aureole]] in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same device was known several centuries earlier, in non-Christian [[art]]. It is found in some [[Persian people|Persian]] representations of kings and Gods, and appears on coins of the [[Kushan]] kings [[Kanishka]], [[Huvishka]] and [[Vasudeva]], as well as on most representations of the Buddha in [[Greco-Buddhist art]] from the 1st century CE.
Another image which appears to have transferred from China via the Silk Road is the symbol of the [[Three hares]], showing three animals running in a circle. It has been traced back to the [[Sui dynasty]] in China, and is still to be found in sacred sites in many parts of Western Europe, and especially in churches in [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]].

[[Herakles]] was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.&lt;ref&gt;''"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardina Deities (Nio)."'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind god===

'''Middle:''' Wind God from (Kızıl), [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century. '''Right:''' Japanese Wind God [[Fūjin]], 17th century.]]Various other artistic influences from the Silk Road can be found in Asia, one of the most striking being that of the Greek Wind God [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], transiting through Central Asia and China to become the Japanese [[Shinto]] wind god [[Fūjin]].&lt;ref&gt;''"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by Boreas/ Oado."'' (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt;

In consistency with Greek iconography for Boreas, the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or "wind bag" in the same general attitude. The abundance of hair have been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.

'''Middle right:''' Japanese temple tile, 7th century, [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. '''Bottom:''' Tile detail from a Japanese contemporary house, [[Tokyo]], 2005.]]Finally, the Greek artistic motif of the floral scroll was transmitted from the Hellenistic world to the area of the [[Tarim Basin]] around the 2nd century CE, as seen in [[Serindian art]] and wooden architectural remains. It then was adopted by China between the 4th and 6th century, where it is found on tiles and ceramics, and was then transmitted to Japan where it is found quite literally in the decoration of the roof tiles of Japanese Buddhist temples from around the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The clearest one are from the 7th century [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in the roof tile decorations of many Japanese traditional-style buildings.

'''Special education''' (also known as '''special needs education''', '''aided education''', '''exceptional education''' or '''Special Ed''') is the practice of educating students in a way that addresses their [[individual differences]] and needs. Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.

Common special needs include [[learning disability|learning disabilities]] (such as [[dyslexia]]), [[communication disorder]]s, [[emotional and behavioral disorders]] (such as [[ADHD]]), [[physical disabilities]] (such as [[osteogenesis imperfecta]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[spina bifida]], and [[Friedreich's ataxia]]), and [[developmental disabilities]] (such as [[autism spectrum disorders]] and [[intellectual disability]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx What is special education?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512043236/http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/SpecialEducation/AboutSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation/WhatIsSpecialEducation.aspx |date=12 May 2009 }} from New Zealand's Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching, the use of technology, a specifically adapted teaching area, or a [[resource room]].

[[Intellectual giftedness]] is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialised teaching techniques or different educational programs, but the term "special education" is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students with disabilities. [[Gifted education]] is handled separately.

Whereas special education is designed specifically for students with special needs, [[remedial education]] can be designed for any students, with or without special needs; the defining trait is simply that they have reached a point of unpreparedness, regardless of why. For example, even people of high [[intelligence]] can be under-prepared if their education was disrupted, for example, by [[internally displaced person|internal displacement]] during [[civil disorder]] or a [[war]].

In most developed countries, educators modify teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environments. Therefore, special education in developed countries is often regarded as a service rather than a place.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Disability. (1994).

The opposite of special education is ''general education''. General education is the standard [[curriculum]] presented without special teaching methods or supports. Students receiving special education services can enroll in a General education setting to learn along with students without disabilities.

==Identifying students or learners with special needs==
[[File:Skolegutt.jpg|alt=A boy wearing a jacket and a backpack|thumb|A six-year-old boy with [[Down syndrome]] is ready for his first day of school.]]
Some children are easily identified as candidates for special needs due to their medical history. They may have been diagnosed with a genetic condition that is associated with [[intellectual disability]], may have various forms of [[brain damage]], may have a [[developmental disorder]], may have visual or hearing disabilities, or other disabilities.

For students with less obvious disabilities, such as those who have learning difficulties, two primary methods have been used for identifying them: the ''discrepancy model'' and the ''response to intervention model''. The discrepancy model depends on the teacher noticing that the students' achievements are noticeably below what is expected. At which the teacher may make the decision for the student to receive support from a special education specialist. Before doing so, the teacher must show documentation of low academic achievement. The [[response to intervention]] model advocates earlier intervention.

In the discrepancy model, a student receives special education services for a specific learning difficulty (SLD) if the student has at least normal intelligence and the student's academic achievement is below what is expected of a student with his or her [[IQ]]. Although the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach (e.g., Aaron, 1995, Flanagan and Mascolo, 2005) among researchers. One reason for criticism is that diagnosing SLDs on the basis of the discrepancy between achievement and IQ does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who also have low IQ appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who have normal or high intelligence.

The alternative approach, [[response to intervention]], identifies children who are having difficulties in school in their first or second year after starting school. They then receive additional assistance such as participating in a [[Reading for special needs|reading remediation]] program. The response of the children to this intervention then determines whether they are designated as having a learning disability. Those few who still have trouble may then receive designation and further assistance. Sternberg (1999) has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses and places undue emphasis on academics by insisting that students should be supported in this arena and not in music or sports.

==Individual needs==
A special education program should be customised to address each individual student's unique needs. Special educators provide a continuum of services, in which students with special needs receives varying degrees of support based on their individual needs. Special education programs need to be individualised so that they address the unique combination of needs in a given student.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite book |author=Goodman, Libby |title=Time and learning in the special education classroom |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y. |year=1990 |page= 122 |isbn=0-7914-0371-8 |oclc=20635959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Canada, and the UK, educational professionals use a student's [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP). Another name for a student's Individualized Education Plan is a student's [[Individual Learning Plan]] (ILP).

"The IEP is meant to address each child’s unique learning issues and include specific educational goals. It is a legally binding document. The school must provide everything it promises in the IEP."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/special-services/ieps/understanding-individualized-education-programs|title=Understanding Individualized Education Programs|website=Understood.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For children who are not yet 3, an [[Individual Family Service Plan]] (IFSP) contains information on the child's present level of development in all areas; outcomes for the child and family; and services the child and family will receive to help them achieve the outcomes.

In the United States, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a federal law that requires that every school system in the nation must provide a free and appropriate public education for every child, ages 3 to 22, regardless of how or how seriously that child may be disabled.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exceptional Learners|last=Hallahan |first=Daniel |publisher=Pearson Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0-13-703370-6|location=Boston|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that this federal law is obeyed, the government requires every school system provide this type of education to each student in order to receive federal funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Special Education Process.jpg|thumb|Procedure that a person must follow in order to receive special education accommodations]]
Students with special needs are assessed to determine their specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Goodman /&gt; The earlier these students with special needs are assessed, the better it is for them to get the accommodations that they need in order for them to get the most out of their education. Placement, resources, and goals are determined on the basis of the student's needs. Accommodations and Modifications to the regular program may include changes in the curriculum, supplementary aides or equipment, and the provision of specialized physical adaptations that allow students to participate in the educational environment as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_one/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107145830/http://www.weac.org/Issues_Advocacy/Resource_Pages_On_Issues_One/Special_Education/special_education_inclusion.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may need this help to access subject matter, physically gain access to the school, or meet their emotional needs. For example, if the assessment determines that the student cannot write by hand because of a physical disability, then the school might provide a computer for typing assignments, or allow the student to answer questions verbally instead. If the school determines that the student is severely distracted by the normal activities in a large, busy classroom, then the student might be placed in a smaller classroom such as a [[resource room]].

Parent of students with a learning disability must know what type of disability their child has, so they can get accommodations such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and adaptive physical education.For example, if a student takes an academic test and it indicates that the student struggles with reading comprehension, parents can request speech and language support or classroom accommodations, such as extra time to complete reading and writing tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Special Education Process Explained|url=http://www.specialeducationguide.com/pre-k-12/what-is-special-education/the-special-education-process-explained/|website=Special Education Guide|accessdate=22 March 2016|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools use different approaches to providing special education services to students. These approaches can be broadly grouped into four categories, according to how much contact the student with special needs has with non-disabled students (using North American terminology):

* ''[[Inclusion (education)|Inclusion]]:'' In this approach, students with special needs spend all, or most of the school day with students who do not have special needs. Because inclusion can require substantial modification of the general curriculum, most schools use it only for selected students with mild to moderate special needs, which is accepted as a [[best practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smith P |title=Have we made any progress?

Students may occasionally leave the regular classroom to attend smaller, more intensive instructional sessions in a [[resource room]], or to receive other related services that might require specialised equipment or might be disruptive to the rest of the class, such as [[speech and language therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[rehabilitation counseling]]. They might also leave the regular classroom for services that require privacy, such as counseling sessions with a [[social worker]].&lt;ref name=Bowe&gt;{{cite book |author=Bowe, Frank |title=Making Inclusion Work |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-13-017603-6 |oclc=54374653}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstreaming]]'' refers to the practice of educating students with [[special needs]] in classes with non-disabled students during specific time periods based on their skills. Students with special needs are segregated in separate classes exclusively for students with special needs for the rest of the school day.&lt;ref name="Teachers, Schools, and Society"&gt;{{cite book

* ''Segregation'' in a separate classroom or special school for students with special needs: In this model, students with special needs do not attend classes with non-disabled students. Segregated students may attend the same school where regular classes are provided, but spend all instructional time exclusively in a separate classroom for students with special needs. If their special class is located in an ordinary school, they may be provided opportunities for social integration outside the classroom, such as by eating meals with non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html Warnock Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111230317/http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/warnock/warnock07.html |date=11 January 2013 }} (1978).

Students who have been [[suspension (punishment)|suspended]] or [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] are not considered excluded in this sense.
* ‘’[[Co-Teaching]]:’’ In this setting, students with disabilities are placed in a General education classroom to learn along with their disabled peers and non-disabled peers. A General Education teacher and a Special Education teacher work as partners in instruction.

===Effective Instruction for students with disabilities===

* ''Goal Directed'': Each child must have an individualised Education Program (IEP) that distinguishes his/her particular needs. The child must get the services that are designed for him/her. These services will allow him/her to reach his/her annual goals which will be assessed at the end of each term along with short-term goals that will be assessed every few months.
* ''Research-Based Methods''- There has been a lot of research done about students with disabilities and the best way to teach them. Testing, IQs, interviews, the discrepancy model, etc. should all be used to determine where to place the child. Once that is determined, the next step is the best way for the child to learn. There are plenty of different programs such as the Wilson Reading Program and Direct Instruction
* ''Guided by student performance''- While the IEP goals may be assessed every few months to a year, constant informal assessments must take place. These assessments will guide instruction for the teacher. The teacher will be able to determine if the material is too difficult or to easy.&lt;ref name="Bos, C. S. 2005"&gt;Bos, C. S. &amp; Vaughn, S. (2005). Strategies for teaching students with learning and behavior problems. (6th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special schools===
A ''special school'' is a school catering for students who have special educational needs due to [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]], physical [[disabilities]] or behavioural problems. Special schools may be specifically designed, staffed and resourced to provide appropriate special education for children with additional needs. Students attending special schools generally do not attend any classes in mainstream schools.

Special schools provide individualised education, addressing specific needs. Student to teacher ratios are kept low, often 6:1 or lower depending upon the needs of the children. Special schools will also have other facilities for children with special needs, such as soft play areas, [[Sensory perception|sensory]] rooms, or [[swimming pool]]s, which are necessary for treating students with certain conditions.

In recent times, places available in special schools are declining as more children with special needs are educated in [[Inclusion (education)|mainstream schools]]. However, there will always be some children, whose learning needs cannot be appropriately met in a regular classroom setting and will require specialised education and resources to provide the level of support they require. An example of a disability that may require a student to attend a special school is intellectual disability. However, this practice is often frowned upon by school districts in the US in the light of Least Restrictive Environment as mandated in the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, Ron (2002). "Exceptional Lives: Special Education in Today's Schools (3rd ed.)Merrill Prentice Hall. New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative is a '''special unit''' or '''special classroom''', also called a '''self-contained classroom''', which is a separate room or rooms dedicated solely to the education of students with special needs within a larger school that also provides general education. These classrooms are typically staffed by specially trained teachers, who provide specific, individualised instruction to individuals and small groups of students with special needs. Self-contained classrooms, because they are located in a general education school, may have students who remain in the self-contained classroom full-time, or students who are [[mainstreaming (education)|included]] in certain general education classes. In the United States a part-time alternative that is appropriate for some students is sometimes called a [[resource room]].

====History of special schools====
One of the first special schools in the world was the [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles]] in Paris, which was founded in 1784. It was the first school in the world to teach [[Blindness|blind]] students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=/pages-infos/pages/informations_generales/presentation_de_l_inja/histoire-inja/histoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 History of the INJA]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233247/http://www.inja.fr/inja/htmgen/SimHTMLGen.asp?FORM=0&amp;STYLE=2&amp;URL=%2Fpages-infos%2Fpages%2Finformations_generales%2Fpresentation_de_l_inja%2Fhistoire-inja%2Fhistoirinja_sommaire.xhtml&amp;CSS=1 |date=20 July 2011 }} {{Fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first school in U.K, for the Deaf was established 1760 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/DeafStudiesTeaching/deafed/Session%202A.htm |title=Session 2A |publisher=Bris.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922095519/http://www.connerprairie.org/Learn-And-Do/Indiana-History/America-1800-1860/Education-Of-The-Deaf.aspx |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Edinburgh by [[Thomas Braidwood]], with education for [[Blindness and education|visually impaired]] people beginning in the Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765.

In the 19th century, people with disabilities and the inhumane conditions where they were supposedly housed and educated were addressed in the literature of [[Charles Dickens]]. Dickens characterized people with severe disabilities as having the same, if not more, compassion and insight in [[Bleak House]] and [[Little Dorrit]].&lt;ref&gt;''The history of special education: From isolation to integration''. MA Winzer&lt;/ref&gt;

Such attention to the downtrodden conditions of people with disabilities brought resulted in reforms in Europe including the re-evaluation of special schools. In the United States reform came more slowly. Throughout the mid half of the 20th century, special schools, termed institutions, were not only accepted, but encouraged. Students with disabilities were housed with people with [[mental illness]]es, and they were not educated much, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;Inventing the feeble mind: A history of mental retardation in the United States. S McCuen – ''Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law'', 1997 – Duke Univ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Deinstitutionalization proceeded in the US beginning in the 1970s following the exposes of the institutions, and it has taken sometime before the Education for All Handicapped Children's Act of 1974, to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and then Individuals with Disabilities Educational Improvement Act (IDEIA) have come into fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull, H. R., Beegle, R. &amp; Stowe, M.J. (2007). Public policy and developmental disabilities: A 35-year retrospective and a 5-year prospective on the core concepts in disability. In: S. Odom, R.H. Horner, M.E. Snell, &amp; J. Blacher, ''Handbook on Developmental Disabilities'', 15-34. London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; School integration was supported as early as the 1970s, and teacher preparation programs in higher education have carefully taught and instructed graduates on inclusion at the classroom, individual, school, and district levels for decades resulting in dual certification of "regular teachers".

With the Amendments to the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997]], school districts in the United States began to slowly integrate students with moderate and severe special needs into regular school systems. This changed the form and function of special education services in many school districts and special schools subsequently saw a steady decrease in enrollment as districts weighed the cost per student. It also posed general funding dilemmas to certain local schools and districts, changed how schools view assessments, and formally introduced the concept of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]] to many educators, students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, C.M. (1998). ''Restructuring high school for all students: Taking inclusion to the next level''. Baltimore: Paul H. Brooks Publishing co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instructional strategies==
{{Anchor|Modifications|Accommodations}}
&lt;!--  This section does not discuss *where* the student is taught.  Please discuss *how* the student is taught.  --&gt;

The student can be taught in either a classroom or outside environment. Both environments can be interactive for the student to engage better with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;http://rse.sagepub.com/content/9/6/29.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;

Different instructional techniques are used for some students with special educational needs. Instructional strategies are classified as being either ''accommodations'' or ''modifications''.

An ''accommodation'' is a reasonable adjustment to teaching practices so that the student learns the same material, but in a format that is more accessible to the student. Accommodations may be classified by whether they change the presentation, response, setting, or scheduling of lessons.&lt;ref name=Ofqual&gt;{{cite report

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the school may modify a reading assignment for a student with reading difficulties by substituting a shorter, easier book. A student may receive both accommodations and modifications.

;Examples of modifications:
* Skipping subjects: Students may be taught less information than typical students, skipping over material that the school deems inappropriate for the student's abilities or less important than other subjects. For example, students with poor fine motor skills may be taught to print [[block letters]], but not [[cursive]] handwriting.
* Simplified assignments: Students may read the same literature as their peers but have a simpler version, such as Shakespeare with both the original text and a modern paraphrase available.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson, Sue.  "Macbeth in the Resource Room: Students with Learning Disabilities Study Shakespeare."  ''Journal of Learning Disabilities'', v28 n9 p575-81 Nov 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shorter assignments: Students may do shorter homework assignments or take shorter, more concentrated tests.
* Extra aids: If students have deficiencies in working memory, a list of vocabulary words, called a ''word bank'', can be provided during tests, to reduce lack of recall and increase chances of comprehension. Students might use a calculator when other students do not.
* Extended time: Students with a slower processing speed may benefit from extended time for assignments and/or tests in order to have more time to comprehend questions, recall information, and synthesize knowledge.
* Students can be offered a flexible setting in which to take tests. These settings can be a new location to provide for minimal distractions.

;Examples of accommodations:
* Response accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Typing homework assignments rather than hand-writing them (considered a modification if the subject is [[penmanship|learning to write by hand]]). Having someone else write down answers given verbally.
* Presentation accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Examples include listening to [[audiobook]]s rather than reading printed books. These may be used as substitutes for the text, or as supplements intended to improve the students' reading fluency and phonetic skills. Similar options include designating a person to read to the student, or providing [[text to speech]] software. This is considered a modification if the purpose of the assignment is [[Learning to read|reading skills acquisition]]. Other presentation accommodations may include designating a person to take notes during lectures or using a talking [[calculator]] rather than one with only a visual display.
* Setting accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual/&gt; Taking a test in a quieter room. Moving the class to a room that is physically accessible, e.g., on the first floor of a building or near an [[elevator]]. Arranging seating assignments to benefit the student, e.g., by sitting at the front of the classroom.
* Scheduling accommodations:&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students may be given rest breaks or extended time on tests (may be considered a modification, if speed is a factor in the test). Use a timer to help with time management.

All developed countries permit or require some degree of accommodation for students with special needs, and special provisions are usually made in examinations which take place at the end of formal schooling.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

In addition to how the student is taught the academic curriculum, schools may provide non-academic services to the student. These are intended ultimately to increase the student's personal and academic abilities. Related services include developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as are required to assist a student with special needs and includes [[speech and language pathology]], [[audiology]], psychological services, [[physical therapy]], [[occupational therapy]], counseling services, including [[rehabilitation counseling]], orientation and mobility services, medical services as defined by regulations, parent counseling and training, school health services, school social work, assistive technology services, other appropriate developmental or corrective support services, appropriate access to recreation and other appropriate support services.&lt;ref name="Related Services"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, most related services are provided by the schools; in others, they are provided by the normal healthcare and social services systems.

As an example, students who have [[autistic spectrum disorder]]s, poor impulse control, or other behavioral challenges may learn self-management techniques, be kept closely on a comfortingly predictable schedule, or given extra cues to signal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Simpson, Richard L. |author2=Sonja R. de Boer |title=Successful inclusion for students with autism: creating a complete, effective ASD inclusion program |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco |year=2009 |pages=38–42 |isbn=0-470-23080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A university field, termed ''severe disabilities'', also is taught throughout the US university sector in schools of education. Advanced instruction is based upon community-referenced instruction, and alignment with transition to adulthood and progressive community practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Snell, M.E. |author2=Brown, F. |year=2011 |title=Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities |edition=7th |publisher=Pearson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehabilitation counseling personnel are often association with [[supported employment]] services, and typically with "transition to adulthood" &lt;ref&gt;Rusch, F.R., DeStefano, L., Chadsey-Rusch, J., Phelps, L.A., &amp; Szymanski, E. (1992). ''Transition from School to Adult Life: Models, Linkages and Policies''. Sycamore, IL:Sycamore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, D. &amp; Ferguson, P. (1987/2011). The promise of adulthood. In: M. Snell &amp; F. Brown, ''Instruction of Students with Severe Disabilities''. Madrid: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; in which multi-decade recommendations for better coordination between the school and the community service sectors have been made at the federal and university levels.

==Issues==
At-risk students (those with educational needs that are not associated with a disability) are often placed in classes with students who have disabilities. Critics assert that placing at-risk students in the same classes as students with disabilities may impede the educational progress of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greenwood CR |title=Longitudinal analysis of time, engagement, and achievement in at-risk versus non-risk students |journal=Except Child |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=May 1991  |pmid=2070811 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some special education classes have been criticized for a watered-down curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/Watering_Up_the_Curriculum_for_Adolescents_with_Learning_Disabilities,_Part_I:_Goals_of_the_Knowledge_Dimension |title=Watering Up the Curriculum for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities, Part I: Goals of the Knowledge Dimension |accessdate=2010-04-21 |last=Ellis |first=Edwin |year=2002 |publisher=WETA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of inclusion (in mainstream classrooms) has been criticized by advocates and some parents of children with special needs because some of these students require instructional methods that differ dramatically from typical classroom methods. Critics assert that it is not possible to deliver effectively two or more very different instructional methods in the same classroom. As a result, the educational progress of students who depend on different instructional methods to learn often fall even further behind their peers.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://publicculture.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/citation/13/3/349 |title=The Critical Limits of Embodiment: Disability's Criticism |author=Carol A.

Parents of typically developing children sometimes fear that the special needs of a single "fully included" student will take critical levels of attention and energy away from the rest of the class and thereby impair the academic achievements of all students.&lt;ref name=Breckenridge/&gt;

Linked to this, there is debate about the extent to which students with special needs, whether in mainstream or special settings, should have a specific pedagogy, based on the scientific study of particular diagnostic categories, or whether general instructional techniques are relevant to all students including those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lews|first1=Ann|last2=Norwich|first2=Brahm|title=Special Teaching for Special Children?|date=2005|publisher=Open University Press|location=Milton Keynes, UK|isbn=0335214053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mintz|first1=Joseph|title=Professional Uncertainty, Knowledge and Relationship in the Classroom: A Psycho-social Perspective|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415822961|url=http://routledge-ny.com/books/details/9780415822961/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parents, advocates, and students have concerns about the eligibility criteria and their application. In some cases, parents and students protest the students' placement into special education programs. For example, a student may be placed into the special education programs due to a mental health condition such as [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[panic attack]]s or [[ADHD]], while the student and his parents believe that the condition is adequately managed through medication and outside therapy. In other cases, students whose parents believe they require the additional support of special education services are denied participation in the program based on the eligibility criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001996968|title=Development And Validation Of A Process For Screening Referrals To Special Education |author=Amanda M. Vanderheyden |author2=Joseph C Witt |author3=Gale Naquin  |year=2003 |journal=School Psychology Review|volume=32 |publisher=Research and Read Books, Journals, Articles at Questia Online Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether it is useful and appropriate to attempt to educate the most severely disabled children, such as children who are in a [[persistent vegetative state]], is debated. While many severely disabled children can learn simple tasks, such as pushing a buzzer when they want attention, some children may be incapable of learning. Some parents and advocates say that these children would be better served by substituting improved physical care for any academic program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/education/20donovan.html?pagewanted=all
|title = A Struggle to Educate the Severely Disabled
|newspaper = The New York Times
|author = Otterman, Sharon
|date = 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, they question whether teaching such non-academic subjects, such as pushing a buzzer, is properly the job of the school system, rather than the health care system.

Another large issue is the lack of resources enabling individuals with special needs to receive an education in the developing world. As a consequence, 98 percent of children with [[Disability and Poverty|special needs in developing countries]] do not have access to education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue would be budget cuts. Cuts can affect special education students who don't have access to proper equipment or education. The National Coalition for Personal Shortages did a survey and almost 100% of the teachers said that they are not able to give the proper rights to children with disabilities. Teachers are getting cut off from work due to the budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f8ad9957-dcd5-4bd6-9000-d2db068bc640@sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4201{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{full citation needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a financial debate that covers the use and allotment of special education government funding. The three views on this topic are that we spend too much money on it, there is not enough money put into it or that the money that is given isn't being spent properly. The argument for the first is that the amount of money spent on one special needs child is enough to cover a large group of general education students, and sometimes even causes several students to suffer budget cuts on general programs to support one child. The evidence for special education not having enough money is the lack of teachers, burnt out teachers and a limited variety of teaching tools for each student. The argument to spend the money differently states that there is a lot of money set aside, but that it is being wasted by spending too much time on paperwork, inefficient IEP meetings or spending money on things that don't actually benefit the child.&lt;ref&gt;https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED427399&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global issues ===
Children with disabilities are often denied their right to education. However, little is known about their school attendance patterns. The collection of data on children with disabilities is not straightforward, but data are vital to ensure that policies are in place to address the constraints these children face.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location= |pages=44, Box 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|first=|year=2014|title=Teaching and Learning: Achieving quality for all|url=|journal=EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013-2014|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one estimate, 93 million children under age 14, or 5.1% of the world's children, were living with a ‘moderate or severe disability’ in 2004. According to the World Health Survey, in 14 of 15 low and middle income countries, people of working age with disabilities were about one-third less likely to have completed primary school. For example, in [[Bangladesh]], 30% of people with disabilities had completed primary school, compared with 48% of those with no disabilities. The corresponding shares were 43% and 57% in [[Zambia]]; 56% and 72% in [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

It has been shown that children with a higher risk of disability are far more likely to be denied a chance to go to school. In Bangladesh, [[Bhutan]] and [[Iraq]], children with mental impairments were most likely to be denied this right. In Iraq, for instance, 10% of 6- to 9-year-olds with no risk of disability had never been to school in 2006, but 19% of those at risk of having a hearing impairment and 51% of those who were at higher risk of mental disability had never been to school. In [[Thailand]], almost all 6- to 9-year-olds who had no disability had been to school in 2005/06, and yet 34% of those with walking or moving impairments had never been to school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

Children with disabilities require access to services that can support them throughout their time in school, such as more individual attention from instructors. According to the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, about 2% of children with disabilities have access to these services. Those without access to these services are excluded from education and unable to attend school.

;South Africa

Both modifications and accommodations are recommended, depending on the student's individual needs.

;Japan
{{Main|Education in Japan}}

Japanese students with special needs are placed in one of four different school arrangements: [[special school]]s, special classrooms with another school, in [[resource rooms]] (which are called ''tsukyu''), or in regular classrooms.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special schools are reserved for students whose severe disabilities cannot be accommodated in the local school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; They do not use the same grading or marking systems as mainstream schools, but instead assess students according to their individualized plans.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Special classes are similar, and may vary the national curriculum as the teachers see fit. ''Tsukyu'' are [[resource room]]s that students with milder problems use part-time for specialized instruction individually in small groups. These students spend the rest of the day in the mainstream classroom. Some students with special needs are fully included in the mainstream classroom, with accommodations or modifications as needed.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more disabled students.

;Pakistan
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
After independence (1947), Pakistan had to face some serious challenges, due to which no proper emphasis was given to special education and even education. Among other reasons, lack of resources, financial as well as human, was the major one in this context. The need and importance of special education was felt in different educational policies of Pakistan in different times. At the first time, in its report, the Commission on National Education (1959) highlighted the importance of special education. After that the Education Policy (1972) and the National Policy and Implementation Programme (1979) gave some importance to this sector. The same was also reflected in different medium-term (five-year) plans. This was felt more seriously when the Directorate General of Special Education, Islamabad formulated a draft National Policy for Special Education in 1986 and revised it in 1988 to bring it in line with the emerging needs of special/disabled population. After that a special education policy was launched in 1999. Recently, Government of Pakistan has launched a new National Policy for Persons with Disabilities 2002, which is dynamically being implemented.

Special education is regulated centrally by the Singapore Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Both [[special school]]s and integration into mainstream schools are options for students with special educational needs, but most students with disabilities are placed in special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students with special education who wish accommodations on national exams must provide appropriate documentation to prove that they are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations, but not modifications (e.g., simpler questions) are normally approved if they are similar to the accommodations already being used in everyday schoolwork, with the goal of maintaining the exam's integrity while not having students unfairly disadvantaged by factors that are unrelated to what is being tested. The accommodations are listed on the Primary School Leaving Exam.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

With respect to standardized tests, special consideration procedures are in place in all states for students who are disabled.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students must provide documentation Not all desired forms of accommodations are available. For example, students who cannot read, even if the inability to read is due to a disability, cannot have the exam read to them, because the exam results should accurately show that the student is unable to read. Reports on matriculation exams do not mention whether the student received any accommodations in taking the test.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

[[File:Kötitz Rathaus.JPG|thumb|A special school for children with special emotional needs in Kötitz, Germany]]

Most students with special needs in Germany attend a [[special school]] that serves only children with special needs. These include:
* ''Förderschule für Lernbehinderte'' (special school for learning disabilities): for children who have challenges that impair learning
* ''Förderschule mit dem Förderschwerpunkt Geistige Entwicklung'' (school for cognitive development): for children with very severe learning challenges
* ''Förderschule Schwerpunkt emotionale und soziale Entwicklung'' (school for emotional and social development): for children who have special emotional needs
* ''Förderschule für Blinde'' (school for the blind): for blind children
* ''Förderschule für Sehbehinderte'' (school for the visually impaired): for children who are visually challenged
* ''Förderschule für Gehörlose'' (school for the deaf): for deaf children
* ''Förderschule für Schwerhörige'' (school for the hearing impaired): for children who are hearing impaired
* ''Förderschule für Körperbehinderte'' (school for children with physical disabilities): for children with physical disabilities
* ''Förderschule für Sprachbehinderte'' (school for children with language disorders): for children with language disorders
* ''Förderschule für Taubblinde'' (school for the deafblind): for children who are deafblind
* ''Schule für Kranke'' (school for ill children): for children who are too ill to attend school or are hospitalized for a longer period of time.
* ''Förderschule für schwer mehrfach Behinderte'' (school for children with severe and multiple disabilities): for children with severe and multiple disabilities who need very special care and attention. Sometimes these children are only susceptible for very basic emotional and sensory stimulation. Thus teachers at these school (as well as at schools for the deafblind) are highly specialized professionals.

One in 21 German students attends a special school. Teachers at those schools are specially trained professionals who have specialized in special needs education while in university. Special schools often have a very favorable student-teacher ratio and facilities other schools do not have.

Some special needs children in Germany do not attend a special school, but are educated in a mainstream school such as a [[Hauptschule]] or [[Gesamtschule]] (comprehensive school).

Students with special educational needs may be exempted from standardized tests or given modified tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Greece

Greek students with special needs may attend either mainstream schools or special schools.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Students whose disabilities have been certified may be exempted from some standardized tests or given alternative tests.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Accommodations are responsive to students' needs; for example, students with visual impairments may take oral tests, and students with hearing impairments take written tests. Accommodations and modifications are noted on the certificate of achievement.

As a general rule, students with special educational needs are integrated into their regular, mainstream schools with appropriate support, under the "Going to School Together" policy (''Weer Samen Naar School'').&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Four types of disability-specific special schools exist. The national policy is moving towards "suitable education" (''passend onderwijs''), based on the individual's strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''Norway'''

The National Support System for Special Needs Education (Statped) is managed by the [[Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training]]. The general objective for Statped is to give guidance and support to those in charge of the education in municipalities and county administrations to ensure that children, young people and adults with major and special educational needs are secured well-advised educational and developmental provisions. The institutions affiliated with Statped offer a broad spectrum of services. Statped consists of 13 resource centres owned by the State, and 4 units for special education, where Statped buys services. These centres offer special educational guidance and support for local authorities and county administrations.

Students with disabilities have a "guaranteed right" to appropriate accommodations on assessments.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Schools are generally considered autonomous.

;Slovenia

On national tests, the National Examination Center normally grants most requests for accommodations that are supported by the local school's examination committee. Legislation opposes the use of modifications that would be unfair to non-disabled students.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Spain

Schools are required to provide services and resources to students with special educational needs so that they make progress and participate in school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; If the local school is unable to provide appropriately for an individual student, then the student may be transferred to a special school.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

Spanish non-governmental organizations like [[ONCE]] have traditionally provided significant services to students with disabilities.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

;Sweden

Local schools have significant autonomy, based on national guidelines. Schools are expected to help students meet the goals that are set for them.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

There are special schools (Swedish:Särskola) for students with low abilities to attend normal education. There has in 2012-2013 been media criticism on the fact that students with light problems such as [[dyslexia]] have been placed in special schools, seriously hampering their chances on the labour market.

;Switzerland

Education is controlled by the 26 cantons, and so special education programs vary from place to place.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; However, integration is typical.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt; Students are assessed according to their individual learning goals.&lt;ref name=Ofqual /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

In [[England and Wales]] the [[acronym]] ''SEN'' for [[Special Educational Needs]] denotes the condition of having special educational needs, the services which provide the support and the programmes and staff which implement the education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |title=Special education needs, Special needs education |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306171514/http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/wholeschool/sen/ |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England ''SEN PPS'' refers to the Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Service. ''SENAS'' is the special educational needs assessment service, which is part of the Local Authority. ''SENCO'' refers to a special educational needs coordinator, who usually works with schools and the children within schools who have special educational needs. The Special Educational Needs Parent Partnership Services help parents with the planning and delivery of their child's educational provision. The [[Department for Education]] oversees special education in England.

Most students have an individual educational plan, but students may have a group plan in addition to, or instead of, an individual plan. Group plans are used when a group of students all have similar goals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5vhVPZoIG?url=http://education.staffordshire.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/6C2C3FF2-43F1-40A4-AB6F-77E4CC4602F6/22865/SENCOResourceCentreCompletedocument2.pdf Management of Inclusion].  The SENCO Resource Centre, part 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Scotland]] the [[Additional Support Needs Act]] places an obligation on education authorities to meet the needs of all students in consultation with other agencies and parents. In [[Scotland]] the term Special Educational Needs (SEN), and its variants are not official terminology although the very recent implementation of the [[Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004|Additional Support for Learning Act]] means that both ''SEN'' and ''ASN'' (Additional Support Needs) are used interchangeably in current common practice.

;Turkey

At a young age students who have special needs in Turkey are provided special education from [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|The Ministry of Education]], who are responsible in giving them the education that they need.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|title=Special Needs Education in Turkey - Turkey - Angloinfo|work=Angloinfo|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417154851/https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/turkey/family/schooling-education/special-needs-education|archive-date=17 April 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to get special education you are required certain things:
* "Residency certificate&amp;nbsp;
* Written application by the parents to the school administration&amp;nbsp;
* Personal development report of the child (if already registered)&amp;nbsp;
* Child's health report from the hospital." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (BEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Özel Eğitim Kurumları Yönetmeliği]] (ÖEKY) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs. Government-run schools provide special education in varying degrees from the least restrictive settings, such as full inclusion, to the most restrictive settings, such as segregation in a [[special school]].

The education offered by the school must be appropriate to the student's individual needs. Schools are not required to maximize the student's potential or to provide the best possible services. Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.

As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.

Before 1978, little action was taken to educate children with disabilities in Columbia. Children would be left home without much interaction with the outside world. In 1985, special education was researched across the country and education programs were created.

The history of special education in Colombia can be categorized into three time periods: the period of neglect, the period of diagnosis and planning, and the emergence of special education. The period of planning ran from the years 1978 to the year 1990. The Ministry of Colombia in 1995 implemented a national plan for the development of special education called "Plan Nacional para el Desarrollo de la Education Especial". The purposes of the plan was to create a national diagnosis of special education and to initiate programs for individuals with disabilities. In 1994, the Ministry of education put the first law into action to introduce special classes in public schools that include students with disabilities, called Law 115. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuadros|first=Jose|date=May 2005|title=The Status of Disability in Colombia and the Importance of Parental Perceptions on the Development of Special Education|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ966524.pdf|journal=Teaching Exceptional Children Plus|volume=1|pages=8|via=google scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2011, Colombia entered into the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kamenopoulou|first=Leda|date=2018|title=Inclusive Education in the global South?

The most recent development of special education in Colombia was Article 11 of Law 1618, which was passed in 2013. The law states that "the Ministry of Education will define the policy and regulate the scheme of education for persons with special educational needs, promoting educational access and quality under a system based on inclusion in the educational services".

All special-needs students receive an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) that outlines how the school will meet the student's individual needs. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) requires that students with special needs be provided with a [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] in the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] that is appropriate to the student's needs.

Unlike most of the developed world, American schools are also required to provide many medical services, such as [[speech therapy]], if the student needs these services.

According to the Department of Education, approximately 6 million children (roughly 10 percent of all school-aged children) currently receive some type of special education services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.rethinkingschools.org/restrict.asp?path=archive/16_03/Hist163.shtml |title=The History of Special Education|author=Priscilla Pardini |year= 2002 |journal=Rethinking Schools |volume=16 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most countries in the world, students who are poor, ethnic minorities, or do not speak the dominant language fluently are disproportionately identified as needing special education services.&lt;ref name=Blanchett /&gt; Poor, black and Latino urban schools are more likely to have limited resources and to employ inexperienced teachers that do not cope well with student behavior problems, "thereby increasing the number of students they referred to special education."&lt;ref&gt;Tejeda-Delgado, M.

During the 1960s, in some part due to the [[civil rights movement]], some researchers began to study the disparity of education amongst people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ladson-Billings, Gloria |title=The dreamkeepers: successful teachers of African American children |publisher=Jossey-Bass Publishers |location=San Francisco |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=1-55542-668-9 |oclc=30072651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision, which declared unconstitutional the "[[separate but equal]]" arrangements in public schools for students of different races, paved the way for [[PARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] and [[Mills vs. Board of Education of District of Columbia]], which challenged the segregation of students with special needs. Courts ruled that unnecessary and inappropriate segregation of students with disabilities was unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=Blanchett&gt;Blanchett, W. J. (2009). A retrospective examination of urban education: From "brown" to the resegregation of African Americans in special education—it is time to "go for broke". Urban Education, 44(4), 370–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded to these court rulings with the federal [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] in 1975 (since renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)). This law required schools to provide services to students previously denied access to an appropriate education.

== Integrating technology in special ed. classrooms ==

=== Autism ===
Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), refers to a range of conditions. These conditions involve challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. They also involve unique strengths and differences. 

[[Autism]] is known as a disability that impairs the social interactions and communication skills of a person. People who are autistic tend to think and act differently than others. Many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) find themselves comfortable with a device in their hands.&amp;nbsp;For students with autism, there are apps called "visual scene displays" that are most helpful for children who are having difficulty with verbal skills, according to Jules Csillag, a speech-language pathologist who focuses on special ed tech. Apps such as SceneSpeak and Speech with Milo help autistic children develop storytelling skills with text-to-speech voice and interactive storybooks. Using apps like these in a classroom can improve autistic student's verbal skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/20/teaching-technology-autism_n_6865030.html|title=The Technology That's Giving Students With Autism a Greater Voice|date=2015-04-20|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several controversies surrounding the diagnoses and causes of autism. It's now believed that there's no single cause of autism. Research seems to suggest that autism is normally the result of both genetic and environmental influences.

=== Down syndrome ===
If a student has [[down syndrome]], [[assistive technology]] can help with their learning experience. Author of&amp;nbsp;''Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together,''&amp;nbsp;Terry Hassold, who got his PhD in human genetics, explains that students with Down syndrome have delays with cognitive ability. Their brains have a late reaction when their neurological system sends a message for any task. Because of this late reaction, they tend to take longer to complete a task than an average students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Down_Syndrome.html?id=wuh9OlwsWaQC|title=Down Syndrome: A Promising Future, Together|last=Hassold|first=Terry J.|last2=Patterson|first2=David|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471296867|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology is crucial in helping Down's students with their writing ability. Down syndrome children tend to have shorter, stubbier fingers and a lowered thumb making their ability to write more difficult. Also, some of the usual wrist bones are not formed, making it difficult to hold objects. Slanted desks are one type of assisted technology that can aid in the successful ability to write. A three-ring binder can be used to create a slanted desk by turning the binder sideways. Also, students with Down's often try to hold their pencils by anchoring them against the thumb rather than using the tip of their thumb. Shortened pencils or triangular-shaped pencils encourage students to hold them correctly. Using any of these assistive technologies can help down syndrome students during their educational process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downsyndromepossibilities.blogspot.com/p/assisstive-technology.html|title=Down Syndrome: Assisstive Technology|website=Down Syndrome|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Today many people with disabilities are breaking barriers through the use of technology. For some individuals with disabilities, assistive technology is a necessary tool that enables them to engage in or perform many tasks. Integrating technology will allow students to increase their self-confidence, self-motivation, independence and they will also be able to engage in different activities within the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hfdss006/conf/2002/proceedings/16.htm|title=2002 Conference Proceedings|website=www.csun.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry''' ('''SUNY-ESF''', or '''ESF''') is an American, specialized, doctoral-granting institution based in [[Syracuse, New York]]. It is immediately adjacent to [[Syracuse University]], within which it was founded, and with whom it maintains a special relationship. ESF is a part of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system. ESF also operates facilities in the [[Adirondack Park]] (including the [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York|Wanakena]]), the [[Thousand Islands]], elsewhere in central New York, and [[Costa Rica]]. The College's curricula focus on the understanding, [[natural resource management|management]] and [[sustainability]] of the environment and natural resources. ESF is considered by [[Peterson's]] to be the premier college in the U.S. for the study of environmental and natural sciences, design, engineering, policy and management of natural resources and the environment.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersons.com/college-search/state-university-of-new-york-college-of-environmental-science-and-forestry-000_10000544.aspx|title=State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|publisher=Peterson's|accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has expanded its initial emphasis on forestry to include professional education in environmental science, landscape architecture, environmental studies, and engineering in addition to distinguished programs in the biological and physical sciences.&lt;ref name="petersons.com"/&gt; ESF is ranked at 43rd in the 2017 ''US News &amp; World Report'' rankings of the top public national universities.&lt;ref name=usnwr2019 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/suny-environmental-science-and-forestry-2851|title=SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry - SUNY Environmental Science and Forestry - Best College - US News|publisher=|accessdate=13 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commemorated its centennial in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/centennial/ |title=SUNY-ESF Centennial Celebration |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|History of the New York State College of Forestry}}

=== Founding ===

The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established in 1911 through a bill signed by [[New York (state)|New York]] Governor [[John Alden Dix]]. The previous year, Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes|Hughes]] had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, A.D. ''Liberty Hyde Bailey: A Story of American Plant Sciences''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bills followed the state's defunding, in 1903, of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=October 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cornell_Roots-of-American-Forestry-Education.pdf |format=PDF |title=Roots of American Forestry Education |website=Foresthistory.org |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a unit of [[Syracuse University]], in 1913, the College was made a separate, legal entity.

Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill [[Forest Preserve (New York)]], became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135440/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Herbert Alpert| title = Louis Marshall: 1856-1929| date = 2008-11-03| isbn = 978-0-595-48230-6| page = 36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was elected president of the college's Board of Trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Marshall,"Champion of Liberty", selected papers and addresses(in 2 volumes), edited by Charles Reznikoff,1957. Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dean of the College was [[William L. Bray]], a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/ecology/aepsp3.html |title=American Environmental Photographs, 1891-1936 - Ecology and the American Environment (American Memory from the Library of Congress) |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of [[Gifford Pinchot]], who was the first Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = William L.

April 4, 2008. Volume 61 Issue 9. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/BRAY1865.htm Chrono-Biographical Sketch: William Bray]". A Biographical History of Biogeography by Charles H. Smith, Ph.D., Joshua Woleben, and Carubie Rodgers/ Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published ''The Development of the Vegetation of New York State'', he became one of the founding members, along with [[Raphael Zon]] and [[Yale School of Forestry]]'s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/ |title=The Ecological Society of America's History and Records – by the ESA Historical Records Committee |publisher=Esa.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the 1917 "activist wing" of that Society formed today's [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html |title=New York Nature Conservation, Environment Issues &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325075148/http://www.nature.org/wherewework/northamerica/states/newyork/preserves/art25679.html# |archive-date=2010-03-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/pressroom/ip/press/forests.html |title=Conservation &amp; Green News &amp;#124; The Nature Conservancy |publisher=Nature.org |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the professors, in the early years of the College of Forestry at Syracuse and the Department of Forestry at Cornell's [[New York State College of Agriculture]] were educated in forestry at the [[Yale School of Forestry]]. The forestry students at Syracuse but not at Cornell were referred to as "stumpies" by their classmates.

Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school's first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;SUNY-ESF. 2008. ''Alumni Directory. 100th Anniversary Edition''. Syracuse, NY, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the hallmarks of the College, its research, dates back to 1912, beginning with a study on what firms were using lumber in the state of New York as well as the wood species and quantities.

=== Expansion ===

In 1912, the College opened its [[SUNY-ESF Ranger School|Ranger School]] in [[Wanakena, New York]], in the [[Adirondacks]]. The College began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees—one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper—graduated in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/history.htm A History of ESF]". SUNY-ESF website. Retrieved on October 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1930, Governor [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college's second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: "under [Marshall's] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, [[F. Franklin Moon|Franklin Moon]], the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Cyrus, "Louis Marshall: A Biographical Sketch", American Jewish Year Book, 1930-31, pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate [[Alfred E. Smith]] who was elected to assume the presidency of the college's Board of Trustees.

=== Affiliation with SUNY ===

With the formation of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) in 1948, the College became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the College's name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2009-07-09| author=Peter D.

ESF's main campus, located in [[Syracuse, New York]], is where most academic and administrative activity takes place. The campus is made up of nine main buildings:

* '''Baker Laboratory''': Named after [[Hugh P. Baker]], Dean of the College from 1912–1920 and again 1930-33. The building is the location of several [[computer cluster]]s and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering and the Division of Environmental Science. The building underwent a $37 million overhaul in the early 2000s, providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the [[Nelson C. Brown]] Center for Ultrastructure Studies. Baker Lab is the site of ESF's NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a "smart" classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios. It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.esf.edu/communications/news/2000/03.29.baker.htm ESF's Baker Laboratory Revamped for Engineering]". ESF Office of Communications. Retrieved on October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bray Hall''': The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after [[William L. Bray]], a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first dean, 1911-12. It is the location of most administrative offices and the Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management. The [[New York State University Police|State University Police]] department is located in the basement.
* '''Gateway Center''': The campus' newest building, opened in March 2013, "sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes," according to [[Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr.]] The building is "designed to achieve LEED Platinum Certification".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=415 |title=SUNY-ESF Breaks Ground for Gateway Building |publisher=Esf.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "Gateway Building" (with webcam), SUNY-ESF.] Accessed: June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESF College Bookstore, Trailhead Cafe, and Office of Admissions are located in the Gateway Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm "The Gateway Center"], ESF website. Accessed: October 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Illick Hall''': The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after [[Joseph S. Illick]], a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) on the ground floor. Several greenhouses are located on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also located in the building.
* '''Jahn Laboratory''': Named after [[Edwin C. Jahn]], former head of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The building was completed in 1997. Home to the Department of Chemistry.
* '''Marshall Hall''': Named after [[Louis Marshall]], one of the founders of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. Home to the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Studies departments. The Alumni ([[Eustace B. Nifkin|Nifkin]]) Lounge, Tree House (snack bar) and Marshall Auditorium are located within. Twin brass plaques in the entryway commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]].
* '''Moon Library''': Dedicated to [[F. Franklin Moon]], an early dean of the College. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are located in the basement.
* '''Walters Hall''': Named after [[J. Henry Walters]], who served on the College's Board of Trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Paper and Bioprocess Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment.
*'''Centennial Hall''': ESF's on-campus student [[dormitory]], named in commemoration of the college's 100th anniversary. The facility is capable of accommodating 280-300 freshman (in double or triple studio rooms with private bath), 116 upperclassmen (in single bedroom suits with private bath), and an additional 56 upperclassmen (in 4-bedroom, 2-bath apartments). A $31 million project, Centennial Hall opened in fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centennial Hall|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/centennial.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus life==
[[File:ESF-Robinhood-Oak-2014.jpg|thumb|200px|The 'Robin Hood Oak' (''[[Quercus robur|Q. robur]]''), direct descendant of [[Major Oak]], of [[Sherwood Forest]], England&lt;ref&gt;Interpretive sign, SUNY-ESF&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many students identify themselves as a "Stumpy" (or "Stumpie"). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry "stump jumpers". Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride.

Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Undergraduate Student Association, Graduate Student Association, Woodsmen Team, [[Bob Marshall (wilderness activist)|Bob Marshall]] Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esf.edu/org/axs/ "Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society,"] SUNY-ESF website. Accessed: August 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Soccer Team, [[Sigma Lambda Alpha (honor society)|Sigma Lambda Alpha]], ''The Knothole'' (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, ''The Empire Forester'' (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Environmental Studies Student Organization, [[Habitat for Humanity]], ''Ecologue'' (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, Baobab Society, and the Sustainable Energy Club. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the [[Society of American Foresters]], [[The Wildlife Society]], [[Conservation biology|Conservation Biology]] club, American Fisheries Association, and the (currently defunct) American Water Resources Association.

ESF has an agreement with adjacent [[Syracuse University]] that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the [[Carrier Dome]]. ESF's baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of both the State University of New York and Syracuse University.

Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], and nearby [[Marshall Street, Syracuse|Marshall Street]] and [[Westcott, Syracuse|Westcott Street]].

== Gateway Center ==
ESF has launched several programs, both within the confines of campus and other locations to reduce its [[carbon emission]]s. The Gateway Center utilizes sustainable energy resources to generate power and heat utilized across the campus. The building includes a state-of-the-art, combined heat-and-power (CHP) system, producing 65% of campus heating needs along with 20% of its electrical needs. The CHP system uses [[biomass]] to drive a [[steam turbine]] and produce electricity, while natural gas is used for steam heating along with additional electricity. It has been estimated this building alone is responsible for reducing ESF's carbon footprint by 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gateway Center|url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/campus/gateway.htm|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ESF-Gateway-Green-Roof-2014.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Gateway Center's [[green roof|green roof/ garden]] (foreground)]]

Increased global awareness of global warming and reduced nonrenewable resources has driven ESF to invest in biomass.  Biomass is a renewable resource that draws light energy, carbon dioxide, and water from the environment; in return oxygen is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Shijie|author2=Abrahamson, L. |author3=Scott, G. |title=Biorefinery: Ensuring biomass as a sustainable renewable source of chemicals, materials, and energy|journal=Biomass and Bioenergy|year=2012|volume=39|issue=April|pages=1–4|doi=10.1016/j.biombioe.2010.12.042}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be harvested without negatively affecting the environment.  For this reason, SUNY-ESF has launched a program to grow its own biomass, known as the ''[[Willow Biomass Project]]''. Benefits of woody willow include, high yields and fast growth times, quick re-sprouting, and high heat energy is produced when burned. Woody willow also increases habitat diversity significantly contributes to carbon neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Willow Biomass Project|url=http://www.esf.edu/pubprog/brochure/willow/willow.htm|accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gateway Center was one of the final stages in the school's ''Climate Action Plan'', that encompasses the vision of [[carbon neutrality]] and reduced [[fossil fuel]] dependence by 2015. Currently, the school rests in Phase III of the program and is on track to reach its goal. Included in Phase III is the opening of The Gateway Center, retrofits to Illick Hall, and rooftop greenhouse replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heavey|first=Justin|title=Climate Action Plan for SUNY ESF|year=2009|publisher=Department of Renewable Energy Systems|page=6,21|author2=Kelleher, Michael |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One other advancement towards carbon neutrality can be seen on top of the campus's buildings. [[Green roof|Rooftop gardens]] provide reduced [[energy consumption]] and water runoff. Shrubbery, soil thickness, and moisture content all can contribute to increased [[energy conservation|energy savings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wong|first=N.

=== Athletics history ===

In one notable part of the College's history, [[Laurie D. Cox]], professor of [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]], was responsible for establishing [[Syracuse University]]'s renowned [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|lacrosse program]] in 1916, including players from the New York State College of Forestry.&lt;ref name =father&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-118716843.html|title=Cox began lacrosse legacy at Syracuse|last=Herron|first=Frank|date=June 27, 2004|publisher=The Post-Standard (Syracuse, NY)|accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliation with Syracuse University==
ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed several years after the cessation of state funding to the earlier [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University, 1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 161, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |accessdate=2012-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206063046/http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students may take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools. ESF receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]], although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are administered by them as well.

ESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to library resources, recreational facilities, student clubs, and activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate athletics teams, affiliated with the USCAA and NCAA, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esf.edu/welcome/esfsu.htm |title=The ESF-SU Relationship |publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as [[frisbee]] and soccer playing are encouraged on the Quad.

Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF's previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for ''The Knothole'', and sent mail to the College from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor's degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin.

Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.

'''Sufi studies''' is a particular branch of [[comparative studies]] that uses the technical lexicon of the Islamic mystics, the [[Sufism|Sufis]], to exemplify the nature of its ideas; hence the frequent reference to [[Tariqa|Sufi Orders]]. It may be divided into two main branches, the [[oriental studies|orientalist]]/[[academic]] and the spiritual.

==Early Sufi studies in France==
The earliest Europeans to study Sufism were French, associated (rightly or wrongly) with the [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietist]] movement. They were [[Barthélemy d'Herbelot de Molainville]] (1625–1695), a professor at the [[Collège de France]] who worked from texts available in Europe, [[François Bernier]] (1625–1688), the physician of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]] who spent 1655-69 in the Islamic world (mostly with Aurangzeb), and [[François Pétis de la Croix]] (1653–1713), a diplomat who spent 1674-1676 in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], where he studied [[Rumi]]'s ''[[Masnavi-ye Manavi]]'' and visited the [[Bektashi]] order.

D'Herbelot's great work, the ''Bibliothèque orientale'' (published posthumously in 1697), included an entry on [[Sufism]] (as ''tasawwuf'') and detailed entries on [[Al-Hallaj]], [[Najmeddin Kubra]], and [[Abd-al-karim Jili]]. There were a number of references to the ''Masnavi'' and to Rumi (as Gellaledin Mohammed al Balkhi), and there may also have been entries on them.

Bernier published an article on Sufism entitled "Mémoire sur le quïetisme des Indes" in the periodical ''Histoire des Ouvrages des Savans'' in September 1688. Following this article, there is said to have developed in France a view that the French expression of the creed of Pure Love (Pur Amour/[[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietism]]) was in fact a disguised form of [[Islam]].  The debate over Quietism between the bishops [[Fénelon]] and [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] was remembered as the "Querelle du Pur Amour". Many Quietists (including [[Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon]]) were imprisoned. Others exercised caution and self-censorship.

Pétis de la Croix did not publish himself, but his son (writing later under a pseudonym) gave reasons why he thought "the [[Mevlevi]] are perfect Quïetists" (Ahmed Frangui, ''Lettres critiques de Hadgi Effendi à la Marquise de G... au sujet des mémoires de M. le Chevalier d'Arvieux'', Paris, 1735).

D'Herbelot de Molainville's ''Bibliothèque orientale'' went through several editions, one of the last of which was the 1777 edition printed in the Hague. It has been suggested that some entries on Sufi topics that were present in the 1697 edition were absent from the 1777 edition. The word "Sufi" appears (vol 3, p.&amp;nbsp;329).

==Early translations==
In 1671, Edward Pococke (1648–1727), the son of Oxford professor [[Edward Pococke]] (1604–1691), published a Latin translation of the ''Hayy Ibn Yakhthan'' of [[Ibn Tufayl]]. This led to a number of other translations, including the English translations of 1674 (by George Keith) and 1686 (by George Ashwell), and a Dutch translation of 1701. The anonymous Dutch translator, "S.D.B.", gave a concise biographical review of the philosophers related to the text: [[Al Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al Ghazali]], [[Ibn Bajjah]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Junayd]], and [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]] (with a description of his death and a reference to his famous "Ana al-Haqq"). ''Hayy Ibn Yakhthan'' may have partly inspired [[Robinson Crusoe]].

In 1812, [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]] published a translation of the ''divan'' of [[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]], which was received with delight by [[Goethe]], who was inspired by it to publish in 1819 his ''Westöstlicher Diwan''. A Sufi appears in [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]’s play ''[[Nathan der Weise]]'', first produced in 1779, though it is not clear from where Lessing learned of Sufism, perhaps through his association with [[Johann Jakob Reiske]].

In 1821, F.A.G. Thölluck published ''Ssufismus sive Theosophia persarum pantheistica'' in Berlin (in Latin).

==Early sociological studies==
One of the earliest sociological treatments of Sufism is to be found in Sir [[John Malcolm]]'s 1825 work, ''The History of Persia, From the Most Early Period to the Present Time, Containing an Account of the Religion, Government, Usages and Character of the Inhabitants of that Kingdom''. Malcolm's treatment, though interesting, is not well informed.

In ''An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians written in Egypt during the years 1833-1835'' (1836) [[Edward William Lane]] noted, and illustrated with his own woodcuts, his close observations of the [[Rifa'i]] derwishes while living in Cairo "in disguise". The success of his work also introduced the success of the "disguise". [[Sir Richard Burton]]'s ''Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah'' (3 vol.1855-1856) was undertaken while travelling as a [[Qadiri]], and [[Armin Vambéry]] reached Baveddin near [[Bokhara]] to visit the shrine of [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari]] in 1863 in the guise of a [[murid]]. ''Voyage dans l'Asie Centrale, de Téhéran a Khiva, Bokhara et Samarkand, par Arminius Vambéry, savant Hongrois déguisé en derviche'' was the subject of four instalments of the popular and copiously illustrated "Le Tour Du Monde, Nouveau Journal Des Voyages ([[Édouard Charton]])" Paris, Londres, Leipzig 1865, deuxième semestre -Hachette et Cie ed.

The "disguise" was by no means superficial and necessitated a variety of resources in linguistics and social integration that left marks far beyond the mere popular success of [[Travel literature|travelogues]].

Towards the end of the 19th century, the resistance to the European conquest of North Africa was often led by Sufis, notably [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] and later the [[Senussi|Sanusi]] order. This drew further attention to Sufis and Sufism, and a number of studies were performed and published. These generally suffered from their authors' preoccupations with security.

==Aguéli to Guénon==
One line of 20th century Sufi studies that came to fruition in the West appears to have been born from many [[colors]] in a painters workshop.&lt;ref&gt;[[Talk:Idries Shah#Shah on Naqshbandi]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Aguéli]] [http://www.sala.se/turism/aguelimuseet/e-index.html] who – inspired by the quasi occult tradition ([[Symbolist painters]], [[Les Nabis]]) developing ''en marge'' of the great workshops of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] – took his intellectual search into the realm of [[Sufism]] proper. This culminated into his initiation, in [[Egypt]], by Sheikh Rahman Elish Kabir into the [[Shadhili]] [[tariqa]].

When he returned to [[Paris]] from his travels in the East in 1909, he found a mind receptive to his own spiritual affiliation in the [[person]] of [[René Guénon]] whom in turn he initiated into the [[Shadhili]] Order (1912).[[René Guénon]] – who finally settled in [[Cairo]] where he died (1951) a convert to Islam under his adopted name of Abdel Wahid Yahia – had an enormous influence on a circle of friends centered around the periodical "La Gnose", that he had started in 1909. This circle pooled the resources of a.o. [[Frithjof Schuon]], [[Titus Burckhardt]], [[Marco Pallis]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], [[Martin Lings]] e.a., each with his own focus on [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] ... (see also: [[Gershom Scholem]] on [[Judaism]], [[Kabbalah]])

[[René Guénon]] focused on a measure of criticism towards what he called "solidified" (petrified) forms of initiation in the West; [[Freemasonry]] in particular which he sought to revive in reference to Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd Al-Qadir]] whose name was widely respected among Masons.

If one looks at the aspect of Sufi initiation proper the following background to [[René Guénon]]'s brand of "Perennial Tradition" emerges. Through his affiliation with the [[Shadhili]] Order he was branched to the Akbari chain, going back to the "Greatest Sheikh" – Shaykh Al-Akbar – [[Ibn Arabi]].

Seminal research on the inspiration of Ibn Arabi and the Shadili and its projection in the works of [[Dante]] and [[St John of the Cross]] came from the great Christian scholar [[Miguel Asín Palacios]]

==Abd Al-Qadir and al-Tijani==
The Akbari already had a history of initiation in Western Europe in the person of Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd Al-Qadir]], the noble opponent of the French in their colonial struggle over Algeria, who they had held sequestered at the [[Château d'Amboise]] (1848–1853). In 1858 the Imprimerie Nationale (Paris) had printed his "Rappel à l'Intelligent; avis
à l'Ignorant", an essay he had sent to the Société Asiatique in 1855.

The Emir [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd Al-Qadir]] had been initiated into the [[Naqshbandi]] by Sheikh Diya al-Din Khalid Al-Sharazuri and into the [[Qadiri]] by his own father Sidi Muhiuddin who led a North African branch of the Qadiri Order. In 1863, during his Hajj, he met with Muhammed al-Fasi al-Shadili, who became his last living teacher, in Mekka. Muhammad al-Fasi al-Shadili's proper teacher had been initiated into the [[Shadhili]] by al-Arabi ad-Darqawi, some of whose letters were translated by [[Martin Lings]] (1961); they form the background to [[Martin Lings]]' outline of the autobiographical writings of [[Ahmad al-Alawi]], who was linked to the [[Shadhili]] through ad-Darqawi. Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawi died in 1932.

An approach from a different angle may be traced to Sheikh [[Tijaniyyah|Ahmad al-Tijani]] who died in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in 1815 and was said to be the inheritor of the "paths" of his time, a.o. Qadiri and Shadili.

Sheikh Hammalah ben Mohammed ben Sidna Omar, who died in forced exile to France, lies buried in Montluçon, [[France]]. He was the former Qutub al Zaman of the [[Tijaniyyah]]. A moving account of the circumstances of his death is given by the great African traditionalist and cultural ambassador [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]], himself a Tijani, in the biography of his own sheikh, [[Tierno Bokar]].

==Massignon to Nasr==
Thus the current into which the friends of the [[Traditionalist School]] had tapped proved to be a lively one. [[René Guénon]]'s wish to edit a series of Sufi translations was frustrated, but in the meantime [[Louis Massignon]] had prepared himself for the task. By 1922, his introduction to the technical lexicon of Sufism and the Passion of [[Al-Hallaj]] initiated the first line of textual study, translation and publication of sources that developed into the watershed of which the chief engineers were [[Henry Corbin]] and [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]].

Since the observation is pertinent that thus far the watershed is fed from a distinct French sphere of influence, a mental exercise is needed to broaden the view. It is clear that [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]]'s participation in the collaboration with [[Henry Corbin]] infused this field with a genuine consideration for some of the finer aspects ([[Irfan]]) of Islamic culture as seen from a proper native source – [[Iran]] – and adding a distinct contemporary sting to [[ecology]].

It may be interesting to compare two contributions to Sufi studies from this same angle – (1) Seyyed Hossein Nasr "Revelation, Intellect and Reason in the Qu'ran" in "Sufi Essays" – London and Albany, New York 1972. – (2) Reza Arasteh: "Psychology of the Sufi Way to Individuation" in "Sufi Studies East and West" Rushbrook Williams ed. New York 1973. Both describe the control over the "nafs", the spiritual "breaths" that color man's essential character; a study comparing intelligence in its western and eastern traditional form. Pr. Arasteh had already introduced this "Sufi Way" in his academical work on psychiatric theory ("Final Integration in Adult Personality" Brill Leiden 1965).

==Idries Shah==
Professor Reza Arasteh M. D. (remembered for his correspondence [http://www.merton.org/Research/index.asp] with [[Thomas Merton]]) wrote in honour of Sayyid [[Idries Shah]], whose stature as a scholar was as fiercely disputed as his communication to a general public was successful. Nevertheless, Sayyid [[Idries Shah]] caused the English feed of the watershed to be explored – through his own accessible style of writing, by providing affordable publications of great classical texts, and rebelliously askew on the niceties of an Oxford/Cambridge kind of rivalry over Pr. [[Reynold A. Nicholson|Nicholson]] and Pr. [[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]] – and to exactly what extent can now easily be verified by the student willing to compare for himself the [[Eleven Naqshbandi principles|eleven Naqshbandi rules]] or exercise-aims listed by Sayyid [[Idries Shah]] in chapter VII of ''Oriental Magic'' in 1957 with those presently divulged through the proper channel [http://www.uga.edu/islam/11Naqsprin.html]. They are indeed the same.

"Oriental Magic" was read as a comparative study at the London [[Ethnological]] Institute. Sufi studies in general are directed as comparative studies of human understanding, and can be read as essays in psychosociology (see: [[Albert Hourani]] on "[[Marshall Hodgson]] and the Venture of Islam" in ''Islam in European Thought'' – Cambridge University Press 1991).

==Margaret Smith==

Special note could be taken of the little cited but brilliant academic [[Margaret Smith (author)|Margaret Smith]] who wrote (1925–1935) on the history of mysticism in the Near and Middle East from a woman's perspective leading to classic pages on early Christian mysticism, women in the early Christian Church, Christianity and Islam at the beginning of the Islamic era (see:[[Hanif]]), the rise of Sufism and the early ascetic ideal. Two exemplaries of her subject matter she studied in closer detail: [[Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] and [[Harith al-Muhasibi]].

The summary of her work reposes in her:
:''Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East. Being an account of the rise and development of Christian mysticism up to the seventh century, of the subsequent development of mysticism in Islam, known as Sufism, and of the relationship between Christian and Islamic Mysticism with references, a bibliography and two indexes''
::Dedicated to the memory of [[Thomas Walker Arnold]]
::London, 1931 – The Sheldon Press; reprinted 1973 by Philo Press cv, Amsterdam

==Later academics==

By the end of the 20th century, the academic study of Sufism was well established in university departments of [[religious studies]].

The perspectives of these later scholars varied. Some were purely scientific, while some followed in the line of [[Louis Massignon|Massignon]], or (sometimes privately) in the line of [[Guénon]] and the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalists]], modified somewhat for an academic environment.

For a contemporary academical "state of the art" see: "Sufism in the West", bibliography pp.&amp;nbsp;190–202 (Jamal Malik and John Hinnells ed. Routledge: London and New York, 2006).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9056">The '''Obscene Device Law''' is a [[Texas]] [[statute]] prohibiting the sale of [[sex toy]]s. The law was introduced in 1973, and was last updated in 2003. While the law technically remains in effect, in 2008 a U.S. District Judge released a report declaring it to be "facially unconstitutional and unenforceable".

==History==
In 1973, the [[Texas Legislature]] passed Section 43.21 of the [[Texas Penal Code]], which, in part, prohibited the sale or promotion of "obscene devices"', being defined as "a device including a [[dildo]] or [[artificial vagina]], designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of [[Sex organ|human genital organs]]." The legislation was last updated in 2003, and Section 43.23 currently states "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.43.htm#43.23 |title=Penal Code Chapter 43.

==Prosecuted cases==
Prosecution under the statute is rare but has occasionally occurred. In [[Burleson, Texas|Burleson]] in 2004, Joanne Webb, a mother of three and a former schoolteacher, faced up to one year in prison for selling a [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]] to two undercover police officers posing as a married couple at a private party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |title=Texas mom faces trial for selling sex toys |date=February 11, 2004 |work=[[CNN]] |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130110202251/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/LAW/02/11/obscenity.trial.reut/ |archivedate=January 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later acquitted, and the undercover officers were issued reprimands. In 2007, a [[lingerie]] shop in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] was raided, and items "deemed to be illegal by the Texas Penal Code" were confiscated. The clerk on duty at the time was arrested and may have had to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |title=Police Raid Lingerie Shop |date=May 21, 2007 |work=klbk13.tv |access-date=May 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070525044229/http://www.klbk13.tv/news/default.asp?mode=shownews&amp;id=2259 |archivedate=May 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, attorneys Mary and Ted Roberts used the obscenity statute in an elaborate extortion scheme against a number of men who had engaged in extramarital relations with Mary Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |title=There's something about Mary1 … |date= |work=Texas District &amp; County Attorneys Association |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918140525/http://www.tdcaa.com/node/2483 |archivedate=September 18, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeals==

Reliable Consultants, Inc., who operate four retail stores in Texas that carry a stock of sexual devices, and PHE, Inc., which is also engaged in the retail distribution of sexual devices through their website and catalogs, both filed [[lawsuit]]s against the legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} claiming that the statute is [[unconstitutional]]. In an appeal from the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]], a three-judge panel of the [[5th Circuit Court of Appeals]] overturned the statute on February 12, 2008, by a vote of 2–1, holding that "the statute has provisions that violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1263575.html |title=PHE v.

The 13th District Court of Appeals ruled that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rules that 43.23 is unconstitutional, the promotion of obscene devices remains illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |title=Are Dildos Illegal in Texas (again)? |last=Guest |first=Robert |date=October 6, 2008 |work=Dallas Criminal Defense Lawyer Blog |access-date=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730174954/http://www.dallascriminaldefenselawyerblog.com/2008/10/are-dildos-illegal-in-texas-ag.html |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, despite the actions of the federal courts and the Texas Attorney General described elsewhere in this article, section 43.23 remains in effect in the twenty-county area of Texas covered by the jurisdiction of the 13th District Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |title=Dildos &amp; Sexually Obscene "Toys" Illegal in Texas … for now &amp;#124; Austin Attorney Dax Garvin |work=Dax Legal |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716030219/http://daxlegal.com/dildos-sexually-obscene-toys-illegal-in-texas-for-now/ |archivedate=July 16, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2008, the Fifth Circuit denied Texas's request to re-hear the case ''en banc''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/06/06-51067-CV1.wpd.pdf |title=United States Court of Appeals |publisher=Ca5.uscourts.gov |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal created a split between federal circuits: the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas law and the 11th Circuit upheld a nearly identical Alabama law. That would usually mean that the United States Supreme Court would grant a writ of [[certiorari]] and rule in order to clear up the disagreement between the two circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |title=Dildos at the Supreme Court? |last=Brayton |first=Ed |date=August 11, 2008 |work=[[ScienceBlogs]] |access-date=August 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018121053/http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/08/dildos_at_the_supreme_court.php |archivedate=October 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2008, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel released a two-page document dated October 29, 2008, in which he stated that the Texas Attorney General's Office notified him that they would not file a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The next month, on November 13, Yeakel filed a "joint status report" that noted the parties had come to an agreement. "Texas Penal Code §§ 43.23, to the extent that it applies to "obscene devices" as defined in Texas Penal Code § 43.21(a)(7), is declared to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable throughout the State of Texas".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/document/322594597/2008-11-13-Texas-Western-Court-Order-Obscenity-Law&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past''''', (Pimlico, 1999), is a book by [[Thomas L. Thompson]], Professor of Old Testament at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Its US title is '''''The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel'''''.

== Summary ==
The theme of ''The Bible in History'' is the need to treat the bible as literature rather than as history. Danny Yee cites a passage: "The Bible's language is not an historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dannyreviews.com/h/Bible_History.html "The Bible in History", quoted in dannyreviews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Part 1 deals with general historiographical issues, including the importance of understanding the types and purposes of different biblical stories, the dangers of treating myth and poetry as history, and the use of origin-myths as recurring motifs, concluding that the bible was intended to provide an ancient people with a common past, and thus was very different from our own tradition of critical history-writing. Part 2 is a history of ancient Palestine and the surrounding region from the earliest human settlement to the [[Hellenistic period]] drawing on the most recent archaeological and historical studies, and Part 3 concludes with a survey of the theological implications of the preceding study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dannyreviews.com/h/Bible_History.html dannyreviews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The minimalist/maximalist debate ==
Thompson is a leading [[Biblical minimalism|biblical minimalist]], a group of like-minded scholars including [[Niels Peter Lemche]], Philip R. Davies, and Keith W. Whitelam among others who say that the [[Hebrew bible]] cannot be treated as history, because it was not intended as history. The minimalist argument has been received with emotions bordering on outrage by other scholars, somewhat inaccurately known as "maximalists"{{snd}} most of them do not in fact subscribe to a view that would take all or even most of the bible as being historically accurate, but object strongly to the minimalist contention that it is completely or almost completely ahistorical. The debate has been frequently framed in political terms, with the minimalists accused of subverting the existence of the modern state of Israel and worse. "The Bible in History", Thompson's attempt to summarise the minimalist thesis and set it before a wider public, was the immediate cause for [[William G. Dever]]'s rejoinder, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', (2001), which then led into a long and frequently heated debate (in which Davies, rather than Thompson, championed the minimalist side) on the merits of the bible as history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prophetess.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/history_of_israel.htm prophetess: See section "The Minimalism Debate" for links to papers from each side relating to the dispute]&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to tell a story about a "very powerful man" who passed on hiring a female candidate even though she was the most qualified because she was too attractive and would be "too big a risk".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following criticism for these comments, Robbins posted an apology on his Facebook page, saying 'I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reimel|first1=Erin|title=Popular Life Coach Tony Robbins Tried to Mansplain #MeToo—and Movement Founder Tarana Burke Responded|url=https://www.glamour.com/story/tony-robbins-metoo-burke-response|website=Glamour.com|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 UC-HiPACC organized a major conference on the Future of AstroComputing&lt;ref name=2010AnnualReport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/2010AnnualReport.html|title=UC-HiPACC 2010 Annual Report|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (SDSC). UC-HiPACC provided partial support for the Enzo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enzo|url=http://lca.ucsd.edu/projects/enzo|work=Enzo version 2.0|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; workshop&lt;ref name=PhysOrg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lca.ucsd.edu/workshops/enzo2010/|title=Enzo Workshop at UCSD|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at UCSD in spring 2010.

==== 2012 Science Journalism Boot Camp in Computational Astronomy ====

In June 2012, science and engineering journalists — whose publications and productions are estimated to collectively reach more than 10 million readers and viewers worldwide — attended the first journalism “boot camp” on computational astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/2012CAJBC.html|title=Computational Astronomy: From Planets to Cosmos webpage|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Called “Computational Astronomy: From Planets to Cosmos,” the workshop was an intense three-and-a-half-day backgrounder for practicing science or engineering journalists from all media — print, online, broadcast, social media, and film — whether on staff or freelance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Homepage_Posts.php#3|title=First Science Journalism Boot Camp in Computational Astronomy Held at UCSC|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Trudy E.|title=From ScienceWriters: A computational astronomy boot camp|url=http://www.nasw.org/sciencewriters-computational-astronomy-boot-camp|work=ScienceWriters magazine|publisher=The National Association of Science Writers|accessdate=11 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Science Engineering Journalism Boot Camp PlayList|url=http://shelf3d.com/Search/2012%2BScience+Engineering%2BJournalism%2BBoot%2BCamp%2BPlayListIDPLE86A2876BF2D62BF|publisher=shelf3d|accessdate=11 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Santa Cruz Galaxy Workshops ====

Five-day workshops for galaxy researchers worldwide co-sponsored by UC-HiPACC were held at UCSC in August in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HiPACC Conferences &amp; Workshops|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Conferences.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent, in August 2013, was attended by nearly 90 participants from about 30 institutions in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Korea, Spain, and the United States. Approximately 50 sessions were held over five days. About 85 presenters from around the world conducted sessions on a variety of current concerns in astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Santa Cruz Galaxy Workshop|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/GalaxyWorkshop2013.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Summer School in Computational Astrophysics ===

UC-HiPACC supports an annual international advanced school aimed at graduate students and postdocs who are currently working in or actively interested in doing research in AstroComputing. Topics and locations of the annual school rotate among the UC campuses and national laboratories, and  [[Caltech]] and [[Stanford]] also participate. Lectures from summer school sessions are posted on the UC-HiPACC website so that they can be useful worldwide. During these schools, students are afforded direct access to some of the largest supercomputers in the world for running their own simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Summer School on AstroComputing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/SummerSchool.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010 Summer School ====

The first UC-HiPACC summer school was held in July 2010 on the campus of UC Santa Cruz where students learned about the main software models currently used in high resolution simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. In labs, students worked on projects using these codes, supervised by the lecturers. The summer school was directed by [http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/dept/html/directory.faculty.aklypin.shtml Anatoly Klypin], [[New Mexico State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 International Summer School on Astro-Computing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/2010SummerSchool_archive.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2011 Summer School ====

In 2011, 28 grad students — 17 from outside California — gathered at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to learn about Explosive Astrophysics. The focus was on computational explosive astrophysics, including the modeling of core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, neutron star mergers, and other energetic transients. Workshops guided students in running and visualizing simulations on supercomputers using codes such as FLASH, CASTRO, GR1D and modules for nuclear burning and radiation transport. The conference was organized by [http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/kasen.html Daniel Kasen] and [https://archive.is/20140113104528/http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/nugent.html Peter Nugent] of UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 International Summer School on Astro on AstroComputing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/ISSAC_Home.php|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2012 Summer School ====

Taught from July 9 to 20, 2012, the summer school on the campus of [[UC San Diego]], under the direction of [http://www.sdss.jhu.edu/~szalay/ Alex Szaley], hosted by SDSC Director [https://web.archive.org/web/20070204003044/http://www.sdsc.edu/about/Director.html Michael Norman], taught the next generation of researchers how to deal effectively with the avalanche of data that comes from current astronomical observations. The field of study is called ''AstroInformatics.''  Students were afforded access to the San Diego Supercomputer Center for computational and infrastructure support. Conducted over 10 days, 30 hours of lectures, combined with five hours of post-lecture discussions, and 20 hours of hands-on computation labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2012 International Summer School on AstroInformatics|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/ISSAC2012.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astroinformatics: 2012 Int'l Summer School on Astrocomputing|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/meetings/all-meetings/astroinformatics-2012-intl-summer|work=Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal|publisher=Penn State|accessdate=11 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013 Summer School ====

The 2013 AstroComputing Summer School trained future researchers in the use of large-scale simulations in star and planet formation problems. The school covered many of the major public codes in use today, including tutorials and hands-on experience running and analyzing simulations.

=== Cosmological Simulations ===

Large cosmological simulations are now the basis for much current research on the structure of the universe and the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. “Numerical simulations have become ... one of the most effective tools
to study and to solve astrophysical problems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Lauro |last1=Moscardini |first2=Klaus |last2=Dolag|title=Cosmology with numerical simulations|url=http://icc.ub.edu/~liciaverde/IC/como.pdf|work=Institute of Sciences of the Cosmos|publisher=Universitat de Barcelona|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers associated with UC-HiPACC are deeply involved in the two projects described below, which are relevant to UC-HiPACC’s mission to promote UC computational astrophysics. The HiPACC website is hosting the Bolshoi website. The UCSC AstroComputing system Hyades, including the [[Huawei]] 1 [[Petabyte|PetaByte]] AstroData system, will be hosting many of Bolshoi simulation outputs.

=== Education of Public and Other Outreach ===

As UC-HiPACC states on its website, “A crucial goal of UC-HiPACC outreach is to give the fruits of UC computational astrophysics research back to the taxpaying public through formal (classroom) and informal (extracurricular) education.”&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

Activities include the preparation by UC-HiPACC staff of articles to help astronomers reach classroom students and teachers and collaboration with planetaria, science museums, and other organizations that reach the astronomy-interested general public. Planetarium shows for which UC-HiPACC members have contributed astronomical computations and images include “Life: A Cosmic Story” in the 75-foot dome of the [[Morrison Planetarium]] in [[San Francisco]], and “Deep Space Adventure” in the 71-foot 8000 pixel-across dome of the [[Adler Planetarium]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morrison Planetarium|title=Life, A Cosmic Story, credits tab, Science Data and Simulations |url=http://www.calacademy.org/academy/exhibits/planetarium/life/|publisher=California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UC-HiPACC staff creates and posts to its website approximately monthly “AstroShorts”—illustrated capsule stories about especially interesting work in computational astronomy around the UC-HiPACC consortium, designed for use in the newsletters of astronomical societies, science clubs, newspapers, or other outlets.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt; The website’s “Press Room” publishes press releases on computational astronomy from around the UC-HiPACC consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/PressRoom.php|title=HiPACC Press Room |work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A visualization from the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation, the most detailed cosmological simulation run to date, was narrated in the [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV special ''Inside the Milky Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts from "Inside the Milky Way", produced by National Geographic TV|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Movies.html#insideMW|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UC-HiPACC  provided footage from the Bolshoi Simulation to the Icelandic performer [[Björk]] for her musical number “Dark Matter” for her [[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]] concert.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

The organization conducts outreach to raise funds to support the activities described in this article.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;
