The venue opened in 1979 as '''Liberty Field'''.  [[Al Worthington]] was Liberty's head coach at the time.  On May 3, 1986, the field was dedicated '''Al Worthington Field'''.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

In 1995, the venue's name was again changed, this time to Al Worthington Stadium.  In 1998, the stadium won ''Sports Turf Magazine'''s "Diamond of the Year" award.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

Beginning in 1999, the stadium underwent a series of renovations.  In that year, a 5,200&amp;nbsp;ft.² hitting complex was added, located down the [[left field]] line.  Also in 1999, the [[infield]] was resurfaced with [[bermuda grass]].  A new [[PA system]] and backstop were installed in 2000.  2003 construction added an indoor hitting facility, [[luxury boxes]], and a clubhouse.  Renovations completed in 2008 added stadium lighting and additional seating, which raised capacity by 600-700 spectators.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

With the addition of stadium lighting, Worthington Stadium's first night game was played on March 28, 2008.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;  On the same night, the stadium set a new attendance record of 3,183 spectators.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;  Liberty lost the game to [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina]] 5-3 in 11 innings.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

In August 2011, the university announced plans for a new baseball venue.  The plans called for the venue to be built near [[Williams Stadium]], the university's [[American football|football]] venue, and to hold 3,000 spectators.  The project was projected to cost roughly [[USD|$]]5 million.  The announcement included plans for Worthington Stadium to become a [[softball]] venue.&lt;ref name=newvenue /&gt;

The stadium closed following the [[2012 NCAA Division I baseball season|2012 season]].  Its final game was played on May 13, 2012, in which [[High Point Panthers baseball|High Point]] defeated Liberty 13-11.&lt;ref name=finalgame&gt;{{cite web|title=High Point Edges Liberty in Slugfest in Final Game at Worthington |url=http://www.liberty.edu/flames/index.cfm?PID=10869&amp;newsID=9063&amp;TeamID=1 |work=Liberty.edu |accessdate=31 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E5IErT8H?url=http://www.liberty.edu/flames/index.cfm?PID=10869&amp;newsID=9063&amp;TeamID=1 |archivedate=31 January 2013 |date=13 May 2012 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 2013.&lt;ref name="demolished"/&gt;

== Naming ==
The venue was named for [[Al Worthington]].  Following a fourteen-season major league career, Worthington came to Liberty in 1974.  As the Flames' baseball coach from 1974 to 1986, Worthington compiled a 343-189-1 record.  In each of the last 12 of Worthington's 13 seasons, the program had a winning record.&lt;ref name=worth&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Worthington (Baseball Coach: 1974-86/Athletics Director: 1983-89) |url=http://www.libertyflames.com/index.cfm?PID=18442#Al%20Worthington |work=Liberty Flames |accessdate=19 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/613lfq829?url=http://www.libertyflames.com/index.cfm?PID=18442 |archivedate=2011-08-19 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being named Liberty's [[athletic director]] in 1983, Worthington continued to coach baseball until 1986.  On May 3, 1986, Liberty's baseball field was dedicated to Worthington during his final home game as baseball coach.  The Flames defeated [[Maryland Terrapins|Maryland]] 19-3.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

'''Beach golf''' is a variation of [[golf]] mainly played on sandy beaches. It was devised with the aim of a simplified and more accessible version of golf.

The game is played along a distance of about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) on which the players, two per team, with as few strokes as possible, have to reach the final hole, hitting a soft polyurethane ball with a classic golf club.

== History ==

Beach golf was created in [[Pescara]], Italy in 1999 by Mauro De Marco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title =Palla in buca...ma nella sabbia
| newspaper = Abruzzo Oggi
| publication-place = Pescara, Italy
| date = August 19, 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was designed to be played on crowded beaches during the summer. Objects on the beach are incorporated into the game. Beach umbrellas, bathing people and other objects are turned into obstacles of the game. The rules allow the audience to interact with participants.

The game, developed by BGSA (Beach Golf Sport Association), has been recognized by the [[Centro Sportivo Educativo Nazionale]] (National Educational Sports Centre) and by the [[Italian National Olympic Committee]].

In the summer of 2014, in [[Montesilvano]], was organized the first edition of the European Beach Golf Contest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilcentro.gelocal.it/pescara/cronaca/2014/09/07/news/golf-sulla-spiaggia-a-montesilvano-1.9892780|title=Golf sulla spiaggia a Montesilvano|work=il Centro}}&lt;/ref&gt; an international event which was attended by 90 athletes representing 18 European nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD1ADJ5k6oI|title=European University beach golf 2014|date=2 April 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7 days of competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportag.it/altri-sport/european-beach-golf-montesilvano-partenza-sprint/|title=European Beach Golf a Montesilvano: partenza sprint|author=Redazione|work=Sportag.it|access-date=2015-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209133420/http://www.sportag.it/altri-sport/european-beach-golf-montesilvano-partenza-sprint/|archive-date=2015-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have seen the triumph of the Irish Robert Cast, who took home the first continental title.

Notable competitions have included the Jeckerson Cup 2005 held in the [[Piazza del Campo]], [[Siena]]. The competition was held between 40 teams from different nations. Teams competed in the streets in a “We Golf” race (variant of Beach golf on the street) and were followed by a crowd of 80000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In the following years tours were conducted during the summer on the beaches of the Italian coast.

== Rules==
[[File:Beach Golf 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Swing on the beach, event 2006]]
Regulations have been created for the Beach Golf Event, aiming to anticipate various kinds of situations. The main rule states that people and things constitute natural obstacles on the path.

The game takes place along a path of 2&amp;nbsp;km of sandy coastline on the beach, where 40 teams of two players each (a pro and a beginner), challenge each other to arrive at the final hole with the fewest possible strokes. The game-track is not bounded by any type of border and is punctuated by beach umbrellas and bathers that become natural obstacles throughout the competition.

Because of the crowded place where the event takes place, the ball used is made of soft [[polyurethane foam]] to prevent injury to anyone who is accidentally hit during the game. The route is accompanied throughout its track by music and entertainment that involve, in an original way, the audience that becomes active in the field of play.
The range of the golfer beach is bordered by a protection zone of about 5 meters, supported by three girls on the way to accompany throughout the game.

=== Team ===
Each team is composed of two players, a low-handicap player and a high-handicap one. The sum of the two handicaps split approximately to the next lower (e.g.: mean 17.5, the team is hcp 17) and that is the team’s handicap that show how many improvements can benefit the team.
The game is played with only one beaten ball each turn. It is admitted that the one it replaces the other, in case you lose stroke and distance. Penalty: loss of stroke and distance.

=== Scorecard ===
The scorecard is a table which shows the data about the team and the history of the game. It consists of nine items:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Label !! Description
|-
| '''Team''' || Name of the team as well as the sponsor.
|-
| '''Player 1''' || Name, surname and handicap of the player with the lowest handicap in the team.
|-
| '''Player 2''' || Name, surname and handicap of the player with the highest handicap in the team.
|-
| '''Team Handicap''' || Average handicap of the team.
|-
| '''Score''' || All strokes played during the round.
|-
| '''Drop''' || All drops that took place during the round.
|-
| '''Penalty''' || All penalties that was incurred during the round.
|-
| '''Handicap''' || Strokes that can be deducted from the score.
|-
| '''Scorer''' || The name of the caddie girl that recorded the score.
|}

=== Game ===
It is a stroke-game competition held in two rounds. Two types of balls are used: a soft rubber, totally harmless ( 69&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter ) which is used along the track and a regular one on the green. There is no time limit. Players have the opportunity to stop to have a lunch break, however, teams must respect the assigned starting time.

=== Track ===
This goes along the shore of any beach. When the Beach Golf is held in Pescara, we start from Paolucci Square and arrive at Stadium of the Sea, close to Cascella’s Ship. The track has a length of 1600 meters and a width that take the whole beach.

=== The starting area ===

The starting area is located where the first ball is hit. The area consists of a synthetic rug 1.50x1.50 m2. The ball is placed on the appropriate tee and both players choose a tee shot, placing the balls in the best possible way. The honor is given (noblesse oblige) to the lower handicap player. Any missed shot or barely touched balls are considered as a shot along the path. If the ball is dropped from the tee without being touched can be repositioned to make the shot.
Each team starts three minutes after the previous one. The delay allowed is ten minutes after the departure of the next team. The laggard team start for last with a penalty of five shots.

=== Equipment ===
[[File:Bastoni Beach Golf.jpg|thumb|Beach Golf Clubs]]

The equipment used consist in a classic golf club, expanded foam balls and a protection belt.

==== Clubs ====
Preferably sand or wedge type.

==== Ball ====

The ball is made of polyurethane foam with a diameter of 7&amp;nbsp;cm and a weigh of 35g approximately. Its composition makes them harmless, allowing to play anywhere.

==== Protection belt ====
[[File:Fascia protezione.jpg|thumb|Protection Belt]]

This is held by the Caddy Girls and has a very important function which is to guarantee the safety of bathers, the players and anyone who is on the game-track. This is what makes the Beach Golf the only sport in the world where viewers are on the pitch and involved as active part in the game.

== Caddy Girls ==
Caddy Girls act both as game-judges and hostesses during the event. Their role is to ensure that the game takes place in a proper and safe way. The Caddy Girls support a protection belt around the area of action, aiming to allow the golfer to play in peace among the bathers, beach chairs and umbrellas.

The BGSA has planned a special calendar, featuring the Beach golf Caddy Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshot.it/articolo/calendario-caddy-girls-2009-per-il-beach-golf/1276/ |title=Calendario Caddy Girls 2009 per il Beach Golf &amp;#124; Tshot |publisher=Tshot.it |date= |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the stadium began in 1993, and it was complete and ready for the Opening Ceremony in July 1996, where it hosted [[Athletics at the 1996 Summer Olympics|track and field events]] and the [[1996 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528011846/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v1.pdf 1996 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222634/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v3.pdf 1996 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 3. p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Olympics and Paralympics, it was reconstructed into the baseball-specific [[Turner Field]], used by the [[Atlanta Braves]] of [[Major League Baseball]] for 20 seasons (1997–2016). After the Braves departed for [[SunTrust Park]], the facility was purchased by [[Georgia State University]], which rebuilt the stadium a second time as [[Georgia State Stadium]], designed for [[American football]].

==History==
[[File:JO Atlanta 1996 - Stade.jpg|thumb|left|Stadium during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. Seats in the background became the seating behind home plate for Turner Field and subsequently the south end zone for Georgia State Stadium.]]
During the week-long athletics program, the stadium bore witness to [[Donovan Bailey]] of [[Canada]] winning the 100 m in a world record time of 9.84 s; [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] winning both the 200 and 400 metres titles, breaking the 200 m world record in the process; and [[France]]'s [[Marie-José Pérec]] also winning the 200/400 double. Meanwhile, [[Carl Lewis]] won his fourth consecutive Olympic title in the [[long jump]], becoming only the second person, after [[Al Oerter]], to win the same athletics event at four consecutive Games.

After the closing ceremony of the [[1996 Summer Paralympics|1996 Paralympics]], the stadium was officially leased by the [[Atlanta Braves]]. Private entities, including [[NBC]] and other Olympic sponsors, agreed to pay a large sum of the cost to build Centennial Olympic Stadium (approximately $170 million of the $209 million bill). The [[Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games]] (ACOG) sought to build the stadium in a way that it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion.&lt;ref name="braves move"&gt;{{cite news|title=At Close of Games, Braves Will Move Into Olympic Stadium |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |date=1996-07-30 |accessdate=2008-07-24 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/olympics/0730/oly-stadium-braves.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628184724/http://www.nytimes.com/specials/olympics/0730/oly-stadium-braves.html |archivedate=2008-06-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic Committee and the Braves, because there would be no use for a permanent 85,000 seat [[track and field]] stadium in [[Downtown Atlanta]] since the 71,000 seat [[Georgia Dome]] had been completed 4 years earlier by the state of Georgia and became the home of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Atlanta Falcons]]. The Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new venue to replace [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]]. 

The southwest corner of the Olympic Stadium was built to accommodate the future baseball [[Infielder|infield]] and seating. This is easily seen in aerial views and diagrams of the stadium in its Olympic configuration, where the seats are not placed next to the [[Track and field|oval running track]]. The southwest part of the stadium also had four tiers of seats, [[luxury box]]es, a facade facing the street, and a roof, whereas the north half of the stadium used a simpler two-tiered seating configuration. During reconstruction, the [[All-weather running track|athletics track]] was removed and relocated to [[Panther Stadium|the field hockey stadium]] located at [[Clark Atlanta University]], which uses it for athletics and [[American football|football]], and the north half of the stadium was [[demolish]]ed, reducing the capacity to 49,000. Because of the need to fit a track within the stadium in its earlier incarnation, the field of play, particularly foul territory, while not large by historical standards, was nonetheless larger than that of most MLB stadiums built since 1990. Reconstruction was complete in 1997, and the facility was renamed [[Turner Field]]. Afterward, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, the Braves' previous home and the venue for the Olympics baseball events, was [[building implosion|imploded]] and the site became a parking lot for Turner Field. The Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority owned Turner Field, and the Atlanta Braves occupied the revised stadium until the expiration of their lease in 2016; the Braves moved to [[SunTrust Park]] in [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turner Field |first=Scott |last=Kendrick |work=About.com |publisher=The New York Times Company |url=http://baseball.about.com/od/photogalleries/ig/MLB-Stadiums-Gallery/Turner-Field.htm |accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia State University acquired Turner Field and its surrounding parking lots in January 2017 for a mixed use expansion of the Georgia State campus, which includes private and student housing, academic, retail, and office space in addition to the redevelopment of the former ballpark into Georgia State Stadium. 

The [[Atlanta Track Club]]'s annual Father's Day four-mile (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) road race ends inside the stadium near the warning track where the finish line was located for the Olympics.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The '''Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium''', previously the '''Beausejour Cricket Ground''', is a [[cricket]] ground located near [[Gros Islet]], [[Saint Lucia]] standard seating capacity of 15,000. It was completed in 2002 and currently accommodates 13,000 spectators. 

Originally named after the Beausejour hills&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-www.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/ground/59518.html Cricinfo – Grounds – Beausejour Stadium, Gros Islet, St Lucia]&lt;/ref&gt; and situated in the outskirts of [[Rodney Bay]], the stadium was completed in 2002 and hosts domestic matches for the [[Windward Islands cricket team]]. It staged its first international Test match in 2003 against Sri Lanka and became the first venue in the Caribbean to host a day-night game. 

The sporting facility was constructed on 22 acres consisting of about 18 hospitality suites and a pavilion that offers each team its own gym and lounge apart from a balcony and conference room. It is located in the driest area of Saint Lucia, making it most suitable for hosting cricket.

On July 21, 2016 it was formally renamed the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground after [[Darren Sammy]] who captained the West Indies side in winning the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20]] in [[India]]. He also captained the West Indies to victory in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] in [[Sri Lanka]], making him the second West Indian captain after [[Clive Lloyd]] with multiple ICC world championships. One of the stands will also be named in honour of [[Johnson Charles]], who was also part of the side in both 2012 and 2016.

==Location==
The cricket ground is located at the north-eastern end of the tourist resort of [[Rodney Bay]], approximately 6 minutes drive from the town of [[Gros Islet]] on the scenic Castries-Gros Islet Highway. The stadium is close to the residential enclaves in Beauséjour and Epouge Bay.

==Facilities==
[[File:Beausejour Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|Main stand.]]
The cricket ground is known for its high standard facilities and is regarded by the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] as a standard for current and future venues in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/117724.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its outfield, a perfect oval, is predictably lush green. It also became the first international ground in the Caribbean to receive floodlighting with the installation of 6 floodlight towers in 2006, enabling the hosting of day/night matches. In May 2006 it hosted the first ever international Day/Night ODI match in the Caribbean when the West Indies took on Zimbabwe. Due to the unfavourable time zone differences between the Caribbean and the large cricket markets in the far east international day/night matches have been few and far between.

The facility has 18 hospitality suites, a permanent seating capacity of 13,000 with bucket-type seating which can be increased to 20,000 for international matches. There are also two artificial pitches and two turfs for practice and warm-ups.

==2010 World Twenty20==

Four of the matches were Group stage games, four Super 8 matches and both semi-finals of the tournament (one of the semi-finals due to bad weather preventing matches from being held at the [[Providence Stadium]] in [[Guyana]]).

The stadium saw the third international Twenty20 century scored by Indian batsman [[Suresh Raina]] in the Group match between [[Indian cricket team|India]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]].

'''Donbass Arena''' or '''Donbas Arena''' ({{lang-uk|Донба́с Аре́на}} {{IPA-uk|donˈbɑs ɑˈrɛnɑ|}}, {{lang-ru|Донба́сc Аре́на}}) is a stadium with a natural grass pitch in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]] (under occupation by the [[Donetsk People's Republic]]) that opened on 29 August 2009. The facility is located in the center of the city, in the [[Lenin Comsomol park]]. With a capacity of 52,518 spectators, the stadium used to host [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] matches and hosted some matches of [[Euro 2012]]. The final cost of construction for Donbass Arena was $400M.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donbass-arena.com/en/news/?id=9922 Donbass Arena Ready to Open]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro2012-ukraine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 Donbass Arena: More than Elite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104080824/http://euro2012-ukraine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=3 |date=January 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium has been closed since 2014 due to the [[War in Donbass]].

The name of the stadium represents the simplified and shortened name of the [[Donets Basin]] - huge industrial region of Donbas, hence – '''D'''on'''b'''as (in Ukrainian language: ''Донецький басейн'' or ''Донбас'').

==Construction and design==

[[File:UA Donezk Zentralstadion-Schachtar Neubau.jpg|thumb|250px|Construction site in August 2007]]
Construction began in 2006. The general contractor was a Turkish company ENKA. The Stadium was completed and opened in 2009. About 1600 specialists, mainly Turkish, were involved in the construction.

Donbass Arena was designed by ArupSport.  It was Project Managed by Arup Major Projects (Project Director Charles Goddard).  Arup Sport also designed the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] (Manchester, England), [[Allianz Arena]] (Munich, Germany) and the [[Beijing National Stadium]] (Beijing, China). The soaring roof effect makes the Stadium resemble a flying saucer. The stadium has an oval shape and a glazed façade and is located near [[RSC Olimpiyskiy|Regional Sport Complex Olimpiyskiy]]. The roof of the stadium slopes from north to south matching the landscape and contributing to the natural lighting and airing of the pitch. The external lighting makes the Stadium shine at night.  A major design consideration was the ongoing protection of as much of the forest setting as possible (each tree having been planted in commemoration of deceased family members in the Great Patriotic War, and the exclusion zones to the neighbouring war memorials.   A major geotechnical fault exists some 100m below the ground directly under the centre-spot.  The building's foundations and piling was a major sub-project.

==Opening==
The Donbass Arena was completed ahead of schedule, but the grand opening was delayed until 29 August 2009 to coincide with the Ukrainian holiday of Miners Day, as well as Donetsk City day. Donetsk is in the Donbass region, a mining region, and the date was chosen for its symbolism. The primary tenant of the facility is football club [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] ("Donetsk Coal Miners").

American Pop/R&amp;B singer-songwriter [[Beyoncé Knowles]] performed a show from her [[I Am... Tour]] on the opening night of the new stadium. It was Knowles' first performance in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/46234 Beyonce to perform at the opening of Donbass Arena]&lt;/ref&gt; Beyoncé performed her famous hit [[Halo (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Halo]] to honour the memory of [[Michael Jackson]], who would have had his birthday on that day.

Many state officials attended the show designed by K-events Filmmaster Group. The opening ceremony was awarded as ''Event of the Year'' at the [[Stadium Business Awards]] on June 18, 2010 in [[Dublin]].

Shakhtar Donetsk's first match at the stadium was a 4–0 victory in a [[Ukrainian Premier League]] [[Ukrainian Premier League 2009-10|2009–10]] Round 8 fixture on 27 September 2009 against [[FC Obolon Kyiv]].&lt;ref name="New Shakhtar"&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=880944.html New Shakhtar stadium opens doors]&lt;/ref&gt; The first international game took place on November 18, 2009 against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], which [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] lost 0–1 failing to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Second Round|2010 FIFA World Cup]].

==UEFA Euro 2012 matches==
Donbass Arena was included in the official bidding project submitted by Poland and Ukraine for hosting [[UEFA Euro 2012]]. The stadium was one of the venues for the UEFA Euro 2012. The stadium hosted group D stage games and one quarter-final and one semi-final game (with the other matches in that group played at [[Olimpiysky National Sports Complex|Kiev Olympic Stadium]]). Unlike most new stadiums being built in Poland and Ukraine, Donbass Arena was not specifically built for the tournament.

The following matches were played at the stadium during the UEFA Euro 2012:

The project of new stadium "Donbass Arena" was conceived long before Ukraine was named as co-host of [[Euro 2012]]. The [[Rinat Akhmetov|owner]] considered the possibility of daily use of the arena. "Donbass Arena" includes three restaurants, a lounge-bar, a fan cafe, fast-food outlets, retail outlets, a fitness center, corporate boxes and first aid rooms. The stadium also provides facilities for corporate events - presentations, press conferences, celebrations and concerts. Stadium [[tours]] are available which include an examination of the unique features of Donbass Arena, a visit to the footballers’ rooms and FC Shakhtar Museum and a visit to the FC Shakhtar brand shop for [[souvenirs]].

==2014 conflict in Ukraine==

On 20 May 2014 the stadium hosted a small "Peace March" against the violence of the [[2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine]] and the [[self-proclaimed]] [[Donetsk People's Republic]].&lt;ref name=APM20514&gt;[https://news.pn/en/politics/104499 Akhmetov called a strike at the enterprises in protest], Ukrainian Media Group (20 May 2014)&lt;br&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27483719 Ukrainian tycoon Rinat Akhmetov confronts rebellion], [[BBC News]] (20 May 2014)&lt;br&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/205611.html Akhmetov's "Peace March" in Donetsk took 20 minutes], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (20 May 2014)&lt;br&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/205526.html Businessman Akhmetov condemns 'genocide of Donbas,' calls for peaceful rally against 'Donetsk People's Republic'], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (20 May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gambit''' (from ancient Italian ''gambetto'', meaning "to trip") is a [[chess opening]] in which a player, more often [[White and Black in chess|White]], [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]] {{chessgloss|material}}, usually a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]], with the hope of achieving a resulting advantageous position.&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Brace, ''An Illustrated Dictionary of Chess'', Hamlyn, 1979, p. 114. {{ISBN|0-600-32920-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some well-known examples are the [[King's Gambit]] (1.e4 e5 2.f4), [[Queen's Gambit]] (1.d4 d5 2.c4), and [[Evans Gambit]] (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4). A gambit used by Black may also be called a gambit, e.g. the [[Latvian Gambit]] (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5), or [[Englund Gambit]] (1.d4 e5); but is sometimes called a "countergambit", e.g. the [[Albin Countergambit]] (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e5) and [[Greco Countergambit]] (an old-fashioned name for the Latvian Gambit).

The word "gambit" was originally applied to chess openings in 1561 by Spanish priest [[Ruy López de Segura]], from an Italian expression ''dare il gambetto'' (to put a leg forward in order to trip someone). López studied this maneuver, and so the Italian word gained the Spanish form ''gambito'' that led to French ''gambit'', which has influenced the English spelling of the word. The broader sense of "opening move meant to gain advantage" was first recorded in English in 1855.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Gambits are often said to be ''offered'' to an opponent, and that offer is then said to be either ''accepted'' or ''declined''. If a player who is offered a gambit captures the piece (and thus gains material) the gambit is said to be accepted. If the player who was offered the gambit ignores it and instead continues to develop his pieces, then the gambit is said to be declined.

In modern chess, the typical response to a moderately sound gambit is to accept the material and give the material back at an advantageous time. For gambits that are less sound, the accepting player is more likely to try to hold on to his extra material. A rule of thumb often found in various primers on chess suggests that a player should get three moves (see [[tempo (chess)|tempo]]) of {{chessgloss|development}} for a sacrificed pawn, but it is unclear how useful this general maxim is since the "free moves" part of the [[compensation (chess)|compensation]] is almost never the entirety of what the gambiteer gains. Of course, a player is not obliged to accept a gambit. Often, a gambit can be declined without disadvantage.

== Soundness ==
A gambit is said to be 'sound' if it is capable of procuring adequate concessions from the opponent. There are three general criteria in which a gambit is often said to be sound:

*Time gain: the player accepting the gambit must take time to procure the sacrificed material and possibly must use more time to reorganize his pieces after the material is taken.
*Generation of differential activity: often a player accepting a gambit will decentralize his pieces or pawns and his poorly placed pieces will allow the gambiteer to place his own pieces and pawns on squares that might otherwise have been inaccessible. In addition, bishops and rooks can become more active simply because the loss of pawns often gives rise to open {{chessgloss|files}} and {{chessgloss|diagonals}}. Former world champion [[Mikhail Tal]] once reportedly told [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] that he had sacrificed a pawn because it was simply in the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Russian Silhouettes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iJBCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20|first=Genna|last=Sosonko|authorlink=Genna Sosonko|accessdate=31 January 2016|publisher=New in Chess}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Generation of positional weaknesses: finally, accepting a gambit may lead to a compromised [[pawn structure]], holes or other positional deficiencies.

A good example of a sound gambit is the [[Scotch Gambit]]: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4.  Here Black can force White to sacrifice a pawn speculatively with 4...Bb4+, but White gets very good compensation for one pawn after 5.c3 dxc3 6.bxc3, or for two pawns after 6.0-0 inviting 6...cxb2 7.Bxb2, due to the development advantage and attacking chances against the black king.  As a result, Black is often advised not to try to hold on to the extra pawn.  A more dubious gambit is the so-called [[Halloween Gambit]]: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nxe5{{chesspunc|?!}} Nxe5 5.d4. Here the investment (a knight for just one pawn) is too large for the moderate advantage of having a strong center.

{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}
'''Gymkhana''' is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] event consisting of speed pattern racing and timed games for riders on [[horse]]s.  These events often emphasize children's participation and may be organized by a recognized [[Pony Club]] or a [[4-H]] club.  In parts of the western United States, this type of competition is usually called an "'''O-Mok-See'''" (also spelled "omoksee" or without hyphenation as "o mok see") competition, a term derived from a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] phrase said to mean "games on horseback."  Very small events with little or no prize money, designed for beginners or riders at a local level, are sometimes called '''playdays'''.   Gymkhana is the word used in most of the rest of the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom, and both the east and west coasts of the United States.

== Types of events ==

Gymkhana and o-mok-see classes include timed speed events such as  [[barrel racing]], [[pole bending]], [[keyhole race]], keg race (also known as "down and back"), [[Flag Racing|flag racing]], and stake race. Some organizations include ride and run, musical mats, egg stomp, $1 bill race or "ride a buck", and sack race. 

Most of these events are designed to display precise, controlled actions and tight teamwork between horse and rider at speed, and demonstrate many skills such as  [[flying change|flying lead chang]]es, sliding stops and more.  Most clubs offer a variety of classes for all ages and abilities of people, allowing riders to compete at the speed level at which they are most capable and comfortable.

==O-Mok-See==
O-Mok-See or omoksee is the most common term used in the Western United States for events in the sport of pattern horse racing. Most events are run with contestants simultaneously running in 4 separate lanes (3 for small arenas), with each contestant riding in a 30 foot wide lane. The origin of the term "O-Mok-See" is thought to specifically originate with the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]] people where they described a particular style of riding as "oh-mak-see pass-kan" meaning "riding big dance".  This event was thought to be a war ceremony; before setting out on a mounted expedition against the enemy, the warriors of the camp performed this dance as a part of the prelude of stirring up courage and enthusiasm for battle. The warriors put on their finest dress attire, decorated and painted their best horses, carrying their war bundles, shields, lances and bonnets. They mounted and gathered at some distance out of sight of the camp. They turned and rode together at full speed into the great camp circle, circled around it once and then rode to the center of the camp. In the center were a number of old men and women who sang special songs and beat drums for the horsemen. The horsemen then rode their trained horses to the rhythm of the singers and drummers. From time to time the riders dismounted and danced about on foot beside their horses, shooting in the air and shouting to one another to be brave when the battle came. If anyone fell from his horse during the ceremony it was considered an omen of bad luck.

===National Saddle Clubs Association===
The National Saddle Clubs Association (NSCA) was established in January 1965 as the first national organization of saddle clubs. The NSCA held its first national championship show in 1966.  The NSCA has adopted and promotes the sport of "pattern horse racing" under the term O-Mok-See. They encourage and allow families to compete together. The NSCA has adopted a set of pattern horse racing events for national competition . some of the events that they run are pole bending, California stake race, polo, key, international flags, Idaho figure-eight and two barrel Flags. There are also 10 or so more events in their rule book.  Through standardized rules and regulations for pattern horse racing events, the NSCA's prime purpose and objectives are to promote and cultivate cooperation and friendly relationships between saddle clubs throughout the United States.

'''H.O.C. Gazellen-Combinatie''', also known as '''HGC''', is a [[field hockey]] club located in [[Wassenaar]] on the border of [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The club was founded on 22 September 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hgc.nl/|title=HGC official website site|accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first teams (men and women) competed for many years on the highest level of the Dutch field hockey league, in the "Hoofdklasse". In 1995/'96 both the men's and the women's first team won the national championship. The men's 1st XI also compete in the [[Euro Hockey League]].

HGC has produced a number of internationals for the Dutch national teams as well as attracting a number of internationals from other countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3152">In the game of [[chess]], '''interference''' occurs when the line between an attacked piece and its defender is interrupted by [[Sacrifice (chess)|sacrificially]] [[Block (chess)|interposing]] a piece. It is a [[chess tactic]] which seldom arises, and is therefore often overlooked. Opportunities for interference are rare because the defended object must be more valuable than the sacrificed piece, and the interposition must itself represent a threat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-tactics--definitions-and-examples#interference Interference definitions and examples]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Examples==
{{Chess diagram
|tleft
|

|  |  |kd|rd|  |bd|  |  
|pd|pd|pd|  |  |  |  |pd
|  |  |  |  |  |  |pd|

|White to move
}}
In the position at left, White to play will apparently be obliged to retreat the knight from f5, because the squares to which it could advance are all guarded. However, the interference move 1.Nd6+ interrupts the black rook's defense of the black queen. If Black plays either 1...cxd6 or 1...Bxd6, White will capture Black's queen. Therefore, Black has no better play than 1...Rxd6 2.exd6 Qxe2 3.Rxe2 Bxd6, conceding [[the exchange (chess)|the exchange]] for a pawn.

A more subtle example of interference occurs when the interposing piece interrupts two lines simultaneously. In this case, the moving piece does not have to pose a threat by itself.  Instead, it makes the opponent trip over his own feet, so to speak, because capturing the offending piece will necessarily break one line of defense or the other.

{{Chess diagram
|tright

|  |rl|  |rd|  |  |  |  
|pl|  |  |  |  |pd|  |kd
|  |  |  |  |  |  |pd|pd

|kl|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  
|  |bl|pl|rd|  |  |  |pl
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  
|White to move
}}
In the position at right, White is at a material disadvantage, and apparently can't queen the a-pawn because the black bishop guards the queening square. However, 1.Nd5! interferes with the bishop and with the black rooks' defense of each other. If 1...Bxd5, 2.Rxd8 is crushing. Also, if 1.Nd5 is answered by 1...R8xd5, it would allow 2.Rh8 mate. The best Black can do is 1...R2xd5, interfering with the bishop's guard of a8 and allowing 2.a8=Q.

Although interferences are quite rare in actual play, they are a common theme in [[chess problem]]s. The device in the last example above, in which a sacrifice occurs on the intersection of the defensive lines of two differently moving pieces, is known to problemists as a ''[[Novotny (chess)|Novotny]]''. Various other types of interference are given specific names in [[chess problem terminology|problem terminology]], including the [[Grimshaw (chess)|Grimshaw]], [[Plachutta]] where the two pieces both move orthogonally (see a [[Siegbert Tarrasch#Famous Tarrasch combinations|beautiful example by Tarrasch]]), [[Anti-Bristol]], [[Holzhausen interference|Holzhausen]] and [[Wurzburg-Plachutta]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">'''Jokari''' is a game principally for two players, but it can also be played solo. The game consists of a rubber ball attached to an anchor by means of a long elastic band, which makes the ball come back when you hit it. Jokari is played with wooden paddles.

The jokari was invented in France in 1938, by Louis Joseph Miremont, then residing in [[Bayonne]].

== The Jokari Company ==
The company does still exist, but has relocated to Carrollton, TX, and does not sell the game anymore. The Jokari company now manufactures and markets solution gadgets and storage and organization products, including the Fizz-Keeper, Purse Rack, and Can Caps.

== Cultural references ==
The game has reached some cult status in France, it is featured in several comics, and also in the [[James Bond]] [[Parody|spoof]] movie ''[[OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]]'' (2006), in the English translation of which the game is called "paddleball." Ian Fleming's character, James Bond, (in the first chapter of "On Her Majesty's Secret Service") also refers to the game Jokari as he is watching a bathing beach on the northern coast of France.

The [[Olympic Games]] is a major international [[multi-sport event]]. During its history, both the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] and [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]] were a subject of many scandals, controversies, and illegal drug uses.

Some states have [[boycott]]ed the Games on various occasions, often as a sign of protest against the [[International Olympic Committee]], often having [[racial discrimination]] or contemporary politics of other participants. After both [[World Wars]], the losing countries were not invited. Other controversies include [[Doping_in_sport#By_country|doping programs]], decisions by [[referee]]s and even [[gesture]]s made by [[Sportsperson|athletes]].

* Nine-time Finnish Olympic gold medallist [[Paavo Nurmi]] was found to be a professional athlete and barred from running in the Games. The main conductors of the ban were Swedish officials, especially [[Sigfrid Edström]], who claimed that Nurmi had received too much money for his travel expenses. However, Nurmi did travel to Los Angeles and kept training at the Olympic Village. Despite pleas from all the entrants of the marathon, he was not allowed to compete at the Games. This incident, in part, led to Finland refusing to participate in the traditional [[Finland-Sweden athletics international]] event until 1939.
* After winning the silver in [[equestrian dressage]], Swedish equestrian [[Bertil Sandström]] was demoted to last for clicking to his horse to win encouragement. He asserted that it was a creaking saddle making the sounds.

*In 1931 the IOC selected the German capital city Berlin as the host city of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. However, following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, the plans for the Olympic Games became entangled with the politics of the Nazi regime. [[Adolf Hitler]] regarded the event as 'his' Olympics and sought to exploit the Games for propaganda purposes, with the aim of showcasing the post-First World War Germany. In 1936, a number of prominent politicians and organizations called for a boycott of the Summer Olympics, while other campaigners called for the games to be relocated.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1009630.html|first=Saul|last=Newman|title=Why Grandpa boycotted the Olympics|work=Haaretz|accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USHMM_boycott&gt;{{cite web|title=The Movement to Boycott the Berlin Olympics of 1936|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007087|work=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=8 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095138/http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007087|archivedate=2 February 2014 |date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] government of Spain decided to boycott the Berlin Games entirely and, together with labour and socialist groups around the world, organized an alternative event, the [[People's Olympiad]]. The event did not take place however; just as the Games were about to begin the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out and the People's Olympiad was cancelled.

* The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage.

[[Peter Norman]], a white Australian who finished in second place, wore a human rights badge in solidarity, and was heavily criticised upon returning to Australia.
* [[Věra Čáslavská]], in protest to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people, but was made an outcast by the Soviet dominated government.
* Students in Mexico City tried to make use of the media attention for their country to protest the authoritarian Mexican government. The government reacted with violence, culminating in the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]] ten days before the Games began and more than two thousand protesters were shot at by government forces.

Eleven athletes, coaches and judges were murdered by the terrorists.
* [[Rhodesia]] was banned from participating in the Olympics as the result of a 36 to 31 vote by the IOC held four days before the opening ceremonies. African countries had threatened to boycott the Munich games had the white minority ruled regime been permitted to send a team. The ban occurred over the objections of IOC president [[Avery Brundage]] who, in his speech following the Munich massacre, controversially compared the anti-Rhodesia campaign to the terrorist attack on the Olympic village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/22/newsid_3549000/3549444.stm | work=BBC News | title=1972: Rhodesia out of Olympics | date=22 August 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Rhodesia at the Olympics]])
* In the [[1972 Olympic Men's Basketball Final|controversial gold medal basketball game]], the US Olympic Basketball team battled for the gold medal for the last few seconds against the team from the Soviet Union.With three seconds left in the gold medal game, American forward [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] sank two free throws to put the Americans up 50–49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the U.S. again began celebrating. However, final three seconds was replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded. The U.S. players voted unanimously to refuse their silver medals, and at least one team member, Kenny Davis, has directed in his will that his heirs are never to accept the medals, even posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gary Smith |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1003894/6/index.htm |title=Pieces of Silver |work=Sports Illustrated|date=1992-06-15 |accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the men's field hockey final Michael Krause's goal in the 60th minute gave the host West Germans a 1–0 victory in the final over the defending champion Pakistan. Pakistan's players complained about some of the umpiring and disagreed that Krause's goal was good. After the game, Pakistani fans ran onto the field in rage; some players and fans dumped water on Belgium's Rene Frank, then the head of the sport's international governing body. During the medals ceremony, the players staged their protest, some of them turning their backs to the West German flag. Reports also mention that the Pakistani players handled their silver medals disrespectfully. According to the story in the ''Washington Post'', the team's manager, G.R. Chaudhry, said that his team thought the outcome had been "pre-planned" by the officials, Horacio Servetto of Argentina and Richard Jewell of Australia.

* Canada initially refused to allow the [[Chinese Taipei at the Olympics|Republic of China]]'s team into the country as Canada did not recognize Taiwan as a nation. Canada's decision was in violation of its agreement with the IOC to allow all recognized teams. Canada then agreed to allow the Taiwanese athletes into the country but only if they did not compete under the name or flag of the Republic of China. This led to protests and a threatened boycott by other countries including the US but came to naught after the IOC acquiesced to the Canadian demand which, in turn, led to the Republic of China's boycott of the games. The People's Republic of China also continued its boycott over the failure of the IOC to recognize its team as the sole representative of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1976/|title=1976 Montréal Summer Games|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact number of boycotting nations is difficult to determine, as a total of 62 eligible countries did not participate, but some of those countries withdrew due to financial hardships, only claiming to join the boycott to avoid embarrassment.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Iran at the Olympics|Iran]] also boycotted the Moscow Games owing to [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini's]] support for the Islamic Conference’s condemnation of the invasion of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Golan, Galia; Soviet Policies in the Middle East: From World War Two to Gorbachev; p. 193 {{ISBN|9780521358590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 80 countries participated in the Moscow games, fewer than the 92 that had joined the 1976 games which had also been the target of boycotts and the lowest number since the 1960 Rome Games which had also featured 80 countries. A substitute event, titled the [[Liberty Bell Classic]] (often referred to as Olympic Boycott Games) was held at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]] by 29 of the boycotting countries.
* A 1989 report by a committee of the [[Australian Senate]] claimed that "there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner...who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

* [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott]]: The Soviet Union and fourteen of its allies boycotted the 1984 Games held in Los Angeles, United States, citing lack of security for their athletes as the official reason.

* In a highly controversial 3–2 judge's decision, South Korean [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Park Si-Hun]] defeated American [[Roy Jones, Jr.]], despite Jones pummelling Park for three rounds, landing 86 punches to Park's 32. Allegedly, Park himself apologized to Jones afterward. One judge shortly thereafter admitted the decision was a mistake, and all three judges voting against Jones were eventually suspended. The official [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] investigation concluding in 1997 found that three of the judges had been wined and dined by South Korean officials. This led to calls for Jones to be awarded a gold medal, but the IOC still officially stands by the decision, despite the allegations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Sad Day in Seoul|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/history/a/controversy.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* American diver [[Greg Louganis]] suffered a concussion after he struck his head on the springboard during the preliminary rounds. He completed the preliminaries despite his injury, earning the highest single score of the qualifying round for his next dive and repeated the dive during the finals, earning the gold medal by a margin of 25 points. However, Louganis at the time had just been diagnosed [[HIV]]-positive six months prior to the games—a diagnosis that was not publicly disclosed until 1995. Most of Louganis' corporate sponsors dropped him as a client following the disclosure in 1995, and people in and out of the international diving community began to question Louganis' decision not to disclose his HIV status during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, even though blood in a pool posed no risk. The blood was diluted by thousands of gallons of water, and "chlorine kills HIV", said John Ward, chief of [[HIV]]/[[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome|AIDS]] surveillance at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also, skin is a very effective barrier to HIV; only a diver with an open wound would face any risk. "If the virus just touches the skin, it is unheard of for it to cause infection: the skin has no receptors to bind HIV", explained [[Anthony Fauci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1995/03/05/the-risk-pool-the-dangers-are-off-the-field.html|title=The Daily Beast|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the Women's artistic gymnastics, Australian competitor [[Allana Slater]] complained that the vault was set too low. The vault was measured and found to be 5 centimetres lower than it should have been. A number of the gymnasts made unusual errors, including the American Elise Ray, who missed the vault completely in her warm-up, and British [[Annika Reeder]], who fell and had to be carried off the mat after being injured. After [[Svetlana Khorkina]]'s warm-up, she complained to officials that the vault was set too low, but her protests were ignored. She proceeded to take her first attempt, but crashed painfully on her knees, ruining her chances of gold.
* Romanian [[Andreea Răducan]] became the first gymnast to be stripped of a medal after testing positive for [[pseudoephedrine]], at the time a prohibited substance.&lt;ref&gt;As of [http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2006_LIST.pdf 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819211130/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/2006_LIST.pdf |date=19 August 2008 }}, pseudoephedrine was not considered a prohibited substance by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].

* Chinese gymnast [[Dong Fangxiao]] was stripped of a bronze medal in April 2010. Investigations by the sport's governing body (FIG) found that she was only 14 at the 2000 Games. (To be eligible the gymnastic athletes must turn 16 during the Olympic year). Dong also lost a sixth-place result in the individual floor exercises and seventh in the vault. FIG recommended the IOC take the medal back as her scores aided China in winning the team bronze. The US women's team, who had come fourth in the event, then moved up to third (bronze medal).&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Stephen "[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/ioc-strips-china-of-gymnastics-bronze-20100429-tsss.html IOC strips China of gymnastics bronze ]", ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'',  29 April 2010.

* In a tournament match in men's volleyball, the US and Greece were in the final game of the match (Game 5). When the Americans were handling the ball, a whistle was blown from the audience.

Shin A-Lam was offered a consolation medal but declined the offer.
* In the men's team artistic gymnastics, Japan was promoted to the silver medal position after successfully lodging an appeal over [[Kōhei Uchimura]]'s final [[pommel horse]] performance. His fall on the last piece of apparatus had initially relegated the Japanese to fourth, and elevated hosts Great Britain to silver, and Ukraine to bronze. Although the decision to upgrade the Japanese score was greeted with boos in the arena (where the reasoning for the appeal was not fully known), the teams involved accepted the correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic gymnastics: Why does bronze mean so much for Britain?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19058466|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the Men's Light Fly Gold Medal match between [[Kaeo Pongprayoon]] of Thailand and [[Zou Shiming]] of China, the Chinese fighter won on a controversial decision. The Thai boxer was hit with a two-point penalty for an unclear offence with 9 seconds left in the bout to give the Chinese boxer the clear advantage in the point system. The crowd showed an unappreciated outcome after the Chinese boxer beat the Thai boxer 13–10. Zou's second gold made him the first man to win three medals in the light flyweight. He took bronze at the 2004 Athens Games, Gold in the 2008 Beijing Games and Gold in 2012 London Games.

Comments by Canadian captain Christine Sinclair questioning the delay of time call made against goalkeeper Erin McLeod, which is a call rarely made unless the goalkeeper is blatantly wasting time, led to a suspension from FIFA following the Olympics. The US ended up winning gold in the final and Canada finished with a bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/rio-2016/canada-loses-a-heartbreaker-to-u-s-in-olympic-soccer-semi-final|title=Canada loses a heartbreaker to U.S. in Olympic soccer semi-final|website=News.nationalpost.com|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Indian Olympic Committee lodged a protest against the judges' decision in the match between Indian boxer Sumit Sangwan and Brazilian [[Yamaguchi Falcao]].

*The badminton women's doubles tournament at the 2012 Olympic Games in London took place from 28 July to 4 August at Wembley Arena. The competition became embroiled in controversy during the group stage when eight players (both pairs from South Korea and one pair each from China and Indonesia) were ejected from the tournament by the Badminton World Federation after being found guilty of "not using best efforts" and "conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport" by playing to lose matches in order to manipulate the draw for the knockout stage. In one match, both teams made a series of basic errors, and in one match the maximum rally was just four shots.
* In the Men's Bantamweight early round match, Japanese boxer Satoshi Shimizu floored Magomed Abdulhamidov of Azerbaijan six times in the third round.  The referee, Ishanguly Meretnyyazov of Turkmenistan, never scored a count in each of the six knockdowns and let the fight continue on.  Meretnyyazov claimed they were slips, and even fixed Abdulhamidov's headgear during the affair.  Abdulhamidov had to be helped to his corner following the round.  The fight was scored 22-17 in favour of Abdulhamidov.  AIBA, governing body for Olympic boxing, overturned the result following an appeal by Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/02/olympics-boxing-satoshi-shimizu-appeal | work=The Guardian | title=Olympic boxing: referee sent home after Satoshi Shimizu wins appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Ikhtiyor was awarded a penalty point for Mandakhnaran "failing to engage" during the end of the match, which resulted in Ikhtiyor winning the bronze due. The Mongolian coaches protested the point, which could not be challenged, by stripping in front of the judges on the mat, resulting in a shoe being sent into the judges' table.

* Controversy surrounded the new judging system in [[boxing at the 2016 Summer Olympics|boxing]]; the new system had five judges who judge each bout, and a computer would randomly select three whose scores were counted.

* French skier [[Jean-Claude Killy]] achieved a clean sweep of the then-three alpine skiing medals at Grenoble, but only after what the IOC bills as the "greatest controversy in the history of the Winter Olympics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&amp;OLGY=1968 www.Olympic.org] IOC, 1968 Grenoble Games.&lt;/ref&gt; The slalom run was held in poor visibility and Austrian skier [[Karl Schranz]] claimed a course patrolman crossed his path during the slalom race, causing him to stop. Schranz was given a restart and posted the fastest time. A Jury of Appeal then reviewed the television footage, declared that Schranz had missed a gate on the upper part of the first run, annulled his repeat run time, and gave the medal to Killy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Dan|title=JEAN-CLAUDE WINS THE BATTLE AND THE WAR|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1968/02/26/547300/jeanclaude-wins-the-battle-and-the-war|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Sports Illustrated|issue=Feb. 26, 1968|date=26 February 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schranz's case was particularly high-profile because of the disqualification controversy centring on [[Karl Schranz|Schranz]] and French skier [[Jean-Claude Killy]] at the 1968 games and Schranz's subsequent dominance of alpine skiing in the [[Alpine skiing World Cup|Skiing World Cups]] of 1969 and 1970. However, the ostensible reason was that [[Karl Schranz|Schranz]] was photographed at a soccer game wearing a T-shirt with a coffee advertisement. The incident led directly to changes in athlete sponsorship rules: Schranz reportedly said of these "It's an emphasis on the wrong principle. I think the Olympics should be a contest of all sportsmen, with no regard for color, race or wealth."&lt;ref name="They Said It"/&gt; [[Avery Brundage|Brundage]]'s twenty-year reign as President of the IOC ended six months later and subsequent presidents have been limited to terms of eight years, renewable once for four years. There were no boycotts during the games, but there were few protesters.
*The advent of the state-sponsored "full-time amateur athlete" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name="Benjamin, Daniel"/&gt; Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}

The '''playoffs''', '''play-offs''', '''postseason'''  and/or '''finals''' of a [[sports league]] are a competition played after the [[Regular season|regular season]] by the top competitors to determine the league champion or a similar accolade. Depending on the league, the playoffs may be either a single game, a series of games, or a [[tournament]], and may use a [[Single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] system or one of several other [[playoff format|different playoff formats]]. Playoff, in regard to international fixtures, is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament.

In team sports in the U.S. and Canada, the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross-country travel have led to regional divisions of teams. Generally, during the regular season, teams play more games in their division than outside it, but the league's best teams might not play against each other in the regular season. Therefore, in the postseason a playoff series is organized. Any group-winning team is eligible to participate, and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second- or even lower-placed teams – the term "[[wild card (sports)|wild card]]" refers to these teams.

In England and Scotland, playoffs are used in [[association football]] to decide [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] for lower-finishing teams, rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America. In the [[EFL Championship]] (the second tier of English football), teams finishing 3rd to 6th after the regular season compete to decide the final promotion spot to the [[Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football League Regulations – Section 3|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/regulations/20120702/section-3-the-league_2293633_2125717#10|publisher=football league|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929122708/http://www.football-league.co.uk/regulations/20120702/section-3-the-league_2293633_2125717#10|archivedate=29 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American football==
===National Football League===
{{Main|NFL playoffs}}

Evidence of playoffs in [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] dates to at least 1919, when the "[[New York Pro Football League|New York Pro Championship]]" was held in [[Western New York]] (it is possible one was held in 1917, but that is not known for sure). The [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] metropolitan areas each played a championship game, the winners of which would advance to the "New York Pro Championship" on Thanksgiving weekend. The top New York teams were eventually absorbed into the NFL upon its founding in 1920, but the league (mostly driven by an [[Ohio League]] that did not have true championship games, though they frequently scheduled ''de facto'' championship matchups) did not adopt the New York league's playoff format, opting for a championship based on regular season record for its first twelve seasons; as a result, four of the first six "championships" were disputed. Technically, a vote of league owners was all that was required to win a title, but the owners had a [[gentlemen's agreement]] to pledge votes based on a score (wins divided by the sum of wins and losses, with a few tiebreakers). When two teams tied at the top of the standings in 1932, an [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|impromptu playoff game]] was scheduled to settle the tie.

The [[National Football League]] divided its teams into divisions in 1933 and began holding a single playoff championship game between division winners. In 1950 the NFL absorbed three teams from the rival [[All-America Football Conference]], and the former "Divisions" were now called "Conferences", echoing the college use of that term. In 1967, the NFL expanded and created four divisions under the two conferences, which led to the institution of a larger playoff tournament. After the [[AFL-NFL merger]] brought the [[American Football League]] into the NFL, the NFL began to use three divisions and a single wild card team in each conference for its playoffs, in order to produce eight contenders out of six divisions; this was later expanded in 1978 &amp; 1990 so that more wild card teams could participate.

In 2002 the NFL added its 32nd team, the [[Houston Texans]], and significantly reshuffled its divisional alignment. The league went from 6 division winners and 6 wild card spots to 8 division winners and only 4 wild card qualifiers. The winners of each division automatically earn a playoff spot and a home game in their first rounds, and the two top non-division winners from each conference will also make the playoffs as wild-card teams. The top two teams with the best records in the regular season get a first round bye, and each of the bottom two division winners plays one of the two wild-card teams. Each winner of a wild-card game then plays one of the two bye teams. The winners of these two games go to the conference championships, and the winners of those conference championship games then face each other in the [[Super Bowl]].

===College football===
====Division I NCAA Football FBS====
{{Main|College Football Playoff National Championship}}
The '''College Football Playoff National Championship''' is a post-season [[college football]] [[bowl game]], used to determine a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champion]] of the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), which began play in the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014 college football season]].&lt;ref name="USA Today April 25. 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/04/24/college-football-playoff-questions-and-answers/2111419/|title=Questions and answers for the College Football Playoff|last=Wolken |first=Dan |date=25 April 2013 |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game serves as the final of the [[College Football Playoff]], a [[bracket (tournament)|bracket tournament]] between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee, which was established as a successor to the [[Bowl Championship Series]] and its similar [[BCS National Championship Game]]. Unlike the BCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls—hosted by two of the consortium's six member bowls yearly—and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls.

The game is played at a neutral site, determined through bids by prospective host cities (similarly to the [[Super Bowl]] and [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]]). When announcing it was soliciting bids for the 2016 and 2017 title games, playoff organizers noted that the bids must propose host stadiums with a capacity of at least 65,000 spectators,&lt;ref name="stadium-future"&gt;{{cite web|title=CFB playoff opens bidding for 2016, '17 championship games|author=Jerry Hinnen|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 9, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/eye-on-college-football/23053828/cfb-playoff-opens-bidding-for-2016-2017-championship-games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stadium-future"/&gt; and cities cannot host both a semi-final game and the title game in the same year.&lt;ref name="future-hosting"&gt;{{cite web|title=More bids on future title game sites|author=Brett McMurphy|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 26, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9511533/at-least-7-cities-bid-2016-2017-title-games-sources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner of the game is awarded a new championship trophy instead of the [[AFCA National Championship Trophy|"crystal football"]], which has been given by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] (AFCA) since 1986; officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous BCS championship system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New College Football Playoff will reportedly feature a new trophy|author=Dennis Dodd|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 30, 2013|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/dennis-dodd/22857775/say-goodbye-to-the-crystal-football-bcs-symbol-will-not-be-retained}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy]] is sponsored by [[Dr Pepper]], which paid an estimated $35 million for the sponsorship rights through 2020.&lt;ref name="trophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN Inks Dr Pepper as First Mega-Sponsor of the College Football Playoff Series|author=Anthony Crupi|publisher=Adweek|date=March 25, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2014|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/espn-inks-dr-pepper-first-mega-sponsor-college-football-playoff-series-156518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 26.5-inch high, 35-pound trophy was unveiled on July 14, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Prisbell, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2014/07/14/college-football-playoff-trophy-unveiling/12624861/ College Football Playoff national championship trophy unveiled], ''USA Today'', July 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Division I NCAA Football FCS====
{{Main|NCAA Division I Football Championship}} 
The '''NCAA Division I Football Championship'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div1fbchampionship.com/|title=NCAA Division I Football Championship|website=www.div1fbchampionship.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[college football]] tournament played each year to determine the champion of the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). Prior to 2006, the game was known as the '''NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship'''. The FCS is the  highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion. The [[College Football Playoff|four-team playoff system]] used by the [[Division I-A|Bowl Subdivision]] is not sanctioned by the NCAA.

====Division II NCAA Football====
{{Main|NCAA Division II Football Championship}}
The '''NCAA Division II Football Championship''' is an American [[college football]] tournament played annually to determine a champion at the [[NCAA Division II]] level. It was first held in 1973. Prior to 1973, four regional [[bowl game]]s were played in order to provide postseason action for what was then called the "NCAA College Division" and a poll determined the final champion.

The National Championship game was held at [[Sacramento, California]] from 1973 to 1975. It was in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]] in 1976 and 1977. The game was played in [[Longview, Texas]] in 1978. For 1979 and 1980, [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] hosted the game. [[McAllen, Texas]] hosted the championship games from 1981 to 1985. From 1986 to 2013, the Division II championship game was played at [[Braly Municipal Stadium]] near the campus of the [[University of North Alabama]] in [[Florence, Alabama]]. Between 2014 and 2017, the championship game was played at [[Children's Mercy Park]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingkc.com/news/2013/12/kansas-city-host-14-ncaa-championships|title=Kansas City to host 14 NCAA championships|work=Sporting Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1994, the games have been broadcast on [[ESPN]].

====Division III NCAA Football====
{{Main|NCAA Division III Football Championship}}
The '''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[college football|Football]] Championship''' began in [[1973 in sports|1973]]. Before 1973, most of the schools now in Division III competed either in the NCAA College Division or the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA). NCAA Divisions II and III were created by splitting the College Division in two, with schools that wished to continue awarding [[athletic scholarship]]s placed in Division II and those that did not want to award them placed in Division III.

The Division III playoffs begin with 32 teams selected to participate in the playoffs. The Division III championship game, known as the '''[[Amos Alonzo Stagg|Stagg]] Bowl''', has been played annually in [[Salem, Virginia|Salem]], [[Virginia]] at [[Salem Football Stadium]] since 1993. It was previously played in [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]], [[Alabama]] at [[Garrett-Harrison Stadium]] (1973–1982, 1985–1989), at the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], when the Hall was located in [[Kings Island, Ohio|Kings Island]], [[Ohio]] at [[Galbreath Field]] (1983–1984), and [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], [[Florida]] at [[Hawkins Stadium]] (1990–1992).

==Association football==
As a rule, international [[association football]] has only had championship playoffs when a league is divided into several equal divisions/conferences/groups ([[Major League Soccer]]) and/or when the season is [[Apertura and Clausura|split into two periods]] (as in many leagues in Latin America, such as Mexico's [[Liga MX]]). In leagues with a single table done only once a year, as in most of Europe, playoff systems are not used to determine champions, although in some countries such systems are used to determine teams to be promoted to higher leagues (e.g., England) or qualifiers for European club competitions (such as Greece and the Netherlands), usually between teams that didn't perform well enough to earn an automatic spot.

A ''test match'' is a match played at the end of a season between a team that has done badly in a higher league and one that has done well in a lower league of the same football [[league system]]. The format of a test match series varies; for instance it can be a head-to-head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league, or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league. The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.

=== International playoffs ===
In international [[association football|football]], playoffs were a feature of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] and [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] final tournaments. They are still a feature of the qualification tournaments for the [[FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA European Football Championship]].

In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification playoffs]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], for example:
* In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off UEFA)|Europe]], after the first-place finishers in each of eight groups received automatic finals places, along with the two second-place teams that had earned the most points against teams in the top six of their individual groups, the remaining six second-placed teams entered playoffs to select three teams for the finals.
* The winners of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (OFC)|Oceania qualifying tournament]], [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off CONMEBOL-OFC)|played]] the fifth placed team from the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|South American qualifying tournament]], [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].
* The fifth-placed team of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|Asia qualifying tournament]], [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (play-off AFC-CONCACAF)|played]] the fourth-placed team in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualifying tournament]], [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]].

=== Knockout competitions ===
In addition to their league competitions, most European footballing nations also have [[single elimination tournament|knockout cup competitions]] – English football, for example, has the [[FA Cup]] and the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]. These competitions are open to many teams — 92 clubs compete for the League Cup, and hundreds compete for the FA Cup. These competitions run concurrently with the "regular season" league competitions and are not regarded as playoffs.

===Argentina===
In [[Argentina|Argentine]] football, playoffs in the style of the English leagues occur in the [[Primera B Metropolitana]], part of the third tier, and leagues below it ([[Primera C Metropolitana]] and [[Primera D Metropolitana]]). All ''Primera Metropolitana'' tourneys cover the area in and around [[Buenos Aires]], the capital city. The ''Torneo Reducidos'' (reduced tournaments), however, involve 8 teams below the top two, as opposed to 4.

Before the top-flight [[Argentine Primera División]] abandoned its traditional [[Apertura and Clausura]] format in 2015 in favor of an expanded single season, there was no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winners.  As a result, the league crowned two champions each year. After each Clausura, the two teams with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Primera División games) were relegated to [[Primera B Nacional]] to be replaced by that league's champion and runner-up teams; the two teams immediately above contested promotion/relegation series with the third and fourth places in Primera B Nacional, counted by its aggregate table. In Primera B Nacional, the same procedure continues in use for relegation to either Primera B Metropolitana or [[Torneo Argentino A]] for non-Buenos Aires clubs. From 2015 onward, relegation from the Primera División will be based solely on league position at the end of the season (which, effective in 2016–17, changed from a February–December format to an August–June format).

=== Australia ===
The Australian [[A-League]], which also features [[Wellington Phoenix FC|a team in New Zealand]], has determined its champions via a playoff system, officially known as the "Finals Series" (reflecting standard Australian English usage), since its inception in the [[2005–06 A-League|2005–06 season]].

From the league's inception through the [[2008–09 A-League|2008–09 season]], the top four teams advanced to the finals series, employed using a modified [[Page playoff system]]. The top two teams at the end of league play were matched in one semifinal, with the winner advancing directly to the Grand Final and the loser going into the Preliminary Final. The next two teams played a semifinal for a place in the Preliminary Final, whose winner took the other place in the Grand Final. Both semifinals were two-legged, while the Preliminary Final and Grand Final were one-off matches.

When the league expanded to 10 teams beginning in [[2009–10 A-League|2009–10]], the finals expanded to six teams. The format of the six-team playoff established at that time was:
* The "semifinals" were held over a two-week period. The pairings for Week 1 of the semifinals were 1 vs 2, 3 vs 6, and 4 vs 5.
* In Week 1, the top two teams played the first leg of a two-legged match, and the remaining teams played one-off knockout matches.
* In Week 2, the top two teams played the second leg of their semifinal, and the two other surviving teams played a one-off match. The winner of the two-legged match advanced directly to the Grand Final, while the loser of that match joined the winner of the last semifinal in the Preliminary Final.
* The Preliminary Final and Grand Final remained unchanged.

Starting with the [[2012–13 A-League|2012–13 season]], the finals format has been changed to a pure knockout tournament consisting entirely of one-off matches:
* In Week 1, two Elimination Finals will be held, with the pairings being 3 vs 6 and 4 vs 5.
* In Week 2, the winners of the Elimination Finals advance to Semi-Finals. The top team on the regular-season table, called the "premiers" by the A-League, plays the lowest-seeded survivor of the Elimination Finals, and the second-place team plays the other Elimination Final survivor.
* The Grand Final, pitting the two Semi-Final winners, takes place in Week 3.

It should be noted that the concept of a finals series/playoff is standard in Australian sport.

=== Belgium ===
The [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Belgian First Division A|First Division A]] (previously known as the "First Division" and "Pro League") has a fairly complex playoff system, currently consisting of two levels and at one time three.

Since the 2009–10 season, playoffs have been held to determine the champion and tickets for the Champions League and Europa League. The six highest ranked teams play home-and-away matches against each other; a total of 10 matches each. The 6 participating teams start with the points accumulated during the regular competition divided by two. The first 3 teams after the play-offs get a European ticket. The fourth ranked team (or fifth, when the cup holder is already qualified for European football) plays a knock-out match against the winner of play-off 2. From 2009–10 through 2015–16, teams ranked 7–14 played in two groups; from 2016–17 forward, this playoff will continue to be contested in two groups, but with a total of 12 teams (details below). All points gained from the regular competition are lost. The two group winners play a final match to determine the winner of play-off 2. The winning team plays a final match against the fourth-ranked team (or fifth) for the last European ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksvroeselare.be/index.php?id=533 |title=KSV Roeselare – #oltegoareroeselare |publisher=Ksvroeselare.be |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play-off system has been criticized because more points per match can be earned in the play-off stage than in the regular competition. This way the team who wins the most matches isn't automatically the national champion. The biggest upside in favor of the play-off system is the higher number of matches (40 instead of 34 compared to the previous season) and more top matches. The extra matches also generate higher revenues for the teams.

Nonetheless, the higher number of matches takes an extra toll on teams and players. Besides play-offs, the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB) also introduced Christmas football in order to complete the extra matches in time. This posed some problems because a few matches had to be cancelled due to snowy pitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/091219_charleroi_standard_vooraf |title=Sneeuwval maakt voetballen onmogelijk |language =Dutch|date = 19 December 2009 |website = Sporza |accessdate = 2009-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091224110500/http://www.sporza.be/cm/sporza/voetbal/Jupiler_Pro_League/091219_charleroi_standard_vooraf |archivedate=2009-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The delays will probably cause the tight schedule to fail and postpone the end of the season.{{speculation inline}}

Some structural changes were instituted in [[2015–16 Belgian Pro League|2015–16]]:
* The team that finished atop the regular-season table is now assured of a Europa League place if they fail to finish in a Champions League qualifying spot (currently top two places).
* The first tiebreaker between Championship Round teams is now regular-season position.
* Accumulated yellow cards from the regular season are erased, although suspensions will continue to carry over. During the playoffs, three accumulated yellow cards will result in a suspension, as opposed to five during the regular season.

From 1974 through 2015, the 15th team out of 16 in the final standings was involved in a playoff pool with three teams from the [[Belgian First Division B|Belgian Second Division]] after each season, to determine which of these teams played in the First Division/Pro League the oncoming season. The lowest ranked team of the First Division/Pro League was relegated and replaced by the Second Division champion.

Originally, these playoffs were introduced in 1974 and were part of the Second Division, to determine which team was promoted to the highest level together with the division champions. From the [[2005–06 Belgian First Division|2005–06 season]] on, only one team was relegated directly from the First Division, with the 17th team taking part in the playoff. As a result, this playoff was still called the [[Belgian Second Division Final Round]], although one team from the Pro League took part each year.

Starting in 2015–16, this playoff was scrapped and replaced with direct relegation for the bottom Pro League/First Division A team only.

Further changes will be introduced to the Europa League playoffs from 2016–17 forward. The playoff will involve a total of 12 teams—nine from First Division A, and three from First Division B (the renamed Second Division). The First Division A qualifiers will be those finishing between 7th and 15th on the regular-season table. The First Division B qualifiers will be the top three teams from that league's regular-season table, excluding the division champion, which instead earns promotion to First Division A. As in the previous format, the teams will be divided into two groups, each playing home-and-away within the group, and the two group winners will play a one-off final, with the winner of that match advancing to a one-off match against the fourth- or fifth-place team from the championship playoff (depending on available European slots) for the final Europa League place.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, the [[Copa do Brasil]], the second most prestigious country-wide competition, is contested in pure "knockout" format since its inception in 1989. While the top two tiers in the Brazilian League – [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Série A]] and [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B|Série B]] – are contested in double round robin format, the lower tiers [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série C|Série C]] and [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série D|Série D]] include knockout rounds in their final stages.

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria instituted an elaborate playoff system in its top flight, the [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|First League]], in the 2016–17 season.

After the league's 14 teams play a full home-and-away season, the league splits into two playoffs—a 6-team "championship playoff" and an 8-team "qualifying playoff", with the latter split into two 4-team groups. Each playoff begins with teams carrying over all goals and statistics from the home-and-away season.

Each team in the championship playoff plays the others home and away one additional time. At the end of this stage:
* The top team is declared league champion, and earns the country's sole place in the UEFA Champions League.
* The second-place team earns a place in the UEFA Europa League.
* The highest-placed team that has not already qualified for European competition advances to an eventual one-off match for the country's final Europa League place. This will often be the third-place team, but if the winner of the Bulgarian Cup (which earns an automatic Europa League place) is in the top three of the playoff, the fourth-place team will take its place.

Each group within the qualifying playoff also plays home and away within its group; after this stage, teams enter another level of playoffs depending on their positions in the group.

The top two teams in each group enter a knockout playoff consisting entirely of two-legged matches (unless one of these teams is the winner of that season's Bulgarian Cup, in which case it will not enter the playoff and the team that it would have played receives a bye into the playoff final). The winner of this playoff then contests a one-off match against the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff, with the winner claiming the final Europa League place.

The bottom two teams from each group begin a series of relegation playoffs. The series starts with a knockout playoff that also consists entirely of two-legged matches. The winner of the playoff remains in the First League for the following season. The losing teams then enter the following series of two-legged promotion/relegation matches:
# The losers of the knockout semifinals play, with the loser relegated to the Second League.
# The loser of the knockout final plays the third-place team from the Second League, with the winner playing in the next season's First League.
# Finally, the winner of Match 1 above plays the second-place team from the Second League, with the winner also playing in the next season's First League.

=== Dominican Republic ===
With the creation of the [[Liga Dominicana de Fútbol]] in 2014 to replace the [[Primera División de Republica Dominicana]], it introduced a playoff system to determine the champion of the season.

=== England ===
{{Main|English Football League play-offs}}

When [[English Football League|the Football League]] was first expanded to two divisions in 1892, [[Football League test matches|test matches]] were employed to decide relegation and promotion between them, but the practice was scrapped in favour of automatic relegation and promotion in 1898.

The use of play-offs to decide promotion issues returned to the League in 1986 with the desire to reduce the number of mid-table clubs with nothing to play for at the end of the season. The Football Conference, now known as the [[National League (English football)|National League]], introduced play-offs in 2002 after the Football League agreed to a two-club exchange with the Conference.

The top two teams in the [[EFL Championship]] and in [[EFL League One]] are automatically promoted to the division above and thus do not compete in the play-offs. The top three teams in [[EFL League Two]] and the champion of the [[National League (division)|National League]] (formerly known as Conference Premier) are also automatically promoted. In each of these divisions the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places compete in two-legged semi-finals with the higher-placed club enjoying home advantage in the second leg. The [[away goals rule]] does not apply for the semi-finals. The Football League play-off finals were originally played in two legs, at both teams' home grounds, but were later changed to one-off affairs, which are played at [[Wembley Stadium]] in London.

Teams are also promoted using a play-off tournament from levels six to eight of the [[English football league system|football pyramid]].  At level six, the play-off semi finals are two leg ties with the final being a single match played at the home ground of the highest placed of the two teams.  At levels seven and eight, all of the ties are single matches played at the home ground of the team with the highest league position.

In 2003, [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] proposed replacing the current play-off system with one involving six clubs from each division and replacing the two-legged ties with one-off matches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} If adopted, the two higher-placed clubs in the play-offs would have enjoyed first-round byes and home advantage in the semi-finals. It was a controversial proposal — some people did not believe a club finishing only in eighth position in the League could (or should) compete in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] while others found the system too American for their liking.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although League chairmen initially voted in favour of the proposal, it was blocked by [[The Football Association|The FA]] and soon abandoned.

The championship of every division in English football is determined solely by the standings in the league. However, a championship play-off would be held if the top two teams were tied for points, goal difference and goals scored in both their overall league record; to date, this has never happened. A play-off would also be scheduled if two teams are tied as above for a position affecting promotion, relegation, or European qualification.

=== Greece ===
Starting in [[2007–08 Superleague Greece|the 2007–08 season]], [[Superleague Greece]] instituted a playoff system to determine all of its places in European competition for the following season, except for those of the league champion and the [[Greek Football Cup|cup winner]]. Currently, the league is entitled to two Champions League places and three in the Europa League, with one of the Europa League places reserved for the cup winner. The playoff currently takes the form of a home-and-away mini-league involving the second- through fifth-place teams, under the following conditions:
* The fifth-place team starts the playoffs at 0 points.
* The remaining teams start with a number of "bonus points" determined as follows:
** The number of points earned by the fifth-place team during the main league season is subtracted from the totals of each other club involved in the playoffs.
** The resulting number is then divided by 5 and rounded to the nearest whole number.
* At the end of the playoffs, the winner receives the country's second Champions League place. The next two teams enter the Europa League at different points depending on their playoff finishes; the last-placed team is entirely out of European competition. However, if the cup winner finished in a playoff spot (as happened in [[2010–11 Superleague Greece|2010–11]]), ''or'' the league champion also won the cup, and the losing cup finalist finished in a playoff spot (as happened in [[2012–13 Superleague Greece|2012–13]]), the bottom three teams in the playoff all receive Europa League berths.

=== Italy ===
In 2004-05, Italy's professional league introduced a promotion playoff to its second tier of football, [[Serie B]]. It operates almost identically to the system currently used in England. The top two clubs in Serie B earn automatic promotion to [[Serie A]] with the next four clubs entering a playoff to determine who wins the third promotion place, as long as fewer than 10 points separate the third and fourth-placed teams (which often occurs).

Like the English playoffs, the Italian playoffs employ two-legged semi-finals, with the higher finisher in the league table earning home advantage in the second leg. If the teams are level on aggregate after full-time of the second leg, away goals are not used, but extra time is used. Unlike England, the Italian playoff final is two-legged, again with the higher finisher earning home advantage in the second leg. In both rounds, if the tie is level on aggregate after extra time in the second leg, the team that finished higher in the league standings wins.

In 2003–04, Italy's football league used a two-legged test match to determine one spot in the top level of its system, [[Serie A]]. Some leagues in continental Europe combine automatic promotion/relegation with test matches. For example, in the Netherlands, only one club is automatically relegated from its top level, the [[Eredivisie]], each season, with the winner of the second-flight being promoted. The next two lower-placed teams enter a promotion/relegation mini-league with high-placed teams from the [[Eerste Divisie|Dutch First Division]]

=== Japan ===
[[J.League]] in Japan used a test match series between the third-from-bottom team in J1 and third-place team in J2 (see [[J. League Promotion/Relegation Series]]) from 2004 to 2008. The Promotion/Relegation Series concept dates as far back as 1965 and the first season of the [[Japan Soccer League]].

The [[Japan Football League]], the current Japanese third division, uses the Promotion/Relegation Series only when the number of clubs in the league needs to be filled with clubs from the [[Japanese Regional Leagues]].

A new Promotion/Relegation Series will occur beginning with the 2012 season of [[J. League Division 2]], conditional on the top two JFL teams fulfilling [[J. League Associate Membership|J. League club criteria]]. In turn, J2 will implement a playoff on the style of England for the 3rd to 6th clubs.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico's top flight league, [[Liga MX]], is contested annually by 18 teams.  In each of [[Apertura and Clausura|two annual tournaments]], every team plays every other team in the league once (17 games), after which the top eight teams advance to the ''Liguilla''.

In the Liguilla, all rounds are home-and-away.  Teams are drawn so the best team plays the worst, the second-best plays the second-worst, and so on.  After one round, the teams are redrawn so the best remaining team again plays the worst remaining one and the second-best faces the second-worst in the semi-finals.  The two winners of this round play each other for the championship.

There is no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winner.  As a result, the league crowns two champions each year.  After each Clausura, the team with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Liga MX games) is relegated to [[Ascenso MX]] to be replaced by that league's champion (if eligible).

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, a playoff was introduced in season 2005–2006. It is used to determine which teams from the [[Eredivisie]] qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans as the number of matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of no worse than a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] berth. Starting in 2008–09, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009–10 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off will be for the clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.

Playoffs are also part of the [[promotion and relegation]] structure between the [[Eredivisie]] and the [[Eerste Divisie]], the two highest football leagues in the Netherlands.

=== Scotland ===
The [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) experimented briefly with test matches in 1995–96 and 1996–97, contested between the second-bottom team of the Premier Division and the second-placed team of the First Division.

After the [[Scottish Premier League]] (SPL) and SFL merged in 2013 to form the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (SPFL), reuniting the top four divisions of Scotland since the breakaway of the SPL in [[1998–99 Scottish Premier League|1998–99]], a modified test match format was introduced between the [[Scottish Premiership]] and [[Scottish Championship]]. The bottom team from the first-tier Premiership is automatically relegated and is replaced by the winners of the second-tier Championship, provided that club meets Premiership entry criteria. The second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the Championship qualify for a play-off consisting of two-legged ties, with the second-placed team receiving a bye to play the winner of the teams that finished third and fourth. The winner of this play-off then faces the second-bottom Premiership team, also over two legs, with the winner of that tie taking up the final Premiership place (again, assuming that the Championship club meets Premiership criteria).

The three lower divisions of the SPFL — the Championship, [[Scottish League One|League One]] and [[Scottish League Two|League Two]] — continue with the promotion/relegation play-off system their predecessor SFL leagues used (the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], respectively). In the Championship/League One and League One/League Two, while the champions are automatically promoted and the bottom team relegated, there are play-offs of the second-bottom teams against the second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the division below. Home and away ties decide semi-finals and a final, and the overall winner plays in the higher division the following season, with the loser playing in the lower division.

Beginning with the 2014–15 season, promotion and relegation between the SPFL and the Scottish regional leagues were introduced. Following the end of the league season, the winners of the fifth-level [[Highland Football League|Highland]] and [[Lowland Football League|Lowland]] Leagues compete in a two-legged playoff. The winner then enters a two-legged playoff against the bottom team from Scottish League Two, with the winner of that tie either remaining in or promoted to League Two.

Long before the SPL era, two situations arose in which the top two teams in the table had to share the title as neither goal average nor goal difference had been instituted to break ties. The first was  [[1890–91 Scottish Football League|the inaugural season]], in which [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] both earned 29 points and had to play off for the title. The match ended in a 0-0 draw and both teams shared the title. The second happened 19 years later, in the [[1909–10 Scottish Second Division|Second Division]], when [[Leith Athletic F.C.|Leith Athletic]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] both earned 33 points. This time, the clubs chose not to play off. In 1915 goal average was finally instituted.

=== Spain ===
For the 2010/11 season, the Segunda División experimented with promotion playoffs between the 3rd to 6th placed teams, similar to the rules in the English and Italian systems. However, due to reserve teams being allowed to compete in the same football league system, subsequent places may be allowed to play off depending on reserve teams finishing within the 3rd to 6th places.

At a lower level, playoffs in Segunda División B take place to decide the divisional title between the 4 group winners, and to decide which other teams would be promoted, as follows:

*The first set of matches are an elimination tournament between the 4 group winners. The winners of each match are promoted and then play a final for the tier title.
*After the tier final takes place, the teams who finished 2nd in each of the 4 groups play the teams who finished 4th, whereas the teams who finished third play each other. The 6 winners, along with the 2 Group winners who lost their games in the earlier semifinals, play in each other in a knockout format until there is 2 teams remaining who are promoted.
*If within the qualifying places exist reserve teams whose senior teams are already in Segunda División, subsequent places are allowed to play off. If the senior teams are relegated from Segunda División during the season, the reserve team is automatically disqualified from competing and relegated to Tercera División.

Previously a play off system had been used in which the teams finishing 3rd and 4th from last in [[La Liga]] had played off against the teams finishing 3rd and 4th in the [[Segunda División]]. This system had been introduced in the 1980s but ended in 1998-99.&lt;ref&gt;[[La Liga 1998-99#Relegation playoff]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States and Canada ===
{{main|MLS Cup Playoffs}}
In [[Major League Soccer]] in the United States and Canada, at the end of the [[regular season]], the top five teams in each of its two conferences qualify for the playoffs (from the [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012 season]] to the [[2014 Major League Soccer season|2014 season]]). Under this system, the conferences have separate playoff brackets. From 2015 to 2018, six teams per conference qualify, 12 teams in total, and  [[Audi]] is the official sponsor. 
&lt;!-- Next season.
In 2019, there will be eight teams per conference qualifying, 16 teams in total.
--&gt;

In the first round of the [[postseason]] knockout tournament, the fourth-place team in each conference hosts the fifth-place team from the same conference in a one-off match, with the winner advancing to the Conference Semifinals. From the 2015 season the third-place team plays host to the sixth in the other one-off match, with the two winners advancing to the Conference Semifinals.
&lt;!-- Next season.
From the 2019 season the 1st round will change to four two-legged series, and will also be known as the Conference Quarterfinals. The top-seeded team plays eighth, second plays seventh, third plays sixth, and fourth plays fifth. That round will be played like the next two rounds. 
--&gt;
The Conference Semifinals and the Conference Championships are conducted under a home-and-away, aggregate-goal format. For each conference, the top seed plays the first-round winner, and the 2nd seed faces the 3rd seed in the Conference Semifinal series, with the lower seeded team hosting the first game. From the 2015 season the top seed plays the lowest remaining seed, and the 2nd plays the next-lowest seed in the Conference Semifinals.
&lt;!-- Next season.
From the 2019 season the highest remaining seed plays the lowest remaining seed, and the next-highest plays the next-lowest.
--&gt;
The team that scores the most goals in the home-and-away series advances to the Conference Championship, which expands from a one-off match to a two-legged match starting in 2012. If the teams are tied after 90 minutes of the second leg in either the Conference Semifinal or Conference Championship, a 30-minute extra time period (divided into two 15-minute periods) would be played followed by a penalty-kick shootout, if necessary. As in the Conference Semifinals, the lower seed in the Conference Championship hosts the first leg.

The winner of each conference will play for the [[MLS Cup]], the league championship. Since 2012, the MLS Cup is hosted by the conference champion with the most table points during the regular season.

In the case of ties after regulation in the First Round and MLS Cup, 30 minutes of extra time (divided into two 15-minute periods) would be played followed by a penalty-kick shootout, if necessary, to determine the winners.

Historically MLS did not use the away goals rule in any playoff series, but it has begun to do so in 2014 to be consistent with international practice.

The defunct [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (WPS), which operated only in the U.S., conducted a four-team stepladder tournament consisting of one-off knockout matches. The third seed hosted the fourth seed in the first round. The winner of that game advanced to the "Super Semifinal", hosted by the second seed. The Super Semifinal winner traveled to the top seed for the championship game. The replacement of WPS, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] (which launched in 2013), has a more standard four-team knockout playoff in which the winners of two one-off semifinals advance to the one-off final.

==Australian rules football==
{{See also|AFL final eight system|McIntyre System}}

Playoffs are used throughout Australia in [[Australian rules football]] to determine the premiership. The term '''finals''' is most commonly used to describe them.

In each league, between four and eight teams (depending on league size) qualify for the finals based on the league ladder at the end of the season.  Australian rules football leagues employ finals systems which act as a combination between a [[single elimination tournament]] for lower-ranked teams and a [[double elimination tournament]] for higher-ranked teams in order to provide teams with an easier pathway to the Grand Final as reward for strong performances throughout the season. Finals are decided by single matches, rather than series.

The [[Australian Football League]], which is the top level of the sport, currently has eight teams qualify for the finals under a [[AFL final eight system|system designed by the league]] in 2000. Between 1931–1999, variants of the [[McIntyre System]] were used to accommodate four, five, six and eight teams, and prior to 1930, [[Early VFL Final systems|six different finals systems]] were used.

In most other leagues, from state-level leagues such as the [[South Australian National Football League]] and [[West Australian Football League]], down to local suburban leagues, it is most common for either four or five teams to qualify for the finals. In these cases the [[Page–McIntyre system|Page–McIntyre final four system]] or the [[McIntyre final five system]] are used universally.

The [[Australian Football League]] (which was  known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League) was the first league to introduce regular finals when it was established in 1897. The [[South Australian National Football League]] introduced finals in 1898, and other leagues soon followed.

Prior to 1897, the premiership was generally awarded to the team with the best overall win-loss record at the end of the season. If two teams had finished with equal records, a playoff match for the premiership was required: this occurred in the Challenge Cup in 1871, the SAFA in 1889 and 1894, and in the VFA in 1896.

==Baseball==

===Korea===
{{Main|Korean Series}}
The teams finishing in fourth and fifth place in the regular season face each other in the wildcard game. The winner of the wildcard game faces the team that finished in third place in the first round of the play-offs. The winner of the first round faces the team that finished in second place during the regular season, and the winner of that round faces the team that finished in first place for the championship in the Korean Series. This type of format is known as the [[Ladder tournament|stepladder]] playoff.

===Japan===
{{Main|Climax Series}}
Before 1950 the original [[Japanese Baseball League]] had been a single-table league of franchises. After it was reorganized into the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB) system, a series of playoffs ensued between the champions of the [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]].

Before the playoff system was developed in both professional leagues, the Pacific League had applied a playoff system on two occasions. The first was between 1973–1982, when a split-season was applied with a 5-game playoff between the winning teams from both halves of season (unless a team won both of the halves so that they did not need to play such a game). The second time was between 2004–2006, when the top three teams played a two-staged stepladder knockout (3 games in the first stage and 5 games in the second stage) to decide the League Champion (and the team playing in the [[Japan Series]]). After this system was applied, the [[Seibu Lions]] (now Saitama Seibu Lions), [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] and [[Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters]], which claimed the Pacific League Championship under this system, were all able to clinch the following Japan Series in that season. The success of such a playoff system convinced the [[Central League]] to consider a similar approach. In 2007, a new playoff system, named the "Climax Series", was introduced to both professional leagues in NPB to decide the teams that would compete for the Japan Series. The Climax Series basically applied the rule of the playoff system in the Pacific League, with one important change: each League championship is awarded to the team finishing the regular season at the top of their respective league, regardless of their fate in the playoffs. This means that the two League Champions are not guaranteed to make the Japan Series. The [[Chunichi Dragons]] took advantage of this in the first Climax Series season, finishing second in the regular season but sweeping the [[Hanshin Tigers]] and the League Champion [[Yomiuri Giants]] in the Central League to win a place in the Japan Series; they subsequently defeated the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters to claim their first Japan Series in 52 years.

In 2008, the format of Climax Series will have a slight change, in which the second stage will be played over a maximum of six games, with the League Champion starting with an automatic one game advantage.

====Major League Baseball====
{{Main|Major League Baseball postseason}} {{See also|League Championship Series}}
Major League Baseball (MLB) itself does not use the term "playoffs" for championship tournaments.  Instead they use the term "postseason" as the title of the official elimination tournament held after the conclusion of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Major League Baseball schedule|regular season]].  Since the {{mlby|2012|disp=seas}}, it has consisted of a first round single-elimination knockout game between the two wildcards in each league, a best-of-5 second round series called the Division Series, and two rounds of best-of-seven series for the League Championship and World Series.

MLB uses a "2-3-2" format for the final two rounds of its postseason tournament. In the Majors, the singular term "playoff" is reserved for the rare situation in which two (or more) teams find themselves tied at the end of the regular season and are forced to have a tiebreaking playoff game (or games) to determine which team will advance to the postseason. Thus, in the majors, a "playoff" is actually ''part of the regular season'' and thus can be called a "[[Pennant playoff]]". However, the plural term "Playoffs" is conventionally used by fans and media to refer to baseball's postseason tournament (and has always been used by [[minor league baseball]] for its own postseason play), not including the "[[World Series]]" (see below), so this article defers to that usage.

MLB is the oldest of the major American professional sports, dating back to the 1870s. As such, it is steeped in tradition. The final series to determine its champion has been called the "[[World Series]]" (originally "World's Championship Series" and then "World's Series") as far back as the National League's contests with the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] during the 1880s. The "Playoffs" determine which two teams play in the "[[World Series]]".

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Taiwan Series}}
Taiwan's playoff is different to many such competitions, due to the league's split-season format. The winners of the first half-season and the winners of the second half-season are eligible to play in the playoffs, but if the best overall team have not won either half season then they qualify into a wild card series against the weaker half-season winner, with the winner of this advancing into the [[Taiwan Series]] to face the other half-season winner. If the first and second half winners are different, but one of them is also the best overall team, then both teams progress directly to the Taiwan Series. Finally, if one team wins both halves of the season then a playoff will take place between the second and third best teams for the right to play them in the Final Series; in this case the team winning both halves of the season will begin the Taiwan Series with an automatic one game advantage.

==Basketball==

===National Basketball Association===
{{main|NBA playoffs}} {{see also|NBA Conference Finals}}
The present organization known as the [[National Basketball Association]], then called the BAA (Basketball Association of America), had its inaugural season in 1946–47. Teams had always have different [[strength of schedule]] from each other; currently, a team plays a team outside its conference twice, a team within its conference but outside its division three or four times, and a team from its own division four times.

In the current system, eight clubs from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs, with separate playoff brackets for each conference. In the 2002–03 season, the first-round series were expanded from best-of-5 to best-of-7; all other series have always been best-of-7. In all series, home games alternate between the two teams in a 2-2-1-1-1 format.

The 2-3-2 finals format was adopted from the [[1985 NBA Finals|1985 Finals]] to [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]], copying the format that was then in effect in the National Hockey League. Prior to 1985, almost all finals were played in the 2-2-1-1-1 format (although the [[1971 NBA Finals|1971 Finals]] between Milwaukee and Baltimore were on an alternate-home basis, some 1950s finals used the 2-3-2 format, and the [[1975 NBA Finals|1975 Golden State-Washington]] and [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]] and [[1979 NBA Finals|1979]] Seattle-Washington Finals were on a 1-2-2-1-1 basis). Also, prior to the 1980s, [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western]] playoffs were on an alternate-home basis except for series when distance made the 2-2-1-1-1 format more practical. Since [[2014 NBA Finals|2014]], the [[NBA Finals]] restored the original format.

Teams are seeded according to their regular-season record. Through the 2014–15 season, the three division champions and best division runner-up received the top four seeds, with their ranking based on regular-season record. The remaining teams were seeded strictly by regular-season record. However, if the best division runner-up had a better record than other division champs, it could be seeded as high as second. Beginning in 2015–16, the NBA became the first major American league to eliminate automatic playoff berths for division champions; the top eight teams overall in each conference now qualify for the playoffs, regardless of divisional alignment.

===Elsewhere===
Top flight basketball leagues elsewhere also employ a playoff system mimicking the NBA's. However, most leagues are not divided into divisions and conferences, and employ a double round robin format akin to league association football, unlike the NBA where teams are divided into divisions and conferences, which leads to different strengths of schedule per team. Teams are seeded on regular season record. The playoff structure can be single-elimination or a best-of series, with the higher seed, if held the playoffs are not held at a predetermined venue, having the home court advantage.

Aside from the playoffs, some leagues also have a knockout tournament akin to the [[FA Cup]] running in parallel to the regular season. These are not considered playoffs.

In the [[EuroLeague]], after the regular season plays a best-of-5 playoffs in a 2–2–1 format. However, from the semifinals on, it is a single elimination tournament held at a predetermined venue. Still others also have a relegation playoff.

In [[NCAA Division I]] basketball conferences, a playoff or "postseason tournament" is held after the regular season. Most conferences, including all of the "major" basketball conferences ([[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[American Athletic Conference|American]], [[Big East Conference|Big East]], [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]), hold their tournaments at a predetermined venue, with all conference teams participating (unless barred due to NCAA sanctions). A few conferences hold early rounds at campus sites and later rounds at a predetermined site. For example, the [[Mid-American Conference]] holds its first-round games at campus sites, but the rest of the tournament in [[Quicken Loans Arena|Cleveland]]. The [[Big South Conference]] holds its first round at campus sites, gives hosting rights for its quarterfinals and semifinals to the regular-season champion, and plays its final at the home court of the top remaining seed. The [[American East Conference]], [[Atlantic Sun Conference|ASUN Conference]], and [[Patriot League]] hold all tournament games at campus sites. A small number of conferences do not invite all of their teams to the conference tournament, with one example being the [[Ivy League]], in which only four of the eight members advance to the tournament (which is at a predetermined site). In many such tournaments, higher seeds are afforded byes. The winners, and some losers which are selected as "at-large bids", play in [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|the NCAA tournament]], which is also single-elimination and held at predetermined venues.

In the [[WNBA Playoffs]], the league's best 8 teams, regardless of conference alignment, compete, and are seeded based on their regular-season records. The top two seeds get double byes and the next two seeds first-round byes. The first two rounds are one-off knockout games, and the league semifinals &amp; Finals are best-of-5 on a 2-2-1 basis.

==Canadian football==
In the [[Canadian Football League]], the playoffs begin in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division has an automatic home game berth in the Division Final, and a bye week during the Division Semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts the third-place team in the Division Semifinal, unless the fourth-place team from the opposite division finishes with a better record.  This "crossover rule" does not come into play if the teams have identical records—there are no tiebreakers. While the format means that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the [[Grey Cup]], so far only two crossover teams have won the divisional semifinal game. The winners of each Division's Semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the Division Finals. Since 2005, the Division Semifinals and Division Finals have been sponsored by [[Scotiabank]] and are branded as the "Scotiabank East Championship" and "Scotiabank West Championship".&lt;ref name="CFL.ca 2005-08-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2005/08/08/partnership_of_champions/|title=Partnership of champions|accessdate=|publisher=CFL.ca|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two division champions then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which is held on the third or fourth Sunday of November.

The [[Edmonton Eskimos]] are notable for qualifying for the CFL playoffs every year from [[1972 CFL season|1972]] to [[2005 CFL season|2005]], a record in North American pro sports. The Eskimos are also notable for being the first crossover team to ever win the divisional semifinal game.

==Hockey==
===National Hockey League===
{{main|Stanley Cup playoffs}} {{see also|NHL Conference Finals}}
The [[National Hockey League]] playoff system is an elimination tournament competition for the [[Stanley Cup]], consisting of four rounds of [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]]. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Stanley Cup Final. The winner of that series becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup champion.

Since 2014 the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference, based on the seedings division-wise (# 1 vs. # 4, and # 2 vs. # 3). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the top wild-card seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). In the Conference Semifinals, the four remaining teams in the conference face each other. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Final.

For the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5–7 are played "if necessary").

===Kontinental Hockey League===
The [[Kontinental Hockey League]], based in Russia and including teams from several nearby countries, operates a playoff system similar to that of the NHL, also consisting of four rounds of single-elimination [[Best-of-seven playoff|best-of-seven series]]. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Gagarin Cup Finals. The winner of that series becomes the KHL and [[Gagarin Cup]] champion.

Like the NHL, the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference. The winner of each division receives one of the top two seeds in its conference; the others are based on regular-season record. Unlike the NHL, divisional alignment plays no added role in playoff seeding—all teams are seeded solely within their conference. Playoff pairings are based on seeding number within the conference (# 1 vs. # 8, # 2 vs. # 7, # 3 vs. # 6, and # 4 vs. # 5). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the next-lowest seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). The playoff pairings are reseeded after the first round (a feature that was once used in the NHL, but now abandoned). Therefore, the Conference Semifinals feature the top remaining seed in the conference playing the lowest remaining seed, and the two other first-round survivors playing one another. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Gagarin Cup Finals.

For the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5–7 are played "if necessary").

===Elite Ice Hockey League===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Elite Ice Hockey League]] playoffs are an elimination tournament where the draw is based on the finishing position of teams in the league. Of the 10 teams which compete, the top 8 qualify for the playoffs. The first round (the quarter-finals) are played over two legs (home and away) where the team who finished in 1st place in the regular season plays the team which finished 8th, 2nd plays 7th and so on, with the aggregate score deciding which team progresses.

The semi-finals and final are held over the course of a single weekend at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham. Each consists of a single game with the losing team being eliminated, with the two semi-final games being played on the  Saturday and the final on the Sunday. There is also a third-place game held earlier on the Sunday between the losing teams from the semi-finals. Unlike in the NHL, the winners of the Elite League playoffs are not considered to be the league champions for that season (that title goes to the team which finishes in first place in the league), rather the playoffs are considered to be a separate competition although being crowned playoff champions is a prestigious accolade nonetheless. The most recent playoff champions are the [[Sheffield Steelers]].

==NASCAR==
[[NASCAR]] implemented a "playoff" system beginning in 2004, which they coined the "[[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]]". When first introduced, only NASCAR's [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|top series]] used the system, although the other two national racing series (currently known as the [[Xfinity Series]] and the [[Camping World Truck Series]]) have since adopted similar systems. One unique feature of the Nascar playoffs is that the non-qualifying drivers continue to compete alongside the playoff drivers: the qualifying drivers merely have their championship points reset one or more times during the playoffs to figures so high that no non-qualifying driver could ever catch them.

There are actually two different playoffs going on at the end of the season in each series: one for the drivers and another "[[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|owner's points]]" playoff for the racing teams.  Only one multi-driver team has ever won the Cup series owner's point championship: in 2015, Kyle Busch won the championship after missing the first 11 races of the season due to injury; 3 other drivers drove the #18 car during his absence.  Because of the way the playoffs were structured that year, however, both he and his #18 team won their respective championships with 5043 points.  There have been two cases where a playoff driver failed to enter every playoff race.  In 2005, [[Kurt Busch]] was fired by [[Roush Racing]] with two races left in the season.  Busch finished 10th out of 10 Chase drivers, but [[Kenny Wallace]] stepped in to drive the #97 car to an 8th-place finish in the owner's points race.  In 2012, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] missed two  playoff races due to injury.  [[Regan Smith]] drove the #88 car for two races, including a top-10 finish at Kansas Speedway.  In that case, Smith's 43 additional championship points on top of Earnhardt's 2,245 were not enough to pull the #88 team out of 12th place out of 12 playoff contenders. 

In the original version of the Chase (2004–2006), following the 26th race of the season, all drivers in the top 10 and any others within 400 points of the leader got a spot in the 10-race playoff. Like the current system, drivers in the Chase had their point totals adjusted. However, it was based on the number of points at the conclusion of the 26th race. The first-place driver in the standings led with 5,050 points; the second-place driver started with 5,045. Incremental five-point drops continued through 10th place with 5,005 points.

The first major change to the Chase was announced by NASCAR chairman and CEO [[Brian France]] on January 22, 2007. After 26 races, the top 12 drivers advanced to contend for the points championship and points were reset to 5000. Each driver within the top 12 received an additional 10 points for each win during the "regular season", or first 26 races, thus creating a seeding based on wins. As in previous years, the Chase consisted of 10 races and the driver with the most points at the conclusion of the 10 races was the [[Sprint Cup Series|NEXTEL Cup Series]] Champion. Under the points system then in use, drivers could earn 5 bonus points for leading the most laps, and 5 bonus points for leading a single lap.
Brian France explained why NASCAR made the changes to the chase:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The adjustments taken [Monday] put a greater emphasis on winning races. Winning is what this sport is all about. Nobody likes to see drivers content to finish in the top 10. We want our sport -- especially during the Chase -- to be more about winning."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning with the [[2008 in NASCAR|2008 season]], the playoff became known as the "Chase for the Sprint Cup" due to the NEXTEL/[[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] merger.

The next format of the Chase was announced by France on January 26, 2011, along with several other changes, most significantly to the points system. After 26 races, 12 drivers still advanced to the Chase, but the qualifying criteria changed, as well as the number of base points that drivers received at the points reset.

Under this system. only the top 10 drivers in points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two "wild card" qualifiers, specifically the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th in points who had the most race wins (with tiebreakers used if needed to select exactly two qualifiers). These drivers then had their base points reset to 2,000 instead of the previous 5,000, reflecting the greatly reduced points available from each race (a maximum of 48 for the race winner, as opposed to a maximum of 195 in the pre-2011 system). After the reset, the 10 automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers received no bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110128/chase-format/index.html |title=10-race Chase for the Cup crowns series champ |work=NASCAR 101 |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2014. even more radical changes to the Chase were announced; these took effect for the 2014 season:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html |title=NASCAR Announces Chase for the Sprint Cup Format Change |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 30, 2014 |accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The number of drivers qualifying for the Chase was expanded to 16, with this group officially called the NASCAR Sprint Cup Chase Grid.
* The Chase Grid is now selected primarily on the basis of race wins during the first 26 races (also known as the "regular season"). If fewer than 16 drivers win races. remaining spots on the Chase Grid are filled in order of regular-season drivers' points. Note that the basic point system has not changed from 2013.
* The Chase is now divided into four rounds. After each of the first three rounds, the four Chase Grid drivers with the fewest season points are eliminated from the Grid and championship contention. Any driver on the Chase Grid who wins a race in the first three rounds automatically advances to the next round. Also, all drivers eliminated from the Chase have their points readjusted to the regular-season points scheme, although they retain their points total from the last Chase round in which they participated.
** Challenger Round (races 27–29)
*** Begins with 16 drivers, each with 2,000 points plus a 3-point bonus for each win in the first 26 races.
** Contender Round (races 30–32)
*** Begins with 12 drivers, each with 3,000 points.
** Eliminator Round (races 33–35)
*** Begins with eight drivers, each with 4,000 points.
** NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship (final race)
*** The last four drivers in contention for the season title start the race at 5,000 points, with the highest finisher in the race winning the Cup Series title.

The Chase for the Sprint Cup has been generally panned since its inception, as many drivers and owners have criticized the declining importance of the first 26 races, as well as very little change in schedule from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/430547-nascars-chase-fixer-upper-or-just-demolish-it|title=NASCAR's Chase:  Fixer-Upper or Just Demolish It?|first=Sandra |last= MacWatters |publisher=Bleacher Report|date = 5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fisher, the director of the NASCAR Research and Development Center, has been one of the more vocal critics of the system, saying that "Due to NASCAR having the same competitors on the track week in, week out, a champion emerges. In stick-and-ball sports, every team has a different schedule, so head-to-head series are necessary to determine a champion. That does not apply to auto racing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://hometracks.nascar.com/nascar_101/NASCAR_Research_and_Development_Center |deadurl= yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110414135301/http://hometracks.nascar.com:80/nascar_101/NASCAR_Research_and_Development_Center |archivedate = 14 April 2011|title = NASCAR Research &amp; Development Center|work = NASCAR Home Tracks|date = 17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASCAR extended the Chase format to its other two national touring series, the [[Xfinity Series]] and [[Camping World Truck Series]], beginning in 2016. The formats used in the two lower series are broadly similar to the format used in the Cup Series, but have some significant differences:&lt;ref name="2016 Chase"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/1/19/nascar-official-release-xfinity-truck-series-changes-championship-chase.html |title=Chase Format Extended to Xfinity, Camping World Truck Series |publisher=NASCAR |date=January 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Xfinity and Truck Series Chases are held over three rounds, instead of four in the Cup Series.
* Each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity and Truck Series Chases consists of two races (compared to three in the first three rounds of the Cup Series Chase).
* The Xfinity Series Dash 4 Cash, consisting of four short events with the winners receiving cash prizes, has been incorporated into that series' Chase. A driver who wins two Dash 4 Cash events is considered as having one regular race win, which essentially qualifies the driver for the Chase even if he or she wins no other race during the season. However, there is no points bonus for Dash 4 Cash wins.
* Instead of the 16 drivers who qualify in the Cup Series, 12 drivers qualify in the Xfinity Series and 8 in the Truck Series.
* Four drivers are eliminated at the end of each of the first two rounds of the Xfinity Series Chase, as in the Cup Series. The Truck Series Chase eliminates only two drivers at the end of its first two rounds. All formats end with four drivers eligible to win the season title entering the season's last race.
* The rounds of the Chase now have a standard name across all series. The rounds leading up to the final race are now officially called "Round of X", where "X" is the number of drivers eligible for the season title. The drivers in the final race that are still eligible for the season title are called the "Championship 4".

Starting with the 2017 season, NASCAR abandoned the term "Chase", instead calling its final series the "playoffs".

==Rugby league==

===National Rugby League===
Play-offs are used to decide the premiers of the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) in Australasia, where they are known as ''finals'' (also as ''semi finals'' or ''semis'') – as in Australian rules football, the participating teams only come from within a single division, and the tournament is staged as single matches rather than a series. Currently, in the NRL, eight teams qualify for the finals; starting with the 2012 season, the system was changed from the [[McIntyre Final Eight System|McIntyre Final Eight]] to the [[AFL final eight system|same system used by the AFL]].

Previously, the term play-off was used in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL]] competition to describe matches which were played as tie breakers to determine qualification for the finals series. Since 1995, points differential decides finals' qualification and play-offs are no longer held.

===Super League===
{{Main|Super League play-offs}}
The European [[Super League]] [[rugby league]] competition has used a play-off system to decide its champion since 1998. The original play-off format featured the [[Super League play-offs#Top five|top five highest-ranked teams]] after the regular season rounds.  Starting in 2002, the play-offs added an extra spot to allow [[Super League play-offs#Top six|the top six]] to qualify. With the addition of two new teams for the [[Super League XIV|2009 season]], the play-offs expanded to [[Super League play-offs|eight teams]]. The next format, scrapped after [[Super League XIX|the 2014 season]], worked as follows:

'''Week One'''
*Qualifying Play Off 1: 1st vs 4th ''(winner receives a bye to week three)''
*Qualifying Play Off 2: 2nd vs 3rd ''(winner receives a bye to week three)''
*Elimination Play Off 1: 5th vs 8th ''(loser goes out)''
*Elimination Play Off 2: 6th vs 7th ''(loser goes out)''

'''Week Two'''
*Preliminary Semi Final 1: QPO 1 Loser vs EPO 1 Winner
*Preliminary Semi Final 2: QPO 2 Loser vs EPO 2 Winner

'''Week Three'''
*Qualifying Semi Final 1: QPO 1 Winner vs PSF 1 ''or'' PSF 2 Winner *
*Qualifying Semi Final 2: QPO 2 Winner vs PSF 1 ''or'' PSF 2 Winner *

'''Week Four'''
* Grand Final: Winners of Qualifying Semi-Finals meet at [[Old Trafford]]

''* Opponents decided by the QPO winner (in Week 1) that finished higher in the regular season

Beginning in [[Super League XX|2015]], the Super League season was radically reorganised, and more closely integrated with that of the second-level [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]]. Following a home-and-away season of 22 matches, the top eight clubs in Super League now enter a single round-robin mini-league known as the [[Rugby League Super 8s|Super 8s]], with the top four teams after that stage entering a [[Shaughnessy playoff system|knockout play-off]] to determine the champion. The four bottom teams in Super League at the end of the home-and-away season are joined by the top four from the Championship after its home-and-away season. These eight teams play their own single-round-robin mini-league known as [[The Qualifiers]]; at its end, the top three teams are assured of places in the next season's Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing a single match billed as the "[[Million Pound Game]]", with the winner also playing in Super League in the following season.

===Other leagues===
The two tiers directly below Super League, the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|League 1]] (the latter of which was known as Championship 1 from 2009–2014)—formerly the National Leagues until the 2009 addition of [[Toulouse Olympique|a French club]] to the previously all-British competition—used the old top six system to determine which teams were promoted between its levels through the 2014 season. After that season, both leagues abandoned the top six system. Before the 2008 season, when Super League established a [[2009–11 Super League licences|franchising system]] and ended automatic promotion and relegation in Super League, the National Leagues also used this system to determine the team that earned promotion to Super League. The top six system involved the following:

Week One
* Elimination Semi-final A: 3rd vs 6th (4th vs 7th in Championship 1)
* Elimination Semi-final B: 4th vs 5th (5th vs 6th in Championship 1)

Week Two
* Elimination Final: Winners of Elimination Semi-final A vs Winners of Elimination Semi-final B
* Qualification Match: 1st vs 2nd (2nd vs 3rd in Championship 1)

Week Three
* Final Qualifier: Winners of Elimination Final vs Losers of Qualification Match

Week Four
* Grand Final: Winners of Qualification Match vs Winners of Final Qualifier (in Super League, at Old Trafford)

Since 2015, all clubs in Super League and the Championship play a 22-match home-and-away season. Upon the end of the home-and-away season, the clubs will split into three leagues, with two of them including Championship clubs. As previously noted, the Super 8s will feature the top eight Super League sides. The second league, The Qualifiers, will include the bottom four clubs from Super League and the top four from the Championship, whilst the third will feature the remaining eight Championship sides. The bottom two leagues will begin as single round-robin tournaments. In The Qualifiers, the top three sides will either remain in or be promoted to Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing the aforementioned "Million Pound Game" for the final Super League place. In the third league, the sides compete for the Championship Shield, with the top four teams after the round-robin phase entering a knockout playoff for the Shield. The bottom two teams are relegated to League 1.

League 1 currently conducts a 15-match, single round-robin regular season. At that time, the league splits in two. The top eight clubs play in their own Super 8s, also contested as a single round robin. At the end of the Super 8s, the top club earns the season title and immediate promotion to the Championship. The second- through fifth-place clubs contest a knockout playoff for the second place in the Championship. The bottom eight clubs play their own single round-robin phase; at its end, the top two teams play a one-off match for the League 1 Shield.

==Rugby union==

===England===

==== Premiership ====
In the [[Premiership Rugby|Gallagher Premiership]], the top four qualify for the play-offs, where they are not referred to by that name. The tournament is a [[Shaughnessy playoff system|Shaughnessy playoff]]: the team that finished first after the league stage plays the team that finished fourth, while the team that finished second plays the team that finished third in the Semi-Finals, with the higher-ranked team having home advantage. The winners of these semi-finals qualify for the Premiership Final at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], where the winner will be champions of the league.

====Championship====
Through the 2016–17 season, the second-level [[RFU Championship]] used play-offs—but unlike the Premiership, the Championship officially used the term "play-offs". At the end of the league stage, top teams advanced to a series of promotion play-offs. From the first season of the Championship in [[2009–10 RFU Championship|2009–10]] to [[2011–12 RFU Championship|2011–12]], the top eight teams advanced; from [[2012–13 RFU Championship|2012–13]] through to [[2016–17 RFU Championship|2016–17]], the top four advanced. A relegation play-off involving the bottom four teams existed through the 2011–12 season, but was scrapped from 2012–13 on.

The original promotion play-offs divided the eight teams into two groups of four each, with the teams within each group playing a home-and-away mini-league. The top two teams in each group advanced to a knockout phase. In 2010, the semi-finals were one-off matches; in 2011, they became two-legged. The top team in each pool played the second-place team from the other group in the semi-finals; the winners advanced to the two-legged final, where the ultimate winner earned promotion to the Premiership (assuming that the team met the minimum criteria for promotion).

In the first year of the play-offs in 2010, all eight teams started equal. After that season, it was decided to reward teams for their performance in league play. in 2011 and 2012, the top two teams at the end of the league stage carried over 3&amp;nbsp;competition points to the promotion play-offs; the next two teams carried over 2; the next two carried over 1; and the final two teams carried over none. (Points were earned using the standard [[rugby union bonus points system|bonus points system]].)

The relegation play-offs, like the first stage of the promotion play-offs, were conducted as a home-and-away league, with the bottom team at the end of league play relegated to [[National League 1]]. As with the 2010 promotion play-offs, that season's relegation play-offs started all teams equal. in 2011 and 2012, each team in the relegation play-offs carried over 1&amp;nbsp;competition point for every win in the league season.

Beginning with the 2012–13 season, the pool stage of the promotion playoffs was abolished, with the top four sides directly entering the semi-finals. The format of the knockout stage remained unchanged from 2012, with two-legged semi-finals followed by a two-legged final. At the other end of the table, the bottom club is now automatically relegated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/18102034 |title=Championship: RFU to abolish play-off pool stages |publisher=''BBC Sport'' |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective with the 2017–18 season, the promotion play-offs were scrapped for a minimum of three seasons, to be replaced with automatic promotion for the club finishing atop the league at the end of the home-and-away season (provided said club meets minimum Premiership standards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.premiershiprugby.com/news/play-off-system-removed-from-greene-king-ipa-championship-from-next-season/ |title=Play-off system removed from Greene King IPA Championship from next season |publisher=Premiership Rugby Limited |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The highest level of French rugby union, the [[Top 14]], expanded its playoffs starting with the [[2009–10 Top 14 season|2009–10 season]] from a four-team format to six teams. In the new system, the top two teams after the double round-robin season receive first-round byes. The first-round matches involve the third- through sixth-place teams, bracketed so that 3 hosts 6 and 4 hosts 5. The winners then advance to face the top two teams in the semifinals, which are held at nominally neutral sites (a traditional feature in the French playoffs)—although in the [[2011–12 Top 14 season|2011–12 season]], the semifinals were held at [[Stadium Municipal|Stadium de Toulouse]], occasionally used as a "big-game" venue by traditional Top 14 power [[Stade Toulousain]]. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the final at [[Stade de France]] (though in 2016, the final was at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]] due to conflict with [[UEFA Euro 2016]]), where the winner will be champions of the league and receive the [[Bouclier de Brennus]]. Before 2009–10, the playoffs format was identical to that of the English Premiership with the exception of neutral sites for the semifinals.

Beginning in [[2017–18 Top 14 season|2017–18]], only the bottom club is automatically relegated to [[Rugby Pro D2]]. The second-from-bottom Top 14 side plays a one-off match against the runner-up of the Pro D2 playoffs for the final place in the next Top 14 season.

Pro D2 adopted the Top 14 playoff system effective in [[2017–18 Rugby Pro D2 season|2017–18]], though with all matches held at the higher seed's home field. The playoff champion earns automatic promotion; as noted above, the runner-up enters a one-off match for potential promotion to Top 14. Previously, Pro D2 used a four-team playoff, involving the second- through fifth-place teams, to determine the second of two teams promoted to the next season's Top 14, with the regular-season champions earning automatic promotion. Under this system, the promotion semifinals were held at the home fields of the second- and third-place teams, and the promotion final was held at a neutral site.

=== Pro14 ===
The [[Pro14]], originally known as the Celtic League and later as Pro12, adopted a four-team playoff starting with the [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10 season]]. The format was essentially identical to that of the English Premiership. Through the 2013–14 season, the final was held at a ground chosen by the top surviving seed, with the caveat that the venue must have a capacity of at least 18,000. In [[2012–13 Pro12|2012–13]], top seed [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]] could not use its regular home ground of [[Ravenhill Stadium|Ravenhill]] for that reason (the ground was later expanded to meet the requirement). The league changed to using a predetermined site for its championship final in [[2014–15 Pro12|2014–15]].

With the addition of two South African sides in [[2017–18 Pro14|2017–18]], the league split into two conferences and expanded its playoffs to six teams. The top team of each conference earns a bye into the semifinals, where they will host the winners of matches between the second- and third-place teams from the other conferences (with the second-place team hosting the third-place team from the opposite conference).

=== New Zealand ===
Both domestic competitions in New Zealand rugby — the semi-professional [[Mitre 10 Cup]] (formerly Air New Zealand Cup and ITM Cup) and the nominally amateur [[Heartland Championship]] — use a playoff system to determine their champions, although the term "playoff" is also not used in New Zealand, with "finals" used instead.

==== Air New Zealand/ITM/Mitre 10 Cup ====
In the [[2006 Air New Zealand Cup]], the first season of the revamped domestic structure in that country, the top six teams after Round One of the competition automatically qualified for the finals, officially known as Round Three. Their relative seeding was determined by their standings at the end of the Top Six phase of Round Two. The teams that finished below the top six entered repechage pools in Round Two, with the winner of each pool taking up one of the final two finals slots. The seventh seed was the repechage winner with the better record, and the eighth seed was the other repechage winner.

From [[2007 Air New Zealand Cup|2007]] onward, the former Rounds One and Two were collapsed into a single pool phase of play in which all teams participated. In 2007 and [[2008 Air New Zealand Cup|2008]], the top eight teams advanced to the playoffs; in what was intended to be the final season of the Air New Zealand Cup format in [[2009 Air New Zealand Cup|2009]], the Shaughnessy format was used, with the top four advancing to the finals. The [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] (NZRU) ultimately decided to stay with the previous format for the rebranded [[2010 ITM Cup]], with the same four-team playoff as in 2009. Starting in [[2011 ITM Cup|2011]], the NZRU split the ITM Cup into two seven-team leagues, the top-level Premiership and second-level Championship, and instituted promotion and relegation in the ITM Cup (a feature of the country's former [[National Provincial Championship]]). The competition was renamed the Mitre 10 Cup in 2016.

The playoffs in each season format have consisted of a single-elimination tournament. The teams are bracketed in the normal fashion, with the higher seed receiving home-field advantage. In 2007 and 2008, the playoff was rebracketed after the quarterfinals, with the highest surviving seed hosting the lowest surviving seed and the second-highest surviving seed hosting the third surviving seed. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the Cup Final (2006–10) or Premiership/Championship Final (2011–), held at the home ground of the higher surviving seed. From 2011 onward, the winner of the Championship Final is promoted to the Premiership, replacing that league's bottom team.

Because the 2011 season ran up against that year's [[2011 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]] in New Zealand, the competition window was truncated, with only the top two teams in each division advancing to the final match. The Shaughnessy finals series returned to both divisions in 2012, and is currently used in non-World Cup years.

==== Heartland Championship ====
In the [[Heartland Championship]], teams play for two distinct trophies — the more prestigious [[Meads Cup]] and the Lochore Cup. The 12 Heartland Championship teams are divided into two pools for round-robin play in Round One, with the top three in each pool advancing to the Meads Cup and the bottom three dropping to the Lochore Cup.

Round Two in both the Meads and Lochore Cups is an abbreviated round-robin tournament, with each team playing only the teams it did not play in Round One. The top four teams in the Meads Cup pool at the end of Round Two advance to the Meads Cup semifinals; the same applies for the Lochore Cup contestants.

The semifinals of both cups are seeded 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3, with the higher seeds earning home field advantage. The semifinal winners advance to their respective cup final, hosted by the higher surviving seed.

=== Super Rugby ===
Throughout the pre-2011 history of [[Super Rugby]]—both in the Super 12 and Super 14 formats—the competition's organiser, [[SANZAAR|SANZAR]] (renamed SANZAAR in 2016), held a Shaughnessy playoff involving the top four teams. The top two teams on the league ladder each hosted a semifinal, with the top surviving team hosting the final.

In May 2009, SANZAR announced that it would adopt an expanded playoff when the competition added [[Melbourne Rebels|a new Australian team]] for the 2011 season. Through 2015, the Super Rugby playoff involved six teams—the winners of each of three conferences (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa conferences), plus the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation.

The top two conference winners received a first-round bye; each played at home against the winner of an elimination match involving two of the four other playoff teams. As in the previous system, the final was hosted by the top surviving seed.

Further expansion of the competition in 2016 to 18 teams, with [[Southern Kings|one extra entry]] from South Africa and new teams based in [[Jaguares (Super Rugby)|Argentina]] and [[Sunwolves|Japan]], saw the playoff bracket expand to eight teams. The teams were split into African and Australasian groups, with the Argentine and Japanese teams joining the African group. Each group in turn was divided into two conferences (Australia, New Zealand, Africa 1, Africa 2). Conference winners received the top four playoff seeds, and were joined by the top three remaining Australasian teams and the top remaining team from the African group on table points, again without regard to conference affiliation. The higher seed still hosted all playoff matches, including the final.

With the contraction of the league to 15 teams for 2018, with one Australian and two South African teams being axed, the playoff format changed yet again. The number of conferences was reduced from four to three—Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the Argentine team joining the South Africa conference and the Japanese team joining the Australia conference. The playoff will remain at eight teams, with the three conference winners joined by five "wildcards", specifically the top remaining teams without regard to conference affiliation. The conference winners and the top wildcard will host quarterfinals, with all remaining matches hosted by the higher seed.

[[Image:rashguard.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Surfing "long-sleeves" rashguard]]
A '''rash guard''', also known as '''rash vest''' or '''rashie''', is an athletic [[shirt]] made of [[spandex]] and [[nylon]] or [[polyester]]. The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against [[rash]]es caused by [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]], or by [[sunburn]] from extended exposure to the sun. These shirts can be worn by themselves, or under a [[wetsuit]]. A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several [[watersports]] including [[surfing]], [[canoe polo]], water survival training, [[scuba diving]], [[snorkeling]], [[freediving]], [[wakeboarding]], [[bodysurfing]], [[bodyboarding]], [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]], [[kayaking]], [[stand up paddle surfing]], or [[Human swimming|swimming]]. There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to [[compression shorts]] to be worn under the surfers' boardshorts, but more specialized for surfers.

Rash guards are most often worn in surfing when the weather is too warm for a [[wetsuit]], and to prevent wax-based chafing from sliding on and off of the surf board, on either the torso, or the legs. A surfboard's wax holds sand from the beach that could rub against a surfer's torso while paddling out to the break, or legs while sitting atop one's board. Rash guards also offer some protection from the sun (measured by its [[Sun protective clothing#UPF rating|Ultraviolet Protection Factor]]) and slight protection against jelly fish stings and are sometimes worn under wetsuits to prevent [[Chafing (skin)|chafing]]. A rash guard helps to prevent irritation caused by rapid impact with surface water and waves as well.

Rash guards are thought to have originated in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surfing Rash Guard Shirts|url=http://www.thebeachdepot.com/content/Surfing_Rash_Guard_Shirts.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309093308/http://www.thebeachdepot.com/content/Surfing_Rash_Guard_Shirts.htm|archivedate=2012-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they are commonly referred to as "rashies" or "rashys." Variations of the rash guard have made their way into other sports including [[baseball]], [[American football]], [[water polo]], [[Grappling]], [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], and [[mixed martial arts]]. Athletes who wear rash guards in MMA/Grappling/BJJ seek protection against cuts, mat burns, and the spread of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.venum.com/sports/mma/rashguards.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important components of a rash guard include [[Overlock#Types of overlock stitches|flatlock]] stitching, and six panel construction. Flatlock stitching creates a seam where the seam allowances lies flat to the garment instead of hanging loose from it. It is made by adjusting the overlock or the thread overedge stitch. Flatlock stitching increases the strength of the garment for intense exercise or recreational activities. Six panel construction and different material for separate body parts sewn together in panels allow the user increased mobility wet or dry versus the conventional four-panel tee shirt construction.{{clarify|reason= How do the extra two panels work|date=July 2018}}

The combination of products used to construct a rash guard differ slightly depending on the designer. The use of nylon and spandex create a garment that is lightweight, quick drying, flexible, durable, naturally antibacterial and water wicking.

==Variations==
Some variations include the following:
*Cropped rash guard: A rash guard that is similar to a [[Crop top|crop top]] and is made specifically for females. It can be paired with swimwear bottoms.
*Rash guard overall/bodysuit: A hybrid one-piece swimsuit (with boyleg/short or classic bottoms) with rash guard material and design. There are designs for males and females and this variation is much catered to children.

== Swim shirts ==
[[File:Surfer woman wearing bikini bottom and shirt.png|thumb|A woman wearing a swim shirt while surfing]]

Swim shirts are relatively new to the consumer market, but are growing in popularity. They are generally more loose fitting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Loose Fitting Rash Guard Swim Shirts|url=http://www.myrashguards.com/Loose-Fit-Rash-Guards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and casually worn. Their primary purpose is to offer an alternative to sunscreen to protect the wearer's skin from the sun's UV radiation and possible [[skin cancer]]. Many swim shirts carry a [[sun protective clothing|UPF]] rating of 50+, which blocks out over 98% of the sun’s harmful rays. Many people find that sunscreen isn’t always enough because it is often not used properly and some have skin allergies or sensitivities to chemicals in sunscreens.  Children's skin can be especially sensitive to the sun and sunscreens.  Many children, and parents, find it is much easier to put on a swim shirt as it is loose and easily slipped on. There are also zip front rash guards available which makes slipping in and out of them even easier, especially when wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Rash Vest with Zip|url=https://klassikoz.com.au/collections/tops}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is comfortable and yet gives sun protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swim Shirts and Rash Guards for Children|url=http://swimzip.com/collections/girls-sun-protective}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the name generally applies to water sports, people use swim shirts for an array of activities: swimming, [[boating]], [[golfing]], [[tennis]], [[gardening]], playing in the sprinklers, [[water parks]], beach trips, pool play, rivers and lakes, [[water skiing]], surfing, [[snow skiing]], [[sledding]], [[skimboarding]], in mixed martial arts and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and even as normal everyday clothing.

'''Sportsman's Park''' was the name of several former [[Major League Baseball]] [[Baseball park|ballpark]] structures in the [[Midwestern United States|central]] United States, in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. All but one of these were located on the same piece of land, at the northwest corner of [[Grand Boulevard (St. Louis)|Grand Boulevard]] and Dodier Street, on the north side of the city.

==History==
From 1920&amp;ndash;1953, Sportsman's Park was the home field of both the [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] of the [[American League]], and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of the [[National League]], after which the Browns departed to become the modern-day [[Baltimore Orioles]]. The physical street address was 2911 North Grand Boulevard. This ballpark (by then known as '''Busch Stadium,''' but still commonly called Sportsman's Park) was also the home of the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] from [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1960]] through [[1965 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1965]], after the team's relocation from [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago]] and before [[Busch Memorial Stadium]] opened its doors in 1966. In {{nfly|1923}}, the stadium hosted St. Louis's first NFL team, the [[St. Louis All-Stars]].

===1881 structure===
Baseball was played on the Sportsman's Park site as early as 1867. The tract was acquired in 1866 by August Solari, who began staging games there the following year. It was the home of the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]] in the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] and the [[National League]] from 1875 to 1877. Originally called the '''Grand Avenue Ball Grounds'''. Some sources say the field was renamed '''Sportsman's Park''' in [[1876 in baseball|1876]], although local papers were not using that name until 1881. The local papers also still used the alternate name "'''Grand Avenue Park'''" until at least 1885. The first grandstand—one of three on the site—was built in [[1881 in baseball|1881]].  At that time, the diamond and the grandstands were on the southeast corner of the block, for the convenience of fans arriving from Grand Avenue. The park was leased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chris Von der Ahe and the St. Louis Browns|last=Hetrick|first=J. Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Hetrick|year=1999|publisher=Scarecrow|location=Lanham, Maryland.|isbn=0-8108-3473-1|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the then-major [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] entry, the St. Louis "Brown Stockings", or "Browns". The Browns were a very strong team in the mid-1880s, but their success waned. When the National League absorbed the strongest of the old Association teams in [[1892 in baseball|1892]], the Browns were brought along. Soon they went looking for a new ballpark, finding a site just a few blocks northwest of the old one, and calling it '''New Sportsman's Park''', which was later renamed '''[[Robison Field]]'''. They also changed team colors from Brown to Cardinal Red, thus acquiring a new nickname, and leaving their previous team colors available, as well as the old ballpark site.

===1902 and 1909 structures===
[[File:Sportsman's Park 1907.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The 1902 version of Sportsman's Park, with the diamond located on the northwest corner.]]
When the American League Browns moved from [[Milwaukee]] in [[1902 in baseball|1902]], they built a new version of Sportsman's Park.  They initially placed the diamond and the main stand at the northwest corner of the block.

This Sportsman's Park saw football history made.  It became both the practice field and home field for [[Saint Louis University]] [[Saint Louis Billikens football|football teams]], coached by the visionary [[Eddie Cochems]], father of the [[forward pass]].  Although the first legal forward pass was thrown by Saint Louis's [[Bradbury Robinson]] in a road game at [[Carroll University|Carroll College]] in September 1906, Sportsman's Park was the scene of memorable displays of what Cochems called his "air attack" that season.  These included a 39&amp;ndash;0 thrashing of [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] before a crowd of 12,000&lt;ref&gt;"First Touchdown Is Scored After Few Minutes of Play", ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', November 30, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; and a 34&amp;ndash;2 trouncing of [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] witnessed by some 7,000.&lt;ref&gt;"St. Louis U. Scores 12 Points in First Half of Great Game with Kansas", ''[[St. Louis Star-Chronicle]]'', November 3, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;  Robinson launched an amazingly long pass in the game against the Jayhawks, which was variously reported to have traveled 48, 67 or 87 yards in the air.  [[College Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[David M. Nelson]]&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David M.,''The Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; called the pass extraordinary, "considering the size, shape and weight" of the fat, rugby-style ball used at that time.  Sports historian John Sayle Watterson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/1322.html The Johns Hopkins University Press webpage on John Sayle Watterson]&lt;/ref&gt; agreed.  In his book, ''College Football: History, Spectacle, Controversy'', Watterson described Robinson's long pass as "truly a breathtaking achievement". St. Louis finished with an 11&amp;ndash;0 record in 1906, outscoring its opponents 407&amp;ndash;11.

In [[1909 in baseball|1909]], the Browns moved the diamond to its final location, at the southwest corner, in the shadow of a new steel and concrete grandstand—the third such stadium in the major leagues, and the second in the American League (after [[Shibe Park]]).  The previous wooden grandstand was retained as left-field bleachers for a while, but was soon replaced with permanent bleachers. The Cardinals came back to their original home in mid-1920, as tenants of the Browns, after abandoning the outdated, mostly-wooden Robison Field.
 
After nearly winning the American League Pennant in [[1922 in baseball|1922]], Browns owner [[Phil Ball (baseball)|Phil Ball]] confidently predicted that there would be a World Series in Sportsman's Park by 1926. In anticipation, he increased the capacity of his ballpark from 18,000 to 30,000.  There ''was'' [[1926 World Series|a World Series in Sportsman's Park in 1926]]—but it was the Cardinals, not the Browns, who took part in it, upsetting the Yankees in a memorable seventh game.

Although the Browns had been the stronger team in the city for the first quarter of the century, they had never been quite good enough to win a pennant. After the previously weak Cardinals had moved in, the two teams' situations had started to reverse, both on and off the field.  The Cardinals' [[1926 World Series]] victory more or less permanently tipped the balance in favor of the Cardinals.  From then on, the Cardinals were clearly St. Louis' favorite team, while still tenants of the Browns.  The [[1944 World Series]] between the Cardinals and the Browns, won by the Cardinals 4 games to 2, was perhaps a good metaphor for the two clubs' respective situations.  It remains the last World Series to be played entirely in one facility as the home venue for both competing clubs.

[[File:Sportsman's Park 1946 World Series-1.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[1946 World Series]] at Sportsman's Park.]]
In addition to its primary use as a baseball stadium, Sportsman's Park also hosted several soccer events.  These included several the [[St. Louis Soccer League]] and the [[1948 National Challenge Cup]] when [[St. Louis Simpkins-Ford]] defeated [[Brookhattan]] for the national soccer championship.

In 1936, Browns owner Phil Ball died. His family sold the Browns to businessman [[Donald Lee Barnes]], but the Ball estate maintained ownership of Sportsman's Park until 1946, when it was sold to the Browns for an estimated price of over US$1 million.&lt;ref name=bpsppkmj&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aB0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NSUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3580%2C1107401 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Browns purchase Sportsman's Park |date=October 3, 1946 |page=8, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953 sale===
By the early 1950s, it was clear that the city could not support both teams. [[Bill Veeck]], owner of the Browns (who at one point lived with his family in an apartment under the park's stands),&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Cathedrals|last=Lowry|first=Philip|year=2006|publisher=Walker &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-8027-1608-8|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Afo5vtVTz4wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=green%20cathedrals&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; fancied that he could drive the Cardinals out of town through his promotional skills. He caught an unlucky break when the Cardinals' owner, [[Fred Saigh]], pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to [[tax evasion]]. Faced with certain banishment from baseball, Saigh sold the Cardinals to [[Anheuser-Busch]] in February [[1953 in baseball|1953]].&lt;ref name=cpbbtsv&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jd5YAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bvYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6906%2C3447771 |newspaper=Spokane Daily Chronicle |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Cardinals purchased by brewery $3,750,000 |date=February 20, 1953 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cststlb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nEMxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EhAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7052%2C6050861|newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Cards sold to St. Louis brewery |date=February 21, 1953 |page=3, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Veeck soon realized that the Cardinals now had more resources at their disposal than he could hope to match, and decided to move the Browns out of town.

Busch had the money, and the ballpark was soon renovated. Meanwhile, by the [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|next year]], the Browns relocated to [[Baltimore]] and were renamed as the [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]], which has been the name of the team ever since.
 
The brewery originally wanted to [[naming rights|name]] the ballpark [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] Stadium.&lt;ref name=bwtggvbp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Qmg1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3602%2C4272766 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |agency=United Press |title=Budweiser tag given baseball park in St. Louis |date=April 10, 1953 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]] vetoed the name because of public relations concerns over naming a ballpark after a brand of [[beer]]. However, the commissioner could not stop Anheuser-Busch president [[August Busch, Jr.]] from renaming it after himself, and so he did; many fans still called it by the old name. The Anheuser Busch "eagle" model that sat atop the left field scoreboard flapped its wings after a Cardinal home run.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt; The next year, Anheuser Busch introduced a new economy lager branded as "[[Anheuser-Busch brands#Busch|Busch Bavarian Beer]]", thus [[gaming the system|gaming]] Frick's ruling and allowing the ballpark's name to be branded by what would eventually be Anheuser-Busch's second most popular beer brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/park/sportsmans-park-st-louis|title=Sportsman's Park (St. Louis)|last=Ferkovich|first=Scott|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportsman's Park / Busch Stadium was the site of a number of [[World Series]] contests, first way back in the mid-1880s, and then in the modern era. The [[1964 World Series|1964]] Series was particularly memorable, the park's last, and  featured brother against brother, [[Ken Boyer]] of the Cardinals and [[Clete Boyer]] of the Yankees.  The Cardinals' triumph in seven games led to Yankees management replacing [[Yogi Berra]] with the Cardinals' ex-manager [[Johnny Keane]] (he had resigned after winning the Series), an arrangement which lasted only to early 1966. Both Series managers were St. Louis natives, but neither had ever played for the Cardinals. The stadium also hosted [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s in [[1940 in baseball|1940]], [[1948 in baseball|1948]], and [[1957 in baseball|1957]].

===Replacement===
Sportsman's Park / Busch Stadium was replaced early in the [[1966 St. Louis Cardinals season|1966]] season by [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], during which time much was made of baseball having been played on the old site for more than a century. A helicopter carried home plate to Busch Memorial Stadium after the final Sportsman's Park game on May 8, 1966.&lt;ref name="Lowry"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gw8iarw&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DDcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7xAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6207%2C1340475 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=UPI |title=Giants win 8th in a row |date=May 9, 1966 |page=2, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1966 stadium was replaced forty years later by the new [[Busch Stadium]] in April [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|2006]].&lt;ref name=smnmfrslk&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jywqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c0UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6771%2C281719 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |last=Haudricourt |first=Tom |title=Same name, fresh look |date=April 11, 2006 |page=5C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Donated by the August Busch, the Sportsman's Park site is now home to the [[Herbert Hoover]] [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]].&lt;ref name=osdchty&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eOshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DJsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6184%2C4067573 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |location=Alabama |agency=Associated Press |last=Temple |first=Wick |title=Old stadium due change this year |date=January 30, 1966 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tscalmssx&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jBQfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5p0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6843%2C1966419 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |location=Alabama |agency=Associated Press |title=Sportsman Park is alive, although Cards have gone |date=May 9, 1976 |page=11B }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the grandstand was torn down {{Years or months ago|1966}} in late 1966, the diamond was still intact at the time the structures were cleared, and the field is now used for other sports.

==Dimensions==
For a small park, there were plenty of posted distance markers. The final major remodeling was done in 1926. Distance markers had appeared by the 1940s:&lt;ref name = "details" /&gt;

===Layout===
The left field and right field walls ran toward center, roughly perpendicular to the foul lines or at right angles to each other. The center field area was a short diagonal segment connecting the two longer walls. When distance markers were first posted, there was a 426 marker at the left corner of that segment, and a 422 marker at the right corner of it. There was another 422 marker a few feet to the left of the other one, and that marked "true" center field. For symmetry, a corresponding marker (425) was set a few feet to the right of the 426. The two corner markers were eventually painted over, leaving just the 425 and the true centerfield 422. [http://photosbybmw.com/Sport_Park_web_pages/pages/Sport_park72.html]

'''Tapiolan urheilupuisto''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: '''Hagalunds idrottspark''') is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Tapiola]], [[Espoo]], [[Finland]]. It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is the home stadium of [[FC Honka]]. The stadium holds 5,000 and it was built in 1970.

There were plans for a brand new 13,000 seater stadium with a retractable roof but the club went bankrupt in addition to diminishing crowds so this is now highly unlikely.

'''Thomson &amp; Taylor''' were a motor-racing engineering and car-building firm, based within the [[Brooklands]] race track. They were active [[between the wars]] and built several of the famous [[land speed record]] breaking cars of the day.

==Thomas Inventions Development Co. Ltd.==
The firm was founded as ''Thomas Inventions Development Co. Ltd.'' by [[J. G. Parry-Thomas]] &amp; [[Ken Thomson (motor racing engineer)|Major Ken Thomson]].&lt;ref name="Jennings, Fast Set" &gt;{{cite book|title=The Fast Set|author=Charles Jennings|isbn=0-349-11596-6|publisher=Abacus|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their workshops were based in the 'flying village' inside the circuit at [[Brooklands]], a convenient location for their customers, who raced there. Parry-Thomas lived in an adjacent former Royal Flying Corps building named ''The Hermitage''.

==Thomson &amp; Taylor==
After Parry-Thomas' death whilst driving ''[[Babs (Land speed record car)|Babs]]'' at [[Pendine Sands]] in 1927, [[Ken Thomson (motor racing engineer)|Major Ken Thomson]] carried on, joined by [[Ken Taylor (motor racing engineer)|Ken Taylor]], under the new name of ''Thomson &amp; Taylor''.&lt;ref name="Jennings, Fast Set" /&gt; [[Reid Railton]], who had previously worked for Parry-Thomas at [[Leyland Motors|Leyland]] joined them as Technical Director and chief designer.

In 1926 [[Malcolm Campbell]] had opened the 'Campbell Shed' at Brooklands, trading in racing sports cars. As the name suggests, this was a simply constructed wooden shed but it grew bigger and bigger, even being used to hold a barn dance in 1931.&lt;ref name="Jennings, Fast Set" /&gt; The famously impetuous Campbell lost interest though and handed it over to Thomson &amp; Taylor. The shed survives today as part of the [[Brooklands Museum]].&lt;ref name="Brooklands Museum" &gt;{{cite web

== Nordic combined ==
{{main|Nordic combined at the 1924 Winter Olympics}}

The cross-country skiing part of this event was combined with the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1924 Winter Olympics – Men's 18 kilometre|18 km race]] of cross-country skiing. Those results can be found above in this article in the cross-country skiing section. Some athletes (but not all) entered in both the cross-country skiing and Nordic combined event, their time on the 18 km was used for both events. One would expect that athletes competing at the Nordic combined event, would participate in the cross-country skiing event as well, as they would have the opportunity to win more than one medal. This was not always the case due to the maximum number of athletes (here: 4) could represent a country per event.

The ski jumping (normal hill) event was held separate from the main medal event of ski jumping, results can be found in the table below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9031">'''World Baseball Classic qualification''' is the process that determines which nations will compete at the [[World Baseball Classic]]. Qualification takes place the year prior to the tournament, which itself is played every four years.

Currently, sixteen nations compete at the World Baseball Classic proper. The twelve highest finishing nations from each WBC automatically qualify for the next edition; the remaining four slots are filled by the winners of four four-team qualifying tournaments. Therefore, twenty-eight nations enter the tournament at any point. To date, twenty-nine nations have entered either qualifying or the main tournament.

Unlike other international tournaments such as the [[Rugby World Cup]], [[FIFA World Cup]], and [[FIBA Basketball World Cup]], the qualifying tournaments are not arranged on a regional or geographic basis.

==History==
The 2006 and 2009 tournaments each had the same 16–team field, chosen by invitation. Starting with the 2013 tournament, the top 12 teams from the previous tournament qualified automatically and a qualifying round was added to determine the remaining 4 teams.

For the [[2013 World Baseball Classic|2013]] tournament, [[2013 World Baseball Classic – Qualification|qualifying tournaments]] were held in late 2012. The four nations – ([[Canada national baseball team|Canada]], [[Chinese Taipei national baseball team|Chinese Taipei]], [[Panama national baseball team|Panama]], and [[South Africa national baseball team|South Africa]]) – that had failed to win games in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic|2009 tournament]] were joined by twelve new invited nations.

The qualifiers were organized as four independent [[Double-elimination tournament|modified double-elimination]] tournaments featuring four teams each. The final game was winner-take-all, even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket. That is, the team emerging from the winner's bracket might be eliminated despite losing only one game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbaseballclassic.com/news/article/64278980/&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada and Chinese Taipei won their qualifying tournaments to return to the main tournament, while [[Spain national baseball team|Spain]] and [[Brazil national baseball team|Brazil]] qualified to make their World Baseball Classic debuts.

For [[2017 World Baseball Classic – Qualification|2017 qualifying]], [[Australia national baseball team|Australia]], [[Mexico national baseball team|Mexico]], Spain, and Brazil were relegated to the qualification stage. Previous entrants Panama and South Africa returned, joined by the other invited nations, with the exception of [[Thailand national baseball team|Thailand]], who was replaced by [[Pakistan national baseball team|Pakistan]], who was invited following its 5th-place finish at the [[2015 Asian Baseball Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/961038/world-baseball-classic-championship-history-made-as-pakistan-book-place-in-qualifiers/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Olympic Games infobox}}

The '''Youth Olympic Games''' ('''YOG''') is an international [[multi-sport event]] organized by the [[International Olympic Committee]]. The games are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current [[Olympic Games]] format, though in reverse order with Winter Games held in [[Leap year|leap years]] instead of Summer Games. The first summer version was held in [[Singapore]] from 14 to 26 August [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] while the first winter version was held in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] from 13 to 22 January [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]].&lt;ref name="FIS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fasterskier.com/racing4278.html |title=FIS in favor of Youth Olympic Games |date=8 May 2007 |publisher=[[International Ski Federation|FIS]] |accessdate=20 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021042/http://www.fasterskier.com/racing4278.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18.&lt;ref name="No kidding"&gt;{{cite news |title=No kidding: Teens to get Youth Olympic Games |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2007-04-25-2774646336_x.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=19 May 2007 | date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of such an event was introduced by [[Johann Rosenzopf]] from Austria in 1998. On 6 July 2007, International Olympic Committee (IOC) members at the 119th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC session]] in [[Guatemala City]] approved the creation of a youth version of the [[Olympic Games]], with the intention of sharing the costs of hosting the event between the IOC and the host city, whereas the traveling costs of athletes and coaches were to be paid by the IOC. These Games will also feature cultural exchange programs and opportunities for participants to meet Olympic athletes.

Several other Olympic events for youth, like the [[European Youth Olympic Festival]] held every other year with summer and winter versions, and the [[Australian Youth Olympic Festival]], have proven successful.  The Youth Games are modelled after these sporting events.&lt;ref name="Rogge introduces"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/6467087.stm |title=Rogge wants Youth Olympic Games |date=19 March 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=19 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The YOG are also a successor to the discontinued [[World Youth Games]].

The Summer Youth Olympic Games of [[Singapore]] in [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] and [[Nanjing]] in [[2014 Summer Youth Olympics|2014]] each played host to 3600 athletes and lasted 13 days, whereas the Winter YOG of [[Innsbruck]] in [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]] had 1059 athletes and [[Lillehammer]] in [[2016 Winter Youth Olympics|2016]] had 1100 athletes and lasted 10 days. Even though this exceeded initial estimates,&lt;ref name="CRI English"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.cri.cn/2886/2007/04/25/1221@220491.htm |title=IOC to Introduce Youth Olympic Games in 2010 |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YOG brochure"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2010 |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1215.pdf |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] Department of Communications |year=2007 |format=pdf |page=8 |accessdate=24 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118234849/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_1215.pdf |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the YOG are still both smaller in size as well as shorter than their senior equivalents. The most recent Summer YOG was the [[2018 Summer Youth Olympics|2018 Summer Youth Olympic Games]] of [[Buenos Aires]]. The next Winter YOG to take place will be the [[2020 Winter Youth Olympics|2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games]] of [[Lausanne]] while the [[2022 Summer Youth Olympics]] will take place in [[Dakar]].

==History==
The concept of the Youth Olympic Games came from Austrian industrial manager [[Johann Rosenzopf]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="faz_trial"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.faz.net/-01mcn3 |title=Olympischer Frieden |date=27 December 2010 |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was in response to growing global concerns about childhood obesity and the dropping participation of youth in sport activities, especially amongst youth in developed nations.&lt;ref name=yogextract28&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=pdf|page=28|url=http://www.olympic.org/Assets/YOG/pdf/extract-from-olympic-review.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further recognized that a youth version of the Olympic Games would help foster participations in the Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=cep&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Family|publisher=International Olympic Committee|last=Stoneman|first=Michael|url=http://view.digipage.net/?id=olympicreview76|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these reasons for having an Olympic event for young people, the IOC's response of holding a purely sporting event was negative.&lt;ref name=yogextract35&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=pdf|page=35|url=http://www.olympic.org/Assets/YOG/pdf/extract-from-olympic-review.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IOC delegates wanted the event to be as much about cultural education and exchange as it was about sports, which is why the Culture and Education Program (CEP) was developed as a component of each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name=yogextract35/&gt; [[Jacques Rogge]], IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th [[List of IOC meetings|IOC session]] in [[Guatemala City]] on 6 July 2007.&lt;ref name=Approved&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=2227 |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |title=IOC Session: A "go" for Youth Olympic Games |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=5 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values.&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=Factsheet Youth Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee|date=February 2009|url=http://www.dromore-ac.co.uk/Youth%20Olympic%20Games.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324081517/http://www.dromore-ac.co.uk/Youth%20Olympic%20Games.pdf|archive-date=24 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Singapore]] was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008.&lt;ref name=singapore&gt;{{cite web|title=Perfect Pitch|publisher=International Olympic Committee|last=Wang|first=Jeanette|url=http://www.olympic.org/Assets/YOG/pdf/extract-from-olympic-review.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that [[Innsbruck]], host of the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]], would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innsbruck Elected To Host the Inagural Youth Olympic Winter Games In 2012 |publisher=Gamebids.com |date=12 December 2008 |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_winter_2012/1216133970.html |accessdate=20 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228222617/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_winter_2012/1216133970.html |archivedate=28 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements of host cities==
The scale of the Youth Olympic Games is smaller than that of the Olympics, which is intentional and allows for smaller cities to host an Olympic event.  Potential host cities are required to keep all events within the same city and no new sports venues should be built.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  Exceptions to this building moratorium include a media center, amphitheater facilities for classes and workshops, and a village for coaches and athletes.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  This village is to be the heart of the Games for the athletes, and the hub of activity.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  No new or unique transportation systems are required as all athletes and coaches will be transported by shuttles.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  According to bid procedures, the track and field stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies must hold 10,000 people, and a city must have a 2,500-seat aquatics facility (for Summer editions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Youth Olympic Games: Appraising Abuja’s Bid Plan|publisher=Leadershipeditors.com|date=19 March 2011|url=http://www.leadershipeditors.com/ns/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27272:2018-youth-olympic-games-appraising-abujas-bid-plan&amp;catid=19:sports-news&amp;Itemid=105|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
The original estimated costs for running the Games were US$30 million for the Summer and $15 million to $20 million for Winter Games, these costs do not include infrastructure improvements for venue construction. The IOC has stipulated that costs for infrastructure and venues is to be paid by the host city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympic Games Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=pdf|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/fr_report_1277.pdf|page=52|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IOC will pay travel costs to the host city and room and board for the athletes and judges, estimated at $11 million. The funding will come from IOC funds and not revenues.

Over 200 countries and 3,600 athletes participated in the inaugural 2010 Youth Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |publisher=Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games |url=http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_about_us/en_youth_olympics_games.html |accessdate=19 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120525024041/http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_about_us/en_youth_olympics_games.html |archivedate=25 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants are placed in the following age groups: 14–15&amp;nbsp;years, 16–17&amp;nbsp;years, and 17–18&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=iocofficial&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/youth-olympic-games/|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The athlete's age is determined by how old he or she is by 31 December of the year they are participating in the YOG.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  Qualification to participate in the Youth Olympics is determined by the IOC in conjunction with the International Sport Federations (ISF) for the various sports on the program.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  To ensure that all nations are represented at the YOG the IOC instituted the concept of Universality Places.  A certain number of spots in each event are to be left open for athletes from under-represented nations regardless of qualifying marks.  This is to ensure that every nation will be able to send at least four athletes to each Youth Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  For team tournaments one team per continent will be allowed to compete along with a sixth team either representing the host nation or as proposed by the IF with IOC approval.  There is a cap of two teams (one boys' and one girls') per nation.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;  Finally, no nation may enter more than 70 athletes in individual sports.&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

==Sports==
{{update section|date=November 2018}}
The sports contested at the Youth Games are mainly the same as those [[Olympic sports]] scheduled for the traditional Games, but with some adaptations, and a limited number of disciplines and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympics:Which Sports?|last=Murphy|first=Pam|publisher=Livestrong.com|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/347703-youth-olympics-which-sports/|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the aquatics sport the IOC decided to include [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] events but excluded [[synchronized swimming]] and [[water polo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports-Aquatics |publisher=Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games |url=http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_sports/en_26sports/en_aquatics.html |accessdate=12 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527070943/http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_sports/en_26sports/en_aquatics.html |archivedate=27 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the sports have been modified for the Games.  The basketball competition uses the [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]] format, which is a 3-on-3 half-court game; under current rules, the game is played in a single 10-minute period, and the first team to 21&amp;nbsp;points wins (using a scoring system different from that of the full-court game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports-Basketball |publisher=Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games |url=http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_sports/en_26sports/en_basketball.html |accessdate=12 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527070943/http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_sports/en_26sports/en_basketball.html |archivedate=27 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual skills challenge in basketball is held since 2014. The [[field hockey]] was introduced as outdoor format in 2010 Games, but was later changed to the hockey5s a smaller version of indoor played in outdoor in 2014. The [[cycling]] disciplines are [[BMX racing]], [[bicycle road race|road cycling]] and [[mountain bike racing]], while [[track cycling]] has been left off the schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports-Cycling |publisher=Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games |url=http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_sports/en_26sports/en_cycling.html |accessdate=12 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527070943/http://www.singapore2010.sg/public/sg2010/en/en_sports/en_26sports/en_cycling.html |archivedate=27 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2014, [[beach volleyball]] replaced [[volleyball]].

The [[2018 Summer Youth Olympics|2018 edition]] featured 4 new sports: [[sport climbing]], [[karate]], [[breakdancing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/three-new-sports-to-join-buenos-aires-2018-yog-programme|title=Three new sports to join Buenos Aires 2018 YOG programme |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[roller speed skating]]&lt;ref name="roller"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/roller-speed-added-to-the-buenos-aires-2018-event-programme|title=Roller speed added to the Buenos Aires 2018 event programme! |publisher=Olympic.org |date= 2017-03-17|accessdate=2017-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Added events included [[BMX freestyle]], [[kitesurfing]], [[cross country running]] and [[beach handball]] replaced [[handball]].

The Winter Youth Games features seven sports. Ice hockey will have not only a men's and women's tournament but also an individual skills challenge.&lt;ref name=wintersports&gt;{{cite web|title=Sports events and eligibility requirements|publisher=Innsbruck 2012 Youth Olympic Games|url=http://www.innsbruck2012.com/en/sports/sport_events_and_eligibility|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In luge, figure skating and short track speed skating there will be mixed NOC events that will allow athletes from various countries to compete together in teams.  Alpine and cross-country skiing will have events in which men and women will compete on mixed-gendered teams.&lt;ref name=wintersports/&gt;

Other youth-driven sports may eventually be contested if backed by international sports federations.

==Culture and education==
[[File:Opening Ceremony of Singapore YOG 2010 flags.jpg|thumb|Flags of participating nations at the [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics]]]]
Education and culture are also key components for the Youth edition. Not only does the education/culture aspect apply to athletes and participants, but also youth around the world and inhabitants of the host city and surrounding regions. To this end a Culture and Education Program (CEP) will be featured at each Games.&lt;ref name=cep/&gt;  The first CEP at the 2010 Singapore Games featured events that fostered cooperation amongst athletes of different nations.  It had classes on topics ranging from health and fitness to the environment and career planning.  Local students from Singapore made booths at the World Culture Village that represented each of the 205 participating National Olympic Committee.&lt;ref name=yogextract42&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=pdf|page=42|url=http://www.olympic.org/Assets/YOG/pdf/extract-from-olympic-review.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chat with Champions sessions were the most popular portion of the program.&lt;ref name=cep/&gt;  Participants were invited to hear inspirational talks given by former and current Olympic athletes.&lt;ref name=cep/&gt;

Also part of the CEP are the Young Ambassadors Programme, Young Reporters Programme and Athlete Role Models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Youth_Olympic_Games.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817155609/http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Youth_Olympic_Games.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Young Ambassadors Programme, a group of youths aged 18 to 25 years old are nominated by the NOCs to help promote the YOG in their regions and communities, and encourage the athletes to participate in the CEP programmes.

The Young Reporters Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-announces-the-young-reporters-for-the-youth-olympic-games/92042|title=IOC announces the Young Reporters for the Youth Olympic Games|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides journalism students or those who have recently started their journalism careers a cross-platform journalist-training programme and on-the-job experience during the YOG. Young Reporters, between the ages of 18 and 24, are selected by the Continental Associations of National Olympic Committees and will represent each of the five continents.

Acting as mentors to help support and advise young Olympians are the Athlete Role Models, who are typically active or recently retired Olympians nominated by the IFs, such as Japanese wrestler Kaori Icho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/three-time-olympic-champion-and-athlete-role-model-kaori-icho-on-her-love-for-wrestling/232949|title=Three-time Olympic champion and Athlete Role Model Kaori Icho on her love for wrestling|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Simone Farina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/farina-appointed-to-youth-olympic-games-role/229382|title=Farina appointed to Youth Olympic Games role|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Namibian Frank Fredericks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/meet-frank-fredericks-athlete-role-model-for-innsbruck-2012/182747|title=Meet Frank Fredericks, Athlete Role Model for Innsbruck 2012!|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasis on exchange goes beyond the CEP.  Another unique feature of the Youth Olympic Games are mixed-gender and mixed-national teams.  Triathlon relays, fencing, table tennis, archery and mixed swimming relays are a few of the sports in which athletes from different nations and mixed genders can compete together.&lt;ref name=cep/&gt;  YOG organizers are also using social media such as Facebook, [[Flikr]], and Twitter as key platforms for engaging young athletes before, during, and after each celebration of the Games.&lt;ref name=cep/&gt;  Multi-lingual, multi-cultural, and multi-age requirements are the targets of the program, which stress the themes of "Learning to know, learning to be, learning to do, and learning to live together".&lt;ref name=yogextract42/&gt;

==List of Youth Olympic Games==
In early November 2007, [[Athens]], [[Bangkok]], [[Singapore]], [[Moscow]], and [[Turin]] were selected by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teenage Kicks: The Inaugural Youth Olympic Games|publisher=SportsPro|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/sportspro_blog/teenage_kicks/|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, the candidates were further pared down to just Moscow and Singapore. Finally, on 21 February 2008, Singapore was declared host of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games 2010 via live telecast from Lausanne, Switzerland, winning by a tally of 53 votes to 44 for Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factsheet Youth Olympic Games|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=pdf|url=http://www.dromore-ac.co.uk/Youth%20Olympic%20Games.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324081517/http://www.dromore-ac.co.uk/Youth%20Olympic%20Games.pdf|archive-date=24 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2008 IOC announced that the executive board had shortlisted four cities among the candidates to host the first Winter Youth Olympic Games in 2012. The four candidate cities were [[Harbin]], Innsbruck, [[Kuopio]], and [[Lillehammer]].&lt;ref name=innsbruckwins&gt;{{cite web|title=Innsbruck Elected To Host the Inagural Youth Olympic Winter Games In 2012 |publisher=Gamesbids.com |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_winter_2012/1216133970.html |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106002226/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_winter_2012/1216133970.html |archivedate= 6 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC president Jacques Rogge appointed [[Pernilla Wiberg]] to chair the commission which analysed the projects. As with the Summer Games, the list was then shortened to two finalists, Innsbruck and Kuopio, in November 2008. On 12 December 2008, it was announced that Innsbruck beat Kuopio to host the games.&lt;ref name=innsbruckwins/&gt;  Nanjing, China was selected by the IOC over Poznan, Poland to be the host-city of the 2014 Youth Olympics. The election was held on 10 February 2010, two days before the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nanjing, China Elected To Host 2014 Summer Youth Olympic Games|publisher=Gamesbids.com|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_summer_2014/1216134991.html|accessdate=12 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810083609/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/youth_olympic_bids/youth_summer_2014/1216134991.html|archive-date=10 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lillehammer]], Norway hosted the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/youth-olympics/2016/15116-lillehammer-awarded-2016-winter-youth-olympic-games|title=Lillehammer awarded 2016 Winter Youth Olympic Games|publisher=|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Zander Hollander''' (March 24, 1923 – April 11, 2014) was an American sportswriter, journalist, editor and archivist.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/15/sports/zander-hollander-sports-trivia-shepherd-dies-at-91.html?_r=0 |title= New York Times – Zander Hollander, Sports Trivia Shepherd, Dies at 91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years before the Internet and unfinished cable television system emerged, Hollander served as a prolific supplier of encyclopedias on every major sport. At this point, he edited, wrote or packaged around 300 books over a professional career that spanned 45 years.&lt;ref name=NYTfans&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/sports/for-true-sports-fans-before-the-internet-there-were-the-complete-handbooks.html |title= New York Times – For Sports Fans, Before the Internet, There Were the Complete Handbooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born as Alexander Hollander in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], he grew up in [[Far Rockaway, Queens]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; At age 14, he found his emerging sports ability writing columns for a neighborhood newspaper, and then in high school, he wrote for the ''[[Long Island Daily Press]]'' and the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]''. He later attended [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] but left to serve in the [[Army Air Forces]], assigned to an Army newspaper in [[Hawaii]]. After his discharge, he enrolled at [[City College of New York]] but did not graduate.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The heavy workload never really ended for Hollander. In 1955 he founded ''Associated Features'', a company which produced booklets that were distributed with assorted promotional products, but it was not a lucrative enterprise. Even when immersed in several editorial projects, he would occasionally take a freelance shift  on the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' sports desk.&lt;ref name=NYTfans/&gt;

After a stint with ''[[United Press International]]'' as an editor in New York, Hollander was hired as a sportswriter by the ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram]]'', originally to cover [[yachting]]. Before he committed full-time to his company in the mid-1960s, his day might consist of visiting potential clients and writing on a freelance basis for magazines, followed by phone calls to [[Western Union]] so he could meet the ''World-Telegram'' midnight deadline.&lt;ref name=NYTfans/&gt; Besides this, he reported for the ''[[Associated Press]]'' about his stay in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170215220326/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1708026/ IMDb.com – Zander Hollander biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollander decided to quit newspapers in 1966, when he rejected an offer to work as editor of the ''World-Telegram and Sun'', as it had become after merging with two other New York newspapers, the ''[[New York Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'' and the ''[[New York Journal-American|Journal-American]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He then turned his attention to his ''Associated Features'' business in the years to come.&lt;ref name=NYTfans/&gt;

From 1971 through 1997, Hollander found a niche in the bookstores by annually providing career statistics and profiles of players, team rosters, all-time records, articles with photos, scouting reports, schedules and predictions for the upcoming season, in the form of brick-size tomes, 400-plus pages, he titled ''Complete Handbooks''. In them, he showed his experience and deep knowledge of professional [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[American football|football]], [[Ice hockey|hockey]] and [[tennis]], as well as [[jai alai]], [[Association football|soccer]] and college basketball and football.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTfans/&gt;

But the aforementioned yearbooks of Hollander were just one part his multifaceted sports knowledge. He also chronicled sports [[blooper]]s and wrote a history of [[Madison Square Garden]], among other subjects.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

During his time as a journalist, he started a lifelong friendship with a then young lawyer, [[Howard Cosell]], who represented the [[Little League Baseball|Little League]] of New York and had been asked by the local radio station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] to host a show featuring youth ballplayers. Hollander agreed to collaborate by writing scripts and recruiting sports celebrities for the show. They were not paid for their services, but it was the beginning of a successful sports broadcasting career for Cosell.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285201/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_1 IMDb.com – Howard Cosell : ''Telling It Like It Is'' (1999 Documentary)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 interview, Hollander explained that as soon as he could hold a pencil and throw a ball, he dreamed of being a sportswriter. At the same time, he remembered that his first journalism effort was writing on a mimeographed newspaper in elementary school.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTfans/&gt;

Hollander suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] during his later life. He died on April 11, 2014 in [[Manhattan|Manhattan, New York]], at the age of 91.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;
