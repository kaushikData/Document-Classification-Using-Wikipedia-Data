The '''15th [[World Festival of Youth and Students]]''' (WFYS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfys15.dz/anglais/default.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010331074749/http://www.wfys15.dz/anglais/default.htm |archivedate=2001-03-31 |title=15th World Festival of Youth and Students |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 March 2001 |website=WFYS15 |publisher=WFYS |accessdate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was organized by the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]] (WFDY) in [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]], from 8 to 16 August 2001 for nine days, under the slogan "Let's globalize the struggle for Peace, Solidarity, Development, against Imperialism". The festival was the first organized in an Arab country, as well as the first in Africa and brought together 11,000 delegates from over 100 countries from around the world. International preparatory meetings took place in Cuba, India, Cyprus and Algeria itself. The event came after the successful revival of the festival movement at the 14th World Festival of Youth and Students in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], and marked a continuation of the internationalist and anti-imperialist youth festival spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themilitant.com/1999/636/636_6.html |title=International Youth Meeting In Cyprus Discuss World Festival, Fight Against Imperialism |last1=Malapanis |first1=Argiris |last2=Kelly |first2=Ryan |date=15 February 1999 |website=The Militant |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themilitant.com/2000/6428/642862.html |title=Meeting in Havana calls world youth festival in Algeria |last1=Haras|first1=Aris |last2=Perasso |first2=Jake |date=17 July 2000 |website=The Militant |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themilitant.com/2001/6533/653305.html |title=Youth at international festival discuss fight against imperialism |last1=Malone |first1=Alfonse |last2=Chevrier |first2=Natalie |date=27 August 2001 |website=The Militant|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From the call to the festival ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The international festival’s movement initiated in the beginning of 1947 offered to the youth of the world a space of free expression around their preoccupations and a forum of solidarity with people searching for independence, for self determination and for development. Humanity is entering the 21st century with hopes and new aspirations, but it has to face at the same time great challenges, being aware that not all of the last centuries changes changed our lives for the better; rather, it depends on our youthful, common and joint struggle as an active power of peoples. The 15th edition of the World Festival of Youth and Students comes to strengthen the work of the last festivals, and will take place in a new millennium marked by disastrous effects of globalisation and the new restructuring of the international relations, under the slogan adopted by a consensus “Let us globalise the struggle for peace, solidarity, development, against imperialism”. This 15th WFYS also plays a great role in an era where the civil society at the international level has become an undeniable partner in taking decisions thanks to multi-form struggles led by Non Governmental Organisations which lay down them selves as a real ways and means of claiming and expressing the preoccupations of the different stratum of peoples.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Political unrest ==
The festival took place at the conclusion of the decade-long [[Algerian Civil War]]. In the months leading up to the festival there were sustained street actions by hundreds of thousands of working people and youth in Algeria protesting repression by national police forces and supporting the struggle by the indigenous [[Berber people]], an ethnic nationality in Algeria and throughout North Africa, for the right to be taught in their native language in school. This led to some groups to call to boycott the festival from those communities.

== Delegations ==
Over 1,000 youth from Algeria itself attended the festival including 50 students of Berber origin and whose families live in Kabylia, a region to the east of Algiers where Berbers comprise the overwhelming majority.

A number of other countries from Africa sent significant delegations, including Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Sudan, Egypt, and Tunisia, a first time in the history of the WFYS. A large delegation of over 400 people came with the [[Polisario Front]] from [[Western Sahara]] who raised the issue of their ongoing conflict with Morocco, organizing solidarity tents, dinners, rallies, workshops, and cultural activities about the issue which created thousands of refugees in that country.

Almost 1,000 youth were expected from the Americas with Cuba sending a delegation of 600, the largest from the region. This included 250 international students who were then going to school in Cuba, especially from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa; the other 350 were Cuban students and young workers. Several hundred came from Venezuela, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the United States and Puerto Rico.

The final count for the festival was 11,000 although other sources put the event at 6,500 people.

== Stamp ==
To honour the festival, Algeria released a special stamp by artist and painter Djazia Cherrih featuring the logo of the youth festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stampsoftheworld.co.uk/wiki/Algeria_2001_15th_World_Festival_of_Youth_and_Students|title=Algeria 2001 15th World Festival of Youth and Students |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=5 March 2012|website=Stamps of the World |publisher=Stamps of the World |accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Most of the events were held at the [[Université des sciences et de la technologie Houari-Boumediene]]. Political themes of the conferences included peace, security, international co-operation; self-determination, sovereignty, national liberation, solidarity; democracy; development and the environment; employment; education, science, and technology; childhood; women; health; communication and culture; racism, neo-fascism and discrimination; youth's movements; the students' movement; human and peoples' rights.

The Festival aimed to be an open forum for young people to exchange experiences, work together for alternative solutions, and establish joint programs of action on a wide range issues. Topics of discussion and themes of debates included disarmament and building a nuclear-free world, the "New World Order" and NATO, as well as neo-liberal globalisation.

One day of the festival was devoted to solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico, especially the fight to get the U.S. Navy out of the island of [[Vieques]], which was then being used as a bombing range and testing ground by the navy and United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico.

A combined forum in solidarity with the struggles of the people of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Colombia also took place. The panel included María Pili Hernández, representing the youth of the Fifth Republic Movement of Venezuela, the party founded by Hugo Chávez. She described changes in Venezuela's constitution and other measures by the Chávez government as an alternative example, a "third road," in the fight against imperialism.

Also discussed were questions like the eradication of racism, gender equality, HIV/AIDS and drug abuse. For example, the event featured a joint WFDY - UNESCO Conference on "the Role of Young Women in promoting culture of peace in Africa". The festival also took place on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Organization of Caribbean and Latin American Students (OCLAE), who noted that the student federations represented in OCLAE and at the 15th world youth festival are part of an emerging anti-imperialist youth movement that is revitalizing the organization.

Cultural activities at the festival included a series of amateur tournaments, including football, basketball, handball, a wheelchair competition, a chess match, tennis and table tennis. A series of festivals were also held including of political song, modern music, dance and mime, traditional folklore, and of film-makers.

==Regular season==
Columbus would get off to a poor start, winning only one out of 13 games to open the season and falling to last place in the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]]. While the Blue Jackets would play better as the season progressed, they were far off from playoff qualification and would eventually trade team captain [[Lyle Odelein]] to the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in exchange for defenseman [[Jaroslav Špaček|Jaroslav Spacek]] at the [[NHL trade deadline|trade deadline]]. Columbus would finish the season with a 22–47–8–5 record, earning 57 points, which was 14 fewer points than in their previous season, and 37 points behind the [[Vancouver Canucks]] for the eighth final playoff spot in the West. Columbus would score an NHL-low 164 goals, and their 255 goals against was the highest total in the Western Conference, third-highest in the NHL.

Brazil is currently not ranked in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] and has still not actively competing in any [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championship]], but have played in the [[Pan American Ice Hockey Tournament|Pan American Tournament]], a regional tournament for lower-tier hockey nations in the [[Americas]].

==History==
===Ice hockey in Brazil===
Brazil joined the IIHF on 26 June 1984. It was the first [[South America]]n nation to join the IIHF until [[Argentina men's national ice hockey team|Argentina]] joined in 1998 and [[Chile national ice hockey team|Chile]] in 2000. Brazil has still not actively competing in any World Championship in ice hockey, except in [[Roller in-line hockey|inline hockey]]. There are a number of rinks around the country. The teams that competed for the 2009–10 [[Brazilian Ice Hockey Championship|National Championship]] are Sociedade Hipica Campinas, Sertãozinho, Amparo NL, Palmeiras, Darks-Guariani, Portuguesa and Capelle Hockey School. [[Mike Greenlay]] and [[Robyn Regehr]], who both played in the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], were born in Brazil.

===Participation in IIHF competitions===
Brazil participated in the [[2014 Pan American Ice Hockey Tournament]]. They played their first international game against the host nation, [[Mexico men's national ice hockey team|Mexico]], which they lost 16–0. In the following game, Brazil recorded its first international goal in a 5–3 defeat to Argentina.&lt;ref name="EuroHockey"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurohockey.com/game/detail/76202-brazil--argentina.html | title = Brazil vs. Argentina | publisher = Euro Hockey | date = | accessdate = 2015-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2015 Pan American Ice Hockey Tournament|2015 edition]], Brazil recorded its first win in its first game in the tournament, 5–2, against a junior [[Mexico men's national under-18 ice hockey team|Mexico]] team.&lt;ref name="The Hockey House, June 3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thehockeyhouse.net/international-hockey/brazil-records-first-ever-hockey-victory-in-5-2-victory-over-mexico/ | title = Brazil records first ever hockey victory in 5-2 victory over Mexico | publisher = The Hockey House | date = | accessdate = 2015-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After beating Argentina “B” (7–0) and losing to [[Colombia men's national ice hockey team|Colombia]] (3–0) and Mexico (11–1), Brazil won its last game by 6–1 against Argentina's main team on 7 June, and reached third place in standings, thus winning the bronze medal, its first in the tournament.&lt;ref name="The Hockey House, June 7"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thehockeyhouse.net/international-hockey/brazil-wins-first-ever-ice-hockey-medal-at-pan-american-games/ | title = Brazil Wins First Ever Ice Hockey Medal at Pan-American Games | publisher = The Hockey House | date = | accessdate = 2015-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambodia competed in the [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]] athletics tournament, winning three gold medals and 40 medals in total.

== Preparations ==
Cambodia only announced the formation of its National Team Organizing Committee for the SEA Games in mid-October 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://balita.ph/2009/10/16/cambodia-launches-committee-to-prepare-for-sea-games Xinhua, Cambodia launches committee to prepare for SEA Games]&lt;/ref&gt; less than two months ahead of the start of the Games in [[Vientiane]], [[Laos]]. The [[National Olympic Committee of Cambodia]] (NOCC) assigned its Vice President [[Bun Sok]] to chair this committee.

This committee was made up of representatives of various Olympic sports federations and was responsible for final screening and selection of [[sportsperson|athlete]]s to represent Cambodia in various sports. Cambodia was to compete in 17 sports, with expectations of medals in [[pétanque]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[tennis]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], [[taekwondo]] and [[beach volleyball]]. As part of the preparation for 2009 SEA Games, the athletics and taekwondo athletes traveled to [[South Korea]] to undergo intensive training courtesy of the [[Incheon City of Korea Support Program]], while other athletes were to complete training in [[Vietnam]].

The [[Phnom Penh Post]] reported that, according to [[Nhan Sokvisal]], the SEA Games coordinator, Cambodia was looking forward and optimistic to better their medals haul from the last [[SEA Games]] in [[Thailand]] in 2007. In the 2007 Games, Cambodia won 19 metals - two gold, five silver and 12 bronze.

Cambodian Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] confirmed his presence at the Opening Ceremony after Laotian Prime Minister [[Bouasone Bouphavanh]]'s visit to Cambodia in late November.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2009112629765/Sport/briefs-pm-to-attend-sea-games.html PP Post, Briefs: PM to attend SEA Games ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canvas Stadium,''' also known as '''Sonny Lubick Field at Canvas Stadium''', is an outdoor [[college football]] stadium in the [[Western United States|western]] [[United States]], on the campus of [[Colorado State University]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. It is the home field of the [[Colorado State Rams football|CSU Rams]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]]; it opened August 5, [[2017 Colorado State Rams football team|2017]], and hosted its first game on August 26. It replaced [[Sonny Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium]], which had been the Rams' home since 1968. The stadium sits about 1 mile (5,003 feet) above sea level.

== Development ==
After a nearly two-year process including cost and financing changes, protests, community outreach, and an inter-governmental agreement with the city of Fort Collins, the $220 million, 41,000-capacity on-campus multi-purpose stadium began construction in May 2015.
&lt;!-- ugly run-on-over-hyphenated-when-will-it-ever-end sentence --&gt;

In 2013, the university began raising funds for a ~40,000-seat on-campus facility to replace Hughes Stadium. The project was partially driven by major decreases in state funding for CSU in recent decades. As a result, CSU has been seeking to draw more out-of-state students, whose current tuition is three times that of Colorado residents. CSU president [[Anthony A. Frank]] included the new stadium as part of this goal saying "the new facility will help build a winning football team while advancing one of the school's highest priorities: attracting more out-of-state students".&lt;ref name=Bachman&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303983904579093432304563144?ru=yahoo?mod=yahoo_itp |title=Colorado State University Bets on a Stadium to Fill Its Coffers |first=Rachel |last=Bachman |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=September 27, 2013 |accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', &lt;blockquote&gt;"Skeptics, including some alumni and faculty, see the project as a boondoggle—especially for a team that plays in a relatively low-profile athletic conference and doesn't sell out its current 32,500-seat stadium off campus. The debate has sparked dueling websites, animated letters to the editor and arguments about the role of sports at a university."&lt;ref name=Bachman/&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; Many community members expressed frustration that they did not feel they were being heard at the [[Colorado State University|CSU]] [[Board of governors|Board of Governors]] meeting when final approval was given. After the vote Board chair, Dorothy Horrell, thanked those making comments for their input and reiterated her feeling that   &lt;blockquote&gt;"the decision to build an on-campus stadium was made after "thoughtful and thorough examination of this issue" that is reflected in the board's records.  "As my parents used to tell me, just because I ask a question and didn't get the answer I wanted, it isn't that the question wasn't answered," Horrell said. "And I would just remind us all of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/local/2015/05/07/colorado-state-stadium-board-governors-athletic-director/70964618/ |title=CSU AD pledges to heal wounds opened in stadium debate |website=Coloradoan.com |date=2015-05-07 |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The new stadium, initially estimated to cost $246 million, was originally only to be built if $125 million in private funds had been raised by October 2014.&lt;ref name=Bachman/&gt; Plans were put on hold after fundraising support for the project failed to materialize as expected, according to a September 26, 2014, story in the ''Denver Business Journal''. On November 29, 2014, Frank sent a memo to the school's board of governors recommending that the new stadium be approved without raising the 50% cost in public funds as previously planned. The memo estimated that a 35,900-seat facility would cost $195 million; building with a capacity of 41,200 would cost $220 million.&lt;ref name="AP 2014-11-29"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/8d99378428ea4277a35afc5556b35237/FBC--Colorado-St-Stadium |title=Colorado State president recommends new on-campus stadium to replace existing football arena |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Republic (Columbus, Indiana)|The Republic]] |location=[[Columbus, Indiana]] |date=November 29, 2014 |accessdate=December 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219072022/http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/8d99378428ea4277a35afc5556b35237/FBC--Colorado-St-Stadium# |archive-date=2014-12-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frank also estimated that renovating Hughes Stadium to last 30 to 40 years would cost a minimum of $149 million.&lt;ref name="AP 2014-11-29"/&gt; The board of governors approved a new on campus multi-purpose stadium on December 5, 2014. At that time ''NBCSports.com'' writer Brent Sobleski speculated that the hiring of Rams head coach [[Jim McElwain]] for the head coaching vacancy at [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] days earlier may have swayed the board, noting, "An improving program and a new stadium could help lure another top-level candidate like the school previously did when McElwain was initially hired."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/05/board-of-regents-approve-new-on-campus-stadium-for-colorado-state-rams/related/ |title=Board of Governors approve new on-campus stadium for Colorado State Rams |first=Brent |last=Sobleski |work=College Football Talk |publisher=''NBCSports.com'' |date=December 5, 2014 |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CSU went on to hire Mike Bobo from the SEC like McElwain before him.  University of Georgia's Coach Bobo was named the nation's Offensive Coordinator of the Year in 2013 by 247Sports.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.ajc.com/weblogs/uga-sports/2013/dec/19/georgias-mike-bobo-named-offensive-coordinator-yea/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525015254/http://m.ajc.com/weblogs/uga-sports/2013/dec/19/georgias-mike-bobo-named-offensive-coordinator-yea/ |archivedate=May 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Georgia also had the top scoring offense in the SEC in 2014, Bobo's last season before heading to CSU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/conferences/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/totalPointsPerGame/id/8/sec-conference |title=2015 SEC College Football Team Statistics Leaders for Total - ESPN |website=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the new stadium, tentatively known as Colorado State Stadium, began in May 2015; the official groundbreaking ceremony was held the weekend of CSU's September 12, 2015 home football game against [[2015 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]]. The first game in the new stadium was August 26, 2017, when the Rams defeated [[2017 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] 58-27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400935282 |title=Colorado St. opens new stadium by beating Oregon St 58-27 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=August 26, 2017 |accessdate=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stadium donations ==
In March 2016, the university announced that it had received an anonymous gift of $20 million over a 30-year period with the express purpose of naming the playing field at the new stadium after former Rams head coach [[Sonny Lubick]], whose name was also attached to the playing field at Hughes Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.csurams.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/032516aac.html |title=$20 million gift ensures winning tradition of "Sonny Lubick Field" continues at CSU's new on-campus stadium |publisher=Colorado State Rams |date=March 25, 2016 |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gift was roughly the amount that the university had hoped to make by selling the naming rights to both the stadium and the field.&lt;ref name=Lyell&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.coloradoan.com/story/sports/csu/football/2018/04/19/colorado-state-university-sells-naming-rights-campus-stadium-fort-collins/531368002/ |title=CSU's on-campus stadium naming rights sell for $37.7 million |first=Kelly |last=Lyell |newspaper=[[Fort Collins Coloradoan|Coloradoan]] |location=Fort Collins, CO |date=April 19, 2018 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August of that year, [[New Belgium Brewing Company]], an iconic, local Fort Collins brewery, donated $4.3 million to put its name and its product on the party deck of the north end zone of the $220 million stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://source.colostate.edu/csu-new-belgium-brewing-craft-agreement-creating-new-belgium-porch-at-on-campus-stadium New Belgium Brewing craft agreement creating New Belgium Porch at on-campus stadium&lt;/ref&gt; This new bar area is called the New Belgium Porch.

On April 19, 2018, CSU announced it had sold the naming rights of the stadium itself to Public Service Credit Union for $37.7 million over 15 years. The actual name was not revealed at that time because PSCU was in the process of adopting a new name,&lt;ref name=Lyell/&gt; which was ultimately revealed on June 5 of that year as Canvas Credit Union. Accordingly, the stadium became Canvas Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://csurams.com/news/2018/6/5/general-canvas-stadium-is-new-name-for-colorado-state-universitys-multipurpose-stadium.aspx |title=Canvas Stadium is new name for Colorado State University’s multipurpose stadium |publisher=Colorado State Rams |date=June 5, 2018 |accessdate=June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''Crucible curse'''" (also known as "'''The curse of the Crucible'''") refers to the fact that no first-time [[snooker]] [[List of world snooker champions|world champion]] has retained his title the following year since the [[World Snooker Championship|tournament]] moved to the [[Crucible Theatre]], [[Sheffield]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=14 April 2006|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2006/04/15/sosnoo15.xml&amp;sSheet=/sport/2006/04/15/ixsport.html|title=Murphy aiming to exorcise the Crucible curse|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=21 April 2007|first=John|last=Dee|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=28 April 2006|url=http://nationmultimedia.com/2006/04/28/sport/sport_30002733.php|title=Cruise for Ebdon as Crucible curse strikes champ|publisher=nationalmultimedia.com|accessdate=21 April 2007|first=John|last=Dee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/snooker/worldchampionships2003/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=snooker/03/04/30/SNOOKER_World_2nd_Nightlead.html|title=Crucible Curse Strikes Ebdon|publisher=Sporting Life|accessdate=21 April 2007|date=30 April 2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052004/http://www.sportinglife.com/snooker/worldchampionships2003/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=snooker%2F03%2F04%2F30%2FSNOOKER_World_2nd_Nightlead.html|archivedate=16 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia's Neil Robertson aiming to break the curse of the Crucible|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/15/neil-robertson-crucible-trump-judd|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=23 April 2011|location=London|first=Jamie|last=Jackson|date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The last player to successfully defend his first world title was [[John Pulman]] in [[1964–68 World Snooker Championships|1964]], when the championship was still decided by challenge matches,&lt;ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/&gt; and the tournament had not yet moved to the Crucible Theatre. Since 1977, 17 world champions have experienced the curse, the most recent being [[Stuart Bingham]] at the [[2016 World Snooker Championship]].

==The curse==
The following first-time champions did not retain their title the following year. Of the seventeen players to have won their first championship at the Crucible Theatre, six lost in their first match as defending champion ([[Terry Griffiths]] in 1980, [[Steve Davis]] in 1982, [[Dennis Taylor]] in 1986, [[Graeme Dott]] in 2007, [[Neil Robertson (snooker player)|Neil Robertson]] in 2011 and [[Stuart Bingham]] in 2016) and only two went on to reach the final: [[Joe Johnson (snooker player)|Joe Johnson]] in 1987 and [[Ken Doherty]] in 1998.

In years not listed above, the title was won by players who had already been world champions, and thus the "curse" did not apply. Four players have won consecutive titles at the Crucible: [[Steve Davis]] (1983–1984 and 1987–1989), [[Stephen Hendry]] (1992–1996), [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] (2012–2013) and [[Mark Selby]] (2016–2017), but only after they experienced the "curse".&lt;ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/22421611|title=Ronnie O'Sullivan beats Barry Hawkins to win fifth World title|first=Ben|last=Dirs|accessdate=6 May 2013|date=6 May 2013|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Crucible==
Even before the World Championship was staged at the Crucible, no player in the modern game successfully defended his first world title. Of all first-time world champions, only three retained their title at the next World Championship: [[Joe Davis]] in [[1928 World Snooker Championship|1928]], his brother [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] in [[1949 World Snooker Championship|1949]] and [[John Pulman]] at his [[1964–68 World Snooker Championships|first challenge match in 1964]].

Additionally, [[Ray Reardon]], [[Alex Higgins]] and [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] won the World Championship before the event was moved to the Crucible in 1977 (and failed to retain it the year after their first title); they all also failed to retain the title after winning it for the first time at the Crucible.

The '''Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval''', formerly the '''John Rose Minnesota Oval''', is an outdoor [[ice rink]] in [[Roseville, Minnesota|Roseville]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]]. It is claimed to be the largest artificial outdoor [[ice skating|skating]] surface in North America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The facility was constructed from June to December 1993.

==Rink==
The rink consists of a {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} [[concrete]] surface (a 400-meter track surrounding an infield ice arena) with {{convert|84|mi}} of embedded cooling tubes and an 800-ton refrigeration system. When the temperature is above {{convert|50|F}}&amp;mdash;the highest temperature at which an icy surface can be maintained&amp;mdash;the concrete surface can be used for [[inline skating]].

==History==
The Oval had its beginnings in 1983, when then-governor [[Rudy Perpich]] dreamed of hosting the [[Olympic Games]]. As part of the bid preparation, a task force was formed to determine locations of new facilities. After years of local efforts, Roseville was selected. The city was awarded state bonding money for the design and construction of a multi-purpose outdoor skating facility, which opened in December 1993. The facility was named after [[John Rose (Minnesota politician)|John Rose]], a Roseville teacher and member of the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Skate the Oval
| url = http://www.skatetheoval.com
| accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval hosted the [[1995 Bandy World Championship]] for men and the [[2006 Women's Bandy World Championship]]. It has also hosted US Speedskating Championships, US Junior Speedskating Championships, American Cup Speedskating, World Cup Speedskating, National Bandy Championships, and Aggressive Skating Association competitions. The [[Minnesota Wild]] held their hockey jersey unveiling at the Oval, and notable visitors have included [[Dan Jansen]], [[Bonnie Blair]], [[Paul Wylie]], and [[Neal Broten]]. The facility is the main training site for the [[United States national bandy team]] and local hockey and speedskating clubs.

Leaks in the cooling system were discovered in 2004, making the season's service uncertain. In June 2005, the [[Guidant|Guidant Foundation]] contributed $500,000 to allow for needed repairs to the facility's refrigeration system. The Oval's official name was changed in recognition of the Foundation's gift and continuing support.

==Events==
The Oval hosts over 100,000 guests each year. Sporting events held there include [[bandy]], [[ice hockey]], [[speed skating]], and recreational ice skating. In summer the Oval becomes the largest skating park in the Midwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Skate the Oval
| url = http://www.skatetheoval.com/page/show/254558-guidant-john-rose-mn-oval| accessdate = 2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ramps are put up for BMX biking, roller hockey, and [[Aggressive inline skating|aggressive skating]]. The track is used for inline skating, and a summer skateboard camp is held for beginning to intermediate skateboarders aged 6–13.
 
I.S.I.-certified ice skating lessons are given by Roseville Skating School in the connected Roseville Ice Arena during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Skate the Oval 
| url = http://www.skatetheoval.com/page/show/254561-roseville-skating-lessons| accessdate = 2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oval also hosts two local speedskating clubs:  
the Greater Minnesota Speedskating Association and the Midway Speedskating Club. Midway Speedskating Club is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing speedskating skills in young skaters. It has produced Olympic athletes and coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title = Midway Speedskating
| url = http://midwayspeedskating.org/news-and-events/| accessdate = 2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A novice speedskating program is put on by the Midway Speedskating Club through the Roseville Parks and Recreation Department for youth aged 4–14.

February 25–27, 2015, the [[Bandy World Championship G-17|Bandy World Championship for girls up to 17]] was organised here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusbandy.ru/news/6702 Чемпионат мира среди девушек (U-17)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2016 Women's Bandy World Championship]] will.

'''The David S. Mack Sports and Exhibition Complex,''' also known as Mack Sports Complex, or just "The Mack" for short, is a 5,023-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Town of Hempstead, New York|Hempstead, New York]]. The arena opened in 1999 and replaced the [[Physical Fitness Center]].

==Basketball==
It is home to the [[Hofstra University]] [[Hofstra Pride|Pride]] men's and women's [[basketball]] [[team]]s, as well as the nationally ranked Pride wrestling team. It hosted the 2000 and 2001 title games of the [[America East Conference]] men's basketball tournaments, and also hosted two Postseason NIT games in 2006 (against Nebraska of the Big Twelve, and Old Dominion of the CAA).  In 2006, Hofstra Arena was renamed the 'David S. Mack Sports and Exhibition Complex'. Hofstra belongs to the CAA (Colonial Athletic Association). Before an overtime loss to [[Drexel University]] in February, the Pride had previously won 28 consecutive regular season home games at the Mack. The Mack was also home to the nation's second longest home win streak (behind [[Gonzaga University]]) in 2006, before the Pride's NIT Quarterfinals loss to [[Old Dominion University]]. Hofstra University Men's Basketball has developed an excellent fan base on Long Island, especially in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], as it continues to have winning seasons year after year.

==Other events==
Hofstra Arena also hosts other events year round, such as college fairs, graduations and Kellenberg Memorial High School's Blue and Gold Sports Night.  "The Mack" also hosted the final Presidential Debate of the 2008 U.S. Presidential election between Republican [[John McCain]] and Democrat [[Barack Obama]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hofstra University Is Agog Over the Presidential Debate on Its Turf|first=Javier C.|last=Hernandez|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/nyregion/15hofstra.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 14, 2008|accessdate=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the town hall format of the second Presidential Debate of the 2012 Presidential election between Republican [[Mitt Romney]] and incumbent President [[Barack Obama]]. On September 26, 2016, it hosted the first Presidential Debate of the 2016 election between Republican [[Donald Trump]] and Democrat [[Hillary Clinton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4877">{{WNBA Awards}}
The '''Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award''' is an annual [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA) award given since the league's [[1997 WNBA season|inaugural season]], to the player who most "exemplifies the ideals of [[sportsmanship]] on the court—ethical behavior, fair play and integrity." This is the same criterion used by the analogous [[NBA Sportsmanship Award]], given by the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] since its [[1995–96 NBA season|1995–96 season]].

Every year, each of the WNBA teams nominates one of its players to compete for this award. From these nominees, a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters vote for first and second place winners of this award. First place selections receive two votes, while second place selections receive one. The player with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.

Since the [[2000 WNBA season]], the award is named for the late [[Kim Perrot]], who helped guide the [[Houston Comets]] to their first two WNBA championships before she died in August, 1999, after suffering from [[cancer]] for seven-month.

Many claim that the partnership will take away from the traditions of the 118-year-old tennis event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|title=Davis Cup revamp plans get mixed response|website=Espn.com|access-date=2018-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523172112/http://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/22595981/davis-cup-revamp-plans-hold-event-one-location-seven-days-november-get-mixed-response|archive-date=2018-05-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a secret meeting held in Orlando, Florida, on August 16, 2018, the changes proposed by Kosmos received a 71 percent approval at the International Tennis Federation annual general meeting.

      <comment>/* Statistics */ including Peyton Manning's achievement in 2003-04 regular season/post-season</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31073">In the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the highest official [[passer rating]] that a quarterback can achieve is 158.3, which is considered a perfect passer rating. To [[Passer rating#NFL|qualify]], a quarterback must attempt at least 10 passes, have zero interceptions, and have minimums of a 77.5% completion percentage, 11.88% touchdown passes percentage, and 12.5 yards per attempt. The passer rating was developed in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-statistics.com/Greats/Century/passer-rating.htm |title=Passer Rating Formula |publisher=Baseball-statistics.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1303 |title=History Release » NFL's Passer Rating |publisher=Profootballhof.com |date=2010-02-07 |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the formula to pre and post-1971 quarterbacks, {{As of|2018|11|df=US|lc=y}}, there have been 60 different players, on 72 occasions, who have achieved a perfect passer rating. Four of these ratings have occurred in the post-season. Seven quarterbacks have achieved the feat more than once: [[Ben Roethlisberger]] and [[Peyton Manning]] have four; [[Kurt Warner]] has three; and [[Craig Morton]], [[Dave Krieg]], [[Ken O'Brien]], and [[Tom Brady]] have two.

Ben Roethlisberger is the only quarterback with multiple perfect ratings in a single regular season, when he achieved the feat twice in 2007. The [[San Francisco 49ers]] had two different quarterbacks achieve a perfect rating in the same season, with [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] (week 7) and [[Joe Montana]] (week 10) both earning perfect ratings. Peyton Manning had one perfect rating in the 2003 regular season and one in the post-season.

[[Drew Bledsoe]], [[Robert Griffin III]], and [[Marcus Mariota]] are the only quarterbacks to achieve a perfect passer rating in their rookie seasons, with Mariota being the only quarterback to post one in his NFL debut.

Four of these performances were in a losing cause, though [[Chad Pennington]] is the only quarterback to play from start to finish and earn both a loss and a perfect rating. Twelve quarterbacks have had a perfect 158.3 passer rating and also [[List of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a passer rating of zero|earned a 0.0]] (lowest) passer rating during their careers: [[Otto Graham]], [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Joe Namath]], [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Len Dawson]], [[Bob Griese]], [[James Harris (quarterback)|James Harris]], [[Bob Lee (quarterback)|Bob Lee]], [[Craig Morton]], [[Dan Fouts]], [[Eli Manning]], and [[Peyton Manning]].

[[Pittsburgh Steelers]] quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] is the latest person to achieve a perfect passer rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=401030729 |title=Panthers vs. Steelers - Box Score - November 8, 2018 |website=ESPN.com |date=2018-11-08 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Only three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating with 30 or more attempts.  Ken O'Brien threw 26-for-32 in his perfect game for a completion rate of 81%, while Kurt Warner threw 24 of 30 in his perfect game for a completion rate of 80% and Jared Goff threw 26 of 33 in his perfect game for a completion rate of 78.8%.  Ryan Tannehill holds the record for completion rate in a perfect game, throwing 18 of 19 for 94.7% in his 2015 perfect game. Chris Chandler has the best rate for a game with at least 20 pass attempts (23 of 26) for 88% completed in his 1995 perfect game.

Only Nick Foles has accomplished a perfect passer rating with seven touchdowns thrown. Two quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating with six touchdowns thrown: Peyton Manning was the first to achieve the record on September 28, 2003 against the New Orleans Saints, while Tom Brady matched the feat on October 21, 2007 against the Miami Dolphins. Thirteen quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect game with only two touchdowns thrown. It is impossible to achieve a perfect game with only one touchdown because of the 10 passing attempt minimum to qualify, combined with the minimum 11.875% touchdown-to-attempted-pass ratio.

Three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating with more than 400 passing yards. Ken O'Brien threw for 431 yards on November 2, 1986 against the Seattle Seahawks. Nick Foles threw for 406 yards on November 3, 2013 against the Oakland Raiders. Jared Goff  threw for 465 yards on September 27, 2018 against the Minnesota Vikings. Only three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect game with fewer than 150 passing yards.  Scott Hunter threw for 138 yards on October 31, 1976 against the New Orleans Saints, Drew Bledsoe threw for 143 yards on December 26, 1993 against the Indianapolis Colts, and Rich Gannon threw for 146 yards on October 15, 1992 against the Detroit Lions.

Only three quarterbacks have accomplished a perfect passer rating in their rookie season. Drew Bledsoe of the New England Patriots achieved it against the Indianapolis Colts on December 26, 1993; Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins did it against the Philadelphia Eagles on November 18, 2012; and Marcus Mariota of the Tennessee Titans did it against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 13, 2015, the first quarterback to do so in his professional debut. Only one QB, Ben Roethlisberger, has accomplished a perfect passer rating twice in one season, against the Ravens on November 5, 2007; and against the St. Louis Rams on December 20, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RoetBe00/gamelog/2007/ |title=Ben Roethlisberger 2007 Game Log |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Peyton Manning had one perfect rating in the 2003 regular season and one in the post-season.

'''Ontario Motor Speedway''' was a motorsport venue located in [[Ontario, California]]. It was the first and only automobile racing facility built to accommodate major races sanctioned by all of the four dominant racing sanctioning bodies: [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] (and now [[IndyCar Series]]) for open-wheel oval car races; [[NASCAR]] for a {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} oval stock car races; [[NHRA]] for drag races; and [[FIA]] for [[Formula One]] road course races. Constructed in less than two years,&lt;ref name=otbst/&gt; the track opened in August 1970 and was considered [[state of the art]] at the time.&lt;ref name=domsp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XVYqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9VMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5869%2C375914 |newspaper=The Dispatch |location=Lexington, North Carolina |last=White |first=Ben |title=Defunct Ontario Motor Speedway lived in the wrong period of history |date=September 5, 2006 |page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ntioao&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JOpWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iu0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1672%2C3236883 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |title=New track is opened at Ontario |date=August 23, 1970 |page=1, sports }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full year of racing included the Indy-style open wheel Inaugural California 500 on September 6, 1970; the [[Miller High Life]] 500 stock car race on February 28, 1971, the Super Nationals drag race on November 21, 1970 and the [[Questor Grand Prix]] on March 28, 1971.  Each of these inaugural races drew attendance second only to their established counterparts, the USAC [[Indianapolis 500]], the NASCAR [[Daytona 500]], the [[NHRA]] [[NHRA U.S. Nationals|U.S. Nationals]], and the U.S. Formula One race at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]].

The track was purchased for real estate development by [[Chevron Land Company]] in late 1980&lt;ref name=ospsol&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fWIlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qKoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3319%2C9290199 |newspaper=The Item |agency=Associated Press |location=Sumter, South Carolina |title=Ontario Speedway sold |date=December 18, 1980 |page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demolished at a cost of $3 million in 1981. It is estimated that the {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} facility, with 155,000 permanent seats and an air-conditioned private stadium club would have a replacement cost in 2009 of over $350 million.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==History==
In the mid-sixties, there were two prior attempts to build "The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] of the West." The first attempt was led by [[National General Corporation]], and the second by the [[Santa Anita Consolidated]] and [[Filmways]] Corporations. The second attempt focused on an 800-acre parcel of land (the [[Cucamonga Winery]]) directly across from the new [[Ontario International Airport]] on the [[San Bernardino Freeway]] ([[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]]), {{convert|40|mi|-1}} east of downtown Los Angeles.

William Loorz CEO of [[Stolte Construction]] Co., one of California's largest commercial construction companies, who had been designated the contractor on the project, sent information on the failed projects to [[David Lockton]], co-founder with [[Chuck Barnes]] of Sports Headliners, a leading sports management firm in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] that acted as agent and manager for most of the [[Formula One]] and Indianapolis-style racing drivers.

Sports Headliners represented most of the leading [[Formula One]] drivers and the winners of the past 10 Indianapolis {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} races. Lockton was convinced that the prior efforts failed for lack of involvement with anyone familiar with the automobile racing community. He flew to Los Angeles in October 1966, met with Stolte and viewed the proposed site which had by then been subdivided into fourteen separate parcels owned by 150 individual owners, many of them [[Hollywood]] celebrities who had bought the land for tax shelters.

Lockton spent the next nine months acquiring options on all of the fourteen parcels and then leveraged his position as the drivers’ representative on the board of [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] (United States Auto Club) the sanctioning body for the [[Indianapolis 500]] race; and his personal friendship with [[Tony Hulman]], owner of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] to obtain not only the promise of a USAC sanctioned {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} race, but also the commitment and involvement of Indianapolis Motor Speedway personnel. He obtained the first and only IRS ruling to allow tax deductibility of the $25.5 million industrial revenue bond offering secured by the real estate, in which the facility would be run by a for-profit operating company.

Lockton convinced leading bond investment banker [[John Nuveen &amp; Co.]] in [[Chicago]] as well as [[Citi Securities]] Corporation in Indianapolis to underwrite the bond offering. He also raised $5 million in equity from [[Pioneer Lands]] Corp.; [[Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette]]; and Stolte Construction Company; with Lockton and these three entities owning the speedway in more or less equal proportions. California born architect Walter Ted Tyler was retained by Stolte to design the state-of-the-art facility. Track management planned to make OMS as a replica of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway with many important enhancements. The racing surface was one lane wider and, unlike the Indy speedway, the short chutes (the two shorter straight-aways, at either end of the track) were banked, which made OMS slightly faster.

In addition, OMS was built with an infield road course, making it a facility for both oval and road course style racing in addition to drag racing. At the time, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, familiarly known as "The Brickyard" did not have an infield road course and one was not built there until 2000. The Indianapolis track, which was first built in 1909, was originally paved at great expense with 3.2 million paving bricks. Today, 3 feet (0.91 m) of original bricks remain at the start/finish line, still giving meaning to "The Brickyard". To symbolize Hulman's gesture of friendship with Lockton and support for the "Indy of the West," he provided a special gift from Indy: a circle of the original bricks from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway were laid in OMS's Victory Lane.

The Ontario Motor Speedway introduced many innovations to the sport of automobile racing and is attributed as being the facility that started the boom in development of similar super speedways which made automobile racing track ownership one of the highest growth segments from 1980 to 2005. Ontario pioneered a private stadium club with annual memberships, corporate suites, crash absorbent retaining walls and safety fences, the first pro-am celebrity race, state-of-the-art modern garage facilities for the race teams, and a computerized real-time timing and scoring system which showed in real-time the positions on the track to spectators during the race. This timing and scoring system was subsequently adopted by the Formula One circuit and ultimately by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

During the 22-month construction period, speedway management negotiated the required race dates from the rival sanctioning bodies, convincing the [[FIA]] (Federation Internationale de L’Automobile) to allow a second U.S. Grand Prix in 1972, contingent upon conducting a qualifying race (the Questor Grand Prix) in 1971.

OMS was the first automobile race facility to launch a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign based on extensive market research. The research indicated that in order to attract more than the approximately 50,000 hardcore racing fans in Southern California it would be necessary to convince the non-racing fan of the new speedway's safety to overcome their fears of seeing a terrible accident; to position the facility as a clean, safe, fun place to take the family, and a place to rub elbows with Hollywood stars, astronauts and other celebrities. The speedway launched a radio, billboard and newspaper advertising campaign, developed by the Los Angeles-based [[Campbell Ewald]] Agency, in December 1969, promoting the California 500 as "the place for the family to be for their Labor Day weekend" nine months later.

Legendary Hollywood PR agent, [[Warren Cowan]] of the [[Rogers &amp; Cowan]] Public Relations agency heavily promoted the Hollywood community and the astronauts’ interest in the sport and involvement with the track. During races the suites were full of celebrities, including [[Paul Newman]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Dick Smothers]], [[John Wayne]], [[James Garner]] and [[Ina Balin]], as well as many astronauts, including [[Pete Conrad]]. The dedication of the track occurred in August 1970 with the staging of the first Celebrity Pro-Am Race, featuring many stars from the entertainment industry paired with professional, race winning drivers. The Celebrity Pro-Am race was subsequently aired as a TV special on NBC.

The speedway Board of Directors when the track opened consisted of Chairman [[Dan Lufkin]], of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette; CEO David Lockton; Donald Riehl, of DLJ; William Loorz, CEO of Stolte Construction; Paul Newman, Kirk Douglas, and Dick Smothers from the entertainment industry; [[J.C. Agajanian]], an American motor sport promoter and race car owner; [[Parnelli Jones]], 1963 winner of the Indianapolis 500; [[Roger Penske]], retired race car driver, race car owner and auto related business entrepreneur; [[Briggs Cunningham]], an American sportsman who raced cars and yachts; and Chuck Barnes, Chairman and CEO of Sports Headliners, and former Director of Public Relations for Firestone Tires.

The advertising campaign was so successful that all reserved seats were completely sold out over six weeks before the Inaugural California 500. The 178,000 in paid attendance and $3.3 million gross remained the largest crowd and highest gross in inflation adjusted dollars of any single day sporting event other than the Indianapolis 500 for nearly three decades. California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] presented the trophy to race winner, Jim McElreath, a teammate of car owner, [[A. J. Foyt]]. President [[Richard M. Nixon]] was represented at the event by his daughter [[Tricia Nixon Cox|Tricia Nixon]], and her husband, Ed Cox.

The second event, the [[Mattel]] [[Hot Wheels]] Super Nationals Drag Race on November 20, drew a crowd second only to the NHRA Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana and the Ontario drag strip proved to be the fastest ever with many world records set. The NASCAR sanctioned Miller High Life {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} stock car race on February 28, 1971, drew a crowd of 80,000 and was the third largest crowd to see the first low bank 2-1/2 mile oval {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} stock car race, and the third largest attendance for a stock car race behind the [[Daytona 500]] and the [[AMP Energy Juice 500|Talladega 500]]. The [[Questor Grand Prix]], won by [[Mario Andretti]] on March 28, 1971 was a head-to-head battle between European drivers using Formula One cars against the U.S. [[Formula 5000]] series. This format was a precondition to receipt of a second FIA sanctioned U.S. Grand Prix. The crowd of only 55,000, while the largest to attend a road race in California, was a disappointment.

From a racing standpoint, the inaugural season was a tremendous success and from an attendance standpoint only the hybrid Questor Grand Prix was a disappointment. In April, 1971, Lockton resigned as CEO from Ontario (as well as from Sports Headliners) to pursue non-automobile racing related interests and was replaced as CEO by Ray Smartis, the Vice President and General Manager. Despite the speedway's commercial success in building attendance for each event and the clear potential for future profitability, in the short term, the operating company had difficulty meeting its debt service obligations on the municipal bonds, primarily due to the shortfall of the hybrid Questor Grand Prix race and a downturn in California 500 attendance in year two.

The advertising campaign for the Inaugural California 500 had guaranteed seat purchasers seat renewal rights in perpetuity if they paid for them within 30 days of the last race. Over 20% of the seats for the second 1972 Cal 500 event were sold on this promotion, providing OMS with almost $800,000 in advance ticket sales. Rather than a sustained campaign, the advertising or promotional money was not spent on the 1972 race until only a few weeks before the event and attendance was marginally down approximately 30,000 in the second year. In 1973 the operating company was sold and in a "Hail Mary" attempt to make the debt service payments the new operators devised a strategy to stage two California 500 races in one fiscal year. For the third California 500, the established and popular Labor Day date was sacrificed for a March 10 date, despite the evidence from extensive original market, traffic and weather research that Labor Day weekend was by a considerable margin the date with the largest potential attendance. The March crowds never approached the attendance of the [[Labor Day]] event and the new operator ultimately defaulted on the debt service.&lt;ref name=futremcl&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zRAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nHIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5034%2C2556829 |newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |agency=Associated Press |title=Ontario Motor Speedway future remains cloudy |date=March 12, 1975 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jshgrp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AFlUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1o4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1906%2C4878463 |newspaper=Daily Record |agency=UPI |location=Ellensburg, WA |title=Jones says his group will terminate Ontario lease |date=March 27, 1975 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events==
Attempts were made to provide revenue by holding other events and concerts to promote the track venue more.

On February 28, 1971, OMS promoted and staged motorcycle daredevil [[Evel Knievel]]'s record jump over 19 cars, drawing a crowd of 50,000 in paid attendance on the day prior to the NASCAR sanctioned Miller High Life 500 mile stock car race. The jump was filmed as the climactic scene in the movie ''[[Evel Knievel (film)|Evel Knievel]]'', starring [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]], which was filmed in and around the race track during that weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evelknievel.com/evel-timeline |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206084217/http://evelknievel.com/evel-timeline |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jam I ad.jpg|100px|thumb|right|California Jam Promotional ad]]
[[California Jam]] was held on April 6, 1974. This [[rock festival]] concert drew a crowd of 300-400,000, the largest paid attendance for a rock concert. Portions of the concert were televised live on ABC. The performers included (in order of appearance) [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Seals and Crofts]], [[Black Oak Arkansas]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]] and [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]].

[[California Jam II]] was held on March 18, 1978. The second event drew a crowd of almost 300,000 paid attendance.  Performers included [[Ted Nugent]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Dave Mason]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]], [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Mick Fleetwood]], [[Mahogany Rush]] and [[Rubicon]].

By 1980, the Ontario Motor Speedway bonds were selling at approximately $0.30 on the dollar. Generally unknown and unrealized by the bond holding public, the {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of land originally purchased at an average price of $7,500 per acre, had now risen to a value of $150,000 per acre. Chevron Land Company, a division of [[Chevron Corporation]] recognized the opportunity to acquire the bonds and effectively foreclosed on the real estate. For approximately $10 million, Chevron acquired land which had a commercial real estate development value of $120 million, without regard to the historic significance or future potential of the speedway.

==Subsequent development==
Many of the grandstands and other infrastructure were sold off to other venues.  Section 10 and Section 20 (the grandstands on the east side of the arena) at the [[Paso Robles Event Center]]  (AKA The California Midstate Fair) in [[Paso Robles, Ca]] were constructed from grandstands removed from the speedway.  Also several ticket booths were relocated from the speedway to the fair grounds.

The property remained vacant for several years until the mid-1980s when a [[Hilton Hotel]] was built on turn 4 of the old speedway site. It was the first multiple-story building of its kind in the City of Ontario.

As of the mid-2000s, development on the property has increased. Over half of the old speedway property, adjacent to [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]], has been developed commercially. However, a minor tribute to the racing heritage of the property can be seen in the street names of the developed area (ex: Duesenburg Drive, Ferrari Lane, and others), in much the same way that the developed area that was formerly Riverside International Raceway reflects the same heritage, with roads named after famous drivers.

In 2007, much of the remainder of the property became [[Piemonte]], a mixed-use development with condominiums, business offices, and some retail stores. In the fall of 2008, the centerpiece of Piemonte opened: the [[Citizens Business Bank Arena]], an 11,000-seat sports and entertainment venue.  The arena is home to the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] [[Ontario Reign (AHL)|Ontario Reign]], and is built in the general area of Turn 3 of the old Ontario track.

The [[Ontario Mills]] is located to the east, across the street from the former site of the Ontario Motor Speedway.

==Subsequent racing events==
After the failure of the California 500, the IndyCar series replaced the race with the Michigan 500 at [[Michigan International Speedway]]. Eight years later in 1988, [[Riverside International Raceway]] (in nearby [[Riverside, California]]) was also sold and demolished in favor of development.

In 1997, the [[Auto Club Speedway]] opened in [[Fontana, California|Fontana]], less than {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the former site of the OMS, and the two names were sometimes confused. (The California track was called the ''California Speedway'' before a naming rights deal was signed in February 2008.)

OMS architect Walter Ted Tyler later designed the [[Olympic Velodrome (Carson, California)|Olympic Velodrome]] for the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics in Los Angeles]] where many world [[bicycling]] records were broken.

'''Operation "Wrath of God"''' ({{lang-he|מבצע זעם האל}} ''Mivtza Za'am Ha'el''), also known as '''Operation "Bayonet"''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4605414.stm Munich: Operation Bayonet], ''BBC'', January 16, 2006. Retrieved August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[covert operation]] directed by the [[Mossad]] to assassinate individuals involved in the 1972 [[Munich massacre]] in which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were killed. The targets were members of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] armed militant group [[Black September (group)|Black September]] and operatives of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO).  Authorized by [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Golda Meir]] in the autumn of 1972, the operation is believed to have continued for over twenty years.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

The operation was depicted in the television film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]'' (1986) and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' (2005).

== History ==

Two days after the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], Israel retaliated by [[1972 Israeli air raid in Syria and Lebanon|bombing ten PLO bases in Syria and Lebanon]]. Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] created Committee X, a small group of government officials tasked with formulating an Israeli response, with herself and [[Defense Minister of Israel|Defense Minister]] [[Moshe Dayan]] at the head. She also appointed General [[Aharon Yariv]] as her Advisor on [[Counterterrorism]]; he, along with [[Mossad]] Director [[Zvi Zamir]], took the principal role in directing the ensuing operation. The committee came to the conclusion that, to deter future violent incidents against Israel, they needed to assassinate those who had supported or carried out the Munich massacre, and in dramatic fashion. 

Pressured by Israeli public opinion and top intelligence officials, Meir reluctantly authorized the beginning of the broad [[assassination campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 152–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet when the three surviving perpetrators of the massacre were [[Munich massacre#Aftermath|released just months later]] by West Germany in compliance with the demands of the [[Lufthansa Flight 615|hijackers of Lufthansa Flight 615]], any remaining ambivalence she felt was removed.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's first task for Israeli intelligence was to draw up an assassination list of all those involved in Munich. This was accomplished with the aid of [[PLO]] operatives working for Mossad, and with information provided by friendly European intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Morris, 381.&lt;/ref&gt; While the contents of the entire list are unknown, reports put the final number of targets at 20–35, a mix of Black September and PLO elements.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Reeve states that intelligence sources put the number at 20 (Reeve, 162), while Ostrovsky puts it at 35 (Ostrovsky, 179).&lt;/ref&gt; Once this was complete, Mossad was charged with locating the individuals and assassinating them.

Critical in the planning was the idea of [[plausible deniability]], that it should be impossible to prove a direct connection between the assassinations and Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/eprint/calahan.htm Countering Terrorism: The Israeli Response To The 1972 Munich Olympic Massacre And The Development Of Independence Covert Action Teams], M.A. thesis by Alexander B. Calahan at Marine Corps Command and Staff College, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the operations were more generally intended to terrorize Palestinian militants. According to [[David Kimche]], former deputy head of Mossad, "The aim was not so much revenge but mainly to make them [the Palestinian terrorists] frightened. We wanted to make them look over their shoulders and feel that we are upon them. And therefore we tried not to do things by just shooting a guy in the street – that's easy ... fairly."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/t-z/titfortat5.html Quoted by Britain's Channel 4]. Channel4.com. Retrieved on May 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also known that Mossad agent [[Michael Harari]] led the creation and direction of the teams,&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 161.&lt;/ref&gt; although some may not have always been under government responsibility. Author [[Simon Reeve (UK television presenter)|Simon Reeve]] explains that the Mossad team{{spaced ndash}}whose squad names are letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]{{spaced ndash}}consisted of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...fifteen people divided into five squads: "[[Hebrew alphabet|Aleph]]", two trained killers; "[[Hebrew alphabet|Bet]]", two guards who would shadow the Alephs; "[[Hebrew alphabet|Het]]", two agents who would establish cover for the rest of the team by renting hotel rooms, apartments, cars, and so on; "[[Hebrew alphabet|Ayin]]", comprising between six and eight agents who formed the backbone of the operation, shadowing targets and establishing an escape route for the Aleph and Bet squads; and "[[Hebrew alphabet|Qoph]]", two agents specializing in communications.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is similar to former Mossad ''[[katsa]]'' [[Victor Ostrovsky]]'s description of Mossad's own assassination teams, the [[Kidon]]. In fact, Ostrovsky says in his book that it was Kidon units that performed the assassinations.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrovsky, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by author [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]] who was given access to the debriefing reports submitted by the eight Kidon and 80 member backup team that were involved in the assassinations.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Another report by author [[Aaron J. Klein]] says that these teams were actually part of a unit called Caesarea, which would be renamed and reorganized into Kidon in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 107 &amp; 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Harari eventually commanded three Caesarea teams of around 12 members each. They were each further divided into logistics, surveillance, and assassination squads.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the covert teams was revealed in the aftermath of the [[Lillehammer affair]] (see [[#Ali Hassan Salameh|Ali Hassan Salameh]] section below), when six members of the Mossad assassination team were arrested by Norwegian authorities. Harari escaped to Israel, and it is possible that others were able to evade capture with him. An article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine immediately after the killing put the total number of Mossad personnel at 15,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903989,00.html Fatal Error]", ''Time'', August 6, 1973. Retrieved June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which would also be similar to the above descriptions.

A markedly different account comes from the book ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', where the author states that according to his source, Mossad set up a five-man unit of trained intelligence personnel which he [the source] led in Europe. The book also says that the team operated outside of direct government control, and that its only communications were with Harari.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Several hours before each assassination, each target's family received flowers with a condolence card reading: "A reminder we do not forget we do not forgive."&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/we-know-where-you-live/2006/01/13/1137118970193.html?page=1 We know where you live] [[Sydney Morning Herald]] January 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==

===1972–1988===
The first assassination occurred on October 16, 1972, when Palestinian [[Wael Zwaiter]] was killed in Rome. Mossad agents had been waiting for him to return from dinner, and shot him twelve times.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/olympics-massacre-munich--the-real-story-524011.html|title=Olympics Massacre: Munich - The real story|work=The Independent|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the shooting, they were spirited away to a [[safe house]]. At the time Zwaiter was the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] representative in Italy, and while Israel privately claimed he was a member of Black September and was involved in a failed plot against an [[El Al]] airliner, members of the PLO argued that he was in no way connected. [[Salah Khalaf|Abu Iyad]], deputy-chief of the PLO, stated that Zwaiter was "energetically" against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Kameel B. ''Arab and Israeli Terrorism: The Causes and Effects of Political Violence, 1936–1993''. McFarland &amp; Company, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7864-0280-6}} p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The second target of Mossad was Mahmoud Hamshari, the PLO representative in France. Israel believed that he was the leader of Black September in France. Using an agent posing as an Italian journalist, Mossad lured him from his apartment in Paris to allow a demolition team to enter and install a bomb underneath a desk telephone. On December 8, 1972, the agent posing as a journalist phoned Hamshari's apartment and asked if he was speaking to Hamshari. After Hamshari identified himself, the agent signalled to other colleagues, who then sent a detonation signal down the telephone line, causing the bomb to explode. Hamshari was mortally wounded in the explosion, but managed to remain conscious long enough to tell detectives what had happened. Hamshari died in a hospital several weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; He had given an interview a day after the hostage crisis, saying he was not worried for his life, but did not want to "taunt the devil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tauriac|first1=Michel|title=Attentat représentant OLP à Paris|url=http://www.ina.fr/video/CAF97512594/attentat-representant-olp-a-paris-video.html|website=ina.fr|publisher=Office national de radiodiffusion télévision française|accessdate=July 1, 2015|date=December 8, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossad did not comment on the fact that Hamsari was connected to the attack of Munich.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; This assassination was the first in a series of Mossad assassinations that took place in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleurot|first1=Grégoire|title=La France, théâtre historique des assassinats politiques|url=http://www.slate.fr/story/67185/france-assassinats-politiques-kurdes|website=Slate|accessdate=July 1, 2015|date=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another assassination took place in London, where a Palestinian activist was expertly pushed under a bus during [[rush hour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first= Gordon|title=Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of January 24, 1973, Hussein Al Bashir ([[Jordan]]ian), the [[Fatah]] representative in [[Cyprus]], turned off the lights in his Olympic Hotel room in [[Nicosia]]. Moments later, a bomb planted under his bed was remotely detonated, killing him and destroying the room. Israel believed him to be the head of Black September in Cyprus, though another reason for his assassination may have been his close ties with the [[KGB]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 1973, Basil al-Kubaissi, a law professor at the [[American University of Beirut]] suspected by Israel of providing arms logistics for Black September as well as being involved in other Palestinian plots,&lt;ref name="Reeve, 169"&gt;Reeve, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; was gunned down in Paris while returning home from dinner. As in previous assassinations, he was shot around 12 times by two Mossad agents.

Three of the targets on the Mossad's list lived in heavily guarded houses in [[Lebanon]] that were beyond the reach of previous assassination methods. In order to assassinate them, [[1973 Israeli raid on Lebanon|Operation Spring of Youth]] was launched as a sub-operation of the larger "Wrath of God" campaign. On the night of April 9, 1973, [[Sayeret Matkal]], [[Shayetet 13]], and [[Sayeret Tzanhanim]] commandos landed on the coast of Lebanon in Zodiac speedboats launched from [[Israeli Navy]] missile boats offshore. The commandos were met by [[Mossad]] agents, who drove them to their targets in cars rented the previous day, and later drove them back to the beaches for extraction. The commandos were disguised as civilians, and some were dressed as women. In [[Beirut]], they raided guarded apartment buildings and killed [[Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar]] (Operations leader in Black September), Kamal Adwan (a Chief of Operations in the PLO) and [[Kamal Nasser]] (PLO Executive Committee member and spokesman). During the operation, two Lebanese police officers, an Italian citizen, and Najjar's wife were also killed. One Israeli commando was wounded. Sayeret Tzanhanim paratroopers raided a six-story building that served as the headquarters of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. The paratroopers met strong resistance and lost two soldiers, but managed to destroy the building. Shayetet 13 naval commandos and Sayeret Tzanhanim paratroopers also raided PLO arms-manufacturing facilities and fuel dumps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/opspring.html Operation Spring of Youth]. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org (April 9, 1973). Retrieved on May 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 12–100 PLO and PFLP members were killed during the attacks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Three attacks quickly followed the Lebanon operation. Zaiad Muchasi, the replacement for Hussein Al Bashir in Cyprus, was killed by a bomb in his [[Athens]] hotel room on April 11. Two minor Black September members, Abdel Hamid Shibi and Abdel Hadi Nakaa, were seriously injured when their car was bombed in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossad agents also began to follow [[Mohammad Boudia]], the [[Algeria]]n-born director of operations for Black September in France, who was known for his disguises and womanizing. On June 28, 1973, Boudia was killed in Paris by a pressure-activated bomb packed with heavy nuts and bolts placed under his car seat.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 1979, two Palestinians, Ali Salem Ahmed and Ibrahim Abdul Aziz, were killed in Cyprus. According to police, both men were shot with silenced weapons at point-blank range.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"&gt;[http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter23_2of2.htm Chapter 2: Encyclopedia of the Palestine Problem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322211814/http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter23_2of2.htm |date=March 22, 2012 }}. Palestine-encyclopedia.com. Retrieved on May 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 1982, two senior PLO members in Italy were killed in separate attacks. Nazeyh Mayer, a leading figure in the PLO's Rome office, was shot dead outside his home. Kamal Husain, deputy director of the PLO office in Rome, was killed by a shrapnel bomb placed under the back seat of his car as he drove home, less than seven hours after he had visited the home of Mayer and helped the police in their investigation.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt;

On July 23, 1982, Fadl Dani, deputy director of the PLO office in Paris, was killed by a bomb that had been placed in his car. On August 21, 1983, PLO official Mamoun Meraish was killed in his car in [[Athens]] by two Mossad operatives who shot him from a motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/world/palestinian-shot-dead-by-gunmen-in-athens.html|title=Palestinian Shot Dead By Gunmen in Athens|date=August 21, 1983|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 1986, Khaled Ahmed Nazal, Secretary-General of the PLO's [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine|DFLP]] faction, was gunned down outside a hotel in Athens, Greece. Nazal was shot four times in the head.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt; On October 21, 1986, Munzer Abu Ghazala, a senior PLO official and member of the [[Palestinian National Council]], was killed by a bomb as he drove through a suburb of Athens.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynet.co.il/english/0,7340,L-3550277,00.html הודעת שגיאה – דף הבית]. ynet (June 20, 1995).

On February 14, 1988, a car bomb exploded in [[Limassol]], Cyprus, killing Palestinians Abu Al Hassan Qasim and Hamdi Adwan, and wounding Marwan Kanafami.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt;

===Ali Hassan Salameh===
Mossad continued to search for [[Ali Hassan Salameh]], nicknamed the Red Prince, who was the head of [[Force 17]] and the Black September operative believed by Israel to be the mastermind behind the Munich massacre. This belief has since been challenged by accounts of senior Black September officials, who say that while he was involved in many attacks in Europe, Salameh was not at all connected with the events in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a full year after Munich, Mossad believed they had finally located Salameh in the small Norwegian town [[Lillehammer]]. On July 21, 1973, in what would become known as the [[Lillehammer affair]], a team of Mossad agents shot and killed [[Ahmed Bouchiki]], a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] waiter unrelated to the Munich attack and Black September, after an informant mistakenly identified Bouchiki as Salameh. Six Mossad agents, including two women, were arrested by local police, while others, including the team leader, Michael Harari, managed to escape back to Israel. Five of the captured were convicted of the killing and imprisoned, but were released and returned to Israel in 1975. Victor Ostrovsky claimed that Salameh was instrumental in leading Mossad off course by feeding it false information about his whereabouts.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrovsky, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1974, Mossad agents covertly deployed to Switzerland after receiving information that Salameh would meet PLO leaders in a church on January 12. Two assassins entered the church at the time of the meeting, and encountered three men who appeared to be Arab. One of them made a move for his weapon, and all three were then immediately shot and killed. The Mossad agents continued into the church to search for Salameh, but did not find him. In a short time, the decision was made to abort the mission and escape.&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;Hunter, Thomas B. – ''Wrath of God: The Israeli Response to the 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward, three Mossad operatives travelled to London to meet with a source who offered information on Salameh. When the source failed to show up, the team members began suspecting they were under surveillance. A female assassin-for-hire seduced one of the agents in a hotel, then shot him dead in his hotel room. The Mossad team members located the woman in [[Amsterdam]] three months later, and she was killed near her home on August 21 after she instinctively reached for a weapon as the team approached her. Local sources revealed that she was a freelance assassin, and it was never learned who exactly contracted her to kill the agent. The kidon team leader was later reprimanded for acting outside the assigned scope of the mission.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; One of the team members said, "most of our victims plead for their lives before being killed but not this woman. She was different. She didn't plead. She looked us all directly in the eye with cold detached hatred. Her face reflected nothing but disdain and defiance before we killed her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panachereport.com/channels/more%20short%20stories/1stFemAssassin.htm|title=1st Fem Assassin|publisher=|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panachereport.com/Spycraft.htm|title=Spycraft Myra Panache Report|publisher=|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=November 2016}}

Following the incident, operation commander [[Michael Harari]] ordered the mission to kill Salameh be aborted. The kidon team, however, elected to ignore the order and try one more time to kill Salameh. Intelligence placed Salameh at a house in [[Tarifa]], Spain. As three agents moved toward the house, they were approached by an Arab security guard. The guard raised an [[AK-47]] assault rifle, and was immediately shot. The operation was aborted, and the team escaped to a safe house.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the Lillehammer affair, international outrage prompted Golda Meir to order the suspension of Operation "Wrath of God".&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Norwegian investigation and revelations by the captured agents compromised Mossad assets across Europe, including safe houses, agents, and operational methods.&lt;ref&gt;Black, 276–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, it was decided to recommence the operation under new Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], and find those on the list still at large.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossad began surveillance of Salameh's movements after tracking him to [[Beirut]] during late autumn of 1978. In November 1978, a female Mossad agent identifying herself as [[Erika Chambers]] entered Lebanon with a [[British passport]] issued in 1975, and rented an apartment on the Rue Verdun, a street frequently used by Salameh. Several other agents arrived, including two using the pseudonyms Peter Scriver and Roland Kolberg, traveling with British and [[Canadian passport]]s respectively. Some time after their arrival a [[Volkswagen]] packed with plastic explosives was parked along Rue Verdun within view of the rented apartment. At 3:35&amp;nbsp;p.m. on January 22, 1979, as Salameh and four bodyguards drove down the street in a [[Chevrolet]] station wagon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter32_2of2.htm Chapter 8: Encyclopedia of the Palestine Problem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112718/http://www.palestine-encyclopedia.com/EPP/Chapter32_2of2.htm |date=September 27, 2011 }}.

However, the blast also killed four innocent bystanders, including a British student and a German nun, and injured 18 other people in the vicinity. Immediately following the operation the three Mossad officers fled without trace, as well as up to 14 other agents believed to have been involved in the operation.&lt;ref name="Time 1979"/&gt;

===Munich hostage-takers===
Three of the eight terrorists that carried out the [[Munich massacre]] survived the botched German rescue attempt at [[Fürstenfeldbruck]] airbase on September 6, 1972 and were taken into German custody: [[Jamal Al-Gashey]], Adnan Al-Gashey, and Mohammed Safady. On October 29, they were released in exchange for the hostages onboard hijacked [[Lufthansa Flight 615]] and travelled to Libya, where they went into hiding.&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenfeter|first=Yael|title=Israel in shock as Munich killers freed|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/israel-in-shock-as-munich-killers-freed-1.322811|accessdate=July 26, 2013|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been thought that Adnan Al-Gashey and Mohammed Safady were both assassinated by Mossad several years after the massacre; Al-Gashey was found after making contact with a cousin in a [[Persian Gulf|Gulf State]], and Safady was found by remaining in touch with family in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 188.&lt;/ref&gt; This account was challenged by Aaron J. Klein, who wrote that Adnan died of heart failure in the 1970s and that Safady was  killed by Christian [[Kataeb Party|Phalangists]] in Lebanon in the early 1980s. However, in July 2005, PLO veteran Tawfiq Tirawi told Klein that Safady, whom Tirawi claimed as a close friend, was "as alive as you are."&lt;ref name="Time 2005"&gt;Beyer, Lisa.

===Other actions===
Along with direct assassinations, Mossad used a variety of other means to respond to the Munich massacre and deter future terrorist action. Mossad engaged in a campaign of [[mailbomb|letter bombs]] against Palestinian officials across Europe.&lt;ref name="Ostrovsky 180"/&gt; Historian [[Benny Morris]] writes that these attacks caused non-fatal injuries to their targets, which included persons in [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]], Palestinian student activists in [[Bonn]] and [[Copenhagen]], and a [[Red Crescent]] official in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Klein also cites an incident in [[Cairo]] where a bomb malfunctioned, sparing the two Palestinian targets.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Mossad ''katsa'' [[Victor Ostrovsky]] claimed that Mossad also used [[psychological warfare]] tactics such as running obituaries of still-living militants and sending highly detailed personal information to others.&lt;ref name="Ostrovsky 180"&gt;Ostrovsky, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Reeve further stated that Mossad would call junior Palestinian officials, and after divulging to them their personal information, would warn them to disassociate from any Palestinian cause.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 167.&lt;/ref&gt; British intelligence writer [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]] wrote that hours before each militant was killed, his family would receive flowers and a condolences card bearing the words "A reminder we do not forget or forgive". Thomas further claimed that after each killing, Mossad's psychological warfare department leaked notices about the dead militant to Arabic-language newspapers throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first= Gordon|title=Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad|page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other assassinations===
Several assassinations or assassination attempts have been attributed to the "Wrath of God" campaign, although doubt exists as to whether Mossad was behind them, with breakaway Palestinian factions being suspected of carrying them out. The first such assassination occurred on January 4, 1978, when [[Said Hammami]], the PLO representative in London, was shot and killed. The assassination is suspected of being the work of either Mossad or the [[Abu Nidal Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayoob, Mohammed. ''The Middle East in World Politics'' (1981), page 90&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 1978, Ezzedine Kalak, chief of the PLO's Paris bureau, and his deputy Hamad Adnan, were killed at their offices in the [[Arab League]] building. Three other members of the Arab League and PLO staff were wounded.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt; This attack was either the work of Mossad or the Abu Nidal Organization. On July 27, 1979. [[Zuheir Mohsen]], head of PLO military operations, was gunned down in [[Cannes]], France, just after leaving a casino. Responsibility for the attack has been placed by various sources on Mossad, other Palestinians, and possibly [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 1, 1981, Naim Khader, the PLO representative in Belgium, was assassinated in [[Brussels]]. Officials at the PLO information and liaison office in Brussels issued a statement accusing Israel of being behind the killing.&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt; [[Abu Daoud]], a Black September commander who openly claimed to have helped plan the Munich attack, was shot multiple times on August 1, 1981 by a gunman in a [[Warsaw]] hotel cafe. Daoud survived the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 212&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this was done by Mossad or another breakaway Palestinian faction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wolff |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Wolff |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/08/20/sb3/ |title=Striking Back |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |issue=August 26, 2002 |accessdate=June 20, 2006 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daoud claimed that the attack was carried out by a Palestinian double agent for Mossad, who was killed by the PLO ten years later. On March 1, 1982, PLO official Nabil Wadi Aranki was killed in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref name="chapter 8"/&gt; On June 8, 1992 PLO head of intelligence [[Atef Bseiso]] was shot and killed in Paris by two gunmen with [[Suppressor|suppressed]] weapons.

== Reactions ==

===Black September response===
Black September did attempt and carry out a number of attacks and hostage takings against Israel.

Similar to the Mossad letter-bomb campaign, dozens of letter bombs were sent from [[Amsterdam]] to Israeli diplomatic posts around the world in September and October 1972. One such attack killed [[Ami Shachori]], an Israeli Agricultural Counselor in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906443,00.html?internalid=ACA And Now, Mail-a-Death], ''Time'', October 2, 1972. Accessed September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempted assassination of Golda Meir in Rome====
A terrorist operation was planned by Black September when it learned that Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] would be travelling to Rome to meet with [[Pope Paul VI]] in January 1973. The planned visit was placed under a regimen of strict secrecy in Israel, and news of the upcoming visit was probably leaked by a pro-Palestinian priest in the Vatican [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first= Gordon|title=Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black September commander [[Ali Hassan Salameh]] began planning a missile attack against Meir's plane as it arrived in Rome. Salameh's goal was to kill not only Meir, but also key cabinet ministers and senior Mossad officers accompanying her. At the time, Salameh was negotiating with the [[Soviet Union]], asking for safe haven, and he hoped that by the time Israel recovered from this blow, he and his men would be in the Soviet Union and out of Israel's reach. Black September smuggled several shoulder-launched [[Strela 2|Strela 2 missiles]] to [[Bari, Italy|Bari]], Italy, from [[Dubrovnik]], [[Yugoslavia]], by boat. The missiles were then smuggled to Rome and positioned around [[Fiumicino Airport]] shortly before Meir's arrival. To divert Mossad's vigilance away from Rome in the run-up to the attack, Salameh planned a terrorist attack on the Israeli embassy in [[Bangkok]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first= Gordon|title=Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 1972, four Black September members took over the Israeli embassy in Bangkok, holding 12 hostages. They raised the PLO flag over the building, and threatened to kill the hostages unless 36 PLO prisoners were released. The building was surrounded by Thai troops and police. The option of a rescue operation was considered in Israel but ruled out. A rescue operation was considered a logistical impossibility, and it was also thought that as the embassy was in busy central Bangkok, the Thai government would never allow the possibility of a shootout to occur. Though their demands were not met, negotiations secured the release of all the hostages and the Black September militants were given safe passage to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=1047 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base]. Retrieved August 18, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030930/http://www.tkb.org/Incident.jsp?incID=1047 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossad found out about the plan to assassinate Golda Meir on January 14, 1973, when a local volunteer informed Mossad that he had handled two telephone calls from a payphone in an apartment block where PLO members sometimes stayed. The calls were in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which he spoke. Speaking in code, the caller stated that it was "time to deliver the birthday candles for the celebration". Mossad Director-General [[Zvi Zamir]] was convinced that this was a coded order connected to an upcoming attack. Zamir had been convinced that the Bangkok embassy raid was a diversion for a larger attack, due to the participants in the raid having so easily given up, something he did not expect from a group as well-trained, financed, strategically cunning, and motivated as Black September. Zamir further interpreted that "birthday candles" could refer to weapons, and the most likely one with a candle connotation was a rocket. Zamir linked the possible upcoming missile attack with Meir's upcoming arrival, and guessed that Black September was planning to shoot down Meir's plane. Zamir then sent a Mossad ''[[katsa]]'', or field intelligence officer, to Rome, and travelled to the city with a team of Mossad officers. Zamir met with the head of [[Divisione Investigazioni Generali e Operazioni Speciali|DIGOS]], the Italian anti-terrorism unit, and laid out his concerns. DIGOS  officers raided the apartment blocks from where the calls had been made, and found a Russian instruction manual for launching missiles. Throughout the night, DIGOS teams, each accompanied by a Mossad ''katsa'', raided known PLO apartments, but found no evidence of any plot to kill Meir. In the morning, a few hours before Meir's plane arrived, Mossad agents and Italian police surrounded Fiumicino Airport.

A Mossad ''katsa'' spotted a [[Fiat]] van parked in a field close to the flight path. The agent ordered the driver to step out. The back door then flew open, and two militants opened fire. The agent returned fire, severely wounding both of them. The van was found to contain six missiles. The driver escaped on foot, and was pursued by the agent. He was captured as he tried to hijack a car driven by another patrolling Mossad operative. The driver was bundled into the car and taken to the truck that served as Mossad's mobile command post, where he revealed the whereabouts of the second missile team after being severely beaten. The truck then sped off, heading north. A cafe-van with three missile launchers protruding from the roof was spotted. The truck then rammed the van, turning it over, trapping the launch team inside and half-crushing them beneath the weight of the missiles, and turning the van's fixed launchers away from the sky. The unconscious driver was pulled from the van and tossed to the side of the road, and DIGOS was alerted that there had been "an interesting accident they should look into". Zamir briefly considered killing the Palestinian terrorists, but felt that their deaths would serve as an embarrassment to Golda Meir's audience with the pope. The terrorists, who had been involved in the Munich massacre, were taken to the hospital and eventually allowed to fly to [[Libya]], but within months, all were killed by Mossad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first= Gordon|title=Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad|page= 220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blood and Rage: A Cultural history of Terrorism|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|date=2009|publisher=|year=|location=|pages=172-173|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 171–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assassinations of other Israelis and international officials====
Two Israelis suspected of being intelligence agents were shot and killed, as well as an Israeli official in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Baruch Cohen, a Mossad agent in [[Madrid]], was killed on January 23, 1973 by a young Palestinian contact.&lt;ref name="Reeve, 169"/&gt; Mossad then conducted a side operation to locate and kill Cohen's assassins, and at least three Palestinians involved in planning and carrying out Cohen's killing were assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Vittorio Olivares, an Italian [[El Al]] employee suspected by Black September, was shot and killed in Rome in April 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 173–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli military attaché to the United States, Colonel [[Yosef Alon]], was assassinated on July 1, 1973 in [[Chevy Chase, Maryland|Chevy Chase]], Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, USMC Major Rodney C.

Fred Burton, former deputy chief of the counterterrorism division of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department's]] [[Diplomatic Security Service]] and Vice-President of the private intelligence and consulting firm [[Stratfor]], conducted an investigation and concluded that Alon's killer was a Black September operative who was killed by Mossad in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/148704#.UsZhyvRDsjo|title=Was Alon Killed Because He 'Knew Too Much?' - Defense/Security - News  - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ami Shachori, an agriculture counselor working at the Israeli Embassy in [[London]], was assassinated by Black September on September 19, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Assassination in Khartoum. David A. Korn. pg 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Black September conducted several other attacks only indirectly against Israel, including the seizure of Western diplomats in the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] embassy in [[Khartoum]] (see: [[1973 Khartoum diplomatic assassinations]]), but the group was officially dissolved by [[al-Fatah]] in December 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=153 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base].

===Arab reaction===
While the first wave of assassinations from October 1972 to early 1973 caused greater consternation among Palestinian officials, it was the raid on Lebanon – [[Operation Spring of Youth]] in April 1973 – that truly shocked the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; The audacity of the mission, plus the fact that senior leaders such as [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Abu Iyad]] and [[Ali Hassan Salameh]] were only yards away from the fighting, contributed to the creation of the belief that Israel was capable of striking anywhere, anytime.&lt;ref name="Klein 169"&gt;Klein, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It also brought about popular mourning. At the funerals for the victims of the raid, half a million people came into the streets of Beirut.&lt;ref name="Klein 169"/&gt; Nearly six years later, 100,000 people, including Arafat, turned out in the same city to bury Salameh.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation also caused some of the less radical Arab governments to begin putting pressure on Palestinians to stop attacks against Israeli targets and threatened to pull support for the Palestinians if they used their passports during the course of attacks against Israel. As a result, some Palestinian militants began to instead use forged Israeli documents.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903821,00.html Deadly Battle of the Spooks]", ''Time'', February 12, 1973.

== Criticism ==

In his 2005 book ''Striking Back'', author [[Aaron Klein]]{{spaced ndash}}who says he based his book in large part on rare interviews with key Mossad officers involved in the reprisal missions{{spaced ndash}}contends that Mossad got only one man directly connected to the massacre. The man, [[Atef Bseiso]], was killed in Paris in 1992. Klein goes on to say that the intelligence on [[Wael Zwaiter]], the first Palestinian to die, was "uncorroborated and improperly cross-referenced. Looking back, his assassination was a mistake." He elaborates, stating that the real planners and executors of Munich had gone into hiding along with bodyguards in the [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Arab world]], where Israel could not reach them. Most of those killed were minor Palestinian figures who happened to be wandering unprotected around Western Europe. "Israeli security officials claimed these dead men were responsible for Munich; PLO pronouncements made them out to be important figures; and so the image of Mossad as capable of delivering death at will grew and grew." The operation functioned not just to punish the perpetrators of Munich but also to disrupt and deter future terrorist acts, writes Klein. "For the second goal, one dead PLO operative was as good as another." Klein quotes a senior intelligence source: "Our blood was boiling. When there was information implicating someone, we didn't inspect it with a magnifying glass."&lt;ref name="Time 2005"/&gt;

Abu Daoud, one of the main planners of the Munich massacre, said in interviews before the release of the movie ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' that  "I returned to Ramallah in 1995, and Israel knew that I was the planner of the Munich operation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/features/article_1130614.php/Munich_operation_mastermind_gives_his_account "Munich operation 'mastermind' gives his account"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918170921/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/features/article_1130614.php/Munich_operation_mastermind_gives_his_account |date=September 18, 2009 }}, ''Monsters and Critics News'', February 16, 2006.

Accessed September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Mossad chief Zvi Zamir has countered this in an interview in 2006, when he said that Israel was more interested in striking the "infrastructure of the terrorist organizations in Europe" than those directly responsible for Munich. "We had no choice but to start with preventive measures."&lt;ref&gt;Melman, Yossi.

As the campaign continued, relatives of the athletes killed at Munich were kept informed. Simon Reeve writes that some felt vindicated, while others, including the wife of fencer [[Andre Spitzer]], felt ambivalent.&lt;ref name="Reeve 186"&gt;Reeve, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The wife of assassinated Mossad agent Baruch Cohen called the operation, especially a side operation directed against those who had murdered her husband, sickening.&lt;ref name="Reeve 186"/&gt;

According to [[Ronen Bergman]] (security correspondent for the Israeli newspaper ''[[Yediot Ahronoth]]'' and expert on Mossad): "This campaign stopped most PLO terrorism outside the borders of Israel. Did it help in any way to bring peace to the Middle East? No. Strategically it was a complete failure."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Former ''katsa'' [[Victor Ostrovsky]] has said that the direction Meir set Mossad on, namely that of focusing heavily on the people and operations of the PLO, took energy away from intelligence gathering on Israel's neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrovsky, 197.&lt;/ref&gt; This led Mossad to miss the warning signs of the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], which caught Israeli defenses by surprise.

== In popular culture ==

The 1984 book ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]], tells the story of an Israeli assassination squad from the viewpoint of a self-described former Mossad agent and leader of the squad, Avner. Avner has since been claimed to be a pseudonym for [[Yuval Aviv]], an Israeli who now runs a private investigation agency in New York. However, Jonas denies that Aviv was his source for ''Vengeance'', although the book has not been independently verified beyond the fact checking Jonas says he has done.&lt;ref name="Jonas 2006"&gt;Jonas, George.

A '''post-game''', '''postgame''', or '''post-match show''' is a [[TV]] or [[radio]] presentation that occurs immediately after the live broadcast of a major [[sporting event]].
Contents may include:
* [[instant replay|replay]]s of key moments in the game.
* [[interview]]s with [[Player (game)|player]]s, [[Coach (sport)|coach]]es and [[Coach (sport)|managers]].
* analysis of the game by [[sports commentator]]s.
* footage of celebrating or demoralized [[sports fan|fans]].
* previews of the next game or series.
* championship and/or MVP trophy presentations.

Postgame shows are generally shorter and less structured than [[pre-game show]]s, especially for national broadcasts. In many cases, especially in [[prime time]] matchups, there may be virtually no post-game show at all. This is partially due to the unpredictability of the length of a typical sporting event, which can vary in length by a considerable amount depending on clock stoppages and overtime. The post-game show is expected to fill the gap between the end of the game and the start of regularly scheduled programming. A team's success may also portend whether a post-game show is detailed or merely a summary of the [[box score]] and highlights.

'''Pruitt Field''' is a [[field hockey]] field located in [[Athens, Ohio]] on the campus of [[Ohio University]].  It serves as the home of the [[Ohio Bobcats]] women's [[field hockey]] program and opened in 2000.  Pruitt Field is surrounded by [[Goldsberry Track]] and acts as the infield for track events.

Pruitt Field has a potential to hold 1,000 spectators in the red-brick grandstand located on the east side of the stadium. There is also a press box on the stadium's east side and a high quality sound system. The playing surface at Pruitt Field is made of Astroturf 2000 and features a state-of-the-art drainage system below the field. In the summer of 2006, permanent lights were installed.

The field is named after Dr. Peggy Pruitt who served as Ohio's head field hockey coach from 1975-1977 and Ohio's head tennis coach from 1975-1982. She then became Ohio's Associate Director of Athletics from 1993 until retiring in 2001. Today, she is the  commissioner of the [[American Lacrosse Conference]].

In addition, the venue serves as the practice field for OU's marching band, [[The Ohio University Marching 110]].

The '''Romania national cricket team''' represents the country of [[Romania]] in [[international cricket]].

[[Cricket]] was played in Romania between 1893 and 1930, after which it declined and the sport in Romania died out. In recent years the game has begun to grow again, particularly in [[Bucharest]], [[Timișoara]] and [[Cluj-Napoca]].

In July 2010 they played in a European [[Twenty20]] tournament which was held in [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]].

On 29 June 2013 Romania was granted affiliate status by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) and are therefore entitled to participate in ICC official events.&lt;ref name="new"&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/274/icc-members/affiliate-members/romania|title=Details of Affiliate Membership}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2017, they became an [[ICC members|associate member]]&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt;

As in a number of European countries, the game is dominated by expatriates from the Sub-Continent and other traditional cricket-playing countries.

The main ground of the team for national and international matches is at [[Moara Vlăsiei]], 26 km (16 miles) away from the Bucharest city centre. It was built between 2011 and 2013 and is the only turf ground in eastern and central Europe.

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Romania and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=International Cricket Council|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Skatepark of Tampa''' is a [[skatepark]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], United States. It is considered one of the top [[skateboarding]] venues on the East Coast of the United States. The name is often abbreviated as ''SPoT'', and it is well known for its annual ''Tampa Am'' and ''[[Tampa Pro (skateboard competition)|Tampa Pro]]'' competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skateboarding glory rolls through Tampa event|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/03/11/Sports/Skateboarding_glory_r.shtml|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=11 March 2006|author=Bob Putnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TAMPA AM 2012 FINALS|url=http://skateboarding.transworld.net/1000170061/videos/tampa-am-2012-finals/|work=Transworld Skateboarding|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|accessdate=28 June 2013|author=TWS|date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On December 28, 1992, SPoT was opened only to employees, and on January 2, 1993 the park officially opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE 18TH ANNUAL TAMPA AM|url=http://espn.go.com/action/skateboarding/story/_/id/8721767/the-skatepark-tampa-celebrates-their-20-year-anniversary-weekend-tampa-contest|work=X Games|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=28 June 2013|author=Chris Nieratko|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2012, SPoT announced on its website that the park had been purchased (for {{USD}}9.3 million) by rapper [[Lil Wayne]]. It was revealed shortly afterwards that the fake press release was an [[April Fool's]] joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIL WAYNE BUYS MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IN SKATEPARK OF TAMPA FOR $9.3 MILLION|url=http://skateparkoftampa.com/spot/a.aspx?ID=1732|work=Skatepark of Tampa|publisher=Skatepark of Tampa|accessdate=28 June 2013|author=Rob Meronek|date=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The skatepark includes a [[terrain park]]-style "pro course", offering a [[funboxpyramid]] and many difficult rails for [[Grinds (skateboarding)|grinds]] and [[Slides (skateboarding)|slides]]. Outside, there is a concrete transition course with a pizza oven. The "beginner's course" features many smaller rails and ramps to expand skateboarding skills and also includes the famous bowl.

The [[street skateboarding]] course is redesigned every year for the Tampa Pro and Tampa Am contest.&lt;ref&gt;http://skateparkoftampa.com/spot/a.aspx?ID=3038&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music venue ==
The skatepark also doubles as a popular music venue. In 2012, SPoT hosted its 20-year anniversary event with performances from [[Souls of Mischief]] and [[Killer Mike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SoundCheck: Aerosmith, Geoff Tate, Sum 41, Ty Segall, METZ Skatepark of Tampa 20-Year Anniversary Party, Iris DeMent|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/music/soundcheck-aerosmith-geoff-tate-sum-41-skatepark-of-tampa-20-year/1264743|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=5 December 2012|author=Jay Cridlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue also hosts the ''Transitions Art Gallery'' music venue on its premises. TAG has served as a springboard for acoustic artists and other musicians. In December 2012, the owner of the Gallery announced he was stepping down and that the venue would be under new management from January 2013. The venue's new owners subsequently announced that the name of the venue would change to ''Epic Problem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skatepark of Tampa's Transitions Art Gallery gets new owners, changing name to Epic Problem|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/content/skatepark-tampas-transitions-art-gallery-gets-new-owners-changing-name-epic-problem|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=7 December 2012|author=Jay Cridlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epic Problem'' hosts many shows from many post-hardcore bands and one annual show from the nonprofit high school (mainly from [[Hillsborough High School (Tampa, Florida)|Hillsborough High School]]) sketch comedy troupe On The Brink.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hhstoday.com/life/2015/02/12/on-the-brink-march-12-14/&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Epic Problem held its last show and passed the torch to King State coffee, owned by Tim McTague, of [[Underoath]] and Nate Young, of [[Anberlin]], who use the space for brewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KING STATE COFFEE TAKING OVER TAMPA'S TRANSITION ART GALLERY|url=http://www.cltampa.com/music/music-news/article/20830577/king-state-coffee-taking-over-tampas-transitions-art-gallery|author=Ray Roa|date=11 August 2016|newspaper=Creative Loafing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the SPoT Snack Bar was expanded and reconstructed into a full-fledged music venue and renamed "Transitions". It is complete with stage, lighting, sound system and newly rebuilt bar. Transitions held its first show during the 23rd Annual Tampa Pro contest that featured the music of [[Ray Barbee]], Drowning Clowns, Arctic, and Tampa's own Samurai Shotgun.

==Popular culture==
The skatepark is a major feature in the ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]'' video game, and SPoT employees appear as competitors in the street and vertical contests. The skatepark also served as an exclusive competition level in ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://skateparkoftampa.com/article/173/SPoT_on_THuG&lt;/ref&gt;

SPoT appeared on the MTV series ''[[Rob &amp; Big]]'' that featured professional skateboarder and entrepreneur [[Rob Dyrdek]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/episodes/spvr8h/rob-and-big-tampa-season-2-ep-206&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, [[Lil Wayne]] stopped by SPoT for a private after hours session. He has attended every Tampa Pro contest since, often spectating from the judges' booth.&lt;ref&gt;http://skateparkoftampa.com/article/1605/Lil_Wayne_Skateboarding_at_Skatepark_of_Tampa&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, comedian [[Dave Chappelle]] set up an after hours session with some of his friends while on tour in Tampa.&lt;ref&gt;http://skateparkoftampa.com/article/229/Dave_Chappelle_&amp;_Posse_Take_Lessons&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cricket]], a '''slider''' is a type of delivery bowled by a [[wrist spin]] bowler. While a [[topspinner]] is released with the thumb facing the batsman, a slider is bowled in a similar manner to a legbreak, but instead of imparting sidespin with the third finger, the bowler allows his fingers to roll down the back of the ball, providing a mixture of sidespin and backspin. Whereas a topspinner tends to dip more quickly and bounce higher than a normal delivery, a slider does the opposite: it carries to a fuller length and bounces less than the batsman might expect. The sliders will typically head towards the batsman with a scrambled seam (with the ball not spinning in the direction of the seam, so the seam direction is not constant, unlike in conventional spin bowling). This has less effect on the flight and bounce but absence of [[leg spin]] may deceive the batsman. Frequently the slider is bowled with a mixture of side spin and backspin. This has the effect of making the ball harder to differentiate from the leg break for the batsmen without reducing the mechanical effects caused by the backspin. This delivery may skid straight on or it may turn a small amount.&lt;ref name="Wisden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/287315.html|last=Atherton|first=Michael|title=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2007 - Shane Warne The mighty craftsman|date=24 March 2007|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that [[Shane Warne]] invented this type of delivery. However, this is inaccurate. The Australian spinner [[Peter Philpott]] used the technique in the 1960s, calling it simply an orthodox backspinner, while Australian all - rounder and captain [[Richie Benaud]] used what he called his 'sliding topspinner' which appears again to have been similar.  Since he was taught the technique by [[Doug Ring]],&lt;ref name="Wisden"/&gt; it may be more accurate to suggest that Ring is the originator.  Either that, or the ball is one of those deliveries with no easily identifiable point of origin. However Shane Warne's use of the delivery in the 2005 Ashes brought the variation once more into the public consciousness. His dismissal of [[Ian Bell]] lbw with the delivery was a classic piece of spin bowling; Bell played for the turn of a normal leg break, but the delivery skidded straight into his front pad without turning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jul/25/ashes2005.ashes|last=Haigh|first=Gideon|title=Sliders rule as Warne is recalibrated|date=25 July 2005|newspaper=Guardian|location=London|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is often a good deal of confusion on the subject, the slider is thought to be more or less an identical delivery to the "zooter".&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpafirsteleven.blogspot.com/2010/11/orthodox-back-spinner-part-ii.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Finger spin]] bowlers commonly bowl an exactly equivalent ball, which comes out of the front of the hand with backspin present. However the name slider has not passed over into common parlance for its offspin cousin, and the terms [[arm ball]], '''backspinner''' or, more recently, [[teesra]] are used instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2570">The '''Tipton Road''' [[cricket ground]] in [[Dudley]], [[England]] was used for [[first-class cricket]] by [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire CCC]] on 88 occasions between 1911 and 1971. The county also staged 14 [[List A cricket|List A]] games there between 1969 and 1977, all in the [[National League (cricket)|Sunday League]], as well as a number of Second XI matches. 

One match of the [[1982 ICC Trophy]] was played at Tipton Road, but the game between [[East African cricket team|East Africa]] and [[West African cricket team|West Africa]] was abandoned without a result after East Africa had reached 53/2 from 25.1 overs.

On 25 May 1985, however, a 40-foot wide hole appeared on the cricket pitch, and Dudley council immediately closed the cricket pitch and the rest of the sports centre.

The whole complex remained derelict until the late 1990s, when construction of the first buildings on the [[Castle Gate, Dudley|Castle Gate]] leisure and commercial complex began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcountrysociety.co.uk/articles/hole-in-the-ground/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max''' ('''velocity at maximal oxygen uptake''') is an intense running or swimming pace. This is the minimum speed for which the organism's [[VO2max|maximal oxygen uptake]] is reached (after a few minutes of exercise at this intensity); at higher paces, additional [[power (physics)|power]] is entirely delivered by [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] processes.  At this pace, [[blood lactate]] in the muscles reaches levels around 8-10&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration|mM]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} 

The vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max of world class middle- and long-distance runners may exceed 24&amp;nbsp;km/h (14.9&amp;nbsp;mph or about 4:00/mile pace), making this speed slightly comparable to 3000&amp;nbsp;m race pace. For many athletes, vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max may be slightly slower than 1500&amp;nbsp;m or mile race pace.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Training==
Research by [[:fr:Véronique Billat|Véronique Billat]] has shown that training at vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max pace improves both '''[[VO2max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max]]''' and the economy required to maintain pace at this intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billat|first=Véronique L.|author2=J.

Training at vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max takes the form of interval workouts. For example, 3 x 1000&amp;nbsp;m with 3 minutes recovery between each repetition.

=== Determining vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max from VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max ===
The formula from Léger and Mercier&lt;ref name="Léger-"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Léger | first1 = L. | last2 = Mercier | first2 = D. | title = Gross energy cost of horizontal treadmill and track running. | journal = Sports Med | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 270–7 | doi =  10.2165/00007256-198401040-00003| PMID = 6390604 | year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; links the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max to the vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max, supposing an ideal running technique. 
 
:vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max = VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max / 3.5
where vVO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max is in km/h and VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max is in mL/(kg•min).

'''Note''': This formula is identical to that used to calculate the [[Metabolic_equivalent|Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET)]] score for a given VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max estimation.
