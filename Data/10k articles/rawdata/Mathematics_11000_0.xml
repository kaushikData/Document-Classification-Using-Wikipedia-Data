'''23''' ('''twenty-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[22 (number)|22]] and preceding [[24 (number)|24]].

==In mathematics==
*Twenty-three is the ninth [[prime number]], the smallest odd prime that is not a [[twin prime]]. Twenty-three is also the fifth [[factorial prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A088054|2=Factorial primes|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second [[Woodall prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A050918|2=Woodall primes|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no [[imaginary part]] and [[real part]] of the form&amp;nbsp;3''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

*The fifth [[Sophie Germain prime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A005384|2=Sophie Germain primes|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth [[safe prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A005385|2=Safe primes|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23 is the next to last member of the first [[Cunningham chain]] of the first kind to have five terms (2, 5, 11, 23, 47). Since 14! + 1 is a multiple of 23 but 23 is not one more than a multiple 14, 23 is a [[Pillai prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A063980|2=Pillai primes|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23 is the smallest odd prime to be a [[highly cototient number]], as the solution to ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;φ(''x'') for the integers 95, 119, 143, 529.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A100827|2=Highly cototient numbers|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*23 is the first prime ''p'' for which unique factorization of cyclotomic integers based on the ''p''the root of unity breaks down.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

*The sum of the first 23 primes is 874, which is divisible by 23, a property shared by few other numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEIS|id=A045345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primepuzzles.net/puzzles/puzz_031.htm Puzzle 31.- The Average Prime number, APN(''k'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''S''(''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/''k''] from The Prime Puzzles &amp; Problems Connection website&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the list of [[fortunate number]]s, 23 occurs twice, since adding 23 to either the fifth or eighth [[primorial]] gives a prime number (namely 2333 and 9699713).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A005235|2=Fortunate numbers|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*23 also has the distinction of being one of two integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than 9 cubes of positive integers (the other is [[239 (number)|239]]). See [[Waring's problem]].

*23 is a [[Wedderburn&amp;ndash;Etherington number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A001190|2=Wedderburn-Etherington numbers|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codewords in the perfect (non-extended) [[binary Golay code]] are of size&amp;nbsp;23.

*According to the [[birthday paradox]], in a group of 23 (or more) randomly chosen people, the probability is more than 50% that some pair of them will have the same birthday.  A related coincidence is that 365 times the [[natural logarithm]] of 2, approximately 252.999, is very close to the number of pairs of 23 items, 253.

*In base 10, 23 is the second [[Smarandache&amp;ndash;Wellin prime]], as it is the concatenation of the base 10 representations of the first two primes (2 and 3) and is itself also prime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A069151|2=Concatenations of consecutive primes, starting with 2, that are also prime|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a [[happy number]] in base 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A007770|2=Happy numbers|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23[[factorial|!]] is 23 digits long in base 10. There are only three other numbers that have this property: 1, 22, and&amp;nbsp;24.

*The [[natural logarithm]]s of all [[positive integer]]s lower than 23 are known to have binary [[BBP-type formula]]e.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~chamberl/papers/bbp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

*23 is the smallest [[prime number]] ''p'' such that the largest consecutive pair of ''p''-[[smooth numbers]] is the same as the largest consecutive pair of (''p'' − 1)-smooth numbers, as given in the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] sequence {{OEIS link|A228611}}.  That is, the largest consecutive pair of 23-smooth numbers, (11859210, 11859211), is the same as the largest consecutive pair of 22-smooth numbers, and 23 is the smallest prime for which this is true.

*23 is the smallest positive solution to [[Sunzi Suanjing|Sunzi]]'s original formulation of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].

==In science and technology==
* The [[atomic number]] of [[vanadium]].
* The [[atomic mass number]] of the [[stable isotope]] of [[sodium]].
* Normal human [[sex cells]] have 23 [[chromosome]]s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Wramsby, K. Fredga, P.

Trask, "Human genetics and disease: Human cytogenetics: 46 chromosomes, 46 years and counting" ''Nature Reviews Genetics'' '''3''' (2002): 769. "Human cytogenetics was born in 1956 with the fundamental, but empowering, discovery that normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes."&lt;/ref&gt;

The topology of a &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; bundle is classified by its [[Chern class]], which is an element of &lt;math&gt;H^2(M, \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, the second integral cohomology of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Gerbe]]s, or more precisely 1-gerbes, are abstract descriptions of Deligne 2-classes, which each define an element of &lt;math&gt;H^3(M, \mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, the third integral cohomology of ''M''.

== History ==

Historically the most popular construction of a gerbe is a [[category theory|category-theoretic]] model featured in Giraud's theory of gerbes, which are roughly [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of [[groupoid]]s over ''M''.

In 1994 Murray introduced bundle gerbes, which are geometric realizations of 1-gerbes.
For many purposes these are more suitable for calculations than Giraud's realization, because their construction is entirely within the framework of classical geometry.  In fact, as their name suggests, they are [[fiber bundle]]s.  This notion was extended to higher gerbes the following year.&lt;ref&gt;in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9511169 Higher Bundle Gerbes and Cohomology Classes In Gauge Theories] by [[Alan Carey (mathematician)|Alan Carey]], [[Michael Murray (mathematician)|Michael Murray]] and [[Bai-Ling Wang]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with twisted ''K''-theory==

In [http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0106194 Twisted K-theory and the K-theory of Bundle Gerbes] &lt;ref&gt;by [[Peter Bouwknegt]], [[Alan Carey (mathematician)|Alan Carey]], [[Mathai Varghese|Varghese Mathai]], [[Michael Murray (mathematician)|Michael Murray]] and [[Danny Stevenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; the authors defined modules of bundle gerbes and used this to define a [[K-theory]] for bundle gerbes.  They then showed that this K-theory is isomorphic to Rosenberg's [[twisted K-theory]], and provides an [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]-free construction.

In addition they defined a notion of [[twisted Chern character]] which is a [[characteristic class]] for an element of twisted K-theory.  The twisted Chern character is a [[differential form]] that represents a class in the [[twisted cohomology]] with respect to the [[nilpotent]] operator

:&lt;math&gt; d + H &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the ordinary [[exterior derivative]] and the ''[[twist (mathematics)|twist]]'' &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-form.  This construction was extended to [[equivariant topological K-theory|equivariant K-theory]] and to [[holomorphic K-theory]] by Mathai and Stevenson.&lt;ref&gt;in [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201010 Chern Character in Twisted K-theory: Equivariant and Holomorphic Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with field theory==

Bundle gerbes have also appeared in the context of [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]].  [[Krzysztof Gawedzki|Gawedzki]] and [[Nuno Reis (mathematician)|Reis]] have interpreted the Wess-Zumino term in the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model]] (WZW) of [[string theory|string]] propagation on a [[Lie group|group manifold]] as the [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] of a bundle gerbe.  [[Urs Schreiber]],  [[Christoph Schweigert]] and [[Konrad Waldorf]] have used this construction to extend WZW models to unoriented surfaces and, more generally, the global [[Kalb-Ramond field|Kalb-Ramond coupling]] to unoriented strings.

'''"Business statistics''' is the science of good decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many disciplines such as [[financial analysis]],  [[econometrics]], [[auditing]], production and operations including services improvement and marketing research".&lt;ref&gt;• 
''[[Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics]]'', [http://pubs.amstat.org/page/jbes/aims-and-scope Aims and Scope.]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jbes.cfm "''Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics'', American Statistical Association."]&lt;/ref&gt;

These sources feature regular repetitive publication of series of data. This makes the topic of [[time series]] especially important for business statistics. It is also a branch of [[applied statistics]] working mostly on data collected as a by-product of doing business or by government agencies. It provides knowledge and skills to interpret and use statistical techniques in a variety of business applications.

A typical business statistics course is intended for [[Business education#Undergraduate education|business majors]], and covers statistical study, descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability, and the binomial and [[normal distribution]]s, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, [[linear regression]], and correlation.&lt;ref&gt;• E. Pekoz, ''[[The Manager's Guide to Statistics]]'', http://www.probabilitybookstore.com, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Carus Mathematical Monographs''''' is a [[monograph series]] published by the [[Mathematical Association of America]].&lt;ref name="Drake"&gt;Drake, Miriam A. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Lib-Pub.'' CRC Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8247-2079-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books in this series are intended to appeal to a wide range of readers in [[mathematics]] and [[science]].

==Scope and audience==
While the books are intended to cover nontrivial material, the emphasis is on exposition and clear communication rather than novel results and a systematic [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]-style presentation. The webpage for the series states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exposition of mathematical subjects that the monographs contain are set forth in a manner comprehensible not only to teachers and students specializing in mathematics, but also to scientific workers in other fields. More generally, the monographs are intended for the wide circle of thoughtful people familiar with basic graduate or advanced undergraduate mathematics encountered in the study of mathematics itself or in the context of related disciplines who wish to extend their knowledge without prolonged and critical study of the mathematical journals and treatises.&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;Mathematical Association of America. [http://202.38.126.65/oldmirrors/www.maa.org/pubs/books/carus_series.html Carus Mathematical Monographs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081909/http://202.38.126.65/oldmirrors/www.maa.org/pubs/books/carus_series.html |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the books in the series have become classics in the genre of general mathematical exposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">In [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]] and [[cryptography]], two families of distributions are '''computationally indistinguishable''' if no efficient algorithm can tell the difference between them except with small probability.

==Formal definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{ D_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\{ E_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; be two [[distribution ensemble]]s indexed by a [[security parameter]] ''n'' (which usually refers to the length of the input); we say they are computationally indistinguishable if for any [[Uniformity (complexity)|non-uniform]] probabilistic [[polynomial time]] [[algorithm]] ''A'', the following quantity is a [[negligible function (cryptography)|negligible function]] in ''n'':

: &lt;math&gt;\delta(n) = \left| \Pr_{x \gets D_n}[ A(x) = 1] - \Pr_{x \gets E_n}[ A(x) = 1] \right|.&lt;/math&gt;

denoted &lt;math&gt;D_n \approx E_n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos433/lec4.pdf Lecture 4 - Computational Indistinguishability, Pseudorandom Generators]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, every efficient algorithm ''A'''s behavior does not significantly change when given samples according to ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the limit as &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Another interpretation of computational indistinguishability, is that polynomial-time algorithms actively trying to distinguish between the two ensembles cannot do so: that any such algorithm will only perform negligibly better than if one were to just guess.

==Related notions==
Implicit in the definition is the condition that the algorithm, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, must decide based on a single sample from one of the distributions. One might conceive of a situation in which the algorithm trying to distinguish between two distributions, could access as many samples as it needed. Hence two ensembles that cannot be distinguished by polynomial-time algorithms looking at multiple samples are deemed '''indistinguishable by polynomial-time sampling'''.&lt;ref name=Goldreich&gt;[[Oded Goldreich|Goldreich, O.]] (2003). Foundations of cryptography. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} If the polynomial-time algorithm can generate samples in polynomial time, or has access to a [[random oracle]] that generates samples for it, then indistinguishability by polynomial-time sampling is equivalent to computational indistinguishability.&lt;ref name=Goldreich /&gt;{{rp|108}}

In [[optimization (mathematics)|mathematical optimization]], the '''criss-cross algorithm''' is any of a family of [[algorithm]]s for [[linear programming]]. Variants of the criss-cross algorithm also solve more general problems with [[linear programming|linear inequality constraints]] and [[nonlinear programming|nonlinear]] [[optimization (mathematics)|objective functions]]; there are criss-cross algorithms for [[linear-fractional programming]] problems,&lt;ref name="LF99Hyperbolic"&gt;{{harvtxt|Illés|Szirmai|Terlaky|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bibl" &gt;{{cite journal|first=I.&amp;nbsp;M.|last=Stancu-Minasian|title=A sixth bibliography of fractional programming|journal=Optimization|volume=55|number=4|date=August 2006|url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/02331930600819613|pages=405–428|doi=10.1080/02331930600819613|mr=2258634}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quadratic programming|quadratic-programming]] problems, and [[linear complementarity problem]]s.&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky" &gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Terlaky|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[George Dantzig|George B. Dantzig]], the criss-cross algorithm is not a [[time complexity|polynomial-time algorithm]] for linear programming. Both algorithms visit all&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;corners of a (perturbed) [[unit cube|cube]] in dimension&amp;nbsp;''D'', the [[Klee–Minty cube]] (after [[Victor Klee]] and [[George J. Minty]]), in the [[worst-case complexity|worst case]].&lt;ref name="Roos" &gt;{{harvtxt|Roos|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KleeMinty"/&gt; However, when it is started at a random corner, the criss-cross algorithm [[Average-case complexity|on&amp;nbsp;average]] visits only&amp;nbsp;''D'' additional corners.&lt;ref name="FTNamiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FukudaNamiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgwardt"&gt;The simplex algorithm takes on average&amp;nbsp;''D'' steps for a cube. {{harvtxt|Borgwardt|1987}}: {{cite book|last=Borgwardt|first=Karl-Heinz|title=The simplex method: A probabilistic analysis|series=Algorithms and Combinatorics (Study and Research Texts)|volume=1|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1987|pages=xii+268|isbn=3-540-17096-0|mr=868467|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the three-dimensional cube, the algorithm visits all&amp;nbsp;8 corners in the worst case and exactly&amp;nbsp;3 additional corners on&amp;nbsp;average.

==History==
The criss-cross algorithm was published independently by [[Tamás Terlaky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Terlaky|1985}} and {{harvtxt|Terlaky|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Zhe-Min Wang;&lt;ref name="Wang" &gt;{{harvtxt|Wang|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; related algorithms appeared in unpublished reports by other authors.&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky"/&gt;

==Comparison with the simplex algorithm for linear optimization==
{{See also|Linear programming|Simplex algorithm|Bland's rule}}
[[File:Simplex description.png|thumb|240px|In its second phase, the ''simplex algorithm'' crawls along the edges of the polytope until it finally reaches an optimum [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]]. The ''criss-cross algorithm'' considers bases that are not associated with vertices, so that some iterates can be in the ''interior ''of the feasible region, like interior-point algorithms; the criss-cross algorithm can also have ''infeasible'' iterates ''outside'' the feasible region.]]
In linear programming, the criss-cross algorithm pivots between a sequence of bases but differs from the [[simplex algorithm]] of [[George Dantzig]]. The simplex algorithm first finds a (primal-) feasible basis by solving a "''phase-one'' problem"; in "phase two", the simplex algorithm pivots between a sequence of basic ''feasible ''solutions so that the objective function is non-decreasing with each pivot, terminating when with an optimal solution (also finally finding a "dual feasible" solution).&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TerlakyZhang"&gt;{{harvtxt|Terlaky|Zhang|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criss-cross algorithm is simpler than the simplex algorithm, because the criss-cross algorithm only has one phase. Its pivoting rules are similar to the [[Bland's rule|least-index pivoting rule of Bland]].&lt;ref name="Bland"&gt;

Murty for the [[linear complementarity problem]], according to {{harvtxt|Fukuda|Namiki|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Bland's rule, the criss-cross algorithm is "purely combinatorial", selecting an entering variable and a leaving variable by considering only the signs of coefficients rather than their real-number ordering.&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TerlakyZhang"/&gt; The  criss-cross algorithm has been applied to furnish constructive proofs of basic results in [[real number|real]] [[linear algebra]], such as &lt;!-- [[Steinitz's theorem|Steinitz's lemma]], --&gt; the [[Farkas lemma|lemma of Farkas]]&lt;!-- , [[Weyl's theorem]] on the finite generation of [[convex polytope]]s by linear inequalities ([[halfspace]]s), and the [[Krein–Milman theorem|Minkowski's theorem]] on [[extreme point]]s --&gt;.&lt;ref name="KT91" &gt;{{harvtxt|Klafszky|Terlaky|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most simplex variants are monotonic in the objective (strictly in the non-degenerate case), most variants of the criss-cross algorithm lack a monotone merit function which can be a disadvantage in practice.

==Description==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
The criss-cross algorithm works on a standard pivot tableau (or on-the-fly calculated parts of a tableau, if implemented like the revised simplex method). In a general step, if the tableau is primal or dual infeasible, it selects one of the infeasible rows / columns as the pivot row / column using an index selection rule. An important property is that the selection is made on the union of the infeasible indices and the standard version of the algorithm does not distinguish column and row indices (that is, the column indices basic in the rows). If a row is selected then the algorithm uses the index selection rule to identify a position to a dual type pivot, while if a column is selected then it uses the index selection rule to find a row position and carries out a primal type pivot.

==Computational complexity: Worst and average cases==
[[File:Ellipsoid 2.png|thumb|right&lt;!-- 400px --&gt;|The worst-case computational complexity of Khachiyan's ''ellipsoidal algorithm'' is a polynomial. The ''criss-cross algorithm'' has exponential complexity.]]
The [[time complexity]] of an [[algorithm]] counts the number of [[arithmetic operation]]s sufficient for the algorithm to solve the problem. For example, [[Gaussian elimination]] requires on the [[Big oh|order&amp;nbsp;of]]''&amp;nbsp;D''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; operations, and so it is said to have polynomial time-complexity, because its complexity is bounded by a [[cubic polynomial]]. There are examples of algorithms that do not have polynomial-time complexity. For example, a generalization of Gaussian elimination called [[Buchberger's algorithm]] has for its complexity an &lt;!--doubly --&gt; exponential function of the problem data (the [[degree of a polynomial|degree of the polynomial]]s and the number of variables of the [[multivariate polynomial]]s). Because exponential functions eventually grow much faster than polynomial functions, an&lt;!-- attained rather than upper bound --&gt; exponential complexity implies that an algorithm has slow performance on large problems.

Several algorithms for linear programming—[[Khachiyan]]'s [[ellipsoidal algorithm]], [[Karmarkar]]'s [[Karmarkar's algorithm|projective algorithm]], and [[interior-point method|central-path algorithm]]s—have polynomial time-complexity (in the [[worst case complexity|worst case]] and thus [[average case complexity|on&amp;nbsp;average]]). The ellipsoidal and projective algorithms were published before the  criss-cross algorithm.

However, like the simplex algorithm of Dantzig, the criss-cross algorithm is ''not'' a polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. Terlaky's criss-cross algorithm visits all the&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;corners of a (perturbed) cube in dimension&amp;nbsp;''D'', according to a paper of Roos; Roos's paper modifies the [[Victor Klee|Klee]]–Minty construction of a [[unit cube|cube]] on which the simplex algorithm takes&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''D''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;steps.&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KleeMinty"&gt;{{cite book|title=Inequalities&amp;nbsp;III (Proceedings of the Third Symposium on Inequalities held at the University of California, Los Angeles, Calif., September&amp;nbsp;1–9,&amp;nbsp;1969, dedicated to the memory of Theodore&amp;nbsp;S.

Minty|chapter=How good is the simplex algorithm?|pages=159–175|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the simplex algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm visits all&amp;nbsp;8 corners of the three-dimensional cube in the worst case.

When it is initialized at a random corner of the cube, the criss-cross algorithm visits only&amp;nbsp;''D'' additional corners, however, according to a&amp;nbsp;1994 paper by Fukuda and Namiki.&lt;ref name="FTNamiki" &gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Terlaky|1997|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FukudaNamiki" &gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Namiki|1994|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trivially, the simplex algorithm takes on average&amp;nbsp;''D'' steps for a cube.&lt;ref name="Borgwardt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More generally, for the simplex algorithm, the expected number of steps is  proportional to&amp;nbsp;''D'' for linear-programming problems that are randomly drawn from the [[Euclidean metric|Euclidean]] [[unit&amp;nbsp;sphere]], as proved by Borgwardt and by [[Stephen Smale|Smale]].&lt;/ref&gt; Like the simplex algorithm, the criss-cross algorithm visits exactly&amp;nbsp;3 additional corners of the three-dimensional cube on&amp;nbsp;average.

==Variants==
The criss-cross algorithm has been extended to solve more general problems than linear programming problems.

===Other optimization problems with linear constraints===
There are variants of the criss-cross algorithm for linear programming, for [[quadratic programming]], and for the [[linear complementarity problem|linear-complementarity problem]] with "sufficient matrices";&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FTNamiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FukudaNamikiLCP" &gt;{{harvtxt|Fukuda|Namiki|1994|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OMBook" &gt;{{cite book|last=Björner|first=Anders|last2=Las&amp;nbsp;Vergnas|first2=Michel|author2-link=Michel Las Vergnas|last3=Sturmfels|first3=Bernd|authorlink3=Bernd Sturmfels|last4=White|first4=Neil|last5=Ziegler|first5=Günter|authorlink5=Günter M.

===Vertex enumeration===
The criss-cross algorithm was used in an algorithm for [[Vertex enumeration problem|enumerating all the vertices of a polytope]], which was published by [[David Avis]] and Komei Fukuda in&amp;nbsp;1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Avis|Fukuda|1992|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avis and Fukuda presented an algorithm which finds the&amp;nbsp;''v'' vertices of a [[polyhedron]] defined by a nondegenerate system of&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[linear inequality|linear inequalities]] in&amp;nbsp;''D'' [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s (or, dually, the&amp;nbsp;''v'' [[facet]]s of the [[convex hull]] of&amp;nbsp;''n'' points in&amp;nbsp;''D'' dimensions, where each facet contains exactly&amp;nbsp;''D'' given points) in time&amp;nbsp;[[Big Oh notation|O]](''nDv'') and&amp;nbsp;O(''nD'') [[space complexity|space]].&lt;ref&gt;The&amp;nbsp;''v'' vertices in a simple arrangement of&amp;nbsp;''n'' [[hyperplane]]s in&amp;nbsp;''D'' dimensions can be found in&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''Dv'') time and O(''nD'') [[space complexity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriented matroids===
[[File:max-flow min-cut example.svg|frame|right|The [[max-flow min-cut theorem]] states that the maximum flow through a network is exactly the capacity of its minimum cut. This theorem can be proved using the criss-cross algorithm for oriented matroids.]]
The criss-cross algorithm is often studied using the theory of [[oriented matroid]]s (OMs), which is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] abstraction of linear-optimization theory.&lt;ref name="OMBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theory of [[oriented matroid]]s was initiated by [[R.&amp;nbsp;Tyrrell Rockafellar]]. {{harv|Rockafellar|1969}}:&lt;p&gt;{{cite book

Tucker]] and [[George J. Minty]]. Tucker and Minty had studied the sign patterns of the matrices arising through the pivoting operations of Dantzig's simplex algorithm.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Bland's pivoting rule was based on his previous papers on oriented-matroid theory. However, Bland's rule exhibits cycling on some oriented-matroid linear-programming problems.&lt;ref name="OMBook"/&gt; The first purely combinatorial algorithm for linear programming was devised by [[Michael J. Todd (mathematician)|Michael&amp;nbsp;J. Todd]].&lt;ref name="OMBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"/&gt; Todd's algorithm was developed not only for linear-programming in the setting of oriented matroids, but also for  [[quadratic programming|quadratic-programming problems]] and [[linear complementarity problem|linear-complementarity problem]]s.&lt;ref name="OMBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Michael&amp;nbsp;J.|authorlink=Michael J. Todd (mathematician)|title=Linear and quadratic programming in oriented matroids|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory|series=Series&amp;nbsp;B|volume=39|year=1985|number=2|pages=105–133|mr=811116|doi=10.1016/0095-8956(85)90042-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd's algorithm is complicated even to state, unfortunately, and its finite-convergence proofs are somewhat complicated.&lt;ref name="OMBook"/&gt;

The criss-cross algorithm and its proof of finite termination can be simply stated and readily extend the setting of oriented matroids. The algorithm can be further simplified for ''linear feasibility problems'', that is for [[linear system]]s with [[linear inequality|nonnegative variable]]s; these problems can be formulated for oriented matroids.&lt;ref name="KT91"/&gt;  The criss-cross algorithm has been adapted for problems that are more complicated than linear programming: There are oriented-matroid variants also for the quadratic-programming problem and for the linear-complementarity problem.&lt;ref name="FukudaTerlaky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FukudaNamikiLCP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OMBook"/&gt;

==Summary==
The criss-cross algorithm is a simply stated algorithm for linear programming. It was the second fully combinatorial algorithm for linear programming. The partially combinatorial simplex algorithm of Bland cycles on some (nonrealizable) oriented matroids. The first fully combinatorial algorithm was published by Todd, and it is also like the simplex algorithm in that it preserves feasibility after the first feasible basis is generated; however, Todd's rule is complicated. The criss-cross algorithm is not a simplex-like algorithm, because it need not maintain feasibility. The criss-cross algorithm does not have polynomial time-complexity, however.

Researchers have extended the criss-cross algorithm for many optimization-problems, including linear-fractional programming. The criss-cross algorithm can solve quadratic programming problems and linear complementarity problems, even in the setting of oriented matroids. Even when generalized, the criss-cross algorithm remains simply stated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7340">The '''cut-elimination theorem''' (or '''Gentzen's ''Hauptsatz''''') is the central result establishing the significance of the [[sequent calculus]].  It was originally proved by [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in his landmark 1934 paper "Investigations in Logical Deduction" for the systems [[system LJ|LJ]] and [[system LK|LK]] formalising [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] and [[classical logic]] respectively.  The cut-elimination theorem states that any judgement that possesses a proof in the sequent calculus making use of the '''cut rule''' also possesses a '''cut-free proof''', that is, a proof that does not make use of the cut rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|1977|pp=208–213}}, gives a 5-page proof of the elimination theorem. See also pages 188, 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kleene|2009|pp=453}}, gives a very brief proof of the cut-elimination theorem.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cut rule==
A [[sequent]] is a logical expression relating multiple formulas, in the form {{nowrap|"&lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots \vdash B_1, B_2, B_3, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;"}}, which is to be read as {{nowrap|"&lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;}} proves {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;B_1, B_2, B_3, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;"}}, and (as glossed by Gentzen) should be understood as equivalent to the truth-function "If (&lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3&lt;/math&gt; …) then (&lt;math&gt;B_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B_2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B_3&lt;/math&gt; …)."&lt;ref&gt;Wilfried Buchholz, [http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~buchholz/articles/beweisth.ps Beweistheorie] (university lecture notes about cut-elimination, German, 2002-2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the left-hand side (LHS) is a conjunction (and) and the RHS is a disjunction (or).  

The LHS may have arbitrarily many or few formulae; when the LHS is empty, the RHS is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]].  In LK, the RHS may also have any number of formulae—if it has none, the LHS is a [[contradiction]], whereas in LJ the RHS may only have one formula or none: here we see that allowing more than one formula in the RHS is equivalent, in the presence of the right contraction rule, to the admissibility of the [[law of the excluded middle]].  However, the sequent calculus is a fairly expressive framework, and there have been sequent calculi for intuitionistic logic proposed that allow many formulae in the RHS. From [[Jean-Yves Girard]]'s logic LC it is easy to obtain a rather natural formalisation of classical logic where the RHS contains at most one formula; it is the interplay of the logical and structural rules that is the key here.

"Cut" is a rule in the normal statement of the [[sequent calculus]], and equivalent to a variety of rules in other [[proof theory|proof theories]], which, given

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Gamma \vdash A,\Delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

and 

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Pi, A \vdash \Lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

allows one to infer

&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma, \Pi \vdash \Delta,\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

That is, it "cuts" the occurrences of the formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; out of the inferential relation. 
==Cut elimination==
The cut-elimination theorem states that (for a given system) any sequent provable using the rule Cut can be proved without use of this rule.

For sequent calculi that have only one formula in the RHS, the "Cut" rule reads, given

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Gamma \vdash A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

and 

&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Pi, A \vdash B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

allows one to infer

&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Gamma, \Pi \vdash B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

If we think of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; as a theorem, then cut-elimination in this case simply says that a lemma &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; used to prove this theorem can be inlined. Whenever the theorem's proof mentions [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we can substitute the occurrences for the proof of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, the cut rule is [[admissible rule|admissible]].

==Consequences of the theorem==

For systems formulated in the sequent calculus, [[analytic proof]]s are those proofs that do not use Cut. Typically such a proof will be longer, of course, and not necessarily trivially so. In his essay "Don't Eliminate Cut!" [[George Boolos]] demonstrated that there was a derivation that could be completed in a page using cut, but whose analytic proof could not be completed in the lifespan of the universe.

The theorem has many, rich consequences:
* A system is [[consistency proof|inconsistent]] if it admits a proof of the absurd. If the system has a cut elimination theorem, then if it has a proof of the absurd, or of the empty sequent,  it should also have a proof of the absurd (or   the empty sequent), without cuts. It is typically very easy  to check that there are no such proofs. Thus, once a system is shown to have a cut elimination theorem, it is normally immediate that the system is consistent.
* Normally also the system has, at least in first order logic,  the [[subformula property]], an important property in several approaches to [[proof-theoretic semantics]].

Cut elimination is one of the most powerful tools for proving [[Craig interpolation|interpolation theorem]]s.  The possibility of carrying out proof search based on [[First-order resolution|resolution]], the essential insight leading to the [[Prolog]] programming language, depends upon the admissibility of Cut in the appropriate system.

For proof systems based on  [[higher-order typed lambda calculus]] through a [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]], cut elimination algorithms correspond to the strong normalization property (every proof term reduces in a finite number of steps into a [[normal form (term rewriting)|normal form]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10626">'''Dialetheism''' (di-alethe-ism is greek for two-truth-(belief in)) is the view that there are [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are both true and false. More precisely, it is the belief that there can be a true statement whose [[negation]] is also true. Such statements are called "true [[contradiction]]s", ''dialetheia'', or [[nondualism]]s.

Dialetheism is not a [[formal system|system of formal logic]]; instead, it is a thesis about [[truth]] that influences the construction of a formal logic, often based on pre-existing systems. Introducing dialetheism has various [[logical consequence|consequences]], depending on the theory into which it is introduced. A common mistake resulting from this is to reject dialetheism on the basis that, in traditional systems of logic (e.g., [[classical logic]] and [[intuitionistic logic]]), every statement becomes false if a contradiction is true; this means that such systems become [[trivialism|trivial]] when dialetheism is included as an axiom.&lt;ref name=Why&gt;Ben Burgis, Visiting Professor of Philosophy at the University of Ulsan in South Korea, in (Blog&amp;~Blog) http://blogandnot-blog.blogspot.co.za/2007/11/why-contradictions-dont-explode-or-how.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other logical systems, however, do not [[principle of explosion|explode]] in this manner when contradictions are introduced; such contradiction-tolerant systems are known as [[paraconsistent logic]]s. Dialetheists who do not want to allow that every statement is true are free to favour these over traditional, explosive logics.

[[Graham Priest]] defines dialetheism as the view that there are true contradictions.&lt;ref name="Dialetheism, logical consequence and hierarchy"&gt;Whittle, Bruno. "Dialetheism, logical consequence and hierarchy." &lt;u&gt;Analysis&lt;/u&gt; Vol. 64 Issue 4 (2004): 318–326.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jc Beall]] is another advocate; his position differs from Priest's in advocating constructive (methodological) [[deflationism]] regarding the truth predicate.&lt;ref name="True and False-As If,"&gt;Jc Beall in ''The Law of Non-Contradiction: New Philosophical Essays'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;197–219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations==

===Dialetheism resolves certain paradoxes===
The [[liar paradox|Liar's paradox]] and [[Russell's paradox]] deal with self-contradictory statements in classical logic and [[naïve set theory]], respectively. Contradictions are problematic in these theories because they cause the theories to [[principle of explosion|explode]]—if a contradiction is true, then every proposition is true. The classical way to solve this problem is to ban contradictory statements, to revise the axioms of the logic so that self-contradictory statements do not appear. Dialetheists, on the other hand, respond to this problem by accepting the contradictions as true. Dialetheism allows for the unrestricted [[Axiom schema of specification#Unrestricted comprehension|axiom of comprehension]] in [[set theory]], claiming that any resulting contradiction is a [[theorem]].&lt;ref name="Transfinite Numbers in Paraconsistent Set Theory"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Transfinite Numbers in Paraconsistent Set Theory&lt;/u&gt; (Review of Symbolic Logic 3(1), 2010), pp.&amp;nbsp;71-92..&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human reasoning===

Ambiguous situations may cause humans to affirm both a proposition and its negation. For example, if John stands in the doorway to a room, it may seem reasonable both to affirm that ''John is in the room'' and to affirm that ''John is not in the room''.

Critics argue that this merely reflects an ambiguity in our language rather than a dialetheic quality in our thoughts; if we replace the given statement with one that is less ambiguous (such as "John is halfway in the room" or "John is in the doorway"), the contradiction disappears. The statements appeared contradictory only because of a syntactic play; here, the actual meaning of "being in the room" is not the same in both instances, and thus each sentence is not the exact logical negation of the other: therefore, they are not necessarily contradictory.

===Apparent dialetheism in other philosophical doctrines===
The [[Jain]] philosophical doctrine of [[anekantavada]]—non-one-sidedness—states that all statements are true in some sense and false in another.&lt;ref&gt;Matilal, Bimal Krishna. (1998), "The character of logic in India" (Albany, State University of New York press), 127-139&lt;/ref&gt; Some interpret this as saying that dialetheia not only exist but are ubiquitous. Technically, however, a ''logical contradiction'' is a proposition that is true and false in the ''same'' sense; a proposition which is true in one sense and false in another does not constitute a logical contradiction. (For example, although in one sense a man cannot both be a "father" and "celibate"—leaving aside such cases as a celibate man adopting a child or a man fathering a child and only later adopting celibacy—there is no contradiction for a man to be a ''spiritual'' father and also celibate; the sense of the word father is different here. In another example, although at the same time George W. Bush cannot both be President and not be President, he was President from 2001-2009, but was not President before 2001 or after 2009, so in different times he was both President and not President.)

The [[Buddhist]] logic system named [[Catuṣkoṭi]] similarly implies that a statement and its negation may possibly co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/nagarjun/#H2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed : Ganeri, J. (2002), "The Collected Essays
of [[Bimal Krishna Matilal]]: Mind, Language and World" (Oxford University Press), 77-79&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Graham Priest]] argues in ''Beyond the Limits of Thought'' that dialetheia arise at the borders of expressibility, in a number of philosophical contexts other than formal semantics.

==Formal consequences==
In classical logics, taking a contradiction &lt;math&gt;p \wedge \neg p&lt;/math&gt; (see [[List of logic symbols]]) as a premise (that is, taking as a premise the truth of both &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;), allows us to prove any statement &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, since &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is true, the statement &lt;math&gt;p \vee q&lt;/math&gt; is true (by generalization). Taking &lt;math&gt;p \vee q&lt;/math&gt; together with &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt; is a disjunctive syllogism from which we can conclude &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. (This is often called the ''[[principle of explosion]]'', since the truth of a contradiction is imagined to make the number of theorems in a system "explode".)&lt;ref name="Why"/&gt;

==Advantages==
The proponents of dialetheism mainly advocate its ability to avoid problems faced by other more orthodox resolutions as a consequence of their appeals to hierarchies. According to Graham Priest, "the whole point of the dialetheic solution to the semantic paradoxes is to get rid of the distinction between object language and meta-language".&lt;ref name="Dialetheism, logical consequence and hierarchy"/&gt; Another possibility is to utilize dialetheism along with a [[paraconsistent logic]] to resurrect the program of [[logicism]] advocated for by Frege and Russell.&lt;ref name="Inconsistent Mathematics"&gt;Mortensen, Chris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/mathematics-inconsistent/ "Inconsistent Mathematics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; This even allows one to prove the truth of otherwise unprovable theorems such as the [[well-ordering theorem]] and the falsity of others such as the [[continuum hypothesis]].

There are also dialetheic solutions to the [[sorites paradox]].

==Criticisms==
One criticism of dialetheism is that it fails to capture a crucial feature about [[negation]], known as absoluteness of disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=W.w|title=Against Classical Dialetheism|journal=Frontiers of Philosophy in China|date=2011|volume=6|issue=3|pages=492–500|doi=10.1007/s11466-011-0152-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imagine John's utterance of ''P''.  Sally's typical way of disagreeing with John is a consequent utterance of ¬''P''.  Yet, if we accept dialetheism, Sally's so uttering does not prevent her from also accepting ''P''; after all, ''P'' may be a dialetheia and therefore it and its negation are both true.  The absoluteness of disagreement is lost.

A response is that disagreement can be displayed by uttering "¬''P'' and, furthermore, ''P'' is not a dialetheia". However, the most obvious codification of "''P'' is not a dialetheia" is ¬(''P'' &amp; ¬''P'').  But what if ''this itself'' is a dialetheia as well?  One dialetheist response is to offer a distinction between [[Logical assertion|assertion]] and rejection.  This distinction might be hashed out in terms of the traditional distinction between [[logical quality|logical qualities]], or as a distinction between two [[illocutionary force|illocutionary]] [[speech acts]]: [[Logical assertion|assertion]] and rejection. Another criticism is that dialetheism cannot describe logical consequences, once we believe in the relevance of logical consequences,  because of its inability to describe hierarchies.&lt;ref name="Dialetheism, logical consequence and hierarchy"/&gt;

'''''Educational Studies in Mathematics''''' is a peer-reviewed [[scientific journal]] within the field of [[mathematics education]]. Founded by [[Hans Freudenthal]], it first appeared in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://springerlink.metapress.com/content/h43621764274/?p=05d0c21e811b4a7eb72ea7adce02cbb3&amp;pi=218 Link to the first issue]&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], the journal normally appears in 3 annual volumes, each consisting of 3 issues. The journal is [[Journal pagination|paginated]] by volume.

According to the official description of the journal, it "emphasizes high-level articles that go beyond local or national interest", and a typical article deals with "didactical, methodological and pedagogical subjects, rather than with specific programs for teaching mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/education/mathematics+education/journal/10649 Description at the official journal web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal was listed in ISI and received an [[impact factor]] (of 0.549) for the first time in 2012.

'''Eugenius Nulty''' (1790 – July 3, 1871) was an Irish born American mathematician of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Cajori "The Teaching and History of Mathematics in the United States", Vol. 890-893 (Circulars of Information, United States Bureau of Education, ''The Teaching and History of Mathematics in the United States'', Florian Cajori, Issue 3 of U.S. Bureau of Education, circular of information, 1890, No. 3) Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1890), pages 95-96&lt;/ref&gt; He served on the faculty of [[Dickinson College]] from 1814 to 1816, and later taught and tutored prominent Philadelphians, including the brothers [[Mathew Carey Lea]] and [[Henry Charles Lea]].

==Career==
After arriving in the [[United States]] from his native [[Ireland]], Nulty quickly became ensconced as a member of the new nation’s small intelligentsia. Contemporaries described him as “brilliant”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/histories/sellers/chapter_seven.htm#157] Charles Coleman Sellers ''Dickinson College A History'' Middletown: Wesleyan University Press (1973) {{ISBN|9780819540577}}, pages 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Henry Morgan ''Dickinson College'' Mount Pleasant Press, J.

In 1814, Nulty became a professor of mathematics at [[Dickinson College]], where he remained for two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicles.dickinson.edu/encyclo/f/faculty/] ''Encyclopedia Dickinsonia'' Faculty Index 1783–&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Francis Himes ''A Sketch of Dickinson College, Carlisle, Penn’a'' Harrisburg: Lane S. Hart (1879), p 152&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816 he moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] at the invitation of The Philadelphia Life Insurance Company and the Pennsylvania Company, who each recruited Nulty as one of the first U.S. actuarial scientists.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Moorhead “Sketches of Early North American Actuaries” ''Transactions of Society of Actuaries'' Vol. 36 (1984) “JOSEPH ROBERTS, JR.” p 356;&lt;/ref&gt; His new countrymen also called Nulty to assist with mathematics for the U.S. Office of [[Coast Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Richard Slotten ''Patronage, Practice, and the Culture of American Science'' Cambridge University Press (1994) {{ISBN|9780521433952}}, p 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1817, Nulty was elected a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]]. In 1823, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] awarded Nulty an honorary A.M.&lt;ref&gt;Committee of the Society of the Alumni ''Graduates of the Departments of Arts and Sciences and of the Honorary Graduates of the University of Pennsylvania 1749–1880'' Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co. (1880), p 82&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected an Associate Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] 1832.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter N|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nulty was also a correspondent of mathematician, chemist and natural philosopher [[Robert Maskell Patterson|Robert M. Patterson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.P274-ead.xml] Robert M. Patterson Papers (1775–1853)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nulty contributed to the defunct ''Mathematical Diary'', one of the 3 earliest learned mathematical journals published in the U.S. His ''Elements of Geometry, theoretical and practical'' Philadelphia: J. Wetham (1836) was one of the first two or three original geometries published in the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/browse?type=lcsubc&amp;key=Geometry&amp;c=x] Online Books Library U. Penn&lt;/ref&gt; and is still over 150 years later available from multiple publishers in historical reprints.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenius Nulty ''Elements of Geometry, theoretical and practical'' (1836), reprint Ulan Press (June 4, 2011) BOOATT9698 ; Eugenius Nulty ''Elements of Geometry, theoretical and practical'' (1836), reprint BibloBazaar (August 21, 2008) {{ISBN|0554636344}}; Eugenius Nulty ''Elements of Geometry, theoretical and practical'' (1836), Kessinger Legacy Reprints (September 1, 2010) {{ISBN|1164731599}}; and others&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, P.J. Walker, director of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, called Nulty "unsurpassed at home or abroad" in pure mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_MoAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA447&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=eugenius+nulty+mathematician&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N3D13rcGC6&amp;sig=LP-zdbi8pWVRLbAgkkmzId2idRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-DaBUo-wL9SOkAfZ2YCwAQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=eugenius%20nulty%20mathematician&amp;f=false] ''Bulletins of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science'', Harvard College Copies, digitized by Google, printed at Washington: Gales and Seaton and others from 1840, "Proceedings of the Meeting of April, 1844", Opening Address by John Tyler, President of the United States and Patron of the National Institutes, in Introductory Address of the Hon.

In [[geometry]], '''fractal canopies''' are one of the easiest-to-create types of [[fractal]]s.  They are created by splitting a line segment into two smaller segments at the end, and then splitting the two smaller segments and as well, and so on, infinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Michael Betty|title=Fractals - Geometry between dimensions|newspaper=[[New Scientist]], Vol. 105, N. 1450|date=4 April 1985|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benoît B. Mandelbrot|title=The fractal geometry of nature|publisher=W.H. Freeman, 1983|isbn=0716711869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fractal canopy must have the following three properties:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
#The angle between any two neighboring line segments is the same throughout the fractal.
#The ratio of lengths of any two consecutive line segments is constant.
#Points all the way at the end of the smallest line segments are interconnected.

Ordinary [[trigonometry]] studies [[triangle]]s in the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. There are a number of ways of defining the ordinary [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean geometric]] [[trigonometric functions]] on [[real number]]s: [[trigonometric functions#Right-angled triangle definitions|right-angled triangle definitions]], [[trigonometric functions#Unit-circle definitions|unit-circle definitions]], [[trigonometric functions#Series definitions|series definitions]], [[trigonometric functions#Definitions via differential equations|definitions via differential equations]], [[trigonometric functions#Definitions using functional equations|definitions using functional equations]].  '''Generalizations of trigonometric functions''' are often developed by starting with one of the above methods and adapting it to a situation other than the real numbers of Euclidean geometry. Generally, trigonometry can be the study of triples of points in any kind of [[List of geometry topics#Types, methodologies, and terminologies of geometry|geometry]] or [[Space (mathematics)|space]]. A triangle is the [[polygon]] with the smallest number of vertices, so one direction to generalize is to study higher-dimensional analogs of angles and polygons: [[solid angle]]s and [[polytopes]] such as [[tetrahedron]]s and [[n-simplex|n-simplices]].

It was introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Vladimir|last=Drinfeld|authorlink=Vladimir Drinfeld|year=1990}} and named after [[Alexander Grothendieck]] and [[Oswald Teichmüller]], based on Grothendieck's suggestion in his [[Esquisse d'un Programme]] to study the absolute Galois group of the rationals by relating it to its action on the Teichmüller tower of Teichmüller groupoids ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''g'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[fundamental groupoid]]s of [[moduli stacks]] of genus ''g'' curves with ''n'' points removed. There are several minor variations of the group: a discrete version, a pro-''l'' version, a ''k''-pro-unipotent version, and a [[profinite group|profinite]] version; the first three versions were defined by Drinfeld, and the version most often used is the profinite version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8461">The '''Grzegorczyk hierarchy''' (pronounced: {{IPAc-pl|g|rz|e|'|g|o|r|cz|y|k}}), named after the Polish logician [[Andrzej Grzegorczyk]], is a hierarchy of functions used in [[computability theory]] (Wagner and Wechsung 1986:43). Every [[function (mathematics)|function]] in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy is a [[primitive recursive function]], and every primitive recursive function appears in the hierarchy at some level. The hierarchy deals with the rate at which the values of the functions grow; intuitively, functions in lower level of the hierarchy grow slower than functions in the higher levels. 

== Definition ==

First we introduce an infinite set of functions, denoted ''E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for some natural number ''i''. We define &lt;math&gt;E_0(x,y)=x+y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_1(x)=x^2+2&lt;/math&gt;. I.e., ''E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the addition function, and ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a unary function which squares its argument and adds two. Then, for each ''n'' greater than 1, we define &lt;math&gt;E_n(x)=E^{x}_{n-1}(2)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the ''x''-th [[iterated function|iterate]] of &lt;math&gt;E_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; evaluated at 2.

From these functions we define the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n''-th set in the hierarchy, contains the following functions:
# ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for ''k'' &lt; ''n''
# the zero function (''Z''(''x'') = 0);
# the [[successor function]] (''S''(''x'') = ''x'' + 1);
# the [[projection function]]s (&lt;math&gt; p_i^m(t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m) = t_i &lt;/math&gt;);
# the (generalized) [[function composition|compositions of functions]] in the set (if ''h'', ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;  are in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f(\bar{u}) = h(g_1(\bar{u}), g_2(\bar{u}), \dots, g_m(\bar{u})) &lt;/math&gt; is as well)&lt;ref group=note name="tuple notation"/&gt;; and
# the results of limited (primitive) recursion applied to functions in the set, (if ''g'', ''h'' and ''j'' are in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(t, \bar{u}) \leq j(t, \bar{u})&lt;/math&gt; for all ''t'' and &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;, and further &lt;math&gt;f(0, \bar{u}) = g(\bar{u})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(t+1, \bar{u}) = h(t,\bar{u},f(t,\bar{u}))&lt;/math&gt;, then ''f'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt; as well)&lt;ref group=note name="tuple notation"/&gt;

In other words, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of set &lt;math&gt;B_n = \{Z, S, (p_i^m)_{i \le m}, E_k : k &lt; n\}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to function composition and limited recursion (as defined above).

== Properties ==

These sets clearly form the hierarchy
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}^0 \subseteq \mathcal{E}^1 \subseteq \mathcal{E}^2 \subseteq \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
because they are closures over the &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;'s and &lt;math&gt; B_0 \subseteq B_1 \subseteq B_2 \subseteq \cdots&lt;/math&gt;.

They are strict subsets (Rose 1984; Gakwaya 1997). In other words
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}^0 \subsetneq \mathcal{E}^1 \subsetneq \mathcal{E}^2 \subsetneq \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
because the [[hyper operation]] &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt; but not in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^0&lt;/math&gt; includes functions such as ''x''+1, ''x''+2, ... 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^1&lt;/math&gt; provides all addition functions, such as ''x''+''y'', 4''x'', ...
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^2&lt;/math&gt; provides all multiplication functions, such as ''xy'', ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^3&lt;/math&gt; provides all exponentiation functions, such as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and is exactly the [[ELEMENTARY|elementary recursive functions]].
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^4&lt;/math&gt; provides all [[tetration]] functions, and so on.

Notably, both the function &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and the characteristic function of the predicate &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; from the [[Kleene normal form theorem]] are definable in a way such that they lie at level &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^0&lt;/math&gt; of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. This implies in particular that every recursively enumerable set is enumerable by some &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^0&lt;/math&gt;-function.

== Relation to primitive recursive functions ==

The definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that of the [[primitive recursive function]]s, {{sans-serif|PR}}, except that recursion is ''limited'' (&lt;math&gt;f(t, \bar{u}) \leq j(t, \bar{u})&lt;/math&gt; for some ''j'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;) and the functions &lt;math&gt;(E_k)_{k&lt;n}&lt;/math&gt; are explicitly included in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the Grzegorczyk hierarchy can be seen as a way to ''limit'' the power of primitive recursion to different levels.

It is clear from this fact that all functions in any level of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy are primitive recursive functions (i.e. &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}^n \subseteq \mathsf{PR} &lt;/math&gt;) and thus:
:&lt;math&gt; \bigcup_n{\mathcal{E}^n} \subseteq \mathsf{PR} &lt;/math&gt;

It can also be shown that all primitive recursive functions are in some level of the hierarchy (Rose 1984; Gakwaya 1997), thus
:&lt;math&gt; \bigcup_n{\mathcal{E}^n} = \mathsf{PR} &lt;/math&gt;
and the sets &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}^0, \mathcal{E}^1 - \mathcal{E}^0, \mathcal{E}^2 - \mathcal{E}^1, \dots, \mathcal{E}^n - \mathcal{E}^{n-1}, \dots &lt;/math&gt; [[partition of a set|partition]] the set of primitive recursive functions, {{sans-serif|PR}}.

== Extensions ==
{{main|Fast-growing hierarchy}}

The Grzegorczyk hierarchy can be extended to [[Transfinite number|transfinite]] [[Ordinal number|ordinals]]. Such extensions define a [[fast-growing hierarchy]]. To do this, the generating functions &lt;math&gt;E_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; must be recursively defined for limit ordinals (note they have already been recursively defined for successor ordinals by the relation &lt;math&gt; E_{\alpha+1}(n) = E_\alpha^n(2) &lt;/math&gt;). If there is a standard way of defining a ''fundamental sequence'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda_m&lt;/math&gt;, whose [[limit ordinal]] is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then the generating functions can be defined &lt;math&gt; E_\lambda(n) = E_{\lambda_n}(n) &lt;/math&gt;. However, this definition depends upon a standard way of defining the fundamental sequence. Rose (1984) suggests a standard way for all ordinals α &lt; [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].

The original extension was due to [[Martin Löb]] and [[Stan S. Wainer]] (1970) and is sometimes called the [[Löb–Wainer hierarchy]].

== Notes ==
{{reflist|group=note|refs=

&lt;ref name="tuple notation"&gt;Here &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; represents a [[tuple]] of inputs to ''f''. The notation &lt;math&gt;f(\bar{u})&lt;/math&gt; means that ''f'' takes some arbitrary [[arity|number of arguments]] and if &lt;math&gt;\bar{u} = (x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(\bar{u}) = f(x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;. In the notation &lt;math&gt;f(t, \bar{u})&lt;/math&gt;, the first argument, ''t'', is specified explicitly and the rest as the arbitrary tuple &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;\bar{u} = (x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(t, \bar{u}) = f(t, x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;. This notation allows composition and limited recursion to be defined for functions, ''f'', of any number of arguments.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2023">In mathematical [[harmonic analysis|abstract harmonic analysis]], '''Harish-Chandra's Schwartz space''' is a space of functions on a [[semisimple Lie group]] whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing, studied by {{harvs|txt|last=Harish-Chandra|authorlink=Harish-Chandra|year=1966|loc=section 9}}. It is an analogue of the [[Schwartz space]] on a real [[vector space]], and is used to define the space of [[tempered representation|tempered distributions]] on a semisimple Lie group.

==Definition==

The definition of the Schwartz space uses [[Harish-Chandra's Ξ function]] and his ''σ'' function. The ''σ'' function is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(x)=\|X\|&lt;/math&gt;
for ''x''=''k''&amp;nbsp;exp&amp;nbsp;''X'' with ''k'' in ''K'' and ''X'' in ''p'' for a [[Cartan decomposition]] ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&amp;nbsp;exp&amp;nbsp;''p'' of the Lie group ''G'', where ||''X''|| is a ''K''-invariant Euclidean norm on ''p'', usually chosen to be  the [[Killing form]]. {{harv|Harish-Chandra|1966|loc=section 7}}.

The Schwartz space on ''G'' consists roughly of the functions all of whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing compared to&amp;nbsp;''Ξ''. More precisely, if ''G'' is connected then the Schwartz space consists of all smooth functions ''f'' on ''G'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{(1+\sigma)^r|Df|}{\Xi}&lt;/math&gt;
is bounded, where ''D'' is a product of left-invariant and right-invariant differential operators on&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;{{harv|Harish-Chandra|1966|loc=section 9}}.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Harish-Chandra isomorphism''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=[[Harish-Chandra]]|year=1951}},
is an [[isomorphism]] of commutative rings constructed in the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s. The isomorphism maps the [[center (ring theory)|center]] ''Z''(''U''(''g'')) of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] ''U''(''g'') of a [[reductive Lie algebra]] ''g'' to the elements ''S''(''h'')&lt;sup&gt;''W''&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[symmetric algebra]] ''S''(''h'') of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] ''h'' that are invariant under the [[Weyl group]] ''W''.

==Fundamental invariants==

Let ''n'' be the '''rank''' of ''g'', which is the dimension of the Cartan subalgebra ''h''. [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] observed that ''S''(''h'')&lt;sup&gt;''W''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[polynomial ring|polynomial algebra]] in ''n'' variables (see [[Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem]] for a more general statement). Therefore, the center of the universal enveloping algebra of a reductive Lie algebra is a polynomial algebra. The degrees of the generators are the degrees of the fundamental invariants given in the following table.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Lie algebra || [[Coxeter number]] ''h'' || [[Dual Coxeter number]] || Degrees of fundamental invariants
|-
| '''R''' || 0 || 0 || 1
|-
| A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; || ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 || ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 || 2, 3, 4, ..., ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1

|}

For example, the center of the universal enveloping algebra of ''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a polynomial algebra on generators of degrees 2 and 6.

==Examples==
*If ''g'' is the Lie algebra ''sl''(2, '''R'''), then the center of the universal enveloping algebra is generated by the [[Casimir invariant]] of degree 2, and the Weyl group acts on the Cartan subalgebra, which is isomorphic to '''R''', by negation, so the invariant of the Weyl group is simply the square of the generator of the Cartan subalgebra, which is also of degree 2.

== Introduction and setting ==
Let ''g'' be a [[semisimple Lie algebra]], ''h'' its [[Cartan subalgebra]] and λ, μ &amp;isin; ''h''* be two elements of the [[weight space]] and assume that a set of [[Positive root#Positive roots and simple roots|positive roots]] Φ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have been fixed. Let ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, resp. ''V''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; be [[highest weight module]]s with highest weight λ, resp. μ.

=== Central characters ===
The ''g''-modules ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; are representations of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] ''U''(''g'') and its [[center (algebra)|center]] acts on the modules by scalar multiplication (this follows from the fact that the modules are generated by a highest weight vector). So, for ''v'' in ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x'' in ''Z''(''U''(''g'')),
:&lt;math&gt;x\cdot v:=\chi_\lambda(x)v&lt;/math&gt;
and similarly for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;.

The functions &lt;math&gt;\chi_\lambda, \,\chi_\mu&lt;/math&gt; are homomorphims to scalars called ''central characters''.

==Statement of Harish-Chandra theorem==
For any  λ, μ &amp;isin; ''h''*, the characters &lt;math&gt;\chi_\lambda=\chi_\mu&lt;/math&gt; if and only if λ+δ and μ+δ are on the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of the [[Weyl group]] of ''h''*, where δ is the half-sum of the [[positive root]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys (1972), p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

Another closely related formulation is that the [[Harish-Chandra homomorphism]] from the center of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] ''Z''(''U''(''g'')) to ''S''(''h'')&lt;sup&gt;''W''&lt;/sup&gt; (the elements of the symmetric algebra of the Cartan subalgebra fixed by the Weyl group) is an [[isomorphism]].

== Applications ==
The theorem may be used to obtain a simple algebraic proof of [[Weyl's character formula]] for finite-dimensional representations.

Further, it is a necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero homomorphism of some highest weight modules (a homomorphism of such modules preserves central character). A simple consequence is that for [[Verma module]]s or [[generalized Verma module]]s ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; with highest weight λ, there exist only finitely many weights μ such that  a nonzero homomorphism ''V''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; → ''V''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; exists.

'''Herta Freitag''' (December 6, 1908 – January 25, 2000) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]]-American mathematician, a professor of mathematics at [[Hollins University|Hollins College]], known for her work on the [[Fibonacci numbers]].
== Life ==
She was born as Herta Taussig in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. She earned a master's degree from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1934 and took a teaching position at the university. However, her father (the editor of ''Die Neue Freie Presse'') had publicly opposed the Nazis, so in 1938 she and her parents emigrated to England, taking a job as a maid because the English immigration laws prevented her from entering the country as a teacher. In 1944 she, her brother (the conductor [[Walter Taussig]]) and her mother moved to the United States (her father having died a year earlier), and began teaching mathematics again at the [[Greer School]] in upstate New York.

She earned a second master's degree in 1948 from [[Columbia University]], and a doctorate from Columbia in 1953. Meanwhile, in 1948, she had joined the faculty at Hollins, where she eventually became a full professor and department chair. In 1962 she served as a section president for the [[Mathematical Association of America]], the first woman in her section to do so. She retired in 1971, but returned to teaching again in 1979 after the death of her husband, Arthur Freitag, whom she had married in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Freitag|title=Herta Taussig Freitag|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/freitag.htm|title=Herta Taussig Freitag|series=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|first=Larry|last=Riddle|publisher=[[Agnes Scott College]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her retirement, she became a frequent contributor to the ''[[Fibonacci Quarterly]]'', and the journal honored her in 1996 by dedicating an issue to her on the occasion of her 89th birthday (89 being a Fibonacci number).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/34-5/dedication.pdf|title=Dedication to Herta Taussig Freitag|journal=[[Fibonacci Quarterly]]|year=1996|page=467|volume=34|issue=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2206">In [[algebra]], the '''Hochster–Roberts theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last1=Hochster|last2=Roberts|year=1974}},  
states that rings of invariants of linearly [[reductive group]]s acting on [[regular ring]]s are [[Cohen–Macaulay ring|Cohen–Macaulay]].

In other words,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mumford|1994|loc=pg. 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:If ''V'' is a rational representation of a linearly reductive group ''G'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', then there exist algebraically independent invariant homogeneous polynomials &lt;math&gt;f_1, \cdots, f_d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;k[V]^G&lt;/math&gt; is a free finite [[graded module]] over &lt;math&gt;k[f_1, \cdots, f_d]&lt;/math&gt;.

{{harvtxt|Boutot|1987}} proved that if a variety over a field of characteristic 0 has [[rational singularity|rational singularities]] then so does its quotient by the action of a reductive group; this implies the Hochster–Roberts theorem in characteristic 0 as rational singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.

In characteristic ''p''&gt;0, there are examples of groups that are reductive (or even finite) acting on polynomial rings whose rings of invariants are not Cohen–Macaulay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19999">In mathematics, a '''hyperbolic metric space''' is a [[metric space]] satisfying certain metric relations (depending quantitatively on a nonnegative real number δ) between points. The definition, introduced by [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhael Gromov]], generalizes the metric properties of classical [[hyperbolic geometry]] and of [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]]. Hyperbolicity is a large-scale property, and is very useful to the study of certain infinite [[group (mathematics)|groups]] called (Gromov-)[[hyperbolic group]]s.

== Definitions ==

In this paragraph we give various definitions of a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space. A metric space is said to be (Gromov-) hyperbolic if it is &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic for some &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Definition using the Gromov product ===
{{Main article | Gromov product}}

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. The [[Gromov product]] of two points &lt;math&gt;y, z \in X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a third one &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;(y,z)_x = \frac 1 2 \left( d(x, y) + d(x, z) - d(y, z) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Gromov's definition of a hyperbolic metric space is then as follows: &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic if and only if all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z,w \in X&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the ''four-point condition''

:&lt;math&gt; (x,z)_w \ge \min \left( (x,y)_w, (y,z)_w \right) - \delta&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if this condition is satisfied for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in X&lt;/math&gt; and one fixed base point &lt;math&gt;w_0&lt;/math&gt;, then it is satisified for all &lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt; with a constant &lt;math&gt;2\delta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coornaert|Delzant|Papadopoulos|1990|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the hyperbolicity condition only needs to be verified for one fixed base point; for this reason, the subscript for the base point is often dropped from the Gromov product.

=== Definitions using triangles ===
{{see also|Ideal triangle|Hyperbolic triangle}}

Up to changing &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; by a constant multiple, there is an equivalent geometric definition involving triangles when the metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''geodesic'', i.e. any two points &lt;math&gt;x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; are end points of a geodesic segment &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt; (an isometric image of a compact subinterval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; of the reals). {{sfn|de la Harpe|Ghys|1990|loc=Chapitre 2, Proposition 21}}{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter III.H, Proposition 1.22}} {{sfn|Coorneart|Delzant|Papadopoulos|pages=6–8}} Note that the definition via Gromov products does not require the space to be geodesic.

Let &lt;math&gt;x, y, z \in X&lt;/math&gt;. A geodesic triangle with vertices &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; is the union of three geodesic segments &lt;math&gt;[x,y], [y,z], [z,x]&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;[p,q]&lt;/math&gt; denotes a segment with endpoints &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;).

{{Annotation|80|135|&lt;math&gt;B_\delta([y,z])&lt;/math&gt;}}
}}

If for any point &lt;math&gt;m \in [x,y]&lt;/math&gt; there is a point in &lt;math&gt;[y,z] \cup [z,x]&lt;/math&gt; at distance less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly for points on the other edges, and &lt;math&gt;\delta \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; then the triangle is said to be ''&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-slim'' .

A definition of a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space is then a geodesic metric space all of whose geodesic triangles are &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-slim. This definition is generally credited to [[Eliyahu Rips]].

Another definition can be given using the notion of a &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-approximate center of a geodesic triangle: this is a point which is at distance at most &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of any edge of the triangle (an "approximate" version of the [[incenter]]). A space is &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic if every geodesic triangle has a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-center.

These two definitions of a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space using geodesic triangles are not exactly equivalent, but there exists &lt;math&gt;k &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space in the first sense is &lt;math&gt; k \cdot \delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic in the second, and vice versa.{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter III.H, Proposition 1.17}} Thus the notion of an hyperbolic space is independent of the chosen definition.

=== Examples ===
[[File:Inkreis mit Strecken.svg|right|250px]]
The [[hyperbolic plane]] is hyperbolic: in fact the [[incircle]] of a geodesic triangle is the circle of largest diameter contained in the triangle and every geodesic triangle lies in the interior of an ideal triangle, all of which are isometric with incircles of diameter 2 log 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coornaert|Delzant|Papadopoulos|1990|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that in this case the Gromov product also has a simple interpretation in terms of the incircle of a geodesic triangle. In fact the quantity {{math|(''A'',''B'')&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is just the hyperbolic distance {{math|''p''}} from {{math|''C''}} to either of the points of contact of the incircle with the adjacent sides: for from the diagram {{math|1= ''c'' = (''a'' – ''p'') + (''b'' – ''p'')}}, so that 
{{math|1=''p'' = (''a'' + ''b'' – ''c'')/2 = (''A'',''B'')&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coornaert|Delzant|Papadopoulos|1990|page=1–2s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Euclidean plane]] is not hyperbolic, for example because of the existence of [[Homothetic transformation|homotheties]].

Two "degenerate" examples of hyperbolic spaces are spaces with bounded diameter (for example finite or compact spaces) and the real line.

Metric [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] and more generally [[real tree]]s are the simplest interesting examples of hyperbolic spaces as they are 0-hyperbolic (i.e. all triangles are tripods).

The 1-skeleton of the triangulation by Euclidean equilateral triangles is not hyperbolic (it is in fact quasi-isometric to the Euclidean plane). A triangulation of the plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt; has an hyperbolic 1-skeleton if every vertex has degree 7 or more.

The two-dimensional grid is not hyperbolic (it is quasi-isometric to the Euclidean plane). It is the [[Cayley graph]] of the [[fundamental group]] of the [[torus]]; the Cayley graphs of the fundamental groups of a surface of higher genus is hyperbolic (it is in fact quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane).

=== Hyperbolicity and curvature ===

The hyperbolic plane (and more generally any [[Hadamard manifold]]s of [[sectional curvature]] &lt;math&gt;\le -1&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic. If we scale the Riemannian metric by a factor &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; then the distances are multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and thus we get a space that is &lt;math&gt;\lambda\cdot\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic. Since the curvature is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; we see that in this example "the more (negatively) curved the space is, the more hyperbolic it is (measured by its hyperbolicity constant &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;)".

Similar examples are [[CAT space]]s of negative curvature. With respect to curvature and hyperbolicity it should be noted however that while curvature is a property that is essentially local, hyperbolicity is a large-scale property which does not see local (i.e. happening in a bounded region) metric phenomena. For example, the union of an hyperbolic space with a compact space with any metric extending the original ones remains hyperbolic.

== Important properties ==

=== Invariance under quasi-isometry ===

One way to precise the meaning of "large scale" is to require invariance under [[quasi-isometry]]. This is true of hyperbolicity.

:''If a geodesic metric space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is quasi-isometric to a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; then there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic.''

The constant &lt;math&gt;\delta'&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and on the multiplicative and additive constants for the quasi-isometry.{{sfn|de la Harpe|Ghys|1990|loc=Chapitre 5, Proposition 15}}

=== Approximate trees in hyperbolic spaces ===

The definition of an hyperbolic space in terms of the Gromov product can be seen as saying that the metric relations between any four points are the same as they would be in a tree, up to the additive constant &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. More generally the following property shows that any finite subset of an hyperbolic space looks like a finite tree.

:''For any &lt;math&gt;n, \delta&lt;/math&gt; there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that the following holds: if &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; are points in a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-hyperbolic space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; there is a finite tree &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and an embedding &lt;math&gt;f : T \to X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i \in f(T)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt; and 
::&lt;math&gt;\forall i, j : d(f^{-1}(x_i), f^{-1}(x_j)) \le d(x_i, x_j) \le d(f^{-1}(x_i), f^{-1}(x_j)) + C &lt;/math&gt;

The constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; can be taken to be &lt;math&gt;\delta \cdot h(n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h(n) = O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; and this is optimal.{{sfn|Bowditch|2006|loc=Chapter 6.4}}

=== Exponential growth of distance and isoperimetric inequalities ===

In an hyperbolic space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; we have the following property:{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter III.H, Proposition 1.25}}

:''There are &lt;math&gt;\mu, K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;p, x, y \in X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(p, x) = d(p, y) =: r&lt;/math&gt;, every path &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; joining &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and staying at distance at least &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; has length at least &lt;math&gt;e^{\mu \cdot d(x,y)} - K&lt;/math&gt;. ''

Informally this means that the circumference of a "circle" of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; grows exponentially with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. This is reminiscent of the [[Isoperimetric inequality#The isoperimetric problem in the plane|isoperimetric problem in the Euclidean plane]]. Here is a more specific statement to this effect.&lt;ref&gt;a more general statement is given in {{harvtxt|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter III.H, Proposition 2.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Suppose that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[cell complex]] of dimension 2 such that its 1-skeleton is hyperbolic, and there exists &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that the boundary of any 2-cell contains at most &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; 1-cells. Then there is a constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for any finite subcomplex &lt;math&gt;Y \subset X&lt;/math&gt; we have 
:: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{area}(Y) \le  \lambda \cdot \operatorname{length(\partial Y)} &lt;/math&gt;''

Here the area of a 2-complex is the number of 2-cells and the length of a 1-complex is the number of 1-cells. The statement above is a linear [[isoperimetric inequality]] ; it turns out that having such an isoperimetric inequality characterises Gromov-hyperbolic spaces.{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|loc=Chapter III.H, Theorem 2.9}} Linear isoperimetric inequalities were inspired by the [[Small cancellation theory|small cancellation]] conditions from [[combinatorial group theory]].

=== Quasiconvex subspaces ===

A subspace &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of a geodesic metric space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be quasiconvex if there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; such that any geodesic in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; between two points of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; stays within distance &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

:''A quasi-convex subspace of an hyperbolic space is hyperbolic.''

=== Asymptotic cones ===

All [[Ultralimit#Asymptotic cones|asymptotic cone]]s of an hyperbolic space are [[real tree]]s. This property characterises hyperbolic spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Dyubina (Erschler) | first1=Anna | last2=Polterovich | first2=Iosif | title=Explicit constructions of universal '''R'''-trees and asymptotic geometry of hyperbolic spaces | journal=Bull. London Math. Soc. | volume=33 | year=2001| pages=727–734 | mr=1853785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The boundary of a hyperbolic space ==

Generalising the construction of the [[End (graph theory)|ends]] of a simplicial tree there is a natural notion of boundary at infinity for hyperbolic spaces, which has proven very useful for analysing group actions.

In this paragraph &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a geodesic metric space which is hyperbolic.

=== Definition using the Gromov product ===

A sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n) \in X^{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''converge to infinity'' if for some (or any) point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;(x_n, x_m)_p \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; as both &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; go to infinity. Two sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_n), (y_n)&lt;/math&gt; converging to infinity are considered equivalent when &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to +\infty}(x_n, y_n)_p = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; (for some or any &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;). The ''boundary'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of equivalence classes of sequences which converge to infinity,{{sfn|de la Harpe|Ghys|1990|loc=Chapitre 7, page 120}} which is denoted &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\xi, \eta&lt;/math&gt; are two points on the boundary then their Gromov product is defined to be:

:&lt;math&gt; (\xi, \eta) = \sup_{(x_n)=\xi, (y_n)=\eta} \left( \liminf_{n, m\to +\infty} (x_n, y_m)_p \right)&lt;/math&gt;

which is finite and does not depend on &lt;math&gt;p \in X&lt;/math&gt;. One can then define a topology on &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt; using the functions &lt;math&gt;(\cdot, \xi)&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|de la Harpe|Ghys|1990|loc=Chapitre 7, section 2}} This topology on &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt; is metrisable and there is a distinguished family of metrics defined using the Gromov product.{{sfn|de la Harpe|Ghys|1990|loc=Chapitre 7, section 3}}

=== Definition for proper spaces using rays ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; be two [[Quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric embedding]]s of &lt;math&gt;[0, +\infty[&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ("quasi-geodesic rays"). They are considered equivalent if and only if the function &lt;math&gt;t \mapsto d(\alpha(t), \beta(t))&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on &lt;math&gt;[0, +\infty[&lt;/math&gt;. If the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is proper then the set of all such embeddings modulo equivalence with its natural topology is homeomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt; as defined above.{{sfn |de la Harpe|Ghys|1990|loc=Chapitre 7, Proposition 4}}

A similar realisation is to fix a basepoint and consider only quasi-geodesic rays originating from this point. In case &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is geodesic and proper one can also restrict to genuine geodesic rays.

=== Examples ===

When &lt;math&gt;X = T&lt;/math&gt; is a simplicial regular tree the boundary is just the space of ends, which is a Cantor set. Fixing a point &lt;math&gt;x \in T&lt;/math&gt; yields a natural distance on &lt;math&gt;\partial T&lt;/math&gt;: two points represented by rays &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta&lt;/math&gt; originating at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; are at distance &lt;math&gt;\exp(-\operatorname{Length}(\alpha \cap \beta))&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the unit disk, i.e. the [[Poincaré disk model]] for the hyperbolic plane,  the hyperbolic metric on the disk is

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2 = {4|dz|^2\over (1-|z|^2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the Gromov boundary can be identified with the unit circle.

The boundary of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional hyperbolic space is homeomorphic to the &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional sphere and the metrics are similar to the one above.

=== Busemann functions ===

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is proper then its boundary is homeomorphic to the space of [[Busemann function]]s on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; modulo translations.{{sfn|Bridson|Haefliger|1999|p=428}}

=== The action of isometries on the boundary and their classification ===

A quasi-isometry between two hyperbolic spaces &lt;math&gt;X, Y&lt;/math&gt; induces a homeomorphism between the boundaries.

In particular the group of isometries of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; acts by homeomorphisms on &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt;. This action can be used{{sfn |de la Harpe| Ghys |1990|loc=Chapitre 8}} to classify isometries according to their dynamical behaviour on the boundary, generalising that for trees and classical hyperbolic spaces. Let &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; be an isometry of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then one of the following cases occur:

*First case: &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has a bounded orbit on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (in case &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is proper this implies that &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has a fixed point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;). Then it is called an ''elliptic'' isometry.
*Second case: &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has exactly two fixed points &lt;math&gt;\xi_+, \xi_-&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial X&lt;/math&gt; and every positive orbit &lt;math&gt;\{g^n\xi : n \ge 0\}, \xi \not= \xi_-&lt;/math&gt; accumulates only at &lt;math&gt;\xi_+&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''hyperbolic'' isometry.
*Third case: &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one fixed point on the boundary and all orbits accumulate at this point. Then it is called a ''parabolic'' isometry.

== More examples ==

Subsets of the theory of [[hyperbolic group]]s can be used to give more examples of hyperbolic spaces, for instance the [[Cayley graph]] of a [[Small cancellation theory|small cancellation group]]. It is also known that the Cayley graphs of certain models of [[random group]]s (which is in effect a randomly-generated infinite regular graph) tend to be hyperbolic very often.

It can be difficult and interesting to prove that certain spaces are hyperbolic. For example, the following hyperbolicity results have led to new phenomena being discovered for the groups acting on them.

*The hyperbolicity of the [[curve complex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Masur | first1=Howard A. | last2=Minsky | first2=Yair N. | title=Geometry of the complex of curves. I. Hyperbolicity | journal=Invent. Math. | volume=138 | year=1999 | pages=103–149| mr=1714338}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to new results on the mapping class group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Dahmani|first1=François|last2=Guirardel|first2=Vincent|last3=Osin|first3=Denis|title=Hyperbolically embedded subgroups and rotating families in groups acting on hyperbolic spaces|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1111.7048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Similarly, the hyperbolicity of certain graphs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1=Bestvina | first1=Mladen | last2=Feighn | first2=Mark | title=Hyperbolicity of the complex of free factors | journal=Adv. Math. |volume=256 | year=2014 | pages=104–155 | mr=3177291}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated to the outer automorphism group [[Out(Fn)]] has led to new results on this group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18070">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[multivariable calculus]], the '''implicit function theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;Also called '''[[Ulisse Dini|Dini]]'s theorem''' by the Pisan school in Italy. In the English-language literature, [[Dini's theorem]] is a different theorem in mathematical analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool that allows [[relation (mathematics)#Formal definition|relations]] to be converted to [[functions of several real variables]].  It does so by representing the relation as the [[graph of a function]].  There may not be a single function whose graph can represent the entire relation, but there may be such a function on a restriction of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the relation.  The implicit function theorem gives a sufficient condition to ensure that there is such a function.

More precisely, given a system of {{mvar|m}} equations {{math|1=''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''{{space|hair}}(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') = 0,  ''i'' = 1, ..., ''m''}} (often abbreviated into  {{math|1=''F''('''x''', '''y''') = 0}}), the theorem states that, under a mild condition on the [[partial derivative]]s (with respect to the  {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}s) at a point, the {{mvar|m}} variables {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are differentiable functions of the {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in some [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the point. As these functions can generally not be expressed in [[closed form expression|closed form]], they are ''implicitly'' defined by the equations, and this motivated the name of the theorem.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Chiang|1984|pages=204–206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, under a mild condition on the partial derivatives, the set of [[zero of a function|zeros]] of a system of equations is [[local property|locally]] the [[graph of a function]].

== History ==
[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] (1789–1857) is credited with the first rigorous form of the implicit function theorem.  [[Ulisse Dini]] (1845–1918) generalized the real-variable version of the implicit function theorem to the context of functions of any number of real variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Krantz |first2=Harold |last2=Parks |title=The Implicit Function Theorem |series=Modern Birkhauser Classics |publisher=Birkhauser |location= |year=2003 |isbn=0-8176-4285-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ya5yy5EPFD0C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First example ==
[[Image:Implicit circle.svg|thumb|right|200px|The unit circle can be specified as the level curve ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 1 of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x^2 + y^2.&lt;/math&gt; Around point A, ''y'' can be expressed as a function ''y''(''x''). In this example this function can be written explicitly as &lt;math&gt;g_1(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2};&lt;/math&gt; in many cases no such explicit expression exists, but one can still refer to the ''implicit'' function ''y''(''x'').  No such function exists around point B.]]
If we define the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)=x^2 + y^2&lt;/math&gt;, then the equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 1 cuts out the [[unit circle]] as the [[level set]] {(''x'', ''y'')| ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 1}. There is no way to represent the unit circle as the graph of a function of one variable ''y'' = ''g''(''x'') because for each choice of ''x'' ∈ (−1, 1), there are two choices of ''y'', namely &lt;math&gt;\pm\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, it is possible to represent ''part'' of the circle as the graph of a function of one variable.  If we let &lt;math&gt;g_1(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt; for −1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1, then the graph of &lt;math&gt;y = g_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; provides the upper half of the circle.  Similarly, if &lt;math&gt;g_2(x) = -\sqrt{1-x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, then the graph of &lt;math&gt;y = g_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; gives the lower half of the circle.

The purpose of the implicit function theorem is to tell us the existence of functions like &lt;math&gt;g_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, even in situations where we cannot write down explicit formulas.  It guarantees that &lt;math&gt;g_1(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; are differentiable, and it even works in situations where we do not have a formula for ''f''(''x'', ''y'').

== Definitions ==
Let ''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; be a [[continuously differentiable]] function.  We think of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; as the [[Cartesian product]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we write a point of this product as ('''x''', '''y''') = (''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''y&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''). Starting from the given function ''f'', our goal is to construct a function ''g'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; whose graph ('''x''', ''g''('''x''')) is precisely the set of all ('''x''', '''y''') such that ''f''('''x''', '''y''') = ''0''.

As noted above, this may not always be possible.  We will therefore fix a point ('''a''', '''b''') = (''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') which satisfies ''f''('''a''', '''b''') = 0, and we will ask for a ''g'' that works near the point ('''a''', '''b''').  In other words, we want an [[open set]] ''U'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; containing '''a''', an open set ''V'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; containing '''b''', and a function ''g'' : ''U'' → ''V'' such that the graph of ''g'' satisfies the relation ''f'' = 0 on ''U'' × ''V'', and that no other points within ''U'' × ''V'' do so.  In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;\{ (\mathbf{x}, g(\mathbf{x})) \mid \mathbf x \in U \} = \{ (\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\in U \times V \mid f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = 0 \}.&lt;/math&gt;

To state the implicit function theorem, we need the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'', which is the matrix of the [[partial derivative]]s of ''f''.  Abbreviating (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') to ('''a''', '''b'''), the Jacobian matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;(Df)(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) =  \left[\begin{matrix}
 \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) &amp;
    \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\\
 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
 \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})
\end{matrix}\right|\left.
\begin{matrix} 
 \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y_1}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y_m}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\\
 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial y_1}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial y_m}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\\
\end{matrix}\right] = [X|Y]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''X'' is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''Y'' is the matrix of partial derivatives in the variables ''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The implicit function theorem says that if ''Y'' is an invertible matrix, then there are ''U'', ''V'', and ''g'' as desired.  Writing all the hypotheses together gives the following statement.

== Statement of the theorem ==
Let ''f'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; be a [[continuously differentiable function]], and let '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''m''&lt;/sup&gt; have coordinates ('''x''', '''y''').  Fix a point ('''a''', '''b''') = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'') with ''f''('''a''', '''b''') = '''0''', where '''0''' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is the zero vector. If the [[Jacobian matrix]] {{math|1=''J''&lt;sub&gt;''f'', '''y'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''a''', '''b''') = [(∂''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' / ∂''y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'')('''a''', '''b''')]}} (this is the right-hand panel of the Jacobian matrix shown in the previous section) is [[invertible]], then there exists an open set ''U'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; containing '''a''' such that there exists a unique continuously differentiable function ''g'': ''U'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; f(\mathbf{x}, g(\mathbf{x})) = \mathbf{0}\quad \text{for all} \quad\mathbf{x}\in U.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the partial derivatives of ''g'' in ''U'' are given by the [[matrix product]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Oliveira|2013|pages=214–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial  g}{\partial  x_j}(\mathbf{x})=- \left [ J_{f, \mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{x},g(\mathbf{x})) \right ]_{m \times m} ^{-1} \left [ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j}(\mathbf{x},g(\mathbf{x})) \right ]_{m \times 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Higher derivatives===
If, moreover, ''f'' is  [[analytic function|analytic]] or continuously differentiable ''k'' times  in a neighborhood of ('''a''', '''b'''), then one may choose ''U'' in order that the same holds true for ''g'' inside ''U''. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fritzsche|Grauert|2002|page=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the analytic case, this is called the '''analytic implicit function theorem'''.

== The circle example ==
Let us go back to the example of the [[unit circle]]. In this case ''n'' = ''m'' = 1 and &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1&lt;/math&gt;. The matrix of partial derivatives is just a 1 × 2 matrix, given by

:&lt;math&gt;(Df)(a,b) = \left [ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(a,b)  \ \ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(a,b) \right ] = [2a \ \   2b]&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, here, the ''Y'' in the statement of the theorem is just the number 2''b''; the linear map defined by it is invertible [[iff]] ''b'' ≠ 0. By the implicit function theorem we see that we can locally write the circle in the form ''y'' = ''g''(''x'') for all points where ''y'' ≠ 0. For (±1, 0) we run into trouble, as noted before. The implicit function theorem may still be applied to these two points, by writing ''x'' as a function of ''y'', that is, &lt;math&gt;x = h(y)&lt;/math&gt;; now the graph of the function will be &lt;math&gt;\left(h(y), y\right)&lt;/math&gt;, since where ''b = 0'' we have ''a = 1'', and the conditions to locally express the function in this form are satisfied.

The implicit derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'', and that of ''x'' with respect to ''y'', can be found by [[Differential of a function#Differentials in several variables|totally differentiating]] the implicit function &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2-1&lt;/math&gt; and equating to 0:

:&lt;math&gt;2x dx+2y dy = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

giving 

:&lt;math&gt;dy/dx=-x/y&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;dx/dy=-y/x.&lt;/math&gt;

== Application: change of coordinates ==
Suppose we have an ''m''-dimensional space, parametrised by a set of coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x_1,\ldots,x_m) &lt;/math&gt;. We can introduce a new coordinate system &lt;math&gt; (x'_1,\ldots,x'_m) &lt;/math&gt; by supplying m functions &lt;math&gt; h_1\ldots h_m &lt;/math&gt;. These functions allow us to calculate the new coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x'_1,\ldots,x'_m) &lt;/math&gt; of a point, given the point's old coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x_1,\ldots,x_m) &lt;/math&gt; using &lt;math&gt; x'_1=h_1(x_1,\ldots,x_m), \ldots,  x'_m=h_m(x_1,\ldots,x_m) &lt;/math&gt;. One might want to verify if the opposite is possible: given coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x'_1,\ldots,x'_m) &lt;/math&gt;, can we 'go back' and calculate the same point's  original coordinates &lt;math&gt; (x_1,\ldots,x_m) &lt;/math&gt;? The implicit function theorem will provide an answer to this question. The (new and old) coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x'_1,\ldots,x'_m, x_1,\ldots,x_m)&lt;/math&gt; are related by ''f'' = 0, with
:&lt;math&gt;f(x'_1,\ldots,x'_m,x_1,\ldots x_m)=(h_1(x_1,\ldots x_m)-x'_1,\ldots , h_m(x_1,\ldots, x_m)-x'_m).&lt;/math&gt;
Now the Jacobian matrix of ''f'' at a certain point (''a'', ''b'') [ where &lt;math&gt;a=(x'_1,\ldots,x'_m), b=(x_1,\ldots,x_m)&lt;/math&gt; ] is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;(Df)(a,b)  = \left [\begin{matrix}
 -1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; -1 
\end{matrix}\left|
\begin{matrix} 
\frac{\partial h_1}{\partial x_1}(b) &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial h_1}{\partial x_m}(b)\\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\frac{\partial h_m}{\partial x_1}(b) &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial h_m}{\partial x_m}(b)\\
\end{matrix} \right.\right] = [-I_m |J ].&lt;/math&gt;
where I&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the ''m'' × ''m'' [[identity matrix]], and ''J'' is the ''m'' × ''m'' matrix of partial derivatives, evaluated at (''a'', ''b''). (In the above, these blocks were denoted by X and Y. As it happens, in this particular application of the theorem, neither matrix depends on ''a''.) The implicit function theorem now states that we can locally express &lt;math&gt; (x_1,\ldots,x_m) &lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt; (x'_1,\ldots,x'_m) &lt;/math&gt; if ''J'' is invertible. Demanding ''J'' is invertible is equivalent to det ''J'' ≠ 0, thus we see that we can go back from the primed to the unprimed coordinates if the determinant of the Jacobian ''J'' is non-zero. This statement is also known as the [[inverse function theorem]].

=== Example: polar coordinates ===
As a simple application of the above, consider the plane, parametrised by [[polar coordinates]] (''R'', θ). We can go to a new coordinate system ([[cartesian coordinates]]) by defining functions ''x''(''R'', θ) = ''R'' cos(θ) and ''y''(''R'', θ) = ''R'' sin(θ). This makes it possible given any point (''R'', θ) to find corresponding cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y''). When can we go back and convert cartesian into polar coordinates? By the previous example, it is sufficient to have det ''J'' ≠ 0, with 
:&lt;math&gt;J  =\begin{bmatrix}
 \frac{\partial x(R,\theta)}{\partial R} &amp; \frac{\partial x(R,\theta)}{\partial \theta} \\
 \frac{\partial y(R,\theta)}{\partial R} &amp; \frac{\partial y(R,\theta)}{\partial \theta} \\
\end{bmatrix}=
 \begin{bmatrix}
 \cos \theta &amp; -R \sin \theta \\
 \sin \theta &amp; R \cos \theta
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since det ''J'' = ''R'', conversion back to polar coordinates is possible if ''R'' ≠ 0. So it remains to check the case ''R'' = 0. It is easy to see that in case ''R'' = 0, our coordinate transformation is not invertible: at the origin, the value of θ is not well-defined.

== Generalizations ==

=== Banach space version ===
Based on the [[inverse function theorem]] in [[Banach space]]s, it is possible to extend the implicit function theorem to Banach space valued mappings.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Lang|1999|pages=15–21}} and {{harvnb|Edwards|1994|pages=417–418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' be [[Banach space]]s. Let the mapping ''f'' : ''X'' × ''Y'' → ''Z'' be continuously [[Fréchet differentiable]]. If &lt;math&gt;(x_0,y_0)\in X\times Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(x_0,y_0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y\mapsto Df(x_0,y_0)(0,y)&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space isomorphism from ''Y'' onto ''Z'', then there exist neighbourhoods ''U'' of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V'' of ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a Fréchet differentiable function ''g'' : ''U'' → ''V'' such that ''f''(''x'', ''g''(''x'')) = 0 and ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 if and only if ''y'' = ''g''(''x''), for all &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in U\times V&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Implicit functions from non-differentiable functions ===
Various forms of the implicit function theorem exist for the case when the function ''f'' is not differentiable.  It is standard that it holds in one dimension.&lt;ref&gt;See Kudryavtsev 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The following more general form was proven by Kumagai&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Kumagai|1980|pages=285–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; based on an observation by Jittorntrum.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Jittorntrum|1978|pages=575–577}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f : R^n \times R^m \to R^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x_0, y_0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  '''If''' there exist open neighbourhoods &lt;math&gt;A \subset R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subset R^m&lt;/math&gt; of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, such that, for all ''y'' in ''B'', &lt;math&gt;f(\cdot, y) : A \to R^n&lt;/math&gt; is locally one-to-one '''then''' there exist open neighbourhoods &lt;math&gt;A_0 \subset R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_0 \subset R^m&lt;/math&gt; of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, such that, for all &lt;math&gt;y \in B_0&lt;/math&gt;, the equation
''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 has a unique solution
:&lt;math&gt;x = g(y) \in A_0&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''g'' is a continuous function from ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; into ''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10173">In [[mathematics]], the '''Langlands–Shahidi method''' provides the means to define [[automorphic L-function]]s in many cases that arise with connected [[reductive group]]s over a [[Algebraic number field|number field]]. This includes [[Rankin–Selberg method|Rankin–Selberg]] products for cuspidal [[automorphic representation]]s of [[general linear group]]s. The method develops the theory of the '''local coefficient''', which links to the global theory via [[Eisenstein series]]. The resulting ''L''-functions satisfy a number of analytic properties, including an important functional equation.

== The local coefficient ==
The setting is in the generality of a connected quasi-split reductive group ''G'', together with a '''Levi''' subgroup ''M'', defined over a [[local field]] ''F''. For example, if ''G'' = ''G&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[classical group]] of rank ''l'', its maximal Levi subgroups are of the form GL(''m'') × ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''G&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a classical group of rank ''n'' and of the same type as ''G&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''l'' = ''m'' + ''n''. [[Freydoon Shahidi|F. Shahidi]] develops the theory of the '''local coefficient''' for irreducible generic representations of ''M(F)''.&lt;ref name="sh1"&gt;F. Shahidi, ''On certain ''L''-functions'', American Journal of Mathematics '''103''' (1981), 297–355.&lt;/ref&gt; The local coefficient is defined by means of the uniqueness property of [[Whittaker model]]s paired with the theory of intertwining operators for representations obtained by parabolic induction from generic representations.

The global intertwining operator appearing in the functional equation of [[Robert Langlands|Langlands]]' theory of Eisenstein series&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;R. P. Langlands, ''On the Functional Equations Satisfied by Eisenstein Series'', Lecture Notes in Math., Vol. 544, Springer-Verlag, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; can be decomposed as a product of local intertwining operators. When ''M'' is a maximal Levi subgroup, local coefficients arise from Fourier coefficients of appropriately chosen Eisenstein series and satisfy a crude functional equation involving a product of partial ''L''-functions.

== Local factors and functional equation ==
An induction step refines the crude functional equation of a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation &lt;math&gt;\pi = \otimes' \pi_v&lt;/math&gt; to individual functional equations of partial ''L''-functions and '''γ-factors''':&lt;ref name="sh2"&gt;F. Shahidi, ''A proof of Langlands conjecture on Plancherel measures; Complementary series for ''p''-adic groups'', Annals of Mathematics '''132''' (1990), 273–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L^S(s,\pi,r_i) = \prod_{v \in S} \gamma_i(s,\pi_v,\psi_v) L^S(1-s,\tilde{\pi},r_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The details are technical: ''s'' a complex variable, ''S'' a finite set of places (of the underlying global field) with &lt;math&gt;\pi_v&lt;/math&gt; unramified for ''v'' outside of ''S'', and &lt;math&gt;r = \oplus r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the adjoint action of ''M'' on the complex Lie algebra of a specific subgroup of the [[Langlands dual group]] of ''G''. When ''G'' is the [[special linear group]] SL(2), and ''M'' = ''T'' is the maximal torus of diagonal matrices, then π is a [[Hecke character|Größencharakter]] and the corresponding γ-factors are the local factors of [[John Tate|Tate's thesis]].

The γ-factors are uniquely characterized by their role in the functional equation and a list of local properties, including multiplicativity with respect to parabolic induction. They satisfy a relationship involving [[Artin L-function]]s and [[Artin root number]]s when ''v'' gives an archimedean local field or when ''v'' is non-archimedean and &lt;math&gt;\pi_v&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent of an unramified principal series representation of ''M(F)''. Local ''L''-functions and root numbers ε&lt;math&gt;(s,\pi_v,r_{i,v},\psi_v)&lt;/math&gt; are then defined at every place, including &lt;math&gt;v \in S&lt;/math&gt;, by means of Langlands classification for ''p''-adic groups. The functional equation takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;L(s,\pi,r_i) = \epsilon(s,\pi,r_i) L(1-s,\tilde{\pi},r_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(s,\pi,r_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(s,\pi,r_i)&lt;/math&gt; are the completed global ''L''-function and root number.

== Examples of automorphic ''L''-functions ==
* &lt;math&gt;L(s,\pi_1 \times \pi_2)&lt;/math&gt;, the Rankin–Selberg ''L''-function of cuspidal automorphic representations &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt; of GL(''m'') and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; of GL(''n'').
* &lt;math&gt;L(s,\tau \times \pi)&lt;/math&gt;, where τ is a cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(''m'') and π is a globally generic cuspidal automorphic representation of a classical group ''G''.
* &lt;math&gt;L(s,\tau,r)&lt;/math&gt;, with τ as before and ''r'' a symmetric square, an exterior square, or an Asai representation of the dual group of GL(''n'').

A full list of '''Langlands–Shahidi L-functions'''&lt;ref name="sh3"&gt;F. Shahidi, ''Eisenstein Series and Automorphic ''L''-functions'', Colloquium Publications, Vol. 58, American Mathematical Society, Providence, Rhode Island, 2010. {{isbn|978-0-8218-4989-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; depends on the quasi-split group ''G'' and maximal Levi subgroup ''M''. More specifically, the decomposition of the adjoint action &lt;math&gt;r = \oplus r_i&lt;/math&gt; can be classified using [[Dynkin diagram]]s. A first study of automorphic ''L''-functions via the theory of Eisenstein Series can be found in Langlands' '''Euler Products''',&lt;ref name="la"&gt;R. P. Langlands, ''Euler Products'', Yale Univ. Press, New Haven, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; under the assumption that the automorphic representations are everywhere unramified. What the Langlands–Shahidi method provides is the definition of ''L''-functions and root numbers with no other condition on the representation of ''M'' other than requiring the existence of a Whittaker model.

== Analytic properties of ''L''-functions ==
Global ''L''-functions are said to be '''nice'''&lt;ref name="CPS"&gt;J. W. Cogdell and I. I. Piatetski–Shapiro, ''Converse theorems for GL(''n'')'', Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS '''79''' (1994), 157–214.&lt;/ref&gt; if they satisfy:

# &lt;math&gt;L(s,\pi,r), \ L(s,\tilde{\pi}, r) &lt;/math&gt; extend to [[entire function]]s of the complex variable ''s''.
# &lt;math&gt;L(s,\pi,r), \ L(s,\tilde{\pi},r) &lt;/math&gt; are bounded in vertical strips.
# (Functional Equation) &lt;math&gt;L(s,\pi,r) = \epsilon(s,\pi,r) L(1-s,\tilde{\pi},r)&lt;/math&gt;.

Langlands–Shahidi ''L''-functions satisfy the functional equation. Progress towards boundedness in vertical strips was made by S. S. Gelbart and F. Shahidi.&lt;ref name="GeSh"&gt;S. Gelbart and F. Shahidi, ''Boundedness of automorphic ''L''-functions in vertical strips'', Journal of the American Mathematical Society, '''14''' (2001), 79–107.&lt;/ref&gt; And, after incorporating twists by highly ramified characters, Langlands–Shahidi ''L''-functions do become entire.&lt;ref name="KSh"&gt;H. H. Kim and F. Shahidi, ''Functorial products for GL(2) × GL(3) and the symmetric cube for GL(2)'', Annals of Mathematics '''155''' (2002), 837–893.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another result is the non-vanishing of ''L''-functions. For Rankin–Selberg products of general linear groups it states that &lt;math&gt;L(1+it,\pi_1 \times \pi_2)&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero for every real number&amp;nbsp;''t''.&lt;ref name="Shahidi"&gt;F. Shahidi, On nonvanishing of L-functions.
Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 2 (1980), no. 3, 462–464.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications to functoriality and to representation theory of ''p''-adic groups ==
* '''Functoriality for the classical groups''': A cuspidal globally generic automorphic representation of a classical group admits a [[Langlands program|Langlands functorial]] lift to an automorphic representation of GL(''N''),&lt;ref name="CKPSS"&gt;J. W. Cogdell, H. H. Kim, I. I. Piatetski–Shapiro, and F. Shahidi, ''Functoriality for the classical groups'', Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS '''99''' (2004), 163–233&lt;/ref&gt; where ''N'' depends on the classical group. Then, the Ramanujan bounds of W. Luo, Z. Rudnick and P. Sarnak&lt;ref name="LRS"&gt;W. Luo, Z. Rudnick, and P. Sarnak, ''On the generalized Ramanujan conjecture for GL(''n'')'', Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics '''66''', part 2 (1999), 301–310.&lt;/ref&gt; for GL(''N'') over number fields yield non-trivial bounds for the [[Ramanujan–Peterson conjecture|generalized Ramanujan conjecture]] of the classical groups.
* '''Symmetric powers for GL(2)''': Proofs of functoriality for the symmetric cube and for the symmetric fourth&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Kim, ''Functoriality for the exterior square of GL(4) and the symmetric fourth of GL(2)'', Journal of the American Mathematical Society '''16''' (2002), 131–183.&lt;/ref&gt; powers of cuspidal automorphic representations of GL(2) were made possible by the Langlands–Shahidi method. Progress towards higher Symmetric powers leads to the best possible bounds towards the [[Ramanujan–Peterson conjecture]] of automorphic cusp forms of GL(2).
* '''Representations of ''p''-adic groups''': Applications involving [[Harish-Chandra]] μ functions (from the Plancherel formula) and to complementary series of ''p''-adic reductive groups are possible. For example, GL(''n'') appears as the Siegel Levi subgroup of a classical group G. If π is a smooth irreducible ramified supercuspidal representation of GL(''n'', ''F'') over a field ''F'' of ''p''-adic numbers, and &lt;math&gt;I(\pi) = I(0,\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, then:
# &lt;math&gt;I(s,\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible and in the complementary series for 0 &lt; ''s'' &lt; 1;
# &lt;math&gt;I(1,\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is reducible and has a unique generic non-supercuspidal discrete series subrepresentation;
# &lt;math&gt;I(s,\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible and never in the complementary series for ''s'' &gt; 1.
Here, &lt;math&gt;I(s,\pi)&lt;/math&gt; is obtained by unitary parabolic induction from 
:*&lt;math&gt;\pi \otimes |\det|^s&lt;/math&gt; if ''G'' = SO(2''n''), Sp(2''n''), or U(''n''+1, ''n'');
:*&lt;math&gt;\pi \otimes |\det|^{s/2}&lt;/math&gt; if ''G'' = SO(2''n''+1) or U(''n'', ''n'').

The '''life-time of correlation''' measures the timespan over which there is appreciable [[autocorrelation]] or [[cross correlation]] in [[stochastic process]]es.

==Definition==
{| class="wikitable" style="float:right;"
|-
! Correlation !! Negative !! Positive
|-
| Weak || −0.5 to 0.0 || 0.0 to 0.5
|-
| Strong || −1.0 to −0.5|| 0.5 to 1.0
|}

The [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] ''ρ'', expressed as an [[autocorrelation function]] or [[cross-correlation function]], depends on the lag-time between the times being considered. Typically such functions, ''ρ''(''t''), decay to zero with increasing lag-time, but they can assume values across all levels of correlations: strong and weak, and positive and negative as in the table.

The life-time of a correlation is defined as the length of time when the correlation coefficient is at the strong level.&lt;ref name="Buda"&gt;Buda, Andrzej; Jarynowski, Andrzej (2010) ''Life-time of correlations and its applications vol.1'', p.9, [Głogów] : Wydawnictwo Niezależne&lt;/ref&gt; The durability of correlation is determined by signal (the strong level of correlation is separated from weak and negative levels). The mean life-time of correlation could measure how the durability of correlation depends on the window width size (the window is the length of time series used to calculate correlation).

This page lists the [[regular polytope]]s and regular [[polytope compound]]s in [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[spherical geometry|spherical]] and [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] spaces.

The [[Schläfli symbol]] describes every regular tessellation of an ''n''-sphere, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. A Schläfli symbol describing an n-polytope equivalently describes a tessellation of an (''n''−1)-sphere. In addition, the symmetry of a regular polytope or tessellation is expressed as a [[Coxeter group]], which [[Coxeter]] expressed identically to the Schläfli symbol, except delimiting by square brackets, a notation that is called [[Coxeter notation]]. Another related symbol is the [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram]] which represents a symmetry group with no rings, and the represents regular polytope or tessellation with a ring on the first node. For example, the [[cube]] has Schläfli symbol {4,3}, and with its [[octahedral symmetry]], [4,3] or {{CDD|node|4|node|3|node}}, it is represented by Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|4|node|3|node}}.

The regular polytopes are grouped by dimension and subgrouped by convex, nonconvex and infinite forms. Nonconvex forms use the same vertices as the convex forms, but have intersecting [[Facet (mathematics)|facets]]. Infinite forms [[Tessellation|tessellate]] a one-lower-dimensional Euclidean space.

Infinite forms can be extended to tessellate a [[hyperbolic space]]. Hyperbolic space is like normal space at a small scale, but parallel lines diverge at a distance. This allows vertex figures to have negative [[defect (geometry)|angle defects]], like making a vertex with seven [[equilateral triangle]]s and allowing it to lie flat. It cannot be done in a regular plane, but can be at the right scale of a hyperbolic plane.

A more general definition of regular polytopes which do not have simple Schläfli symbols includes [[regular skew polytope]]s and [[regular skew apeirotope]]s with nonplanar [[Facet (geometry)|facets]] or [[vertex figure]]s.

|A [[Coxeter diagram]] represent mirror "planes" as nodes, and puts a ring around a node if a point is ''not'' on the plane. A ''dion'', { }, {{CDD|node_1}} is a point ''p'' and its mirror image point ''p''', and the line segment between them.
|}
A one-dimensional polytope or 1-polytope is a closed [[line segment]], bounded by its two endpoints. A 1-polytope is regular by definition and is represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {&amp;nbsp;},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1973}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McMullen|Schulte|2002}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Coxeter diagram]] with a single ringed node, {{CDD|node_1}}. [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] calls it a ''dion''&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|N.W. Johnson]]: ''Geometries and Transformations'', (2018) {{ISBN|978-1-107-10340-5}} Chapter 11: ''Finite symmetry groups'', 11.1 Polytopes and Honeycombs, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; and gives it the Schläfli symbol { }.

Although trivial as a polytope, it appears as the [[Edge (geometry)|edges]] of polygons and other higher dimensional polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1973}}, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the definition of [[prism (geometry)|uniform prism]]s like Schläfli symbol {&amp;nbsp;}×{p}, or Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|2|node_1|p|node}} as a [[Cartesian product]] of a line segment and a regular polygon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1973}}, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two dimensions (polygons)==

The two-dimensional polytopes are called [[polygon]]s. Regular polygons are [[equilateral]] and [[cyclic polygon|cyclic]]. A p-gonal regular polygon is represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {p}.

Usually only [[convex polygon]]s are considered regular, but [[star polygon]]s, like the [[pentagram]], can also be considered regular. They use the same vertices as the convex forms, but connect in an alternate connectivity which passes around the circle more than once to complete.

Star polygons should be called ''nonconvex'' rather than ''concave'' because the intersecting edges do not generate new vertices and all the vertices exist on a circle boundary.

===Convex===

The Schläfli symbol {p} represents a [[Regular polygon|regular ''p''-gon]].

===Stars===
There exist infinitely many regular star polytopes in two dimensions, whose Schläfli symbols consist of rational numbers {''n''/''m''}. They are called [[star polygon]]s and share the same [[vertex arrangement]]s of the convex regular polygons.

In general, for any natural number ''n'', there are n-pointed star regular polygonal stars with Schläfli symbols {''n''/''m''} for all m such that ''m'' &lt; ''n''/2 (strictly speaking {''n''/''m''}={''n''/(''n''−''m'')}) and ''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]] (and as such, all stellations of a polygon with a prime number of sides will be regular stars). Cases where ''m'' and ''n'' are not coprime are called [[#Two dimensional compounds|compound polygons]].

===Skew polygons ===

In 3-dimensional space, a [[regular skew polygon]] is called an ''antiprismatic polygon'', with the [[vertex arrangement]] of an [[antiprism]], and a subset of edges, zig-zagging between top and bottom polygons.

In 4-dimensions a regular skew polygon can have vertices on a [[Clifford torus]] and related by a [[Clifford displacement]]. Unlike antiprismatic skew polygons, skew polygons on double rotations can include an odd-number of sides.

They can be seen in the [[Petrie polygon]]s of the [[convex regular 4-polytope]]s, seen as regular plane polygons in the perimeter of Coxeter plane projection:

==Three dimensions (polyhedra)==

In three dimensions, polytopes are called [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]:

A regular polyhedron with [[Schläfli symbol]] {p,q}, Coxeter diagrams {{CDD|node_1|p|node|q|node}}, has a regular face type {p}, and regular [[vertex figure]] {q}.

A [[vertex figure]] (of a polyhedron) is a polygon, seen by connecting those vertices which are one edge away from a given vertex. For [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]], this vertex figure is always a regular (and planar) polygon.

Existence of a regular polyhedron {p,q} is constrained by an inequality, related to the vertex figure's [[defect (geometry)|angle defect]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} &gt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; : Polyhedron (existing in Euclidean 3-space)
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; : ''Euclidean'' plane tiling
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} &lt; \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; : Hyperbolic plane tiling

By enumerating the [[permutation]]s, we find 5 convex forms, 4 star forms and 3 plane tilings, all with polygons {p} and {q} limited to: {3}, {4}, {5}, {5/2}, and {6}.

Beyond Euclidean space, there is an infinite set of regular hyperbolic tilings.

===Convex===
The convex regular [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are called the 5 [[Platonic solid]]s. The [[vertex figure]] is given with each vertex count. All these polyhedra have an [[Euler characteristic]] (χ) of 2.

====Spherical====

In [[spherical geometry]], regular [[spherical polyhedra]] ([[tessellation|tiling]]s of the [[sphere]]) exist that would otherwise be degenerate as polytopes. These are the [[hosohedron|hosohedra]] {2,n} and their dual [[dihedron|dihedra]] {n,2}. [[Coxeter]] calls these cases "improper" tessellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Coxeter|1973}}, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

The first few cases (n from 2 to 6) are listed below.

Star-dihedra and hosohedra {''p''/''q'',2} and {2,''p''/''q''} also exist for any star polygon {''p''/''q''}.

===Stars===
The regular [[Star polyhedron|star polyhedra]] are called the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]] and there are four of them, based on the [[vertex arrangement]]s of the [[dodecahedron]] {5,3} and [[icosahedron]] {3,5}:

As [[spherical tiling]]s, these star forms overlap the sphere multiple times, called its ''density'', being 3 or 7 for these forms. The tiling images show a single [[spherical polygon]] face in yellow.

There are infinitely many ''failed'' star polyhedra. These are also spherical tilings with star polygons in their Schläfli symbols, but they do not cover a sphere finitely many times. Some examples are {5/2,4}, {5/2,9}, {7/2,3}, {5/2,5/2}, {7/2,7/3}, {4,5/2}, and {3,7/3}.

=== Skew polyhedra ===
[[regular skew polyhedron|Regular skew polyhedra]] are generalizations to the set of [[regular polyhedron]] which include the possibility of nonplanar [[vertex figure]]s.

For 4-dimensional skew polyhedra, Coxeter offered a modified [[Schläfli symbol]] {l,m|n} for these figures, with {l,m} implying the [[vertex figure]], ''m'' l-gons around a vertex, and ''n''-gonal holes. Their vertex figures are [[skew polygon]]s, zig-zagging between two planes.

The regular skew polyhedra, represented by {l,m|n}, follow this equation:
: 2 sin(π/l) sin(π/m) = cos(π/n)

Four of them can be seen in 4-dimensions as a subset of faces of four [[regular 4-polytope]]s, sharing the same [[vertex arrangement]] and [[edge arrangement]]:

==Four dimensions==

Regular [[4-polytopes]] with [[Schläfli symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r\}&lt;/math&gt; have cells of type &lt;math&gt;\{p,q\}&lt;/math&gt;, faces of type &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt;, edge figures
&lt;math&gt;\{r\}&lt;/math&gt;, and vertex figures &lt;math&gt;\{q,r\}&lt;/math&gt;.
* A [[vertex figure]] (of a 4-polytope) is a polyhedron, seen by the arrangement of neighboring vertices around a given vertex. For regular 4-polytopes, this vertex figure is a regular polyhedron.
* An [[Vertex figure#Edge figure|edge figure]] is a polygon, seen by the arrangement of faces around an edge. For regular 4-polytopes, this edge figure will always be a regular polygon.

The existence of a regular 4-polytope &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r\}&lt;/math&gt; is constrained by the existence of the regular polyhedra &lt;math&gt;\{p,q\}, \{q,r\}&lt;/math&gt;. A suggested name for 4-polytopes is "polychoron".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mit.edu/~hlb/Associahedron/program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Each will exist in a space dependent upon this expression:
: &lt;math&gt;\sin \left ( \frac{\pi}{p} \right ) \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{r}\right) - \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; : Hyperspherical 3-space honeycomb or 4-polytope
:: &lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt; : Euclidean 3-space honeycomb
:: &lt;math&gt;&lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; : Hyperbolic 3-space honeycomb

These constraints allow for 21 forms: 6 are convex, 10 are nonconvex, ''one'' is a Euclidean 3-space honeycomb, and 4 are hyperbolic honeycombs.

The [[Euler characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; for convex 4-polytopes is zero:
&lt;math&gt;\chi = V+F-E-C = 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Convex===

The 6 convex [[regular 4-polytope]]s are shown in the table below. All these 4-polytopes have an [[Euler characteristic]] (χ) of 0.

====Spherical====

[[Ditope|Di-4-topes]] and [[hosotope|hoso-4-topes]] exist as regular tessellations of the [[3-sphere]].

Regular '''di-4-topes''' (2 facets) include: {3,3,2}, {3,4,2}, {4,3,2}, {5,3,2}, {3,5,2}, {p,2,2}, and their '''hoso-4-tope''' [[Dual polytope|duals]] (2 vertices): {2,3,3}, {2,4,3}, {2,3,4}, {2,3,5}, {2,5,3}, {2,2,''p''}. 4-polytopes of the form {2,''p'',2} are the same as {2,2,''p''}. There are also the cases {''p'',2,''q''} which have dihedral cells and hosohedral vertex figures.

===Stars===
There are ten [[star polytope|regular star 4-polytopes]], which are called the [[Schläfli–Hess 4-polytope]]s.  Their vertices are based on the convex [[120-cell]] ''{5,3,3}'' and [[600-cell]] ''{3,3,5}''.

[[Ludwig Schläfli]] found four of them and skipped the last six because he would not allow forms that failed the [[Euler characteristic]] on cells or vertex figures (for zero-hole tori: F+V−E=2). [[Edmund Hess]] (1843–1903) completed the full list of ten in his German book ''Einleitung in die Lehre von der Kugelteilung mit besonderer Berücksichtigung ihrer Anwendung auf die Theorie der Gleichflächigen und der gleicheckigen Polyeder'' (1883)[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/b/bib/bibperm?q1=ABN8623.0001.001].

There are 4 unique [[edge arrangement]]s and 7 unique [[face arrangement]]s from these 10 regular star 4-polytopes, shown as [[orthogonal projection]]s:

There are 4 ''failed'' potential regular star 4-polytopes permutations: {3,5/2,3}, {4,3,5/2}, {5/2,3,4}, {5/2,3,5/2}. Their cells and vertex figures exist, but they do not cover a hypersphere with a finite number of repetitions.

==Five and more dimensions==
In [[Five-dimensional space|five dimensions]], a regular polytope can be named as
&lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r,s\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r\}&lt;/math&gt; is the 4-face type, &lt;math&gt;\{p,q\}&lt;/math&gt; is the cell type, &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; is the face type, and &lt;math&gt;\{s\}&lt;/math&gt; is the face figure, &lt;math&gt;\{r,s\}&lt;/math&gt; is the edge figure, and &lt;math&gt;\{q,r,s\}&lt;/math&gt; is the vertex figure.

: A [[vertex figure]] (of a 5-polytope) is a 4-polytope, seen by the arrangement of neighboring vertices to each vertex.
: An [[edge figure]] (of a 5-polytope) is a polyhedron, seen by the arrangement of faces around each edge.
: A [[face figure]] (of a 5-polytope) is a polygon, seen by the arrangement of cells around each face.

A regular 5-polytope &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r,s\}&lt;/math&gt; exists only if &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{q,r,s\}&lt;/math&gt; are regular 4-polytopes.

The space it fits in is based on the expression:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{q}\right)}{\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{p}\right)} + \frac{\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{r}\right)}{\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{s}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; : Spherical 4-space tessellation or 5-space polytope
:: &lt;math&gt;= 1&lt;/math&gt; : Euclidean 4-space tessellation
:: &lt;math&gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; : hyperbolic 4-space tessellation

Enumeration of these constraints produce ''3'' convex polytopes, ''zero'' nonconvex polytopes, ''3'' 4-space tessellations, and ''5'' hyperbolic 4-space tessellations. There are no non-convex regular polytopes in five dimensions or higher.

===Convex===
In dimensions 5 and higher, there are only three kinds of convex regular polytopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Coxeter|1973}}, Table I: Regular polytopes, (iii) The three regular polytopes in ''n'' dimensions (n&gt;=5), pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also improper cases where some numbers in the Schläfli symbol are 2. For example, {p,q,r,...2} is an improper regular spherical polytope whenever {p,q,r...} is a regular spherical polytope, and {2,...p,q,r} is an improper regular spherical polytope whenever {...p,q,r} is a regular spherical polytope. Such polytopes may also be used as facets, yielding forms such as {p,q,...2...y,z}.

===Non-convex===

There are no non-convex regular polytopes in five dimensions or higher.

== Regular projective polytopes ==
A projective regular (''n''+1)-polytope exists when an original regular ''n''-spherical tessellation, {p,q,...}, is [[centrally symmetric]]. Such a polytope is named hemi-&lt;nowiki/&gt;{p,q,...}, and contain half as many elements. Coxeter gives a symbol {p,q,...}/2, while McMullen writes {p,q,...}&lt;sub&gt;h/2&lt;/sub&gt; with ''h'' as the [[coxeter number]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JfmlMYe6MJgC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;ots=IGcpn3wv_C&amp;dq=Hemi-24-cell%20abstract%20regular%20polytope&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q=Hemi-24-cell&amp;f=false Abstract regular polytopes, p. 162-165]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even-sided [[regular polygon]]s have hemi-''2n''-gon projective polygons, {2p}/2.

There are 4 regular [[projective polyhedron|projective polyhedra]] related to 4 of 5 [[Platonic solid]]s.

The hemi-cube and hemi-octahedron generalize as hemi-[[hypercube|''n''-cubes]] and hemi-''n''-[[orthoplex]]es in any dimensions.

=== Regular projective 4-polytopes===

==Apeirotopes==
An '''[[apeirotope]]''' or '''infinite polytope''' is a [[polytope]] which has infinitely many [[Facet (geometry)|facets]]. An ''n''-apeirotope is an infinite ''n''-polytope: a 2-apeirotope or apeirotope, is an infinite polygon, a 3-apeirotope, or apeirohedron, is an infinite polyhedron, etc.

There are two main geometric classes of apeirotope:&lt;ref&gt;Grünbaum, B.; "Regular Polyhedra—Old and New", ''Aeqationes mathematicae'', Vol. 16 (1977), pp 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Regular [[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]] in ''n'' dimensions, which completely fill an ''n''-dimensional space.
*Regular [[skew apeirotope]]s, comprising an ''n''-dimensional manifold in a higher space.

===One dimension (apeirogons)===
The straight [[apeirogon]] is a regular tessellation of the line, subdviding it into infinitely many equal segments. It has infinitely many vertices and edges. Its [[Schläfli symbol]] is {∞}, and Coxeter diagram {{CDD|node_1|infin|node}}.

...[[Image:Regular apeirogon.png|320px]]...

Apeirogons in the [[hyperbolic plane]], most notably the ''regular apeirogon'', {∞}, can have a curvature just like finite polygons of the Euclidean plane, with the vertices circumscribed by [[horocycle]]s or [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] rather than [[circle]]s.

Regular apeirogons that are scaled to converge at infinity have the symbol {∞} and exist on horocycles, while more generally they can exist on hypercycles.

|[[File:Pseudogon_example.png|160px]]&lt;BR&gt;Apeirogon on [[hypercycle (hyperbolic geometry)|hypercycle]]
|}

Above are two regular hyperbolic apeirogons in the [[Poincaré disk model]], the right one shows perpendicular reflection lines of divergent [[fundamental domain]]s, separated by length λ.

==== Skew apeirogons ====
A skew apeirogon in two dimensions forms a zig-zag line in the plane. If the zig-zag is even and symmetrical, then the apeirogon is regular.

Skew apeirogons can be constructed in any number of dimensions. In three dimensions, a regular [[Skew apeirogon#Helical apeirogons in 3-dimensions|skew apeirogon]] traces out a helical spiral and may be either left- or right-handed.

===Two dimensions (apeirohedra)===

====Euclidean tilings====

There are three regular tessellations of the plane. All three have an [[Euler characteristic]] (χ) of 0.

|}

There are two improper regular tilings: {∞,2}, an apeirogonal [[dihedron]], made from two [[apeirogon]]s, each filling half the plane; and secondly, its dual, {2,∞}, an apeirogonal [[hosohedron]], seen as an infinite set of parallel lines.

|}

====Euclidean star-tilings====

There are no regular plane tilings of [[star polygon]]s. There are many enumerations that fit in the plane (1/''p'' + 1/''q'' = 1/2), like {8/3,8}, {10/3,5}, {5/2,10}, {12/5,12}, etc., but none repeat periodically.

====Hyperbolic tilings====

Tessellations of [[Lobachevski plane|hyperbolic 2-space]] are ''[[hyperbolic tiling]]s''. There are infinitely many regular tilings in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. As stated above, every positive integer pair {''p'',''q''} such that 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''q'' &lt; 1/2 gives a hyperbolic tiling. In fact, for the general [[Schwarz triangle]] (''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q'',&amp;nbsp;''r'') the same holds true for 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''r'' &lt; 1.

There are a number of different ways to display the hyperbolic plane, including the [[Poincaré disc model]] which maps the plane into a circle, as shown below. It should be recognized that all of the polygon faces in the tilings below are equal-sized and only appear to get smaller near the edges due to the projection applied, very similar to the effect of a camera [[fisheye lens]].

There are infinitely many flat regular 3-apeirotopes (apeirohedra) as regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane, of the form {p,q}, with p+q&lt;pq/2. (previously [[#Hyperbolic_tilings|listed above]] as tessellations)
* {3,7}, {3,8}, {3,9} ... {3,∞}
* {4,5}, {4,6}, {4,7} ... {4,∞}
* {5,4}, {5,5}, {5,6} ... {5,∞}
* {6,4}, {6,5}, {6,6} ... {6,∞}
* {7,3}, {7,4}, {7,5} ... {7,∞}
* {8,3}, {8,4}, {8,5} ... {8,∞}
* {9,3}, {9,4}, {9,5} ... {9,∞}
* ...
* {∞,3}, {∞,4}, {∞,5} ... {∞,∞}

A sampling:
{{Regular hyperbolic tiling table}}

====Hyperbolic star-tilings====
There are 2 infinite forms of hyperbolic tilings whose [[face (geometry)|faces]] or [[vertex figure]]s are star polygons: {''m''/2, ''m''} and their duals {''m'', ''m''/2} with ''m'' = 7, 9, 11, .... The {''m''/2, ''m''} tilings are [[stellation]]s of the {''m'', 3} tilings while the {''m'', ''m''/2} dual tilings are [[faceting]]s of the {3, ''m''} tilings and [[greatening (geometry)|greatening]]s of the {''m'', 3} tilings.

The patterns {''m''/2, ''m''} and {''m'', ''m''/2} continue for odd ''m'' &amp;lt; 7 as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]: when ''m'' = 5, we obtain the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great dodecahedron]], and when ''m'' = 3, the case degenerates to a [[tetrahedron]]. The other two Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra (the [[great stellated dodecahedron]] and [[great icosahedron]]) do not have regular hyperbolic tiling analogues. If ''m'' is even, depending on how we choose to define {''m''/2}, we can either obtain degenerate double covers of other tilings or [[polyhedral compound|compound]] tilings.

====Improper tessellations of Euclidean 3-space====
[[File:Order-4 square hosohedral honeycomb-sphere.png|160px|thumb|Regular {2,4,4} honeycomb, seen projected into a sphere.]]
There are six improper regular tessellations, pairs based on the three regular Euclidean tilings. Their cells and vertex figures are all regular [[hosohedron|hosohedra]] {2,n}, [[dihedron|dihedra]], {n,2}, and Euclidean tilings. These improper regular tilings are constructionally related to prismatic uniform honeycombs by truncation operations. They are higher-dimensional analogues of the [[order-2 apeirogonal tiling]] and [[apeirogonal hosohedron]].

Noncompact solutions exist as [[Lorentzian Coxeter group]]s, and can be visualized with open domains in hyperbolic space (the fundamental tetrahedron having some parts inaccessible beyond infinity). All honeycombs which are not shown in the set of tables below and do not have 2 in their Schläfli symbol are noncompact.
{{Regular honeycomb table}}

There are no regular hyperbolic star-honeycombs in H&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;: all forms with a regular star polyhedron as cell, vertex figure or both end up being spherical.

===Four dimensions (5-apeirotopes)===

====Tessellations of Euclidean 4-space====

In E&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, there are also the improper cases {4,3,3,4,2}, {2,4,3,3,4}, {3,3,4,3,2}, {2,3,3,4,3}, {3,4,3,3,2}, and {2,3,4,3,3}.

====Tessellations of hyperbolic 5-space====

There are 5 regular honeycombs in H&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, all paracompact, which include infinite (Euclidean) facets or vertex figures: {3,4,3,3,3}, {3,3,4,3,3}, {3,3,3,4,3}, {3,4,3,3,4}, and {4,3,3,4,3}.

There are no compact regular tessellations of hyperbolic space of dimension 5 or higher and no paracompact regular tessellations in hyperbolic space of dimension 6 or higher.

Since there are no regular star ''n''-polytopes for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5, that could be potential cells or vertex figures, there are no more hyperbolic star honeycombs in H&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;5.

===6 dimensions and higher (7-apeirotopes+)===

====Tessellations of hyperbolic 6-space and higher====
There are no regular compact or paracompact tessellations of hyperbolic space of dimension 6 or higher. However, any Schläfli symbol of the form {p,q,r,s,...} not covered above (p,q,r,s,... [[natural numbers]] above 2, or infinity) will form a noncompact tessellation of hyperbolic ''n''-space.

== Compound polytopes ==
{{main article|Polytope compound}}

=== Two dimensional compounds ===
For any natural number n, there are n-pointed star regular polygonal stars with Schläfli symbols {n/m} for all m such that m &lt; n/2 (strictly speaking {n/m}={n/(n−m)}) and m and n are [[coprime]]. When m and n are not coprime, the star polygon obtained will be a regular polygon with ''n''/''m'' sides. A new figure is obtained by rotating these regular ''n''/''m''-gons one vertex to the left on the original polygon until the number of vertices rotated equals ''n''/''m'' minus one, and combining these figures. An extreme case of this is where ''n''/''m'' is 2, producing a figure consisting of ''n''/2 straight line segments; this is called a '''[[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] star polygon'''.

In other cases where ''n'' and ''m'' have a common factor, a star polygon for a lower ''n'' is obtained, and rotated versions can be combined. These figures are called '''star figures''', '''improper star polygons''' or '''compound polygons'''. The same notation {''n''/''m''} is often used for them, although authorities such as Grünbaum (1994) regard (with some justification) the form ''k''{''n''} as being more correct, where usually ''k'' = ''m''.

A further complication comes when we compound two or more star polygons, as for example two pentagrams, differing by a rotation of 36°, inscribed in a decagon. This is correctly written in the form ''k''{''n''/''m''}, as 2{5/2}, rather than the commonly used {10/4}.

Coxeter's extended notation for compounds is of the form ''c''{''m'',''n'',...}[''d''{''p'',''q'',...}]''e''{''s'',''t'',...}, indicating that ''d'' distinct {''p'',''q'',...}'s together  cover the vertices of {''m'',''n'',...} ''c'' times and the facets of {''s'',''t'',...} ''e'' times. If no regular {''m'',''n'',...} exists, the first part of the notation is removed, leaving [''d''{''p'',''q'',...}]''e''{''s'',''t'',...}; the opposite holds if no regular {''s'',''t'',...} exists. The dual of ''c''{''m'',''n'',...}[''d''{''p'',''q'',...}]''e''{''s'',''t'',...} is ''e''{''t'',''s'',...}[''d''{''q'',''p'',...}]''c''{''n'',''m'',...}. If ''c'' or ''e'' are 1, they may be omitted. For compound polygons, this notation reduces to {''nk''}[''k''{''n''/''m''}]{''nk''}: for example, the [[hexagram]] may be written thus as {6}[2{3}]{6}.

Coxeter's notation for regular compounds is given in the table above, incorporating [[Schläfli symbol]]s. The material inside the square brackets, [''d''{''p'',''q''}], denotes the components of the compound: ''d'' separate {''p'',''q''}'s. The material ''before'' the square brackets denotes the vertex arrangement of the compound: ''c''{''m'',''n''}[''d''{''p'',''q''}] is a compound of ''d'' {''p'',''q''}'s sharing the vertices of an {''m'',''n''} counted ''c'' times. The material ''after'' the square brackets denotes the facet arrangement of the compound: [''d''{''p'',''q''}]''e''{''s'',''t''} is a compound of ''d'' {''p'',''q''}'s sharing the faces of {''s'',''t''} counted ''e'' times. These may be combined: thus ''c''{''m'',''n''}[''d''{''p'',''q''}]''e''{''s'',''t''}  is a compound of ''d'' {''p'',''q''}'s sharing the vertices of {''m'',''n''} counted ''c'' times ''and'' the faces of {''s'',''t''} counted ''e'' times. This notation can be generalised to compounds in any number of dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Harold Scott MacDonald | last=Coxeter | author-link=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher = Dover Publications | edition=Third | oclc=798003 | date = 1973  | orig-year=1948 | isbn = 0-486-61480-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ee7AQAAQBAJ |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Euclidean and hyperbolic plane compounds ====
There are eighteen two-parameter families of regular compound tessellations of the Euclidean plane. In the hyperbolic plane, five one-parameter families and seventeen isolated cases are known, but the completeness of this listing has not yet been proven.

The Euclidean and hyperbolic compound families 2 {''p'',''p''} (4 ≤ ''p'' ≤ &amp;infin;, ''p'' an integer) are analogous to the spherical [[stella octangula]], 2 {3,3}.

There are thirty-two regular compounds of regular 4-polytopes, which [[Coxeter]] lists in his book ''[[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Regular polytopes, Table VII, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different compounds of 75 tesseracts: one shares the vertices of a 120-cell, while the other shares the vertices of a 600-cell. It immediately follows therefore that the corresponding dual compounds of 75 16-cells are also different.

There are also fourteen ''partially regular'' compounds, that are either vertex-transitive or cell-transitive but not both. The seven vertex-transitive partially regular compounds are the duals of the seven cell-transitive partially regular compounds.

Although the 5-cell and 24-cell are both self-dual, their dual compounds (the [[compound of two 5-cells]] and [[compound of two 24-cells]]) are not considered to be regular, unlike the compound of two tetrahedra and the various dual polygon compounds, because they are neither vertex-regular nor cell-regular: they are not facetings or stellations of any regular 4-polytope.

==== Euclidean 3-space compounds ====
The only regular Euclidean compound honeycombs are an infinite family of compounds of [[cubic honeycomb]]s, all sharing vertices and faces with another cubic honeycomb. This compound can have any number of cubic honeycombs. The Coxeter notation is {4,3,4}[''d''{4,3,4}]{4,3,4}.

=== Five dimensions and higher compounds===
There are no regular compounds in five or six dimensions. There are three known seven-dimensional compounds (16, 240, or 480 [[7-simplex]]es), and six known eight-dimensional ones (16, 240, or 480 [[8-cube]]s or [[8-orthoplex]]es). There is also one compound of ''n''-simplexes in ''n''-dimensional space provided that ''n'' is one less than a power of two, and also two compounds (one of ''n''-cubes and a dual one of ''n''-orthoplexes) in ''n''-dimensional space if ''n'' is a power of two.

The Coxeter notation for these compounds are (using α&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = {3&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}, β&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = {3&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;,4}, γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {4,3&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;}:

* 7-simplexes: ''c''γ&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;[16''c''α&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]''c''β&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''c'' = 1, 15, or 30
* 8-orthoplexes: ''c''γ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;[16''c''β&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]
* 8-cubes: [16''c''γ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]''c''β&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;

The general cases (where ''n'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''d'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''k'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''k'' = 2, 3, 4, ...):

* Simplexes: γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;[''d''α&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;]β&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;
* Orthoplexes: γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;[''d''β&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]
* Hypercubes: [''d''γ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]β&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;

==== Euclidean honeycomb compounds====
A known family of regular Euclidean compound honeycombs in five or more dimensions is an infinite family of compounds of [[hypercubic honeycomb]]s, all sharing vertices and faces with another hypercubic honeycomb. This compound can have any number of hypercubic honeycombs. The Coxeter notation is δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;[''d''δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where δ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = {∞} when ''n'' = 2 and {4,3&lt;sup&gt;''n''−3&lt;/sup&gt;,4} when ''n'' ≥ 3.

== Abstract polytopes ==

The [[abstract polytope]]s arose out of an attempt to study polytopes apart from the geometrical space they are embedded in. They include the tessellations of spherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic space, tessellations of other [[manifold]]s, and many other objects that do not have a well-defined topology, but instead may be characterised by their "local" topology. There are infinitely many in every dimension. See [http://www.abstract-polytopes.com/atlas/ this atlas] for a sample. Some notable examples of abstract regular polytopes that do not appear elsewhere in this list are the [[11-cell]], {3,5,3}, and the [[57-cell]], {5,3,5}, which have regular projective polyhedra as cells and vertex figures.

The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the ''null polytope'' or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or ''realised'' as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or ''faithful'' realisations, others do not. A ''flag'' is a connected set of elements of each dimension - for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be ''regular'' if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags - that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.

Five such regular abstract polyhedra, which can not be realised faithfully, were identified by [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] in his book ''[[Regular Polytopes]]'' (1977) and again by [[J. M. Wills]] in his paper "The combinatorially regular polyhedra of index 2" (1987).&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/regularpolyhedra.htm The Regular Polyhedra (of index two)], David A. Richter&lt;/ref&gt; They are all topologically equivalent to [[toroid]]s. Their construction, by arranging ''n'' faces around each vertex, can be repeated indefinitely as tilings of the [[Hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]]. In the diagrams below, the hyperbolic tiling images have colors corresponding to those of the polyhedra images.

for the iteration ''v'' {{mapsto}} ''v''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''.]]
The '''Mandelbulb''' is a three-dimensional [[fractal]], constructed by Daniel White and Paul Nylander using [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.bugman123.com/Hypercomplex/index.html
|title=Hypercomplex fractals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[canonical form|canonical]] 3-dimensional [[Mandelbrot set]] does not exist, since there is no 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional space of complex numbers. It is possible to construct Mandelbrot sets in 4 dimensions using [[quaternions]] and [[Bicomplex number|bicomplex numbers]]. 

White and Nylander's formula for the "''n''th power" of the vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v} = \langle x, y, z\rangle&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} is

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}^n := r^n\langle\sin(n\theta)\cos(n\phi),\sin(n\theta)\sin(n\phi),\cos(n\theta)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\phi=\arctan(y/x)=\arg (x+yi)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;\theta=\arctan(\sqrt{x^2+y^2}/z)=\arccos(z/r)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

The Mandelbulb is then defined as the set of those &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf c}&lt;/math&gt; in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for which the orbit of &lt;math&gt;\langle 0, 0, 0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; under the iteration &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v} \mapsto {\mathbf v}^n+{\mathbf c}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.skytopia.com/project/fractal/2mandelbulb.html
|title=Mandelbulb: The Unravelling of the Real 3D Mandelbrot Fractal}} see "formula" section&lt;/ref&gt; For ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;3, the result is a 3-dimensional bulb-like structure with [[fractal]] surface detail and a number of "lobes" depending on ''n''. Many of their graphic renderings use ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8. However, the equations can be simplified into rational polynomials when n is odd. For example, in the case ''n'' = 3, the third power can be simplified into the [[mathematical beauty|more elegant]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y, z\rangle^3 = \left\langle\ \frac{(3z^2-x^2-y^2)x(x^2-3y^2)}{x^2+y^2} ,\frac{(3z^2-x^2-y^2)y(3x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2},z(z^2-3x^2-3y^2)\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The Mandelbulb given by the formula above is actually one in a family of fractals given by parameters (p,q) given by:
:
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}^n := r^n\langle\sin(p\theta)\cos(q\phi),\sin(p\theta)\sin(q\phi),\cos(p\theta)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:
Since p and q do not necessarily have to equal n for the identity |v&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;|=|v|&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; to hold. More general fractals can be found by setting

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf v}^n := r^n\langle\sin(f(\theta,\phi))\cos(g(\theta,\phi)),\sin(f(\theta,\phi))\sin(g(\theta,\phi)),\cos(f(\theta,\phi))\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for functions f and g.

==Quadratic formula==
Other formulae come from identities which parametrise the sum of squares to give a power of the sum of squares such as:
:&lt;math&gt;
(x^2-y^2-z^2)^2+(2 x z)^2+(2xy)^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2)^2&lt;/math&gt;
which we can think of as a way to square a triplet of numbers so that the modulus is squared. So this gives, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
x\rightarrow  x^2-y^2-z^2+x_0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
y\rightarrow  2 x z+y_0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
z\rightarrow  2 x y +z_0
&lt;/math&gt;
or various other permutations. This 'quadratic' formula can be applied several times to get many power-2 formulae.

==Cubic formula==
[[File:cubic fractal.jpg|thumb|Cubic fractal]]
Other formulae come from identities which parametrise the sum of squares to give a power of the sum of squares such as:
:&lt;math&gt;
(x^3-3xy^2-3xz^2)^2+(y^3 - 3 y x^2 + y z^2)^2+(z^3 - 3 z x^2 + z y^2)^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2)^3&lt;/math&gt;
which we can think of as a way to cube a triplet of numbers so that the modulus is cubed. So this gives:
:&lt;math&gt;
x\rightarrow  x^3 - 3 x (y^2 + z^2) + x_0
&lt;/math&gt;
or other permutations.

:&lt;math&gt;
y\rightarrow 
-y^3 + 3 y x^2 - y z^2  + y_0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z\rightarrow  
z^3 - 3 z x^2 + z y^2 + z_0
&lt;/math&gt;

for example. This reduces to the complex fractal &lt;math&gt;w\rightarrow w^3+w_0&lt;/math&gt; when z=0 and &lt;math&gt;w\rightarrow \overline{w}^3+w_0&lt;/math&gt; when y=0.

There are several ways to combine two such `cubic` transforms to get a power-9 transform which has slightly more structure.

==Quintic formula==

[[File:Quintic fractal.jpg|thumb|Quintic Mandelbulb]]
[[File:Quintic fractal2.jpg|thumb|Quintic Mandelbulb with C=2]]

Another way to create Mandelbulbs with cubic symmetry is by taking the complex iteration formula &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow z^{4m+1} + z_0&lt;/math&gt; for some integer m and adding terms to make it symmetrical in 3 dimensions but keeping the cross-sections to be the same 2 dimensional fractal. (The 4 comes from the fact that &lt;math&gt;i^4=1&lt;/math&gt;.) For example, take the case of &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow z^5 + z_0&lt;/math&gt;. In two dimensions where &lt;math&gt;z=x+iy&lt;/math&gt; this is:
:&lt;math&gt;
x\rightarrow x^5-10 x^3 y^2 + 5 x y^4 + x_0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
y\rightarrow y^5-10 y^3 x^2 + 5 y x^4 + y_0&lt;/math&gt;

This can be then extended to three dimensions to give:
:&lt;math&gt;
x\rightarrow 
x^5 - 10 x^3 (y^2 + A y z + z^2) + 5 x (y^4 + B y^3 z + C y^2 z^2 + B y z^3 + z^4) + D x^2 y z (y+z) + x_0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y\rightarrow 
y^5 - 10 y^3 (z^2 + A x z + x^2) + 5 y (z^4  + B z^3 x +  C z^2 x^2  + B z x^3 + x^4) + D y^2 z x (z+x)+ y_0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z\rightarrow  
z^5 - 10 z^3 (x^2 + A x y + y^2) + 5 z (x^4  + B x^3 y + C x^2 y^2  + B x y^3 + y^4) + D z^2 x y (x+y) +z_0
&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary constants A,B,C and D which give different Mandelbulbs (usually set to 0). The case &lt;math&gt;z \rightarrow z^9&lt;/math&gt; gives a Mandelbulb most similar to the first example where n=9. A more pleasing result for the fifth power is got basing it on the formula: &lt;math&gt;z\rightarrow -z^5 + z_0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Power nine formula==

[[File:Z9fractal.jpg|thumb|Fractal with z^9 Mandelbrot cross sections]]
This fractal has cross-sections of the power 9 Mandelbrot fractal. It has 32 small bulbs sprouting from the main sphere. It is defined by, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;
x\rightarrow 
x^9-36 x^7 (y^2+z^2)+126 x^5 (y^2+z^2)^2-84 x^3 (y^2+z^2)^3+9 x (y^2+z^2)^4 + x_0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
y\rightarrow 
y^9-36 y^7 (z^2+x^2)+126 y^5 (z^2+x^2)^2-84 y^3 (z^2+x^2)^3+9 y (z^2+x^2)^4 + y_0
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
z\rightarrow 
z^9-36 z^7 (x^2+y^2)+126 z^5 (x^2+y^2)^2-84 z^3 (x^2+y^2)^3+9 z (x^2+y^2)^4 + z_0
&lt;/math&gt;

These formula can be written in a shorter way:
:&lt;math&gt;
x\rightarrow 
\frac{1}{2}(x+i\sqrt{y^2+z^2})^9+\frac{1}{2}(x-i\sqrt{y^2+z^2})^9+x_0
&lt;/math&gt;
and equivalently for the other coordinates.

[[File:Mandelblob.jpg|thumb|Power nine fractal detail]]

==Spherical formula==
A perfect spherical formula can be defined as a formula:
:&lt;math&gt;
(x,y,z)\rightarrow( f(x,y,z)+x_0, g(x,y,z) + y_0, h(x,y,z) + z_0 )
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
(x^2+y^2+z^2)^n = f(x,y,z)^2+ g(x,y,z)^2+h(x,y,z)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
where f,g and h are nth power rational trinomials and n is an integer. The cubic fractal above is an example.

In [[cryptography]], '''Mercy''' is a tweakable [[block cipher]] designed by Paul Crowley for [[disk encryption]].

The [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] is 4096 bits—unusually large for a block cipher, but a standard [[disk sector]] size. Mercy uses a 128-bit secret [[key (cryptography)|key]], along with a 128-bit non-secret tweak for each block. In disk encryption, the sector number would be used as a tweak. Mercy uses a 6-round [[Feistel network]] structure with partial [[key whitening]]. The round function uses a key-dependent [[state machine]] which borrows some structure from the [[stream cipher]] [[WAKE (cipher)|WAKE]], with key-dependent [[S-box]]es based on the [[Kaisa Nyberg|Nyberg]] S-boxes also used in [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]].

[[Scott Fluhrer]] has discovered a [[differential attack]] that works against the full 6 rounds of Mercy.  This attack can even be extended to a seven-round variant.&lt;ref name=fluhrer/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4528">In mathematics, the '''mex''' of a [[subset]] of a [[well-ordered]] set is the smallest value from the whole set that does not belong to the subset. That is, it is the [[minimum]] value of the [[complement set]].  The name "mex" is shorthand for "''m''inimum ''ex''cluded" value.

Beyond sets, [[subclass (set theory)|subclasses]] of well-ordered [[class (set theory)|classes]] have minimum excluded values.  Minimum excluded values of subclasses of the [[ordinal number]]s are used in [[combinatorial game theory]] to assign [[nim-value]]s to [[impartial game]]s.
According to the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]], the nim-value of a game position is the minimum excluded value of the class of values of the positions that can be reached in a single move from the given position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Conway | first=John H. | authorlink=John Horton Conway | title=[[On Numbers and Games]] | edition=2nd | publisher=A.K. Peters | year=2001 | isbn=1-56881-127-6 | page=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimum excluded values are also used in [[graph theory]], in [[greedy coloring]] algorithms. These algorithms typically choose an ordering of the vertices of a graph and choose a numbering of the available vertex colors. They then consider the vertices in order, for each vertex choosing its color to be the minimum excluded value of the set of colors already assigned to its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | volume = 10
 | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following examples all assume that the given set is a subset of the class of [[ordinal number]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mex}(\emptyset) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mex}(\{1, 2, 3\}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mex}(\{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\}) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mex}(\{0, 1, 4, 7, 12\}) = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mex}(\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}) = \omega&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{mex}(\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, \omega\}) = \omega+1&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ω''}} is the [[limit ordinal]] for the natural numbers.

==Game theory==
In the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem|Sprague–Grundy theory]] the minimum excluded ordinal is used to determine the [[nimber]] of a [[Normal play convention|normal-play]] impartial game. In such a game, either player has the same moves in each position and the last player to move wins.  The nimber is equal to 0 for a game that is lost immediately by the first player, and is equal to the mex of the nimbers of all possible next positions for any other game.

For example, in a one-pile version of [[Nim]], the game starts with a pile of {{math|''n''}} stones, and the player to move may take any positive number of stones.  If {{math|''n''}} is zero stones, the nimber is 0 because the mex of the empty set of legal moves is the nimber 0.  If {{math|''n''}} is 1 stone, the player to move will leave 0 stones, and  {{math|1=mex({{mset|0}}) = 1}}, gives the nimber for this case.  If {{math|''n''}} is 2 stones, the player to move can leave 0 or 1 stones, giving the nimber 2 as the mex of the nimbers {{math|{{mset|0, 1}}}}.  In general, the player to move with a pile of {{math|''n''}} stones can leave anywhere from 0 to {{math|''n''-1}} stones; the mex of the nimbers {{math|{{mset|0, 1, ..., ''n''-1}}}} is always the nimber {{math|''n''}}.  The first player wins in Nim if and only if the nimber is not zero, so from this analysis we can conclude that the first player wins if and only if the starting number of stones in a one-pile game of Nim is not zero; the winning move is to take all the stones.

If we change the game so that the player to move can take up to 3 stones only, then with {{math|1=''n'' = 4}} stones, the successor states have nimbers {{math|{{mset|1, 2, 3}}}}, giving a mex of 0.  Since the nimber for 4 stones is 0, the first player loses.  The second player's strategy is to respond to whatever move the first player makes by taking the rest of the stones.  For {{math|1=''n'' = 5}} stones, the nimbers of the successor states of 2, 3, and 4 stones are the nimbers 2, 3, and 0 (as we just calculated); the mex of the set of nimbers {{math|{{mset|0, 2, 3}}}} is the nimber 1, so starting with 5 stones in this game is a win for the first player.

See [[nimber]]s for more details on the meaning of nimber values.

In [[mathematics]], a '''moving frame''' is a flexible generalization of the notion of an [[ordered basis]] of a [[vector space]] often used to study the [[differential geometry|extrinsic differential geometry]] of [[smooth manifold]]s embedded in a [[homogeneous space]].

==Introduction==

In lay terms, a '''frame of reference''' is a system of [[measuring rod]]s used by an [[observation|observer]] to measure the surrounding space by providing [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]].  A '''moving frame''' is then a frame of reference which moves with the observer along a trajectory (a [[curve]]).  The method of the moving frame, in this simple example, seeks to produce a "preferred" moving frame out of the [[kinematics|kinematic]] properties of the observer.  In a geometrical setting, this problem was solved in the mid 19th century by [[Jean Frédéric Frenet]] and [[Joseph Alfred Serret]].&lt;ref name="Chern"&gt;{{harvnb|Chern|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Frenet–Serret formulas|Frenet–Serret frame]] is a moving frame defined on a curve which can be constructed purely from the [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Struik, ''Lectures on classical differential geometry'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frenet–Serret frame plays a key role in the [[differential geometry of curves]], ultimately leading to a more or less complete classification of smooth curves in Euclidean space up to [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]].&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{harvnb|Griffiths|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Frenet–Serret formulas]] show that there is a pair of functions defined on the curve, the [[torsion of a curve|torsion]] and [[curvature]], which are obtained by [[derivative|differentiating]] the frame, and which describe completely how the frame evolves in time along the curve.  A key feature of the general method is that a preferred moving frame, provided it can be found, gives a complete kinematic description of the curve.

In the late 19th century, [[Gaston Darboux]] studied the problem of constructing a preferred moving frame on a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] in Euclidean space instead of a curve, the [[Darboux frame]] (or the ''trièdre mobile'' as it was then called).  It turned out to be impossible in general to construct such a frame, and that there were [[integrability conditions for differential systems|integrability conditions]] which needed to be satisfied first.&lt;ref name="Chern" /&gt;

Later, moving frames were developed extensively by [[Élie Cartan]] and others in the study of submanifolds of more general [[homogeneous spaces]] (such as [[projective space]]). In this setting, a '''frame''' carries the geometric idea of a basis of a vector space over to other sorts of geometrical spaces ([[Klein geometry|Klein geometries]]).  Some examples of frames are:&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt;

* A '''[[linear frame]]''' is an [[ordered basis]] of a [[vector space]].
* An '''[[orthonormal frame]]''' of a vector space is an ordered basis consisting of [[orthogonal]] [[unit vector]]s (an [[orthonormal basis]]).
* An '''[[affine frame]]''' of an affine space consists of a choice of [[affine space|origin]] along with an ordered basis of vectors in the associated [[difference space]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Affine_Frame "Affine frame" Proofwiki.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[Euclidean frame]]''' of an affine space is a choice of origin along with an orthonormal basis of the difference space.
* A '''[[projective frame]]''' on ''n''-dimensional [[projective space]] is an ordered collection of ''n''+1 [[linearly independent]] points in the space. &lt;!--Could do more examples probably, e.g. [[conformal frame]]?--&gt;
* [[Frame fields in general relativity]] are four-dimensional frames, or [[vierbein]]s, in German.

In each of these examples, the collection of all frames is [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] in a certain sense.  In the case of linear frames, for instance, any two frames are related by an element of the [[general linear group]].  Projective frames are related by the [[projective linear group]].  This homogeneity, or symmetry, of the class of frames captures the geometrical features of the linear, affine, Euclidean, or projective landscape.  A moving frame, in these circumstances, is just that: a frame which varies from point to point.

Formally, a frame on a [[homogeneous space]] ''G''/''H'' consists of a point in the tautological bundle ''G'' → ''G''/''H''.  A '''''moving frame''''' is a section of this bundle.  It is ''moving'' in the sense that as the point of the base varies, the frame in the fibre changes by an element of the symmetry group ''G''.  A moving frame on a submanifold ''M'' of ''G''/''H'' is a section of the [[pullback bundle|pullback]] of the tautological bundle to ''M''.  Intrinsically&lt;ref&gt;See Cartan (1983) 9.I; Appendix 2 (by Hermann) for the bundle of tangent frames.  Fels and Olver (1998) for the case of more general fibrations.  Griffiths (1974) for the case of frames on the tautological principal bundle of a homogeneous space.&lt;/ref&gt; a moving frame can be defined on a [[principal bundle]] ''P'' over a manifold.  In this case, a moving frame is given by a ''G''-equivariant mapping φ : ''P'' → ''G'', thus ''framing'' the manifold by elements of the Lie group ''G''.

Although there is a substantial formal difference between extrinsic and intrinsic moving frames, they are both alike in the sense that a moving frame is always given by a mapping into ''G''.  The strategy in Cartan's '''method of moving frames''', as outlined briefly in [[Cartan's equivalence method]], is to find a ''natural moving frame'' on the manifold and then to take its [[Darboux derivative]], in other words [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] the [[Maurer-Cartan form]] of ''G'' to ''M'' (or ''P''), and thus obtain a complete set of structural invariants for the manifold.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt;

== Method of the moving frame ==
{{harvtxt|Cartan|1937}} formulated the general definition of a moving frame and the method of the moving frame, as elaborated by {{harvtxt|Weyl|1938}}.  The elements of the theory are

* A [[Lie group]] ''G''.
* A [[Klein space]] ''X'' whose group of geometric automorphisms is ''G''.
* A [[smooth manifold]] Σ which serves as a space of (generalized) coordinates for ''X''.
* A collection of ''frames'' ƒ each of which determines a coordinate function from ''X'' to Σ (the precise nature of the frame is left vague in the general axiomatization).

The following axioms are then assumed to hold between these elements:

* There is a free and transitive [[group action]] of ''G'' on the collection of frames: it is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for ''G''.  In particular, for any pair of frames ƒ and ƒ&amp;prime;, there is a unique transition of frame (ƒ→ƒ&amp;prime;) in ''G'' determined by the requirement (ƒ→ƒ&amp;prime;)ƒ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ&amp;prime;.
* Given a frame ƒ and a point ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'', there is associated a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''A'',ƒ) belonging to Σ.  This mapping determined by the frame ƒ is a bijection from the points of ''X'' to those of Σ.  This bijection is compatible with the law of composition of frames in the sense that the coordinate ''x''&amp;prime; of the point ''A'' in a different frame ƒ&amp;prime; arises from (''A'',ƒ) by application of the transformation (ƒ→ƒ&amp;prime;).  That is,

::&lt;math&gt;(A,f') = (f\to f')\circ(A,f).&lt;/math&gt;

Of interest to the method are parameterized submanifolds of ''X''.  The considerations are largely local, so the parameter domain is taken to be an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;.  Slightly different techniques apply depending on whether one is interested in the submanifold along with its parameterization, or the submanifold up to reparameterization.

== Moving tangent frames ==
The most commonly encountered case of a moving frame is for the bundle of tangent frames (also called the ''[[frame bundle]]'') of a manifold.  In this case, a moving tangent frame on a manifold ''M'' consists of a collection of vector fields ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; forming a basis of the [[tangent space]] at each point of an open set ''U'' ⊂ ''M''.

If &lt;math&gt;(x^1,x^2,...,x^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate system on ''U'', then each vector field ''e&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be expressed as a linear combination of the coordinate vector fields &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;e_j = \sum_{i=1}^n A^i_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i},&lt;/math&gt;where each &lt;math&gt;A^i_j&lt;/math&gt; is a function on ''U''. These can be seen as the components of a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This matrix is useful for finding the coordinate expression of the dual coframe, as explained in the next section.

===Coframes===

A moving frame determines a '''dual frame''' or '''[[coframe]]''' of the [[cotangent bundle]] over ''U'', which is sometimes also called a moving frame. This is a ''n''-tuple of smooth ''1''-forms
:''θ''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; , ..., ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;

which are linearly independent at each point ''q'' in ''U''. Conversely, given such a coframe, there is a unique moving frame ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; which is dual to it, i.e., satisfies the duality relation ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''δ''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''δ''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] function on ''U''.

If &lt;math&gt;(x^1,x^2,...,x^n)&lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate system on ''U'', as in the preceding section, then each covector field ''θ''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; can be expressed as a linear combination of the coordinate covector fields &lt;math&gt;dx^i&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\theta^i = \sum_{j=1}^n B^i_j dx^j,&lt;/math&gt;where each &lt;math&gt;B^i_j&lt;/math&gt; is a function on ''U.'' Since &lt;math&gt;dx^i\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\right) = \delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt;, the two coordinate expressions above combine to yield &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n B^i_k A^k_j = \delta^i_j&lt;/math&gt;; in terms of matrices, this just says that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are [[Matrix inverse|inverses]] of each other.

===Uses===

Moving frames are important in [[general relativity]], where there is no privileged way of extending a choice of frame at an event ''p'' (a point in [[spacetime]], which is a manifold of dimension four) to nearby points, and so a choice must be made. In contrast in [[special relativity]], ''M'' is taken to be a vector space ''V'' (of dimension four). In that case a frame at a point ''p'' can be translated from ''p'' to any other point ''q'' in a well-defined way. Broadly speaking, a moving frame corresponds to an observer, and the distinguished frames in special relativity represent [[inertial frame of reference|inertial observers]].

In relativity and in [[Riemannian geometry]], the most useful kind of moving frames are the '''orthogonal''' and '''[[orthonormal frame]]s''', that is, frames consisting of orthogonal (unit) vectors at each point. At a given point ''p'' a general frame may be made orthonormal by [[orthonormalization]]; in fact this can be done smoothly, so that the existence of a moving frame implies the existence of a moving orthonormal frame.

===Further details===

A moving frame always exists ''locally'', i.e., in some neighbourhood ''U'' of any point ''p'' in ''M''; however, the existence of a moving frame globally on ''M'' requires [[topological]] conditions. For example when ''M'' is a [[circle]], or more generally a [[torus]], such frames exist; but not when ''M'' is a 2-[[sphere]]. A manifold that does have a global moving frame is called ''[[parallelizable]]''. Note for example how the unit directions of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] on the Earth's surface break down as a moving frame at the north and south poles.

The '''method of moving frames''' of [[Élie Cartan]] is based on taking a moving frame that is adapted to the particular problem being studied. For example, given a [[curve]] in space, the first three derivative vectors of the curve can in general define a frame at a point of it (cf. [[torsion tensor]] for a quantitative description – it is assumed here that the torsion is not zero). In fact, in the method of moving frames, one more often works with coframes rather than frames. More generally, moving frames may be viewed as sections of [[principal bundle]]s over open sets ''U''. The general Cartan method exploits this abstraction using the notion of a [[Cartan connection]].

== Atlases==
In many cases, it is impossible to define a single frame of reference that valid globally. To overcome this, frames are commonly pieced together to form an [[atlas (topology)|atlas]], thus arriving at the notion of a '''[[local frame]]'''. In addition, it is often desirable to endow these atlases with a [[smooth structure]], so that the resulting frame fields are differentiable.

==Generalizations==
Although this article constructs the frame fields as a coordinate system on the [[tangent bundle]] of a [[manifold]], the general ideas move over easily to the concept of a [[vector bundle]], which is a manifold endowed with a vector space at each point, that vector space being arbitrary, and not in general related to the tangent bundle.

==Applications==
[[Image:Flight dynamics with text.png|right|thumb|The principal axes of rotation in space]]
[[Aerobatic maneuver|Aircraft maneuver]]s can be expressed in terms of the moving frame ([[Aircraft principal axes]]) when described by the pilot.

'''Multimedia Broadcast multicast service Single Frequency Network''' ('''MBSFN''') is a [[Channel (communications)|communication channel]] defined in the [[4G|fourth-generation cellular networking standard]] called [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|Long Term Evolution (LTE)]]. The transmission mode is intended as a further improvement of the efficiency of the [[MBMS|enhanced Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service]] (eMBMS) service, which can deliver services such as [[mobile TV]] using the LTE infrastructure, and is expected to [[MBMS#Competing technologies|compete]] with dedicated mobile/handheld TV broadcast systems such as [[DVB-H]] and [[DVB-SH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long Term Evolution (LTE): A Technical Overview|url=http://www.motorola.com/web/Business/Solutions/Industry%20Solutions/Service%20Providers/Wireless%20Operators/LTE/_Document/Static%20Files/6834_MotDoc_New.pdf|publisher=Motorola Technical White Paper|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Lorraine|title=3G evolution to rival DVB-H, WiMAX - Analysys|url=http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=363424|publisher=Total Telecom|accessdate=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables [[network operator]]s to offer mobile TV without the need for additional expensive [[licensed spectrum]] and without requiring new infrastructure and end-user devices.&lt;ref name=Fitchard0&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitchard|first=Kevin|title=Why Qualcomm thinks LTE-broadcast will work where FLO TV failed|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/04/09/why-qualcomm-thinks-lte-broadcast-will-work-where-flo-tv-failed/|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eMBMS service can offer many more TV programs in a specific radio frequency spectrum as compared to traditional terrestrial TV broadcasting, since it is based on the principles of [[Interactive Multicast]], where TV content only is transmitted in where there currently are viewers. The eMBMS service also provides better [[system spectral efficiency]]  than [[video-on-demand]] over traditional cellular unicasting services, since in eMBMS, each TV program is only transmitted once in each cell, even if there are several viewers of that program in the same cell. The MBSFN transmission mode further improves the spectral efficiency, since it is based on the principles of [[Dynamic single frequency networks]] (DSFN). This implies that it dynamically forms [[single-frequency network]]s (SFNs), i.e. groups of adjacent base stations that send the same signal simultaneously on the same frequency sub-carriers, when there are mobile TV viewers of the same TV program content in the adjacent cells. The LTE [[OFDMA]] downlink modulation and multiple access scheme eliminates self-interference caused by the SFN:s. Efficient TV transmission using similar combinations of Interactive multicast (IP Multicast) and DSFN has also been suggested for the DVB-T2 and DVB-H systems.&lt;ref&gt;M. Eriksson, S.M. Hasibur Rahman, F. Fraille, M. Sjöström, ”[http://apachepersonal.miun.se/~mageri/myresearch/bmsb2013-Eriksson.pdf Efficient Interactive Multicast over DVB-T2 - Utilizing Dynamic SFNs and PARPS]”, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (BMSB’13), London, UK, June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

MBMS and [[mobile TV]] was a failure in 3G systems, and was offered by very few mobile operators, partly because of its limited peak bit rates and capacity, not allowing standard TV video quality, something that LTE with eMBMS does not suffer from.

==Technical details==

LTE's Enhanced [[MBMS|Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services]] (E-MBMS) provides transport features for sending the same content information to all the users in a cell ([[broadcast]]) or to a given set of users (subscribers) in a cell ([[multicast]]) using a subset of the available radio resources with the remaining available to support transmissions towards a particular user (so-called [[unicast]] services). It must not be confused with IP-level broadcast or multicast, which offer no sharing of resources on the radio access level. In E-MBMS it is possible to either use a single [[Node B|eNode-B]] or multiple eNode-Bs for transmission to multiple [[User equipment|UE]]s. MBSFN is the definition for the latter.&lt;ref name=Lescuyer&gt;{{cite book|last=Lescuyer|first=Pierre|title=Evolved Packet System (EPS): The LTE and SAE Evolution of 3G UMTS|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-05976-0|pages=140–143|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470059761.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBSFN is a transmission mode which exploits LTE's [[OFDM]] radio interface to send multicast or broadcast data as a multicell transmission over a synchronized [[Single-frequency network|single-frequency network (SFN)]]. The transmissions from the multiple cells are sufficiently tightly synchronized for each to arrive at the UE within the OFDM [[Cyclic prefix|Cyclic Prefix (CP)]] so as to avoid [[Intersymbol interference|Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)]]. In effect, this makes the MBSFN transmission appear to a UE as a transmission from a single large cell, dramatically increasing the [[Signal-to-interference ratio|Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)]] due to the absence of inter-cell interference.&lt;ref name=Sesia&gt;{{cite book|last=Sesia|first=Stefania|title=LTE - A Pocket Dictionary of Acronyms|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-69716-0|page=45|url=http://lte.alcatel-lucent.com/locale/en_us/downloads/LTE-A_Pocket_Dictionary_of_Acronyms.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial adoption==

Commercial deployment of E-MBMS (and therefore MBSFN) features is expected to start in 2013 as an upgrade of existing LTE networks.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Tammy|title=Making the case for LTE Broadcast and Dyle mobile TV|url=http://www.fiercebroadbandwireless.com/story/making-case-lte-broadcast-and-dyle-mobile-tv/2012-08-15|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowell McAdam, CEO of Verizon, stated in his CES 2013 keynote that he hopes to have LTE-Broadcast available to live-broadcast the Super Bowl 2014 over its network. On a more general note, he identified live events as the ideal use case for LTE-Broadcast.&lt;ref name=Fitchard1&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitchard|first=Kevin|title=Can LTE-broadcast dam the mobile video deluge?|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/01/10/can-lte-broadcast-dam-the-mobile-video-deluge/|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7879">In [[mathematics]], the '''multiplicity''' of a member of a [[multiset]] is the number of times it appears in the multiset.  For example, the number of times a given [[polynomial equation]] has a [[Root of a function|root]] at a given point is the multiplicity of that root.

The notion of multiplicity is important to be able to count correctly without specifying exceptions (for example, ''double roots'' counted twice).  Hence the expression, "counted with multiplicity".

If multiplicity is ignored, this may be emphasized by counting the number of '''distinct''' elements, as in "the number of distinct roots". However, whenever a set (as opposed to multiset) is formed, multiplicity is automatically ignored, without requiring use of the term "distinct".

==Multiplicity of a prime factor==
{{main|p-adic order}}

In the [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]], for example,

: {{math|1=60 = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3 &amp;times; 5,}}

the multiplicity of the prime factor 2 is 2, while the multiplicity of each of the prime factors 3 and 5 is 1.  Thus, 60 has four prime factors allowing for multiplicities, but only three distinct prime factors.

==Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial==

Let ''F'' be a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and ''p''(''x'') be a [[polynomial]] in one variable and coefficients in ''F''. An element ''a''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''F'' is a [[root of a function|root]] of multiplicity ''k'' of ''p''(''x'') if there is a polynomial ''s''(''x'') such that ''s''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and ''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a'')&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''s''(''x'').  If ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then ''a'' is called a [[simple root]]. If ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, then ''a'' is called a '''multiple root'''.

For instance, the polynomial ''p''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4 has 1 and &amp;minus;4 as [[Root of a function|roots]], and can be written as ''p''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that 1 is a root of multiplicity&amp;nbsp;2, and &amp;minus;4 is a 'simple' root (of multiplicity&amp;nbsp;1).  The multiplicity of a root is the number of occurrences of this root in the complete factorization of the polynomial, by means of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].

If ''a'' is a root of multiplicity ''k'' of a polynomial, then it is a root of multiplicity ''k''&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1 of its [[derivative]].
The [[discriminant]] of a polynomial is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root.

=== Behavior of a polynomial function near a multiple root ===

[[File:Polynomial roots multiplicity.svg|thumb|Graph of the polynomial ''p''(''x'') =&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4 with its roots (zeros) −4 and&amp;nbsp;1. The root −4 is a 'simple' root (of multiplicity 1), and therefore the graph crosses the ''x''-axis at this root. The root 1 is of even multiplicity and therefore the graph bounces off the ''x''-axis at this root.|upright]]

The [[graph of a function|graph]] of a [[polynomial function]] ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'') intersects the ''x''-axis at the real roots of the polynomial. The graph is [[tangent]] to this axis at the multiple roots of ''f'' and not tangent at the simple roots. The graph crosses the ''x''-axis at roots of odd multiplicity and bounces off (not goes through) the ''x''-axis at roots of even multiplicity.

A non-zero polynomial function is always [[non-negative]] if and only if all its roots have an even multiplicity and there exists ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that {{nowrap|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; 0}}.

==Intersection multiplicity==
{{main|Intersection theory}}
In [[algebraic geometry]], the intersection of two sub-varieties of an algebraic variety is a finite union of [[irreducible variety|irreducible varieties]]. To each component of such an intersection is attached an '''intersection multiplicity'''. This notion is [[local property|local]] in the sense that it may be defined by looking at what occurs in a neighborhood of any [[generic point]] of this component. It follows that without loss of generality, we may consider, in order to define the intersection multiplicity, the intersection of two [[affine variety|affines varieties]] (sub-varieties of an affine space).

Thus, given two affine varieties ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, let us consider an [[irreducible component]] ''W'' of the intersection of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''d'' be the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] of ''W'', and ''P'' be any generic point of ''W''. The intersection of ''W'' with ''d'' [[hyperplane]]s in [[general position]] passing through ''P'' has an irreducible component that is reduced to the single point ''P''. Therefore, the [[local ring]] at this component of the [[coordinate ring]] of the intersection has only one [[prime ideal]], and is therefore an [[Artinian ring]]. This ring is thus a [[finite dimensional]] vector space over the ground field. Its dimension is the '''intersection multiplicity''' of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at ''W''.

This definition allows us to state [[Bézout's theorem]] and its generalizations precisely.

This definition generalizes the multiplicity of a root of a polynomial in the following way. The roots of a polynomial ''f'' are points on the [[affine line]], which are the components of the algebraic set defined by the polynomial. The coordinate ring of this affine set is &lt;math&gt;R=K[X]/\langle f\rangle, &lt;/math&gt; where ''K'' is an [[algebraically closed field]] containing the coefficients of ''f''. If &lt;math&gt;f(X)=\prod_{i=1}^k (X-\alpha_i)^{m_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the factorization of ''f'', then the local ring of ''R'' at the prime ideal &lt;math&gt;\langle X-\alpha_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;K[X]/\langle (X-\alpha)^{m_i}\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; This is a vector space over ''K'', which has the multiplicity &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; of the root as a dimension.

This definition of intersection multiplicity, which is essentially due to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in his book ''Local Algebra'', works only for the set theoretic components (also called ''isolated components'') of the intersection, not for the [[embedded prime|embedded components]]. Theories have been developed for handling the embedded case (see [[Intersection theory]] for details).

==In complex analysis==
Let ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; be a root of a [[holomorphic function]] ''f'', and let ''n'' be the least positive integer such that, the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative of ''f'' evaluated at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; differs from zero. Then the power series of ''f'' about ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; begins with the ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; term, and ''f'' is said to have a root of multiplicity (or “order”)&amp;nbsp;''n''. If ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the root is called a simple root.&lt;ref&gt;(Krantz 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;70)&lt;/ref&gt;

We can also define the multiplicity of the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] and [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of a [[meromorphic function]] thus: If we have a meromorphic function ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''g''/''h'', take the [[Taylor series|Taylor expansions]] of ''g'' and ''h'' about a point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and find the first non-zero term in each (denote the order of the terms ''m'' and ''n'' respectively). if ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'', then the point has non-zero value. If ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', then the point is a zero of multiplicity ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''. If ''m''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'', then the point has a pole of multiplicity ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69285">[[File:Descriptively Near Sets.svg|right|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Descriptively, very near sets]]

In mathematics, '''near sets''' are either spatially [[closeness (mathematics)|close]] or descriptively close. Spatially close sets have nonempty [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. In other words, spatially close sets are not [[disjoint sets]], since they always have at least one element in common. Descriptively close sets contain elements that have matching descriptions. Such sets can be either disjoint or non-disjoint sets. Spatially near sets are also descriptively near sets.

[[File:Minimally Descriptive Near Sets.svg|right|thumb|'''Figure 2.''' Descriptively, minimally near sets]]

The underlying assumption with descriptively close sets is that such sets contain elements that have location and measurable features such as colour and frequency of occurrence. The description of the element of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] is defined by a [[feature vector]]. Comparison of feature vectors provides a basis for measuring the closeness of descriptively near sets. Near set theory provides a formal basis for the observation, comparison, and classification of elements in sets based on their closeness, either spatially or descriptively. Near sets offer a framework for solving problems based on [[perception|human perception]] that arise in areas such as [[image processing]], [[computer vision]] as well as engineering and science problems.

Near sets have a variety of applications in areas such as [[topology]]{{cref2|37|1}}, [[pattern recognition|pattern detection]] and [[statistical classification|classification]]{{cref2|50|1}}, [[abstract algebra]]{{cref2|51|1}}, mathematics in computer science{{cref2|38|1}}, and solving a variety of problems based on human perception{{cref2|42|1}}{{cref2|82|1}}{{cref2|47|1}}{{cref2|52|1}}{{cref2|56|1}} that arise in areas such as [[image analysis]]{{cref2|54|1}}{{cref2|14|1}}{{cref2|46|1}}{{cref2|17|1}}{{cref2|18|1}}, image processing{{cref2|40|1}}, [[Facial recognition system|face recognition]]{{cref2|13|1}}, [[ethology]]{{cref2|64|1}}, as well as engineering and science problems{{cref2|55|1}}{{cref2|64|2}}{{cref2|42|2}}{{cref2|19|1}}{{cref2|17|2}}{{cref2|18|2}}. From the beginning, descriptively near sets have proved to be useful in applications of topology{{cref2|37|2}}, and visual pattern recognition {{cref2|50|2}}, spanning a broad spectrum of applications that include [[camouflage]] detection, [[micropaleontology]], handwriting forgery detection, biomedical image analysis, [[content-based image retrieval]], [[population dynamics]], [[quotient space (topology)|quotient topology]], [[textile design]], [[visual merchandising]], and topological psychology.

As an illustration of the degree of descriptive nearness between two sets, consider an example of the Henry colour model for varying degrees of nearness
between sets of picture elements in pictures (see, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|17|3}} §4.3). The two pairs of ovals in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 contain coloured segments. Each segment in the figures corresponds to an equivalence class where all pixels in the class have similar descriptions, ''i.e.'', picture elements with similar colours. The ovals in Fig.1 are closer to each other descriptively than the ovals in Fig. 2.

== History ==
It has been observed that the simple concept of ''nearness'' unifies various concepts of topological structures{{cref2|20|1}} inasmuch as the [[category (mathematics)|category]] '''Near''' of all nearness spaces and nearness preserving maps contains categories '''sTop''' (symmetric topological spaces and continuous maps{{cref2|3|1}}), '''Prox''' ([[proximity space]]s and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-maps{{cref2|8|1}}{{cref2|67|1}}), '''Unif''' ([[uniform space]]s and uniformly continuous maps{{cref2|81|1}}{{cref2|77|1}}) and '''Cont''' (contiguity spaces and contiguity maps{{cref2|24|1}}) as embedded full subcategories{{cref2|20|2}}{{cref2|59|1}}. The categories &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AMer}}&lt;/math&gt; are shown to be full supercategories of various well-known categories, including the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{sTop}&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric topological spaces and continuous maps, and the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of extended metric spaces and nonexpansive maps. The notation &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}\hookrightarrow\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; reads ''category'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; ''is embedded in category'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The categories &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AMer}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon ANear}&lt;/math&gt; are supercategories for a variety of familiar categories{{cref2|76|1}} shown in Fig. 3. Let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; denote the category of all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach nearness spaces and contractions, and let &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AMer}&lt;/math&gt; denote the category of all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach merotopic spaces and contractions.

[[File:EANear and eAMer Supercategories.png|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' Supercats]]

Among these familiar categories is &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{sTop}&lt;/math&gt;, the symmetric form of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Top}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[category of topological spaces]]), the category with objects that are topological spaces and morphisms that are continuous maps between them{{cref2|1|1}}{{cref2|32|1}}. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^{\infty}}&lt;/math&gt; with objects that are extended metric spaces is a subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon AP}&lt;/math&gt; (having objects &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-approach spaces and contractions)  (see also{{cref2|57|1}}{{cref2|75|1}}). Let &lt;math&gt;\rho_X,\rho_Y&lt;/math&gt; be extended pseudometrics on nonempty sets &lt;math&gt;X,Y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The map &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\rho_X)\longrightarrow(Y,\rho_Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction if and only if &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\nu_{D_{\rho_X}})\longrightarrow(Y,\nu_{D_{\rho_Y}})&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. For nonempty subsets &lt;math&gt;A,B\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; , the distance function &lt;math&gt;D_{\rho}:2^X\times 2^X\longrightarrow [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;D_{\rho}(A,B) =\begin{cases}
\inf{\{\rho(a,b): a\in A, b\in B\}}, &amp;\text{if }A\text{ and }B\text{ are not empty},\\ 
\infty, &amp;\text{if }A\text{ or }B\text{ is empty}. 
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;'''AP''' is embedded as a full subcategory in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; by the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}\longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;F((X,\rho))=(X,\nu_{D_{\rho}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(f)=f&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\rho_X)\longrightarrow(Y,\rho_Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction if and only if &lt;math&gt;f:(X,\nu_{D_{\rho_X}})\longrightarrow(Y,\nu_{D_{\rho_Y}})&lt;/math&gt; is a contraction. Thus &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}&lt;/math&gt; is embedded as a full subcategory in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; by the functor &lt;math&gt;F: \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}\longrightarrow \boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;F((X,\rho))=(X,\nu_{D_{\rho}})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(f)=f.&lt;/math&gt; Since the category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt; of extended metric spaces and nonexpansive maps is a full subcategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{AP}}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; is also a full supercategory of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Met^\infty}&lt;/math&gt;. The category &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon{ANear}}&lt;/math&gt; is a topological construct{{cref2|76|2}}.

[[File:Frigyes Riesz.jpeg|thumb|'''Figure 4.''' [[Frigyes Riesz]], 1880-1956]]

The notions of near and far{{cref2|A|1|group=2}} in mathematics can be traced back to works by [[Johann Benedict Listing]] and [[Felix Hausdorff]]. The related notions of resemblance and similarity can be traced back to [[Henri Poincaré|J.H. Poincaré]], who introduced sets of similar sensations (nascent tolerance classes) to represent the results of G.T. Fechner's sensation sensitivity experiments{{cref2|10|1}} and a framework for the study of resemblance in representative spaces as models of what he termed physical continua{{cref2|63|1}}{{cref2|60|1}}{{cref2|61|1}}. The elements of a physical continuum (pc) are sets of sensations. The notion of a pc and various representative spaces (tactile, visual, motor spaces) were introduced by Poincaré in an 1894 article on the mathematical continuum{{cref2|63|2}}, an 1895 article on space and geometry{{cref2|60|2}} and a compendious 1902 book on science and hypothesis{{cref2|61|2}} followed by a number of elaborations, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|62|1}}. The 1893 and 1895 articles on continua (Pt. 1, ch. II) as well as representative spaces and geometry (Pt. 2, ch IV) are included as chapters in{{cref2|61|3}}. Later, F. Riesz introduced the concept of proximity or nearness of pairs of sets at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1908{{cref2|65|1}}.

During the 1960s, [[Christopher Zeeman|E.C. Zeeman]] introduced tolerance spaces in modelling visual perception{{cref2|83|1}}. A.B. Sossinsky observed in 1986{{cref2|71|1}} that the main idea underlying tolerance space theory comes from Poincaré, especially{{cref2|60|3}}. In 2002, Z. Pawlak and J. Peters{{cref2|B|1|group=2}} considered an informal approach to the perception of the nearness of physical objects such as snowflakes that was not limited to spatial nearness. In 2006, a formal approach to the descriptive nearness of objects was considered by J. Peters, A. Skowron and J. Stepaniuk{{cref2|C|1|group=2}} in the context of proximity spaces{{cref2|39|1}}{{cref2|33|1}}{{cref2|35|1}}{{cref2|21|1}}. In 2007, descriptively near sets were introduced by J. Peters{{cref2|D|1|group=2}}{{cref2|E|1|group=2}} followed by the introduction of tolerance near sets{{cref2|41|1}}{{cref2|45|1}}. Recently, the study of descriptively near sets has led to algebraic{{cref2|22|1}}{{cref2|51|2}}, topological and proximity space{{cref2|37|4}} foundations of such sets.

== Nearness of sets ==
The adjective ''near'' in the context of near sets is used to denote the fact that observed feature value differences of distinct objects are small enough to be
considered indistinguishable, ''i.e.'', within some tolerance.

The exact idea of closeness or 'resemblance' or of 'being within tolerance' is universal enough to appear, quite naturally, in almost any mathematical setting
(see, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|66|1}}). It is especially natural in mathematical applications: practical problems, more often than not, deal with approximate input data and only require viable results with a tolerable level of error{{cref2|71|2}}.

The words ''near'' and ''far'' are used in daily life and it was an incisive suggestion of [[Frigyes Riesz|F. Riesz]]{{cref2|65|2}} that these intuitive concepts be made rigorous. He introduced the concept of nearness of pairs of sets at the ICM in Rome in 1908. This concept is useful in simplifying teaching calculus and advanced calculus. For example, the passage from an intuitive definition of continuity of a function at a point to its rigorous epsilon-delta definition is sometime difficult for teachers to explain and for students to understand. Intuitively, [[continuous function|continuity]] can be explained using nearness language, ''i.e.'', a function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at a point &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, provided points &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; go into points &lt;math&gt;\{f(x)\}&lt;/math&gt; near &lt;math&gt;f(c)&lt;/math&gt;. Using Riesz's idea, this definition can be made more precise and its contrapositive is the familiar definition{{cref2|4|1}}{{cref2|36|1}}.

== Generalization of set intersection ==
From a spatial point of view, nearness (a.k.a. proximity) is considered a generalization of set [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. For disjoint sets, a form of nearness set intersection is defined in terms of a set of objects (extracted from disjoint sets) that have similar features within some
tolerance (see, ''e.g.'', §3 in{{cref2|80|1}}). For example, the ovals in Fig. 1 are considered near each other, since these ovals contain pairs of classes that display similar (visually indistinguishable) colours.

== Efremovič proximity space ==
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denote a [[metric space|metric]] [[topological space]] that is endowed with one or more proximity relations and let &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; denote the collection of all subsets of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  The collection &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

There are many ways to define Efremovič proximities on topological spaces (discrete proximity, standard proximity, metric proximity, Čech proximity, Alexandroff proximity, and Freudenthal proximity),  For details, see § 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–94 in{{cref2|6|1}}.
The focus here is on ''standard proximity'' on a topological space.  For &lt;math&gt;A,B\subset X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is near &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided their closures share a common point.

The ''closure'' of a subset &lt;math&gt;A\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) is the usual [[Kuratowski closure axioms|Kuratowski closure]] of a set{{cref2|F|1|group=2}}, introduced in § 4, p.&amp;nbsp;20{{cref2|27}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mbox{cl}(A) &amp;= \left\{x\in X: D(x,A)=0\right\},\ \mbox{where}\\
D(x,A) &amp;= inf\left\{d(x,a): a\in A\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;D(x,A)&lt;/math&gt; is the Hausdorff distance (see § 22, p.&amp;nbsp;128, in{{cref2|15|1}}) between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d(x,a) = \left|x - a \right|&lt;/math&gt; (standard distance)). A ''standard''  proximity relation is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X: \mbox{cl}(A)\ \cap\ \mbox{cl}(B)\neq\emptyset\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no points in common, the sets are ''far''from each other (denoted &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}\ B&lt;/math&gt;).

The following EF-proximity{{cref2|G|1|group=2}} space axioms are given by Jurij Michailov Smirnov{{cref2|67|2}} based on what [[Vadim Arsenyevich Efremovich|Vadim Arsenyevič Efremovič]] introduced during the first half of the 1930s{{cref2|8|2}}. Let &lt;math&gt;A,B,E\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;.

;EF.1 : If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.2 : &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if, at least one of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.3 : Two points are close, if and only if, they are the same point.
;EF.4 : All sets are far from the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
;EF.5 : For any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are far from each other, there exists &lt;math&gt;C,D\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C\cup D = X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (''Efremovič-axiom'').

The pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta)&lt;/math&gt; is called an EF-[[proximity space]].   In this context, a [[space]] is a set with some added structure.  With a proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the structure of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is induced by the EF-proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. In a proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the intersection of all closed sets that contain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 1{{cref2|67|3}} : The closure of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that are close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

== Visualization of EF-axiom ==

[[File:Sample EF-space.svg|thumb|'''Figure 5.''' Example of a descriptive EF-proximity relation between sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C^c&lt;/math&gt;]]

Let the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be represented by the points inside the rectangular region in Fig. 5.  Also, let &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; be any two non-intersection subsets (''i.e.'' subsets spatially far from each other) in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, as shown in Fig. 5.  Let &lt;math&gt;C^c = X \backslash C&lt;/math&gt; ([[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the set &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;). Then from the EF-axiom, observe the following:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A\ &amp;\underline{\delta}\ B,\\
B &amp;\subset C,\\
D &amp;= C^c,\\
X &amp;= D \cup C,\\
 A &amp;\subset D,\ \mbox{hence, we can write}\\
A\ \underline{\delta}\ B\ &amp;\Rightarrow\ A\ \underline{\delta}\ C\ \mbox{and}\ B\ \underline{\delta}\ D,\ \mbox{for some}\ C,D\ \mbox{in}\ X \mbox{ so that } C\cup D = X. \qquad \blacksquare
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

== Descriptive proximity space ==
Descriptively near sets were introduced as a means of solving classification and pattern recognition problems arising from disjoint sets that resemble each other{{cref2|44|1}}{{cref2|43|1}}.  Recently, the connections between near sets in EF-spaces and near sets in descriptive EF-proximity spaces have been explored in{{cref2|53|1}}{{cref2|48|1}}.

Again, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a metric topological space and let &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \left\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\right\}&lt;/math&gt; a set of probe functions that represent features of each &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  The assumption made here is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains non-abstract points that have measurable features such as gradient orientation.  A non-abstract point has a location and features that can be measured (see § 3 in {{cref2|26|1}}).

A ''probe function'' &lt;math&gt;\phi:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; represents a feature of a sample point in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi:X\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = (\phi_1(x),\dots,\phi_n(x))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is an n-dimensional real Euclidean [[vector space]].  &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a feature vector for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which provides a description of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. For example, this leads to a proximal view of sets of picture points in digital images{{cref2|48|2}}.

To obtain a descriptive proximity relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;), one first chooses a set of probe functions.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}: 2^X\longrightarrow 2^{R^n}&lt;/math&gt; be a mapping on a subset of &lt;math&gt;2^X&lt;/math&gt; into a subset of &lt;math&gt;2^{R^n}&lt;/math&gt;.   For example, let &lt;math&gt;A,B\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A),\mathcal{Q}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denote sets of descriptions of points in &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{Q}(A) &amp;= \left\{\Phi(a): a\in A\right\},\\
\mathcal{Q}(B) &amp;= \left\{\Phi(b): b\in B\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;A\  \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is descriptively near'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;A\  \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; reads &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is descriptively far from'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  The descriptive proximity of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))\; \delta \;\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(B)) \neq \emptyset.
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''descriptive intersection'' &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B = \left\{x\in A\cup B:\mathcal{Q}(A)\; \delta \;\mathcal{Q}(B)\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;x\in A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;, provided &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \Phi(a) = \Phi(b)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;a\in A, b\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Observe that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; can be disjoint and yet &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; can be nonempty.
The descriptive proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{\Phi} = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X:
                       \mbox{cl}(A)\ \mathop{\cap}_{\Phi}\ \mbox{cl}(B)\neq\emptyset\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have no points with matching descriptions, the sets are ''descriptively far'' from each other 
(denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;).

The binary relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''descriptive EF-proximity'', provided the following axioms are satisfied for &lt;math&gt;A,B,E\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.

;dEF.1 : If the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.2 : &lt;math&gt;A\cup B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if, at least one of the sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.3 : Two points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; are descriptively close, if and only if, the description of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; matches the description of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.4 : All nonempty sets are descriptively far from the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
;dEF.5 : For any two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; which are descriptively far from each other, there exists &lt;math&gt;C,D\in 2^X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C\cup D = X&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively far from &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is descriptively far from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; (''Descriptive Efremovič axiom'').

The pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \delta_{\Phi})&lt;/math&gt; is called a descriptive proximity space.

== Proximal relator spaces ==
A ''relator'' is a nonvoid family of relations  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; on a nonempty set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|72|1}}.  The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt; (also denoted &lt;math&gt;X(\mathcal{R})&lt;/math&gt;) is called a relator space. Relator spaces are natural generalizations of ordered sets and uniform spaces{{cref2|73|1}}{{cref2|74|1}}}. With the introduction of a family of proximity relations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta})&lt;/math&gt;.  For simplicity, we consider only two proximity relations, namely, the Efremovič proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|8|3}} and the descriptive proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; in defining the ''descriptive relator'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|53|2}}{{cref2|48|3}}. The pair &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''proximal relator space ''{{cref2|49|1}}. In this work, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes a metric topological space that is endowed with the relations in a proximal relator. With the introduction of &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt;, the traditional closure of a subset (''e.g.'', {{cref2|9|1}}{{cref2|7|1}}) can be compared with the more recent descriptive closure of a subset.

In a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the ''descriptive closure of a set'' &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A) = \left\{x\in X: {\Phi(x)} \delta \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is in the descriptive closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, provided the closure of &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and the closure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}(A))&lt;/math&gt; have at least one element in common.

;Theorem 2 {{cref2|50|3}} : The descriptive closure of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the descriptive EF-proximity space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; is the set of points &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; that are descriptively close to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 3 {{cref2|50|4}} : Kuratowski closure of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of the descriptive closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in a descriptive EF-proximity space.

;Theorem 4 {{cref2|49|2}} : Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; be a proximal relator space, &lt;math&gt;A\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)\subseteq \mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

; Proof : Let &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\in\mathcal{Q}(X\setminus \mbox{cl}(A))&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \Phi(a)&lt;/math&gt;  for some &lt;math&gt;a\in \mbox{cl}A&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\in\mathcal{Q}(\mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A))&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}(A)\subseteq \mbox{cl}_{\Phi}(A)&lt;/math&gt;

In a proximal relator space, EF-proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; leads to the following results for descriptive proximity &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;.

;Theorem 5 {{cref2|49|3}} : Let &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}})&lt;/math&gt; be a proximal relator space, &lt;math&gt;A,B,C\subset X&lt;/math&gt;.  Then

;1&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B\ \mbox{implies}\ A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;.
;2&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; (A\cup B)\ \delta\ C\ \mbox{implies}\ (A\cup B)\ \delta_{\Phi}\ C &lt;/math&gt;.
;3&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{cl}A\ \delta\ \mbox{cl}B\ \mbox{implies}\ \mbox{cl}A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ \mbox{cl}B&lt;/math&gt;.

; Proof : 
;1&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta\ B\Leftrightarrow A\cap B\neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;x\in A\cap B, \Phi(x)\in \mathcal{Q}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)\in \mathcal{Q}(B)&lt;/math&gt;.  Consequently, &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;1^\circ \Rightarrow\ 2^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
;3&lt;math&gt;^\circ&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}A\ \delta\ \mbox{cl}B&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{cl}A&lt;/math&gt; have at least one point in common. Hence, 1&lt;math&gt;^o\Rightarrow\ 3^o&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\qquad \blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

== Descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods ==

[[File:Descriptive.svg|thumb|'''Figure 6.''' Example depicting &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods]]

In a pseudometric proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the neighbourhood of a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;N_{x,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;), for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
N_{x,\varepsilon} = \left\{y\in X: d(x,y) &lt; \varepsilon\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The interior of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) and boundary of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mbox{bdy}(A)&lt;/math&gt;) in a proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{int}(A) = \left\{x\in X: N_{x,\varepsilon}\subseteq A\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{bdy}(A) = \mbox{cl}(A)\setminus\mbox{int}(A).
&lt;/math&gt;

A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a ''natural strong inclusion'' in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|5|1}}{{cref2|6|2}}} (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \ll_{\delta}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided &lt;math&gt;A\subset\ \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}\ X\setminus \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is far from the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;).  Correspondingly, a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a ''descriptive strong inclusion'' in a set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; (denoted by &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A)\subset\ \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{int}B)&lt;/math&gt;, ''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ X\setminus \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{Q}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is far from the complement of &lt;math&gt;\mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;).

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; be a descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhood relation defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathop{\ll}_{\Phi} = \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X: \mathcal{Q}(A)\subset \mathcal{Q}(\mbox{int}B)\right\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt;, provided the description of each &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the set of descriptions of the points &lt;math&gt;b\in \mbox{int}B&lt;/math&gt;.  Now observe that any &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; in the proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B&lt;/math&gt; have disjoint &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods,  ''i.e.'',
 
:&lt;math&gt;
A\ \underline{\delta}_{\Phi}\ B\Leftrightarrow A\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ E1, B\ \mathop{\ll}_{\Phi}\ E2,\ \mbox{for some}\ E1,E2\subset X\ \mbox{(See Fig. 6).}
&lt;/math&gt;

; Theorem 6 {{cref2|50|5}} : Any two sets descriptively far from each other belong to disjoint descriptive &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;-neighbourhoods in a descriptive proximity space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

A consideration of strong containment of a nonempty set in another set leads to the study of hit-and-miss topologies and the Wijsman topology{{cref2|2|1}}.

== Tolerance near sets ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be a real number greater than zero.  In the study of sets that are proximally near within some tolerance, the set of proximity relations &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt; is augmented with a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]] tolerance proximity relation (denoted by &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;) defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
D_{\Phi}(A,B) &amp;= inf\left\{d(\Phi(a),\Phi(a)): \Phi(a)\in\mathcal{Q}(A), \Phi(a)\in \mathcal{Q}(B)\right\},\\
d(\Phi(a),\Phi(a)) &amp;= \mathop{\sum}_{i=1}^n |\phi_i(a)-\phi_i(b)|,\\
\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon} &amp;= \left\{(A,B)\in 2^X\times 2^X:
                       |D(\mbox{cl}(A), \mbox{cl}(B))| &lt; \varepsilon\right\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}} = \mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}\cup\left\{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, a nonempty set equipped with the proximal relator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}&lt;/math&gt; has underlying [[mathematical structure|structure]] provided by the proximal relator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi}}&lt;/math&gt; and provides a basis for the study of tolerance near sets in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that are near within some tolerance.  Sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; in a descriptive pseudometric proximal relator space &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}})&lt;/math&gt; are tolerance near sets (''i.e.'', &lt;math&gt;A\ \delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}\ B&lt;/math&gt;), provided

:&lt;math&gt;
D_{\Phi}(A,B) &lt; \varepsilon.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Tolerance classes and preclasses ==
Relations with the same formal properties as similarity relations of sensations considered by Poincaré{{cref2|62|2}} are nowadays, after [[Christopher Zeeman|Zeeman]]{{cref2|83|2}}, called ''[[tolerance relation]]s''. A ''tolerance &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;'' is a relation &lt;math&gt;\tau \subseteq O \times O&lt;/math&gt; that is reflexive and symmetric.  In algebra, the term ''tolerance relation'' is also used in a narrow sense to denote reflexive and symmetric relations defined on universes of algebras that are also compatible with operations of a given algebra, ''i.e.'', they are generalizations of congruence relations (see ''e.g.'',{{cref2|12|1}}). In referring to such relations, the term ''algebraic tolerance'' or the term ''algebraic tolerance relation'' is used.
Transitive tolerance relations are equivalence relations. A set &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; together with a tolerance &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''tolerance space'' (denoted &lt;math&gt;(O, \tau)&lt;/math&gt;). A set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq O&lt;/math&gt; is a ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-preclass'' (or briefly ''preclass'' when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is understood) if and only if for any &lt;math&gt;x,y \in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in \tau&lt;/math&gt;.

The family of all preclasses of a tolerance space is naturally ordered by set inclusion and preclasses that are maximal with respect to set inclusion are called ''&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;-classes'' or just ''classes'', when &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is understood. The family of all classes of the space &lt;math&gt;(O, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; is particularly interesting and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau}(O)&lt;/math&gt;. The family &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau}(O)&lt;/math&gt; is a covering of &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt;{{cref2|58|1}}.

The work on similarity by Poincaré and Zeeman presage the introduction of near sets{{cref2|44|2}}{{cref2|43|1}} and research on similarity relations, ''e.g.'',{{cref2|79|1}}.  In science and engineering, tolerance near sets are a practical application of the study of sets that are near within some tolerance.  A tolerance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\in(0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is directly related to the idea of closeness or resemblance (''i.e.'', being within some tolerance) in comparing objects.
By way of application of Poincaré's approach in defining visual spaces and Zeeman's approach to tolerance relations, the basic idea is to compare objects such as image patches in the interior of digital images.

Let a [[tolerance relation]] be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\cong_{\varepsilon} = \{(x,y)\in O \times O :\; \parallel\Phi(x) - \Phi(y)\parallel_{_2} \leq \varepsilon\} &lt;/math&gt;

Then, setting &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 0.1&lt;/math&gt; gives the following tolerance classes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H_{\cong_{\varepsilon}}(O) = &amp; \{ \{x_1, x_8, x_{10}, x_{11}\},\{x_1, x_9, x_{10}, x_{11}, x_{14}\},\\
&amp; \{x_2, x_7, x_{18}, x_{19}\},\\
&amp; \{x_3, x_{12}, x_{17}\},\\
&amp; \{x_4, x_{13}, x_{20}\},\{x_4, x_{18}\},\\
&amp; \{x_5, x_6, x_{15}, x_{16}\},\{x_5, x_6, x_{15}, x_{20}\},\\
&amp; \{x_6, x_{13}, x_{20}\}\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that each object in a tolerance class satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\parallel\Phi(x) -\Phi(y)\parallel_2\leq\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and that almost all of the objects appear in more than one class. Moreover, there would be twenty classes if the indiscernibility relation was used since there are no two objects with matching descriptions.

'''Image Processing Example'''

[[File:NearImages.svg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 7.''' Example of images that are near each other. (a) and (b) Images from the freely available LeavesDataset (see, ''e.g.'', www.vision.caltech.edu/archive.html).]]

The following example provides an example based on digital images. Let a subimage be defined as a small subset of [[pixel]]s belonging to a digital image such that the pixels contained in the subimage form a square. Then, let the sets &lt;math&gt; X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; respectively represent the subimages obtained from two different images, and let &lt;math&gt;O = \{X \cup Y\}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, let the description of an object be given by the Green component in the [[RGB color model]].  The next step is to find all the tolerance classes using the tolerance relation defined in the previous example. Using this information, tolerance classes can be formed containing objects that have similar (within some small &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;) values for the Green component in the RGB colour model. Furthermore, images that are near (similar) to each other should have tolerance classes divided among both images (instead of a tolerance classes contained solely in one of the images). For example, the  figure accompanying this example shows a subset of the tolerance classes obtained from two leaf images. In this figure, each tolerance class is assigned a separate colour. As can be seen, the two leaves share similar tolerance classes. This example highlights a need to measure the degree of nearness of two sets.

== Nearness measure ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(U,\mathcal{R}_{\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}})&lt;/math&gt; denote a particular descriptive pseudometric EF-proximal relator space equipped with the proximity relation &lt;math&gt;\delta_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; and with nonempty subsets &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in 2^U&lt;/math&gt; and with the tolerance relation &lt;math&gt;\cong_{\Phi,\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; defined in terms of a set of probes &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\in (0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, where

[[File:Visulization of nearness measure.jpg|thumb|500px|'''Figure 8.''' Examples of degree of nearness between two sets: (a) High degree of nearness, and (b) Low degree of nearness.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\simeq_{\Phi,\varepsilon} = \{(x, y)\in U\times U\mid\ |\Phi(x) - \Phi(y)| \leq\varepsilon\}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Further, assume &lt;math&gt;Z = X\cup Y&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; denote the family of all classes in the space &lt;math&gt;(Z, \simeq_{\Phi,\varepsilon})&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X, B\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;.  The distance &lt;math&gt;D_{_{tNM}}:2^U\times 2^U:\longrightarrow [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; D_{_{tNM}}(X,Y) =
\begin{cases}
   1-tNM(A,B), &amp;\mbox{if }X\mbox{ and }Y\mbox{ are not empty},\\
   \infty,&amp;\mbox{if }X\mbox{ or }Y\mbox{ is empty},
	\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
tNM(A, B) = \Biggl(\sum_{C\in H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)} |C|\Biggr)^{-1} \cdot \sum_{C\in H_{\tau_{\Phi,\varepsilon}}(Z)} |C| \frac{ \min (|C\cap A |,|[C\cap B|)}{\max (|C\cap A |,|C\cap B|)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The details concerning &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; are given in{{cref2|14|2}}{{cref2|16|1}}{{cref2|17|4}}. The idea behind &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is that sets that are similar should have a similar number of objects in each tolerance class. Thus, for each tolerance class obtained from the covering of &lt;math&gt;Z=X\cup Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; counts the number of objects that belong to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and takes the ratio (as a proper fraction) of their cardinalities. Furthermore, each ratio is weighted by the total size of the tolerance class (thus giving importance to the larger classes) and the final result is normalized by dividing by the sum of all the cardinalities. The range of &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is in the interval [0,1], where a value of 1 is obtained if the sets are equivalent (based on object descriptions) and a value of 0 is obtained if they have no descriptions in common.

As an example of the degree of nearness between two sets, consider figure below in which each image consists of two sets of objects, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Each colour in the figures corresponds to a set where all the objects in the class share the same description. The idea behind &lt;math&gt;tNM&lt;/math&gt; is that the nearness of sets in a perceptual system is based on the cardinality of tolerance classes that they share. Thus, the sets in left side of the figure are closer (more near) to each other in terms of their descriptions than the sets in right side of the figure.

== Near set evaluation and recognition (NEAR) system ==

[[File:Near gui.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 9.''' NEAR system GUI.]]

The Near set Evaluation and Recognition (NEAR) system, is a system developed to demonstrate practical applications of near set theory to the problems of image segmentation evaluation and image correspondence. It was motivated by a need for a freely available software tool that can provide results for research and to generate interest in near set theory. The system implements a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) where each separate processing task is performed in its own child frame. The objects (in the near set sense) in this system are subimages of the images being processed and the probe functions (features) are image processing functions defined on the subimages. The system was written in C++ and was designed to facilitate the addition of new processing tasks and probe functions. Currently, the system performs six major tasks, namely, displaying equivalence and tolerance classes for an image, performing segmentation evaluation, measuring the nearness of two images, performing Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), and displaying the output of processing an image using a specific probe function.

== Proximity System ==

[[File:Proximity System.png|thumb|'''Figure 10.''' The Proximity System.]]

The Proximity System is an application developed to demonstrate descriptive-based topological approaches to nearness and proximity within the context of digital image analysis. The Proximity System grew out of the work of S. Naimpally and J. Peters on Topological Spaces. The Proximity System was written in Java and is intended to run in two different operating environments, namely on Android smartphones and tablets, as well as desktop platforms running the Java Virtual Machine. With respect to the desktop environment, the Proximity System is a cross-platform Java application for Windows, OSX, and Linux systems, which has been tested on Windows 7 and Debian Linux using the Sun Java 6 Runtime. In terms of the implementation of the theoretical approaches, both the Android and the desktop based applications use the same back-end libraries to perform the description-based calculations, where the only differences are the user interface and the Android version has less available features due to restrictions on system resources.

{{Cnote2|A|n=1|group=2|J.R. Isbell observed that the notions ''near'' and ''far'' are important in a uniform space. Sets &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are far ('''uniformaly distal'''), provided the &lt;math&gt;\{A,B\}&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete collection. A nonempty set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a ''uniform neighbourhood'' of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, provided the complement of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is far from &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. See, §33 in {{cref2|23|1}} }}

{{Cnote2|G|n=1|group=2|Observe that up to the 1970s, ''proximity'' meant EF-proximity, since this is the one that was studied intensively. The pre-1970 work on proximity spaces is exemplified by the series of papers by J. M.

Warrack{{cref2|34|1}}. But in view of later developments, there is a need to distinguish between various proximities. A ''basic proximity'' or ''Čech-proximity'' was introduced by E. Čech during the late 1930s (see §25 A.1, pp. 439-440 in {{cref2|78|1}}). The conditions for the non-symmetric case for a proximity were introduced by S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3301">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''Newton–Okounkov body''', also called an '''Okounkov body''', is a [[convex body]] in [[Euclidean space]] associated to a [[Divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] (or more generally a linear system) on a [[Algebraic variety|variety]]. The convex geometry of a Newton–Okounkov body encodes (asymptotic) information about the geometry of the variety and the divisor. It is a large generalization of the notion of the [[Newton polytope]] of a projective [[toric variety]].

It was introduced (in passing) by [[Andrei Okounkov]] in his papers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Okounkov’s construction relies on an earlier result of [[Askold Khovanskii]] on semigroups of lattice points. Later Okounkov’s construction was generalized and systematically developed in the papers of [[Robert Lazarsfeld]] and Mircea Mustață as well as Kiumars Kaveh and Khovanskii.

Beside Newton polytopes of toric varieties, several polytopes appearing in representation theory (such as the [[Gelfand–Zetlin polytope]]s and the string polytopes of Peter Littelmann and Arkady Berenstein–[[Andrei Zelevinsky]]) can be realized as special cases of Newton–Okounkov bodies.

The '''''Novum Organum''''', fully '''''Novum Organum Scientiarum''''' ('new instrument of science'), is a philosophical work by [[Francis Bacon]], written in [[Latin]] and published in 1620. The title is a reference to [[Aristotle]]'s work ''[[Organon]]'', which was his [[treatise]] on [[logic]] and [[syllogism]]. In ''Novum Organum'', Bacon details a new system of logic he believes to be superior to the old ways of syllogism. This is now known as the [[Baconian method]].

For Bacon, finding the essence of a thing was a simple process of [[reduction (philosophy)|reduction]], and the use of [[inductive reasoning]]. In finding the cause of a 'phenomenal nature' such as heat, one must list all of the situations where heat is found. Then another list should be drawn up, listing situations that are similar to those of the first list except for the lack of heat. A third table lists situations where heat can vary. The 'form nature', or cause, of heat must be that which is common to all instances in the first table, is lacking from all instances of the second table and varies by degree in instances of the third table.

The title page of ''Novum Organum'' depicts a [[galleon]] passing between the mythical [[Pillars of Hercules]] that stand either side of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], marking the exit from the well-charted waters of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic Ocean. The Pillars, as the boundary of the Mediterranean, have been smashed through by [[Iberians|Iberian]] sailors, opening a new world for exploration. Bacon hopes that empirical investigation will, similarly, smash the old scientific ideas and lead to greater understanding of the world and heavens. This title page was liberally copied from [[Andrés García de Céspedes]]'s ''Regimiento de Navegación'', published in 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cañizares-Esguerra|first=Jorge|date=2004|title=Iberian Science in the Renaissance: Ignored How Much Longer?|url=|journal=Perspectives on Science|volume=12|issue=1|pages=86-124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin]] tag across the bottom – ''{{lang|la|Multi pertransibunt &amp; augebitur scientia}}'' – is taken from the [[Old Testament]] ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:4). It means: "Many will travel and knowledge will be increased".

==Bacon and the scientific method==
{{main|Baconian method}}

Bacon's work was instrumental in the historical development of the [[scientific method]]. His technique bears a resemblance to the modern formulation of the scientific method in the sense that it is centered on experimental research. Bacon's emphasis on the use of artificial experiments to provide additional observances of a phenomenon is one reason that he is often considered "the Father of the Experimental Philosophy" (for example famously by [[Voltaire]]). On the other hand, modern scientific method does not follow Bacon's methods in its details, but more in the spirit of being methodical and experimental, and so his position in this regard can be disputed.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Rees, Graham and Maria Wakely ''The Instauratio magna Part II: Novum organum and Associated Texts.'' Oxford: Clarendon, 2004. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly though, Bacon set the scene for science to develop various methodologies, because he made the case against older Aristotelian approaches to science, arguing that method was needed because of the natural biases and weaknesses of the human mind, including the natural bias it has to seek metaphysical explanations which are not based on real observations.

==Preface==
Bacon begins the work with a rejection of pure ''a priori'' deduction as a means of discovering truth in natural philosophy. Of his philosophy, he states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Now my plan is as easy to describe as it is difficult to effect. For it is to establish degrees of certainty, take care of the sense by a kind of reduction, but to reject for the most part the work of the mind that follows upon sense; in fact I mean to open up and lay down a new and certain pathway from the perceptions of the senses themselves to the mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The emphasis on beginning with observation pervades the entire work. In fact, it is in the idea that natural philosophy must begin with the senses that we find the revolutionary part of Bacon's philosophy, and its consequent philosophical method, eliminative induction, is one of Bacon's most lasting contributions to science and philosophy.

==''Instauratio Magna''==
''Novum organum'' was actually published as part of a much larger work, ''Instauratio magna''—'the great restoration'.  Originally intending ''Instauratio magna'' to contain six parts (of which ''Novum organum'' constituted the second), Bacon did not come close to completing this series, as parts V and VI were never written at all. ''Novum organum'', written in Latin and consisting of two books of [[wiktionary:aphorism|aphorisms]], was included in the volume that Bacon published in 1620; however, it was also unfinished, as Bacon promised several additions to its content which ultimately remained unprinted.

==Book I==
Bacon titled this first book ''{{lang|la|Aphorismi de Interpretatione Naturae et Regno Hominis}}'' ('Aphorisms Concerning the Interpretation of Nature, and the Kingdom of Man').

In the first book of aphorisms, Bacon criticizes the current state of natural philosophy. The object of his assault consists largely in the [[syllogism]], a method that he believes to be completely inadequate in comparison to what Bacon calls "true ''Induction''":

{{Quote|text=The syllogism is made up of propositions, propositions of words, and words are markers of notions. Thus if the notions themselves (and this is the heart of the matter) are confused, and recklessly abstracted from things, nothing built on them is sound. The only hope therefore lies in true [[Inductive reasoning|''Induction'']].|source=aph. 14}}

In many of his aphorisms, Bacon reiterates the importance of inductive reasoning. Induction, methodologically opposed to deduction, entails beginning with particular cases observed by the senses and then attempting to discover the general axioms from those observations. In other words, induction presupposes nothing. Deduction, on the other hand, begins with general axioms, or first principles, by which the truth of particular cases is extrapolated. Bacon emphasises the strength of the gradual process that is inherent in induction:

{{Quote|text=There are and can only be two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one rushes up from the sense and particulars to axioms of the highest generality and, from these principles and their indubitable truth, goes on to infer and discover middle axioms; and this is the way in current use. The other way draws axioms from the sense and particulars by climbing steadily and by degrees so that it reaches the ones of highest generality last of all; and this is the true but still untrodden way.|source=aph. 19}}

After many similar aphoristic reiterations of these important concepts, Bacon presents his famous Idols.

==The Idols (''{{lang|la|Idola}}'') {{anchor|The Idols}} ==
''Novum organum'', as suggested by its name, is focused just as much on a rejection of received doctrine as it is on a forward-looking progression. In Bacon's Idols are found his most critical examination of man-made impediments which mislead the mind's objective reasoning. They appear in previous works but were never fully fleshed out until their formulation in ''Novum organum'':

;Idols of the Tribe (''{{lang|la|Idola tribus}}'')
"[[Idols of the Tribe]] are rooted in human nature itself and in the very tribe or race of men. For people falsely claim that human sense is the measure of things, whereas in fact all perceptions of sense and mind are built to the scale of man and not the universe." (Aphorism 41.)

Bacon includes in this idol the predilection of the human imagination to presuppose otherwise unsubstantiated regularities in nature. An example might be the common historical astronomical assumption that planets move in perfect circles.

;Idols of the Cave (''{{lang|la|Idola specus}}'')
These "belong to the particular individual. For everyone has (besides vagaries of human nature in general) his own special cave or den which scatters and discolours the light of nature. Now this comes either of his own unique and singular nature; or his education and association with others, or the books he reads and the several authorities of those whom he cultivates and admires, or the different impressions as they meet in the soul, be the soul possessed and prejudiced, or steady and settled, or the like; so that the human spirit (as it is allotted to particular individuals) is evidently a variable thing, all muddled, and so to speak a creature of chance..." (Aphorism 42).

This type of idol stems from the particular life experiences of the individual. Variable educations can lead the individual to a preference for specific concepts or methods, which then corrupt their subsequent philosophies. Bacon himself gives the example of Aristotle, "who made his natural philosophy a mere slave to his logic". (Aphorism 54.)

;[[Idols of the Market]] (''{{lang|la|Idola fori}}'')
These are "derived as if from the mutual agreement and association of the human race, which I call Idols of the Market on account of men's commerce and partnerships. For men associate through conversation, but words are applied according to the capacity of ordinary people. Therefore shoddy and inept application of words lays siege to the intellect in wondrous ways" (Aphorism 43).

Bacon considered these "the greatest nuisances of them all" (Aphorism 59). Because humans reason through the use of words they are particularly dangerous, because the received definitions of words, which are often falsely derived, can cause confusion. He outlines two subsets of this kind of idol and provides examples (Aphorism 60). 
*First, there are those words which spring from fallacious theories, such as the element of fire or the concept of a first mover. These are easy to dismantle because their inadequacy can be traced back to the fault of their derivation in a faulty theory. 
*Second, there are those words that are the result of imprecise abstraction. Earth, for example, is a vague term that may include many different substances the commonality of which is questionable. These terms are often used elliptically, or from a lack of information or definition of the term.

;[[Idols of the Theatre]] (''{{lang|la|Idola theatri}}'')
"Lastly, there are the Idols which have misguided into men's souls from the dogmas of the philosophers and misguided laws of demonstration as well; I call these Idols of the Theatre, for in my eyes the philosophies received and discovered are so many stories made up and acted out stories which have created sham worlds worth of the stage." (Aphorism 44.)

These idols manifest themselves in the unwise acceptance of certain philosophical dogmas, namely Aristotle's sophistical natural philosophy (named specifically in Aphorism 63) which was corrupted by his passion for logic, and Plato's superstitious philosophy, which relied too heavily on theological principles.

==Book II==

After enumerating the shortcomings of the current and past natural philosophies, Bacon can now present his own philosophy and methods.
Bacon retains the Aristotelian causes, but redefines them in interesting ways. While traditionally the final cause was held as most important among the four (material, formal, efficient, and final), Bacon claims that it is the least helpful and in some cases actually detrimental to the sciences (aph. 2). For Bacon, it is the formal cause which is both the most illusive and most valuable, although each of the causes provides certain practical devices. By forms and formal causes, Bacon means the universal laws of nature. To these Bacon attaches an almost occult like power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But he who knows forms grasps the unity of nature beneath the surface of materials which are very unlike. Thus is he able to identify and bring about things that have never been done before, things of the kind which neither the vicissitudes of nature, nor hard experimenting, nor pure accident could ever have actualised, or human thought dreamed of. And thus from the discovery of the forms flows true speculation and unrestricted operation (aphorism 3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this second book, Bacon offers an example of the process that of what he calls true induction. In this example, Bacon attempts to grasp the form of heat.

The first step he takes is the surveying of all known instances where the nature of heat appears to exist. To this compilation of observational data Bacon gives the name ''Table of Essence and Presence.'' The next table, the ''Table of Absence in Proximity'', is essentially the opposite—a compilation of all the instances in which the nature of heat is not present. Because these are so numerous, Bacon enumerates only the most relevant cases. Lastly, Bacon attempts to categorise the instances of the nature of heat into various degrees of intensity in his ''Table of Degrees.'' The aim of this final table is to eliminate certain instances of heat which might be said to be the form of heat, and thus get closer to an approximation of the true form of heat. Such elimination occurs through comparison. For example, the observation that both a fire and boiling water are instances of heat allows us to exclude light as the true form of heat, because light is present in the case of the fire but not in the case of the boiling water. Through this comparative analysis, Bacon intends to eventually extrapolate the true form of heat, although it is clear that such a goal is only gradually approachable by degrees. Indeed, the hypothesis that is derived from this eliminative induction, which Bacon names ''The First Vintage'', is only the starting point from which additional [[empirical evidence]] and experimental analysis can refine our conception of a formal cause.

The "Baconian method" does not end at the ''First Vintage''. Bacon described numerous classes of Instances with Special Powers, cases in which the phenomena one is attempting to explain is particularly relevant. These instances, of which Bacon describes 27 in ''Novum Organum'', aid and accelerate the process of induction. They are "labour-saving devices or shortcuts intended to accelerate or make more rigorous the search for forms by providing logical reinforcement to induction."&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

Aside from the First Vintage and the Instances with Special Powers, Bacon enumerates additional "aids to the intellect" which presumably are the next steps in his "method." In Aphorism 21 of Book II, Bacon lays out the subsequent series of steps in proper induction: including ''Supports to Induction'', ''Rectification of Induction'', ''Varying the Inquiry according to the Nature of the Subject'', ''Natures with Special Powers'', ''Ends of Inquiry'', ''Bringing Things down to Practice'', ''Preparatives to Inquiry'' and ''Ascending and Descending Scale of Axioms.'' 
These additional aids, however, were never explained beyond their initial limited appearance in ''Novum Organum''. It is likely that Bacon intended them to be included in later parts of ''Instauratio magna'' and simply never got to writing about them.

As mentioned above, this second book of ''Novum organum'' was far from complete and indeed was only a small part of a massive, also unfinished work, the ''Instauratio magna.''

==Bacon and Descartes==

Bacon is often studied through a comparison to his contemporary [[René Descartes]]. Both thinkers were, in a sense, some of the first to question the philosophical authority of the ancient Greeks. Bacon and Descartes both believed that a critique of preexisting natural philosophy was necessary, but their respective critiques proposed radically different approaches to natural philosophy. Two over-lapping movements developed; "one was rational and theoretical in approach and was headed by Rene Descartes; the other was practical and empirical and was led by Francis Bacon."&lt;ref name="CantorKlein"&gt;Cantor, Norman F., and Peter L. Klein. ''Seventeenth-Century Rationalism: Bacon and Descartes.'' Massachusetts: Blaisdell, 1969. Print&lt;/ref&gt; They were both profoundly concerned with the extent to which humans can come to knowledge, and yet their methods of doing so projected diverging paths.

On the one hand, Descartes begins with a doubt of anything which cannot be known with absolute certainty and includes in this realm of doubt the impressions of sense perception, and thus, "all sciences of corporal things, such as physics and astronomy." &lt;ref name="CantorKlein"/&gt; He thus attempts to provide a metaphysical principle (this becomes the [[Cogito ergo sum|Cogito]]) which cannot be doubted, on which further truths must be deduced. In this method of deduction, the philosopher begins by examining the most general axioms (such as the ''Cogito''), and then proceeds to determine the truth about particulars from an understanding of those general axioms.

Conversely, Bacon endorsed the opposite method of Induction, in which the particulars are first examined, and only then is there a gradual ascent to the most general axioms. While Descartes doubts the ability of the senses to provide us with accurate information, Bacon doubts the ability of the mind to deduce truths by itself as it is subjected to so many intellectual obfuscations, Bacon's "Idols." In his first aphorism of ''New organum'', Bacon states:

"Man, the servant and interpreter of nature, does and understands only as much as he has observed, by fact or mental activity, concerning the order of nature; beyond that he has neither knowledge nor power."

So, in a basic sense the central difference between the philosophical methods of Descartes and those of Bacon can be reduced to an argument between deductive and inductive reasoning and whether to trust or doubt the senses. However, there is another profound difference between the two thinkers' positions on the accessibility of Truth. Descartes professed to be aiming at absolute Truth. It is questionable whether Bacon believed such a Truth can be achieved. In his opening remarks, he proposes "to establish progressive stages of certainty." For Bacon, a measure of truth was its power to allow predictions of natural phenomena (although Bacon's forms come close to what we might call "Truth," because they are universal, immutable laws of nature).

==Original contributions==

An interesting characteristic of Bacon's apparently scientific tract was that, although he amassed an overwhelming body of empirical data, he did not make any original discoveries. Indeed, that was never his intention, and such an evaluation of Bacon's legacy may wrongfully lead to an unjust comparison with Newton. Bacon never claimed to have brilliantly revealed new unshakable truths about nature—in fact, he believed that such an endeavour is not the work of single minds but that of whole generations by gradual degrees toward reliable knowledge.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

In many ways, Bacon's contribution to the advancement of human knowledge lies not in the fruit of his scientific research but in the reinterpretation of the methods of natural philosophy. His innovation is summarised in ''The Oxford Francis Bacon'':&lt;blockquote&gt;Before Bacon where else does one find a meticulously articulated view of natural philosophy as an enterprise of instruments and experiment, and enterprise designed to restrain discursive reason and make good the defects of the senses? Where else in the literature before Bacon does one come across a stripped-down natural-historical programme of such enormous scope and scrupulous precision, and designed to serve as the basis for a complete reconstruction of human knowledge which would generate new, vastly productive sciences through a form of eliminative induction supported by various other procedures including deduction? Where else does one find a concept of scientific research which implies an institutional framework of such proportions that it required generations of permanent state funding to sustain it? And all this accompanied by a thorough, searching, and devastating attack on ancient and not-so-ancient philosophies, and by a provisional natural philosophy anticipating the results of the new philosophy?"&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20718">In [[mathematics]], the '''Poisson summation formula''' is an equation that relates the [[Fourier series]] coefficients of the [[periodic summation]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] to values of the function's [[continuous Fourier transform]].  Consequently, the periodic summation of a function is completely defined by discrete samples of the original function's Fourier transform.  And conversely, the periodic summation of a function's Fourier transform is completely defined by discrete samples of the original function.  The Poisson summation formula was discovered by [[Siméon Denis Poisson]] and is sometimes called '''Poisson resummation'''.

==Forms of the equation==
For appropriate functions &lt;math&gt;f,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; the Poisson summation formula may be stated as''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty f(n)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \hat f\left(k\right),&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; where &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the [[Fourier transform]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\nu)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ e^{-2\pi i\nu x}\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;;&amp;nbsp; that is &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;\hat f(\nu) = \mathcal{F}\{f(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;
|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

With the substitution, &lt;math&gt;g(xP)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ f(x),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and the Fourier transform property, &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{g(x P)\}\ = \frac{1}{P} \cdot \hat g\left(\frac{\nu}{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; (for &lt;math&gt;P &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), &amp;nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} becomes''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty g(nP)=\frac{1}{P}\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \hat g\left(\frac{k}{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{harv|Stein|Weiss|1971}}.|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}

With another definition, &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;s(t+x)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ g(x),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; and the transform property &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{s(t+x)\}\ = \hat s(\nu)\cdot e^{i 2\pi \nu t},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; {{EquationNote|Eq.2}} becomes a [[periodic summation]] (with period &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) and its equivalent [[Fourier series#Fourier series on a general interval .5Ba.2Cb.5D|Fourier series]]''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} s(t + nP)}_{S_P(t)} = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \underbrace{\frac{1}{P}\cdot \hat s\left(\frac{k}{P}\right)}_{S[k]}\ e^{i 2\pi \frac{k}{P} t }&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ({{harvnb|Pinsky|2002}}; {{harvnb|Zygmund|1968}}).|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}

Similarly, the periodic summation of a function's Fourier transform has this Fourier series equivalent''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat s(\nu + k/T) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} T\cdot s(nT)\ e^{-i 2\pi n T \nu} \equiv \mathcal{F}\left \{ \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} T\cdot s(nT)\ \delta(t-nT)\right \},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.4}}}}

where T represents the time interval at which a function &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is sampled, and &lt;math&gt;1/T&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of samples/sec.

==Examples==
* Let &lt;math&gt; f(x) = e^{-ax}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt; \coth(x) = \frac{1}{x}+ 2x \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z_+}} \frac{1}{x^2+\pi^2n^2}, &lt;/math&gt; the partial fraction decomposition of &lt;math&gt; \coth(x)&lt;/math&gt;
*It can be used to prove the functional equation for the theta function
*Poisson's summation formula appears in Ramanujan's notebooks and can be used to prove some of his formulas, in particular it can be used to prove one of the formulas in Ramanujan's first letter to Hardy
*It can be used to calculate the quadratic Gauss sum

==Distributional formulation==

These equations can be interpreted in the language of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s ({{harvnb|Córdoba|1988}}; {{harvnb|Hörmander|1983|loc=§7.2}}) for a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; whose derivatives are all rapidly decreasing (see [[Schwartz function]]).  Using the [[Dirac comb]] distribution and its [[Fourier series]]''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \delta(x-nT) \equiv \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty  \frac{1}{T}\cdot e^{i 2\pi \frac{k}{T} x} \quad\stackrel{\mathcal{F}}{\Longleftrightarrow}\quad \frac{1}{T}\cdot \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta (\nu-k/T),&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.7}}}}

In other words, the periodization of a [[Dirac delta]] &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;,
resulting in a [[Dirac comb]], corresponds to the discretization of its spectrum which is constantly one.
Hence, this again is a Dirac comb but with reciprocal increments.

{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} readily follows''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \hat f(k)
&amp;= \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ e^{-i 2\pi k x} dx \right)
= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \underbrace{\left(\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty e^{-i 2\pi k x}\right)}_{\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \delta(x-n)} dx \\
&amp;= \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty  \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\ \delta(x-n)\ dx \right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty f(n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly''':'''

\begin{align}
\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \hat s(\nu + k/T)
&amp;= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{F}\left \{ s(t)\cdot e^{-i 2\pi\frac{k}{T}t}\right \}\\
&amp;= \mathcal{F} \bigg \{s(t)\underbrace{\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-i 2\pi\frac{k}{T}t}}_{T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-nT)}\bigg \}

= \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} T\cdot s(nT) \cdot e^{-i 2\pi nT \nu}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Derivation==
We can also prove that {{EquationNote|Eq.3}} holds in the sense that if &lt;math&gt;s(t) \in L_1(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;, then the right-hand side is the (possibly divergent) Fourier series of the left-hand side. This proof may be found in either {{harv|Pinsky|2002}} or {{harv|Zygmund|1968}}.  It follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]] that &lt;math&gt;s_P(t)&lt;/math&gt; exists and is finite for almost every &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.  And furthermore it follows that &lt;math&gt;s_P&lt;/math&gt; is integrable on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,P]&lt;/math&gt;. The right-hand side of {{EquationNote|Eq.3}} has the form of a [[Fourier series#Fourier series on a general interval .5Ba.2Cb.5D|Fourier series]].  So it is sufficient to show that the Fourier series coefficients of &lt;math&gt;s_P(t)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{1}{P} \hat s\left(\frac{k}{P}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Proceeding from the definition of the Fourier coefficients we have''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
S[k]\ &amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{P}\int_0^{P} s_P(t)\cdot e^{-i 2\pi \frac{k}{P} t}\, dt\\
&amp;=\ \frac{1}{P}\int_0^{P}
     \left(\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} s(t + nP)\right)
     \cdot e^{-i 2\pi\frac{k}{P} t}\, dt\\
&amp;=\ \frac{1}{P}
     \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}
        \int_0^{P} s(t + nP)\cdot e^{-i 2\pi\frac{k}{P} t}\, dt,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:where the interchange of summation with integration is once again justified by dominated convergence.  With a [[Integration by substitution|change of variables]] (&lt;math&gt;\tau = t + nP&lt;/math&gt;) this becomes''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S[k] =
\frac{1}{P} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{nP}^{nP + P} s(\tau) \ e^{-i 2\pi \frac{k}{P} \tau} \ \underbrace{e^{i 2\pi k n}}_{1}\,d\tau
\ =\ \frac{1}{P} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) \ e^{-i 2\pi \frac{k}{P} \tau} d\tau = \frac{1}{P}\cdot \hat s\left(\frac{k}{P}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [[Q.E.D.|QED]].

The Poisson summation formula can also be proved quite conceptually using the compatibility of [[Pontryagin duality]] with [[short exact sequence]]s such as
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathbb Z \to \mathbb R \to \mathbb R / \mathbb Z \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Deitmar|first1=Anton|author2=Echterhoff|first2=Siegfried|title=Principles of Harmonic Analysis|edition=2|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-05792-7|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==

{{EquationNote|Eq.3}} holds provided &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous [[Lp space|integrable function]] which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;|s(t)| + |\hat{s}(t)| \le C (1+|t|)^{-1-\delta}&lt;/math&gt;
for some &lt;math&gt;C &gt; 0,\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; ({{harvnb|Grafakos|2004}}; {{harvnb|Stein|Weiss|1971}}).  Note that such &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is [[uniformly continuous]], this together with the decay assumption on &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, show that the series defining &lt;math&gt;s_P&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly to a continuous function. &amp;nbsp; {{EquationNote|Eq.3}} holds in the strong sense that both sides converge uniformly and absolutely to the same limit {{harv|Stein|Weiss|1971}}.

{{EquationNote|Eq.3}} holds in a [[pointwise convergence|pointwise]] sense under the strictly weaker assumption that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; has bounded variation and
:&lt;math&gt;2\cdot s(t)=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} s(t+\varepsilon) + \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} s(t-\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{harv|Zygmund|1968}}.
The Fourier series on the right-hand side of {{EquationNote|Eq.3}} is then understood as a (conditionally convergent) limit of symmetric partial sums.

As shown above, {{EquationNote|Eq.3}} holds under the much less restrictive assumption that &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt; is in [[Lp space|&lt;math&gt;L^1(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;]], but then it is necessary to interpret it in the sense that the right-hand side is the (possibly divergent) Fourier series of &lt;math&gt;s_P(t)&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Zygmund|1968}}. In this case, one may extend the region where equality holds by considering summability methods such as [[Cesàro summation|Cesàro summability]]. When interpreting convergence in this way {{EquationNote|Eq.2}} holds under the less restrictive conditions that &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is integrable and 0 is a point of continuity of &lt;math&gt;g_P(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  However {{EquationNote|Eq.2}} may fail to hold even when both &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{g}&lt;/math&gt; are integrable and continuous, and the sums converge absolutely {{harv|Katznelson|1976}}.

==Applications==
===Method of images===
In [[partial differential equations]], the Poisson summation formula provides a rigorous justification for the [[fundamental solution]] of the [[heat equation]] with absorbing rectangular boundary by the [[method of images]].  Here the [[heat kernel]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; is known, and that of a rectangle is determined by taking the periodization.  The Poisson summation formula similarly provides a connection between Fourier analysis on Euclidean spaces and on the tori of the corresponding dimensions {{harv|Grafakos|2004}}.  In one dimension, the resulting solution is called a [[theta function]].

===Sampling===
In the statistical study of time-series, if &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt;  is a function of time, then looking only at  its values at equally spaced points of time is called "sampling."  In applications, typically the function &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is [[bandlimiting|band-limited]], meaning that there is some cutoff frequency &lt;math&gt;f_o&lt;/math&gt; such that the Fourier transform is zero for frequencies exceeding the cutoff: &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\xi)=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;|\xi|&gt;f_o&lt;/math&gt;.  For band-limited functions, choosing the sampling rate &lt;math&gt;2f_o&lt;/math&gt; guarantees that no information is lost: since &lt;math&gt; \hat f&lt;/math&gt;  can be reconstructed from these sampled values, then, by Fourier inversion, so can &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt;. This leads to the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] {{harv|Pinsky|2002}}.

===Ewald summation===
Computationally, the Poisson summation formula is useful since a slowly converging summation in real space is guaranteed to be converted into a quickly converging equivalent summation in Fourier space.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  (A broad function in real space becomes a narrow function in Fourier space and vice versa.)  This is the essential idea behind [[Ewald summation]].

===Lattice points in a sphere===
The Poisson summation formula may be used to derive Landau's asymptotic formula for the number of lattice points in a large Euclidean sphere.  It can also be used to show that if an integrable function, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt; both have [[compact support]] then &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; {{harv|Pinsky|2002}}.

===Number theory===
In [[number theory]], Poisson summation can also be used to derive a variety of functional equations including the functional equation for the [[Riemann zeta function]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Edwards (mathematician)|H. M. Edwards]] (1974). ''Riemann's Zeta Function''. Academic Press, pp. 209–11. {{ISBN|0-486-41740-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important such use of Poisson summation concerns [[theta function]]s: periodic summations of Gaussians .  Put &lt;math&gt; q= e^{i\pi \tau } &lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt; \tau&lt;/math&gt; a complex number in the upper half plane, and define the theta function:

&lt;math&gt; \theta ( \tau) =  \sum_n q^{n^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The relation between &lt;math&gt; \theta (-1/\tau)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \theta (\tau)&lt;/math&gt;  turns out to be important for number theory, since this kind of relation is one of the defining properties of a [[modular form]].  By choosing &lt;math&gt; f= e^{-\pi x^2}&lt;/math&gt;  in the second version of the Poisson summation formula (with &lt;math&gt;a = 0&lt;/math&gt;), and using the fact that &lt;math&gt; \hat f = e^{-\pi \xi ^2} &lt;/math&gt;, one gets immediately

&lt;math&gt;  \theta \left({-1\over\tau}\right) = \sqrt{ \tau \over i} \theta (\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

by putting &lt;math&gt; {1/\lambda} = \sqrt{ \tau/i} &lt;/math&gt;.

It follows from this that &lt;math&gt; \theta^8&lt;/math&gt;  has a simple transformation property under &lt;math&gt; \tau \mapsto {-1/ \tau}&lt;/math&gt;  and  this can be  used to prove  Jacobi's formula for the number of different ways to express an integer as the sum of eight perfect squares.

===Sphere packings===
{{harvtxt|Cohn|Elkies|2003}} proved an upper bound on the density of [[sphere packing]]s using the Poisson summation formula, which subsequently led to a proof of optimal sphere packings in dimension 8 and 24.

==Generalizations==
The Poisson summation formula holds in [[Euclidean space]] of arbitrary dimension. Let &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; be the [[lattice (group theory)|lattice]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; consisting of points with integer coordinates; &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[character group]], or [[Pontryagin dual]], of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;{{Dubious|reason=should be the torus|date=December 2016}}. For a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, consider the series given by summing the translates of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by elements of &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu\in\Lambda} f(x+\nu).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' For &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)&lt;/math&gt;, the above series converges pointwise almost everywhere, and thus defines a periodic function Pƒ on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Pƒ lies in &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; with ||Pƒ||&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ||ƒ||&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, for all &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;, Pƒ̂(ν) (Fourier transform on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;) equals &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\nu)&lt;/math&gt; (Fourier transform on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;).

When &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in addition continuous, and both &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt; decay sufficiently fast at infinity, then one can "invert" the domain back to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; and make a stronger statement. More precisely, if

:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)| + |\hat{f}(x)| \le C (1+|x|)^{-d-\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''C'', δ &gt; 0, then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\nu\in\Lambda} f(x+\nu) = \sum_{\nu\in\Lambda}\hat{f}(\nu)e^{2\pi i x\cdot\nu}, &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{harv|Stein|Weiss|1971|loc=VII §2}}

where both series converge absolutely and uniformly on Λ. When  ''d'' = 1 and ''x'' = 0, this gives the formula given in the first section above.

More generally, a version of the statement holds if Λ is replaced by a more general lattice in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;. The ''[[dual lattice]]'' Λ′ can be defined as a subset of the dual vector space or alternatively by [[Pontryagin duality]]. Then the statement is that the sum of delta-functions at each point of Λ, and at each point of Λ′, are again Fourier transforms as distributions, subject to correct normalization.

This is applied in the theory of [[theta function]]s, and is a possible method in [[geometry of numbers]]. In fact in more recent work on counting lattice points in regions it is routinely used − summing the [[indicator function]] of a region ''D'' over lattice points is exactly the question, so that the [[Sides of an equation|LHS]] of the summation formula is what is sought and the [[Sides of an equation|RHS]] something that can be attacked by [[mathematical analysis]].

===Selberg trace formula===
Further generalisation to [[locally compact abelian group]]s is required in [[number theory]]. In non-commutative [[harmonic analysis]], the idea is taken even further in the [[Selberg trace formula]], but takes on a much deeper character.

A series of mathematicians applying harmonic analysis to number theory, most notably Martin Eichler, [[Atle Selberg]], [[Robert Langlands]], and James Arthur,  have generalised the Poisson summation formula to the Fourier transform on non-commutative locally compact reductive algebraic groups &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt;  with a discrete subgroup &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt; G/\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;  has finite volume.  For example, &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt;  can be the real points of &lt;math&gt; GL_n&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;  can be the integral points of &lt;math&gt; GL_n&lt;/math&gt;.   In this setting, &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt;  plays the role of the real number line in the classical version of Poisson summation, and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;  plays the role of the integers &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;  that appear in the sum.  The generalised version of Poisson summation is called the Selberg Trace Formula,  and has played a role in proving many cases of Artin's conjecture and in Wiles's proof of  Fermat's Last Theorem.  The left-hand side of (1)  becomes a sum over irreducible unitary representations of &lt;math&gt; G&lt;/math&gt;, and is called "the spectral side," while the right-hand side becomes a sum over conjugacy classes of &lt;math&gt; \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and is called "the geometric side."

The Poisson summation formula is the archetype for vast developments in harmonic analysis and number theory.

In [[mathematics]], the '''support''' of a real-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is the subset of the [[Domain of a function|domain]] containing those elements which are not mapped to zero. If the domain of ''f'' is a topological space, the support of ''f'' is instead defined as the smallest ''closed'' set containing all points not mapped to zero. This concept is used very widely in [[mathematical analysis]].

==Formulation==
Suppose that ''f'' : ''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is a real-valued function whose [[Domain of a function|domain]] is an arbitrary set ''X''. The '''set-theoretic support''' of ''f'', written '''supp(''f'')''', is the set of points in ''X'' where ''f'' is non-zero

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}(f) = \{x\in X \,|\, f(x)\ne 0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The support of ''f'' is the smallest subset of ''X'' with the property that ''f'' is zero on the subset's complement. If ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all but a finite number of points ''x''&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;''X'', then ''f'' is said to have '''finite support'''.
 
If the set ''X'' has an additional structure (for example, a topology), then the support of ''f'' is defined in an analogous way as the smallest subset of ''X'' of an appropriate type such that ''f'' vanishes in an appropriate sense on its complement. The notion of support also extends in a natural way to functions taking values in more general sets than '''R''' and to other objects, such as measures or distributions.

==Closed support==
The most common situation occurs when ''X'' is a [[topological space]] (such as the [[real line]] or ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space) and ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is a continuous real (or complex)-valued function.  In this case, the support of ''f'' is defined topologically as the  [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the subset of ''X'' where ''f'' is non-zero&lt;ref name='folland'&gt;{{cite book|last=Folland|first= Gerald B.|year=1999|title=Real Analysis, 2nd ed.|page=132|location= New York|publisher=John Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='hormander'&gt;{{cite book|last=Hörmander|first= Lars|year=1990|title=Linear Partial Differential Equations I, 2nd ed.|page=14|location= Berlin|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pasc&gt;{{cite book|last=Pascucci|first= Andrea|year=2011|title=PDE and Martingale Methods in Option Pricing|page=678|isbn=978-88-470-1780-1|doi=10.1007/978-88-470-1781-8|location= Berlin|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{supp}(f) := \overline{\{x \in X \,|\, f(x) \neq 0 \}} =\overline{f^{-1}\left(\left\{ 0\right\} ^{c}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the intersection of closed sets is closed, supp(''f'') is the intersection of all closed sets that contain the set-theoretic support of&amp;nbsp;''f''.

For example, if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is the function defined by

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \begin{cases} 1-x^2 &amp; \text{if } |x| &lt; 1 \\ 0 &amp; \text{if } |x| \ge 1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

then the support of ''f'' is the closed interval [−1,1], since ''f'' is non-zero on the open interval (−1,1) and the closure of this set is [−1,1].

The notion of closed support is usually applied to continuous functions, but the definition makes sense for arbitrary real or complex-valued functions on a topological space, and some authors do not require that ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' (or '''C''') be continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudin|first= Walter|year=1987|title=Real and Complex Analysis, 3rd ed.|page=38|location= New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compact support==
Functions with '''compact support''' on a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are those whose closed support is a [[compact space|compact]] subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the real line, or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Euclidean space, then a function has compact support if and only if it has '''bounded support''', since a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined above is a continuous function with compact support [−1, 1].

The condition of compact support is stronger than the condition of [[vanish at infinity|vanishing at infinity]]. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

vanishes at infinity, since &lt;math&gt;f(x)\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;|x|\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;, but its support &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is not compact.

Real-valued compactly supported [[smooth function]]s on a [[Euclidean space]] are called [[bump function]]s. [[Mollifier]]s are an important special case of bump functions as they can be used in [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]] to create [[sequence]]s of smooth functions approximating nonsmooth (generalized) functions, via [[convolution]].

In [[Well-behaved|good cases]], functions with compact support are [[dense set|dense]] in the space of functions that vanish at infinity, but this property requires some technical work to justify in a given example. As an intuition for more complex examples, and in the language of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]], for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, any function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the real line &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that vanishes at infinity can be approximated by choosing an appropriate compact subset &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that
 
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - I_C(x)f(x)| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[indicator function]] of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Every continuous function on a compact topological space has compact support since every closed subset of a compact space is indeed compact.

==Essential support==
If ''X'' is a topological measure space with a Borel measure μ (such as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, or a Lebesgue measurable subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, equipped with Lebesgue measure), then one typically identifies functions that are equal μ-almost everywhere. In that case, the '''essential support''' of a measurable function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', written '''ess supp(''f'')''', is defined to be the smallest closed subset ''F'' of ''X'' such that ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 μ-almost everywhere outside ''F''. Equivalently, ess supp(f) is the complement of the largest open set on which ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 ''μ''-almost everywhere&lt;ref name=lieb&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lieb|first1=Elliott|authorlink1=Elliott H. Lieb|last2=Loss|first2=Michael|author2-link=Michael Loss|title=Analysis|year=2001|edition=2nd|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|series=Graduate Studies in Mathematics|volume=14|isbn=978-0821827833|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ess\,supp}(f) := X \setminus\bigcup \left\{\Omega\subset X \,|\, \Omega\,\text{is open and}\, f = 0\, \mu\text{-almost everywhere in}\, \Omega \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The essential support of a function ''f'' depends on the measure μ as well as on ''f'', and it may be strictly smaller than the closed support. For example, if ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,1]&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' is the [[Dirichlet function]] that is 0 on irrational numbers and 1 on rational numbers, and [0,1] is equipped with Lebesgue measure, then the support of ''f'' is the entire interval [0,1], but the essential support of ''f'' is empty, since ''f'' is equal almost everywhere to the zero function.

In analysis one nearly always wants to use the essential support of a function, rather than its closed support, when the two sets are different, so ess supp(''f'') is often written simply as supp(''f'') and referred to as the support.&lt;ref name = lieb /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a similar way, one uses the [[Essential supremum and essential infimum|essential supremum]] of a measurable function instead of its supremum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization==
If ''M'' is an arbitrary set containing zero, the concept of support is immediately generalizable to functions ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''→''M''.  Support may also be defined for any [[algebraic structure]] with [[identity element|identity]] (such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[monoid]], or [[composition algebra]]), in which the identity element assumes the role of zero. For instance, the family '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; of functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the [[integers]] is the [[uncountable]] set of integer sequences.  The subfamily {&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:''f''&amp;nbsp; has finite support&amp;nbsp;} is the countable set of all integer sequences that have only finitely many nonzero entries.

Functions of finite support are used in defining algebraic structures such as [[Group ring|group rings]] and [[Free abelian group|free abelian groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55897585|title=Computational homology|last=Tomasz,|first=Kaczynski,|date=2004|publisher=Springer|others=Mischaikow, Konstantin Michael,, Mrozek, Marian,|year=|isbn=9780387215976|location=New York|pages=445|oclc=55897585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In probability and measure theory==
{{details|support (measure theory)}}

In [[probability theory]], the support of a [[probability distribution]] can be loosely thought of as the closure of the set of possible values of a random variable having that distribution. There are, however, some subtleties to consider when dealing with general distributions defined on a [[sigma algebra]], rather than on a topological space.

More formally, if &lt;math&gt;X:\Omega \to \R&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable on &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)&lt;/math&gt; then the support of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest closed set &lt;math&gt;R_X \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;P(X \in R_X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

In practice, support of a discrete random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as the set &lt;math&gt;R_X = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: P(X = x) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;.
And support of a continuous random variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the set &lt;math&gt;R_X = \{x \in \mathbb{R}: f_X(x) &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f_X(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[probability density function]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taboga|first1=Marco|title=Support of a random variable|url=https://www.statlect.com/glossary/support-of-a-random-variable|website=statlect.com|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Note that the word ''support'' can refer to the [[logarithm]] of the [[likelihood function|likelihood]] of a probability density function.

==Support of a distribution{{anchor|Support (statistics)}}==
It is possible also to talk about the support of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]], such as the [[Dirac delta function]] δ(''x'') on the real line. In that example, we can consider test functions ''F'', which are [[smooth function]]s with support not including the point 0. Since δ(''F'') (the distribution δ applied as [[linear functional]] to ''F'') is 0 for such functions, we can say that the support of δ is {0} only. Since [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] (including [[probability measure]]s) on the real line are special cases of distributions, we can also speak of the support of a measure in the same way.

Suppose that ''f'' is a distribution, and that ''U'' is an open set in Euclidean space such that, for all test functions &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that the support of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is contained in ''U'', &lt;math&gt;f(\phi) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''f'' is said to vanish on ''U''. Now, if ''f'' vanishes on an arbitrary family &lt;math&gt;U_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; of open sets, then for any test function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; supported in &lt;math&gt;\bigcup U_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, a simple argument based on the compactness of the support of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and a partition of unity shows that &lt;math&gt;f(\phi) = 0&lt;/math&gt; as well. Hence we can define the ''support'' of ''f'' as the complement of the largest open set on which ''f'' vanishes. For example, the support of the Dirac delta is &lt;math&gt;\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Singular support==
In [[Fourier analysis]] in particular, it is interesting to study the '''singular support''' of a distribution. This has the intuitive interpretation as the set of points at which a distribution ''fails to be a smooth function''.

For example, the [[Fourier transform]] of the [[Heaviside step function]] can, up to constant factors, be considered to be 1/''x'' (a function) ''except'' at ''x'' = 0. While ''x'' = 0 is clearly a special point, it is more precise to say that the transform of the distribution has singular support {0}: it cannot accurately be expressed as a function in relation to test functions with support including 0. It ''can'' be expressed as an application of a [[Cauchy principal value]] ''improper'' integral.

For distributions in several variables, singular supports allow one to define ''[[wave front set]]s'' and understand [[Huygens' principle]] in terms of [[mathematical analysis]]. Singular supports may also be used to understand phenomena special to distribution theory, such as attempts to 'multiply' distributions (squaring the Dirac delta function fails – essentially because the singular supports of the distributions to be multiplied should be disjoint).

==Family of supports==
An abstract notion of '''family of supports''' on a [[topological space]] ''X'', suitable for [[sheaf theory]], was defined by [[Henri Cartan]]. In extending [[Poincaré duality]] to [[manifold]]s that are not compact, the 'compact support' idea enters naturally on one side of the duality; see for example [[Alexander–Spanier cohomology]].

Bredon, ''Sheaf Theory'' (2nd edition, 1997) gives these definitions. A family Φ of closed subsets of ''X'' is a ''family of supports'', if it is [[down-closed]] and closed under [[finite union]]. Its ''extent'' is the union over Φ. A ''paracompactifying'' family of supports that satisfies further that any ''Y'' in Φ is, with the [[subspace topology]], a [[paracompact space]]; and has some ''Z'' in Φ which is a [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]]. If ''X'' is a [[locally compact space]], assumed [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] the family of all [[compact subset]]s satisfies the further conditions, making it paracompactifying.

The '''Tonti diagram''',&lt;ref&gt;Tonti, E.: The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, Birkhäuser (Springer) (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; created by the Italian physicist and mathematician Enzo Tonti, is a diagram that classifies variables and equations of physical theories of classical and relativistic physics. The theories involved are: ''particle dynamics, analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids, fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, gravitation, heat conduction,'' and ''irreversible thermodynamics''. The classification stems from the observation that each physical variable has a well-defined association with a space and a time element, as shown in Fig. 1, which can be grasped from the corresponding global variable and from its measuring process.

== Historical note ==
The starting point of this classification stems from a remark by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. Speaking about analogies in different physical theories, Maxwell wrote in 1871:&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: Remarks on the Mathematical Classification of Physical Quantities. Proc.
London Math. Soc. 3 (34), 258-266 (1871) Reprinted by Niven, W.D.: The Scientific Papers of J.C. Maxwell. Dover, New York (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the factors which compose it [energy], one is referred to unit of length, and the other to unit of area. This gives what I regard as a very important distinction among vector quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This remark leads us to a distinction between vectors referred to lines and vectors referred to surfaces. This is not customarily considered in vector calculus or in physics. In electromagnetism, hence, vectors '''E''' and '''H''' are associated with lines, and vectors '''D''' and '''B''' are associated with surfaces. This distinction leads to a classification of physical variables based on their ''association'' with space elements. 
Maxwell continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only through the progress of science in recent times that we have become acquainted with so large a number of physical quantities that a classification of them is desirable. [...] But the classification which I now refer to is founded on the mathematical or formal analogy of the different quantities, and not on the matter to which they belong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The classification diagram arises from an analysis of the ''association'' of physical variables in different physical theories, whatever their mathematical nature, i.e. scalars, vectors, tensors, etc., with space and time elements.

== The three kinds of physical quantities ==
Physics, compared to other natural sciences, has the great privilege of considering the [[quantity|quantitative]] attributes of physical systems and from these originate the [[physical quantity|physical quantities]], which can be [[scalar (physics)|scalars]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, etc. Physical quantities can be divided into three main categories: '''physical variables''', '''physical parameters''' and [[physical constant|'''fundamental constants''']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tonti|first1=Enzo|title=The Reason for Analogies in Physics|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEtOy8xKN-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global variables in space and field variables ==
The term '''space-global variables''' refers to all physical variables that are not densities of other variables. Distinguishing  between global variables and corresponding densities is essential. Mass density is given by the ratio of mass to volume, mass being the ''global'' variable. Pressure is the ratio of the normal force on an element of plane surface to the surface area, therefore the normal force is the ''global'' variable and the pressure is its surface density. The strain of a bar is the ratio of the elongation to its original length, elongation being the ''global'' variable and strain the line density.
The very fact that we create volume, surface or line densities highlights that the corresponding global variables are ''associated'' with volumes, surfaces and lines.
Every density is obtained by dividing a global variable by the extension of the ''associated'' space element. The mathematical treatment of physics also customarily considers the limit of this ratio to obtain a pointwise density, i.e. a '''field variable'''. Generally, field variables are preferred to global variables, to the extent that we express the global variables as integrals of the respective field variables, and call them '''integral variables'''.
Integral variables are global variables, but there are also global variables which are ''associated'' with points, and which, therefore, cannot be considered integral variables. Hence, global variables form a broader class compared to integral variables; for which reason, in view of the classification, the use of the term “global variables” is preferred to that of "integral variables".

== Global variables in time and rates ==
The term '''time-global variables''' is used to indicate variables that are not rates of other variables. Displacement, impulse, momentum and position vector are therefore global variables. Displacement and impulse are associated with time intervals, while momentum and position vector are associated with instants. This is evident if we think that we can perform the rates of the first two variables obtaining velocity and force respectively, while we cannot perform the rates of the last two variables.

== The three kinds of physical variables ==
The physical variables, both global variables and densities, in turn, can be divided into three classes: those characterising the ''configuration'' of a system or a field, those describing the ''source'' of a phenomenon or a field, and finally ''energy'' variables. Every physical system, even a field, has its own “configuration”, and the variables describing this configuration are called '''configuration variables'''. Each field has its sources (for example, electric charges are the source of electric fields, heat generators are the source of thermal fields and forces are the source of motion and deformation): variables describing sources are called '''source variables'''. The third category, that of '''energy variables''', is created by multiplying a configuration variable by a source variable.
The '''fundamental problem''' of a field is finding the configuration of the field at every time instant, given the spatial distribution and the intensity of its sources (which is to say: given the causes, determine the effects).

== Space and time elements ==
By the term "space elements" we intend '''points''', '''lines''', '''surfaces''' and '''volumes''', which are denoted '''P''','''L''','''S''' and '''V''' respectively.
By the term "time elements" we intend '''time instants''' and '''time intervals''', which are denoted '''I''' and '''T''' respectively.
Space elements are naturally classified according to their dimension, from the smallest to the biggest, i.e. points, lines, surfaces and volumes. The same classification applies to time elements, i.e. instants and intervals.

== Association with space elements ==
[[File:Schermata49.png|thumb|'''Figure 1'''.The figure shows a number of physical variables with the space and time elements they are ''associated'' with.]]

[[File:Margheritaq.png|thumb|'''Figure 2'''. Every space element can be endowed with one of the two possible orientations: inner and outer.]]

All fluxes (e.g. magnetic flux, electric flux, vortex flux)  make reference to a surface ('''S'''), all variables expressed by a line integral (e.g. electromotive force, velocity circulation, magnetomotive force) make reference to a line ('''L''') and all contents (e.g. of energy, mass, entropy, etc.) make reference to a volume ('''V'''). Lastly all potentials (e.g. electric potential, velocity potential, temperature) make reference to a point ('''P''').

== Association with time elements ==
A similar association exists between time-global variables and time elements. Therefore, a displacement is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''), whereas a position vector is ''associated'' with a time instant ('''I'''). In this association the measuring process must be taken into account, because temperature is ''referred'' to an instant but its measurement involves a time interval - the one needed to reach thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the temperature is said to be ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T'''). Similarly, the measurement of a force requires a [[mechanical equilibrium]] to be reached, hence it is ''associated'' with a time interval ('''T''').

[[File:Ritaaa.png|thumb|'''Figure 3'''. ''Left'') A two-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Inherited association of field variables ==
Since in each field of physics the global variables are ''associated'' with a space and a time element, the association of the corresponding densities and the rates with the space and time element of the corresponding global variable is spontaneous. The densities and the rates are said to ''inherit'' the association from their corresponding global variables. The same inherited association remains once we have  performed the limit to obtain the field variables.

== Orientation of space elements ==
In this classification, the orientation of the space elements has a fundamental role. There are two kinds of orientation: '''inner''' and '''outer orientation''',&lt;ref&gt;Schouten, J.A.: Tensor Calculus for Physicists. 2nd ed., Dover, New York (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Fig. 2.

There is a surprising correspondence between the role that a physical variable plays in a theory and the type of orientation of the corresponding space element: a detailed analysis of physical variables shows that ''the configuration variables are associated with the space elements endowed with inner orientation while the source and the energy variables are associated with the outer orientation.''

[[File:Greta copia.png|thumb|'''Figure 4'''. ''Left'') A three-dimensional cell complex and its dual; ''right'') the classification of its space elements.]]

== Cell complexes ==
To highlight the four space elements, it is expedient to divide a region of space into many cells, thus creating a '''cell complex'''. The vertices represent points, the edges lines, the faces surfaces and the cells themselves volumes.
Each of these elements can be given an inner orientation. Since we also need space elements with outer orientation, it is expedient to consider the '''dual complex''', obtained by joining the centroids of the cells belonging to the '''primal complex'''. Doing so, we see that the inner orientation of each element of the primal complex induces an outer orientation on the corresponding element of the dual complex.

Figures 3 and 4 show how the space elements of the primal complex, which are endowed with inner orientation, induce an outer orientation on the elements of the dual complex. Moreover, the space elements of the two complexes can be arranged in a diagram such as the one shown on the right-hand side of the figures.

A cell complex and its dual constitute a valid framework to describe the association of physical variables with the oriented space elements. To be precise, the configuration variables, which are associated with space elements with inner orientation, may be associated with the elements of the primal complex, while the source variables, which are associated with the space elements with an outer orientation, can be associated with the elements of the dual complex.

== Orientation of time elements ==

[[File:Tempo nuovo 2.png|thumb|'''Figure 5'''. Time elements. I&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time instants; T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = time intervals; '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = position vector; '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; = displacement.]]

At first glance, the notions of inner and outer orientation of a time element may appear strange, certainly unusual. Let us consider a subdivision of the time axis into many adjacent time intervals. Doing so, we have constructed a one-dimensional cell complex in time. 
Considering now the middle instants of each time interval we have a second cell complex in time. The first complex is called ''primal'' and the second ''dual''.
 
'''Primal complex, inner orientation''': the fact that the time axis is oriented implies that each time interval is oriented: this is the inner orientation of the primal time intervals.
Since the variation of a time function φ (t) is defined as Δφ = + φ (t + h)-φ (t),  in order to conceive the "+" and "-" signs of this formula as incidence numbers between a time interval and its bounding instants, these should be considered as "sinks".

'''Dual complex, outer orientation''': the middle instant of each time interval is called ''dual time instant'' and we can give it the same orientation of the primal time interval. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time instant. In turn, the time intervals connecting two adjacent dual time instants are called ''dual time intervals''. Once more we can assign them the orientation induced by the primal time instants, as shown in Fig. 5. This is called ''outer'' orientation of the dual time intervals.

==The birth of the classification diagram &lt;ref&gt;Diagrams of the various physical theories can be downloaded from the website http://www.discretephysics.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ==

[[File:Ele1.png|thumb|'''Figure 6'''. Classification diagram for electrostatics.]]

The fact that physical variables are associated with space and time elements endowed with inner or outer orientation and that space and time elements of a primal and a dual cell complex can be classified as shown on the right-hand side of Figs. 3 and 4, suggests a corresponding classification of physical variables. 
Let us consider, as an example, the classification diagram of electrostatics, shown in Fig. 6. The left column includes those physical variables associated with the primal cell complex, whose elements are endowed with inner orientation: these are the ''configuration'' variables. The right column includes those physical variables associated with the dual cell complex, whose elements are endowed with outer orientation: these are the ''source'' variables.

The equations linking the variables are contained in the rectangular boxes. The equations in each vertical column are ''balance'' equations, ''circuital'' equations and ''gradient-forming'' equations. They have a topological structure and are called '''topological equations'''. Those that link configuration variables to source variables—contained in the horizontal links—are ''material'' or ''constitutive'' equations, and belong to the category of '''phenomenological equations'''.

==The time diagram==
[[File:Par1.png|thumb|'''Figure 7'''. Classification diagram for particle dynamics.]]
Particle dynamics, analytical mechanics and electric networks make use of space-global variables that depend only on the time variable. Referring here to particle dynamics, we see that configuration variables are geometrical and kinematic variables, while source variables are static and dynamic variables. In Fig. 7 we see that kinematic variables lie in the left column while dynamic variables lie in the right one. The diagram shows three phenomenological equations: those connecting two variables on the same level describe a reversible relation (i.e. a non-dissipative relation), while those linking force with velocity describe an irreversible relation (i.e. a dissipative relation). The dissipative nature is shown by the fact that one variable, velocity, changes sign under reversal of motion, while the other, force, does not.

==The space-time diagram==
[[File:E Tonti Classification diagrams mechanical and field theories.png|thumb|'''Figure 8'''. The two classification diagrams of space-time elements.]] 
Since every global physical variable is associated with both a time and a space element, it appears useful to have a classification diagram combining space and time elements.   
When the four space elements '''P''', '''L''', '''S''' and '''V''' are coupled with the two time elements  '''I''' and '''T''' we obtain eight possible combinations. Furthermore, if one considers that each space element and each time element can be endowed with two orientations, inner and outer, we must combine the 4x2 oriented space elements with the 2x2 oriented time elements, thus obtaining 32 possible space-time combinations. Fig. 8 shows the two possible classification diagrams of the space-time elements.
The first version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with inner orientation and vice versa: it is the case of mechanics in all its manifestations, such as particle and analytical mechanics, mechanics of deformable solids and fluid mechanics. The second version associates the space elements endowed with inner orientation with the time elements endowed with outer orientation and vice versa. It is the case of field theories such as electromagnetism, gravitation, thermal conduction and irreversible thermodynamics.

The space-time diagrams show clearly which phenomenological equations describe irreversible phenomena: they are the ones that link variables that are on the same level but connect a box on the front-left side with a box on the back-right side.

'''Ulisse Dini''' (14 November 1845 – 28 October 1918) was an [[Italia]]n [[mathematician]] and [[politician]], born in [[Pisa]]. He is known for his contribution to [[real analysis]], partly collected in his book "''Fondamenti per la teorica delle funzioni di variabili reali''".&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harv|Ford|1920|p=174}} and {{harv|Severi|1957|pp=23–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and academic career==

[[Image:Betti Enrico.jpg|left|thumb|Enrico Betti, teacher and academic advisor of Ulisse Dini]]
Dini attended the [[Scuola Normale Superiore]] in order to become a teacher. One of his professors was [[Enrico Betti]]. In 1865, a scholarship enabled him to visit [[Paris]], where he studied under [[Charles Hermite]] as well as [[Joseph Bertrand]], and published several papers. In 1866, he was appointed to the [[University of Pisa]], where he taught [[algebra]] and [[geodesy]]. In 1871, he succeeded Betti as professor for [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]. From 1888 until 1890, Dini was ''rettore''&lt;ref&gt;"Rettore" is the Italian title for the chief executive, i.e. the [[rector (academia)|rector]], of a university.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Pisa University, and of the ''[[Scuola Normale Superiore]]'' from 1908 until his death in 1918.

He was also active as a [[politician]]: in 1871 he was voted into the Pisa [[city council]], and in 1880, he became a member of the [[Italian parliament]].

===Honors===
He has been elected honorary member of the [[London Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;See the official list of honorary members redacted by {{harvtxt|Fisher|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dini worked in the field of mathematical analysis during a time when it was begun to be based on rigorous foundations. In addition to his books, he wrote about sixty papers.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvtxt|Ford|1920|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He proved the [[Dini criterion]] for the [[convergence (mathematics)|convergence]] of [[Fourier series]] and investigated the [[potential theory]] and [[differential geometry]] of [[Surface (differential geometry)|surface]]s, based on work by [[Eugenio Beltrami]].

His work on the theory of real functions was also important in the development of the concept of the [[Measure (mathematics)|measure on a set]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Letta|1994|pp=157–161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Watts–Strogatz model''' is a [[random graph]] generation model that produces graphs with [[small-world network|small-world properties]], including short [[average path length]]s and high [[Clustering coefficient|clustering]]. It was proposed by [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Steven Strogatz]] in their joint 1998 [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] paper.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watts | first1 = D.

==Rationale for the model==
The formal study of [[random graph]]s dates back to the work of [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Alfréd Rényi]].&lt;ref name=Erdos1960&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Erdos, P.
 | year = 1960
 | title = Publications Mathematicae 6, 290 (1959); P. Erdos, A. Renyi
 | journal = Publ. Math. Inst. Hung. Acad. Sci
 | volume = 5
 | pages = 17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphs they considered, now known as the classical or [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi (ER)]] graphs, offer a simple and powerful model with many applications.

However the [[Erdős–Rényi model|ER]] graphs do not have two important properties observed in many real-world networks:
# They do not generate local clustering and [[triadic closure]]s. Instead, because they have a constant, random, and independent probability of two nodes being connected, ER graphs have a low [[clustering coefficient]].
# They do not account for the formation of hubs. Formally, the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] distribution of ER graphs converges to a [[Poisson distribution]], rather than a [[power law]] observed in many real-world, [[scale-free networks]].&lt;ref name=Ravasz2002&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravasz|first1=E.|title=Hierarchical Organization of Modularity in Metabolic Networks|journal=Science|date=30 August 2002|volume=297|issue=5586|pages=1551–1555|doi=10.1126/science.1073374|bibcode=2002Sci...297.1551R|arxiv=cond-mat/0209244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Watts and Strogatz model was designed as the simplest possible model that addresses the '''first''' of the two limitations. It accounts for clustering while retaining the short average path lengths of the ER model. It does so by interpolating between a randomized structure close to ER graphs and a regular ring [[lattice (group)|lattice]]. Consequently, the model is able to at least partially explain the "small-world" phenomena in a variety of networks, such as the power grid, neural network of [[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]], networks of movie actors, or fat-metabolism communication in [[budding yeast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004264|pmid=26020510|title=Experimental and Computational Analysis of a Large Protein Network That Controls Fat Storage Reveals the Design Principles of a Signaling Network|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=11|issue=5|pages=e1004264|year=2015|last1=Al-Anzi|first1=Bader|last2=Arpp|first2=Patrick|last3=Gerges|first3=Sherif|last4=Ormerod|first4=Christopher|last5=Olsman|first5=Noah|last6=Zinn|first6=Kai|bibcode=2015PLSCB..11E4264A|pmc=4447291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithm==
[[Image:Watts strogatz.svg|thumb|Watts–Strogatz graph]]
Given the desired number of nodes &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the mean [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (assumed to be an even integer), and a special parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying &lt;math&gt;0 \le \beta \le 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N\gg K \gg \ln N \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, the model constructs an [[Undirected graph#Undirected graph|undirected graph]] with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes and &lt;math&gt;\frac{NK}{2}&lt;/math&gt; edges in the following way:

# Construct a regular ring lattice, a graph with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes each connected to &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; neighbors, &lt;math&gt;K/2&lt;/math&gt; on each side. That is, if the nodes are labeled  &lt;math&gt;n_0 \ldots n_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt;, there is an edge &lt;math&gt;(n_i, n_j)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; |i - j|\ \mathrm{mod}\ \left( N-1-\frac K 2 \right) \leq \frac K 2. &lt;/math&gt; 
# For every node &lt;math&gt;n_i=n_0,\dots, n_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; take every edge connecting &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; to its &lt;math&gt;K/2&lt;/math&gt; rightmost neighbors, that is every edge &lt;math&gt;(n_i, n_j\ \mathrm{mod}\ N)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n_i &lt; n_j \leq n_i + K/2&lt;/math&gt;, and rewire it with probability &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. Rewiring is done by replacing &lt;math&gt;(n_i, n_j\ \mathrm{mod}\ N)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(n_i, n_k)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is chosen uniformly at random from all possible nodes while avoiding self-loops (&lt;math&gt;k \ne i&lt;/math&gt;) and link duplication (there is no edge &lt;math&gt;(n_i, n_{k'})&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k' = k&lt;/math&gt; at this point in the algorithm).

==Properties==
The underlying lattice structure of the model produces a locally clustered network, while the randomly rewired links dramatically reduce the [[average path length]]s. The algorithm introduces about &lt;math&gt;\beta\frac{NK}{2}&lt;/math&gt; of such non-lattice edges. Varying &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; makes it possible to interpolate between a regular lattice (&lt;math&gt;\beta=0&lt;/math&gt;) and a structure close to an [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi random graph]] &lt;math&gt;G(N, p)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p = \frac{K}{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;. It does not approach the actual ER model since every node will be connected to at least &lt;math&gt; K / 2 &lt;/math&gt; other nodes.

The three properties of interest are the [[average path length]], the [[clustering coefficient]], and the [[degree distribution]].

===Average path length===
For a ring lattice, the average path length is &lt;math&gt;\ell(0)=N/2K\gg 1&lt;/math&gt; and scales linearly with the system size. In the [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of &lt;math&gt;\beta \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;, the graph approaches a random graph with &lt;math&gt;\ell(1)=\frac{\ln N}{\ln K}&lt;/math&gt;, while not actually converging to it. In the intermediate region &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\beta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the average path length falls very rapidly with increasing &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, quickly approaching its limiting value.

===Clustering coefficient===
For the ring lattice the [[clustering coefficient]]&lt;ref name=AlbertBarabasi&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;C(0)=\frac{3(K-2)}{4(K-1)}&lt;/math&gt;, and so tends to &lt;math&gt;3/4&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; grows, independently of the system size.&lt;ref name=Barrat2000/&gt; In the limiting case of &lt;math&gt;\beta \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; the clustering coefficient is of the same order as the clustering coefficient for classical random graphs, &lt;math&gt;C=K/(N-1)&lt;/math&gt; and is thus inversely proportional to the system size. In the intermediate region the clustering coefficient remains quite close to its value for the regular lattice, and only falls at relatively high &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;. This results in a region where the average path length falls rapidly, but the clustering coefficient does not, explaining the "small-world" phenomenon.

:: &lt;math&gt;C'(\beta)\equiv\frac{3\times \text{number of triangles}}{\text{number of connected triples}}&lt;/math&gt;

:then we get &lt;math&gt; C'(\beta)\sim C(0)(1-\beta)^3.&lt;/math&gt;

===Degree distribution===

The degree distribution in the case of the ring lattice is just a [[Dirac delta function]] centered at &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. The degree distribution for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\beta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; can be written as,&lt;ref name=Barrat2000/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(k) = \sum_{n=0}^{f(k,K)} {{K/2}\choose{n}} (1-\beta)^n \beta^{K/2-n} \frac{(\beta K/2)^{k-K/2-n}}{(k-K/2-n)!} e^{-\beta K/2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of edges that the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; node has or its degree. Here  &lt;math&gt;k\geq K/2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(k,K)=\min(k-K/2,K/2)&lt;/math&gt;. The shape of the degree distribution is similar to that of a random graph and has a pronounced peak at &lt;math&gt;k=K&lt;/math&gt; and decays exponentially for large &lt;math&gt;|k-K|&lt;/math&gt;. The topology of the network is relatively homogeneous, meaning that all nodes are of similar degree.

==Limitations==
The major limitation of the model is that it produces an unrealistic [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] distribution. In contrast, real networks are often [[scale-free networks]] inhomogeneous in degree, having hubs and a scale-free degree distribution. Such networks are better described in that respect by the [[preferential attachment]] family of models, such as the [[BA model|Barabási–Albert (BA) model]]. (On the other hand, the Barabási–Albert model fails to produce the high levels of clustering seen in real networks, a shortcoming not shared by the Watts and Strogatz model. Thus, neither the Watts and Strogatz model nor the Barabási–Albert model should be viewed as fully realistic.)

The Watts and Strogatz model also implies a fixed number of nodes and thus cannot be used to model network growth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4356">'''Wheels''' are a type of [[universal algebra|algebra]] where division is always defined.  In particular, [[division by zero]] is meaningful. The real numbers can be extended to a wheel, as can any [[commutative ring]].

The [[Riemann sphere]] can also be extended to a wheel by adjoining an element &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0/0=\bot&lt;/math&gt;. The Riemann sphere is an extension of the [[complex plane]] by an element &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;z/0=\infty&lt;/math&gt; for any complex &lt;math&gt;z\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;0/0&lt;/math&gt; is still undefined on the Riemann sphere, but is defined in its extension to a wheel.

The term ''wheel'' is inspired by the topological picture &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt; of the projective line together with an extra point &lt;math&gt;\bot = 0/0&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Carlström|2004}}

== Definition ==
A wheel is an [[algebraic structure]] &lt;math&gt;( W, 0, 1, +, \cdot, / )&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying:

* Addition and multiplication are [[commutative]] and [[associative]], with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; as their respective identities.
* &lt;math&gt;//x = x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;/(xy) = /y/x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;xz + yz = (x + y)z + 0z&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(x + yz)/y = x/y + z + 0y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;0\cdot 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(x+0y)z = xz + 0y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;/(x+0y) = /x + 0y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;0/0 + x = 0/0&lt;/math&gt;

== Algebra of wheels ==
Wheels replace the usual division as a [[binary operation|binary operator]] with multiplication, with a [[unary operation|unary operator]] applied to one argument &lt;math&gt;/x&lt;/math&gt; similar (but not identical) to the [[multiplicative inverse]] &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;a/b&lt;/math&gt; becomes shorthand for &lt;math&gt;a \cdot /b = /b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt;, and modifies the rules of [[algebra]] such that

* &lt;math&gt;0x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; in the general case
* &lt;math&gt;x - x \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; in the general case
* &lt;math&gt;x/x \neq 1&lt;/math&gt; in the general case, as &lt;math&gt;/x&lt;/math&gt; is not the same as the [[multiplicative inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

If there is an element &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1 + a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then we may define negation by &lt;math&gt;-x = ax&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x - y = x + (-y)&lt;/math&gt;.

Other identities that may be derived are
* &lt;math&gt;0x + 0y = 0xy&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x-x = 0x^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x/x = 1 + 0x/x&lt;/math&gt;

And, for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0/x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we get the usual
* &lt;math&gt;x-x = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x/x = 1&lt;/math&gt;

If negation can be defined as above then the subset &lt;math&gt;\{x\mid 0x=0\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[commutative ring]], and every commutative ring is such a subset of a wheel. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible element of the commutative ring, then &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}=/x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, whenever &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; makes sense, it is equal to &lt;math&gt;/x&lt;/math&gt;, but the latter is always defined, even when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Wheel of fractions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a commutative ring, and let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a multiplicative [[monoid|submonoid]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.  Define the congruence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim_S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2)\sim_S(y_1,y_2)&lt;/math&gt; means that there exist &lt;math&gt;s_x,s_y\in S&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(s_x x_1,s_x x_2)=(s_y y_1,s_y y_2)&lt;/math&gt;.
Define the wheel of fractions of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; as the quotient &lt;math&gt;A \times A~/ \sim_S&lt;/math&gt; (and denoting the equivalence class containing &lt;math&gt;(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;[x_1,x_2]&lt;/math&gt;) with the operations
:&lt;math&gt;0 = [0_A,1_A]&lt;/math&gt; {{in5|10}}(additive identity)
:&lt;math&gt;1 = [1_A,1_A]&lt;/math&gt; {{in5|10}}(multiplicative identity)
:&lt;math&gt;/[x_1,x_2] = [x_2,x_1]&lt;/math&gt; {{in5|10}}(reciprocal operation)
:&lt;math&gt;[x_1,x_2] + [y_1,y_2] = [x_1y_2 + x_2 y_1,x_2 y_2]&lt;/math&gt; {{in5|10}}(addition operation)
:&lt;math&gt;[x_1,x_2] \cdot [y_1,y_2] = [x_1 y_1,x_2 y_2]&lt;/math&gt; {{in5|10}}(multiplication operation)

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''Wigner–Weyl transform''' or '''Weyl–Wigner transform''' (after [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]) is the invertible mapping between functions in the quantum [[phase space formulation]] and [[Hilbert space]] [[operator (mathematics)|operators]] in the [[Schrödinger picture]].

Often the mapping from functions on phase space to operators is called the '''Weyl transform''' or '''Weyl quantization''', whereas the inverse mapping, from operators to functions on phase space, is called the '''Wigner transform'''.  This mapping was originally devised by Hermann Weyl in 1927 in an attempt to map symmetrized ''classical'' phase space functions to operators, a procedure known as ''Weyl quantization''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now understood that Weyl quantization does not satisfy all the properties one would require for quantization and therefore sometimes yields unphysical answers. On the other hand, some of the nice properties described below suggest that if one seeks a single consistent quantization procedure mapping functions on the classical phase space to operators, the Weyl quantization is the best option. ([[Groenewold's theorem]] says that no such map can have all the properties one would ideally like.)

Regardless, the Weyl-Wigner transform is a well-defined integral transform between the phase-space and operator representations, and yields insight into the workings of quantum mechanics. Most importantly, the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]] is the Wigner transform of the quantum [[density matrix]], and, conversely, the density matrix is the Weyl transform of the Wigner function. 
In contrast to Weyl's original intentions in seeking a consistent quantization scheme, this map merely amounts to a change of representation within quantum mechanics; it need not connect "classical" with "quantum" quantities. For example, the phase-space function may depend explicitly on Planck's constant ħ, as it does in some familiar cases involving angular momentum.  This invertible representation change then allows one to [[phase space formulation|express quantum mechanics in phase space]], as was appreciated in the 1940s by [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Definition of the Weyl quantization of a general observable==
The following explains the Weyl transformation on the simplest, two-dimensional Euclidean phase space. Let the coordinates on phase space be {{math|''(q,p)''}}, and let  {{math|''f''}} be a function defined everywhere on phase space. In what follows, we fix operators ''P'' and ''Q'' satisfying the [[canonical commutation relation]]s, such as the usual position and momentum operators in the Schrödinger representation. We assume that the exponentiated operators &lt;math&gt;e^{iaQ}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{ibP}&lt;/math&gt; constitute an irreducible representation of the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem|Weyl relations]], so that the [[Stone–von Neumann theorem]] (guaranteeing uniqueness of the canonical commutation relations) holds. 

===The basic formula===

The '''Weyl transform''' (or '''Weyl quantization''') of the function {{math|''f''}}  is given by the following operator in Hilbert space,
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation =&lt;math&gt; \Phi [f] = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\iint\!\!\! \iint f(q,p) \rho\left(e^{i(a(Q-q)
+b(P-p))}\right) \text{d}q\, \text{d}p\, \text{d}a\, \text{d}b.&lt;/math&gt; 
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}
Here &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck constant]].  

It is instructive to perform the ''p'' and ''q'' integrals in the above formula first, which has the effect of computing the ordinary Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\tilde{f}&lt;/math&gt; of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, while leaving the operator &lt;math&gt;e^{i(aQ+bP)}&lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the Weyl transform can be written as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 13.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi [f] = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^2}\iint\tilde{f}(a,b)e^{iaQ+ibP}\,da\,db&lt;/math&gt;.

We may therefore think of the Weyl map as follows: We take the ordinary Fourier transform of the function &lt;math&gt;f(p,q)&lt;/math&gt;, but then when applying the Fourier inversion formula, we substitute the quantum operators &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; for the original classical variables &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, thus obtaining a "quantum version of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;."

A less symmetric form, but handy for applications, is the following,
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi [f]= \frac{2}{(2\pi \hbar)^{3/2}}\iint \!\!\!\iint\!\! dq dp d\tilde{x} d\tilde{p}  ~ e^{ \frac{i}{\hbar} (\tilde {x} \tilde {p}  -2(\tilde{p}-p)(\tilde{x}-q))}~ f(q,p) ~ |\tilde{x}\rangle\langle \tilde{p}|.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- warning: discuss on Talk page before considering tweaking the exponent; the asymmetry has method in its madness. --&gt;

===In the position representation===
The Weyl map may then also be expressed in terms of the integral kernel matrix elements of this operator,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Definition 13.7&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \langle x| \Phi [f] |y \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\text{d}p\over h} ~e^{ip(x-y)/\hbar}~ f\left({x+y\over2},p\right) .  &lt;/math&gt;

===The inverse map===
The inverse of the above Weyl map is the '''Wigner map''', which takes the operator {{math|''Φ''}} back to the original phase-space kernel function {{math|''f''}}, 
{{Equation box 1
|indent =::
|equation = &lt;math&gt; f(q,p)= 2  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \text{d}y~e^{-2ipy/\hbar}~ \langle q+y| \Phi [f] |q-y \rangle.  &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F9FFF7}}

If one replaces &lt;math&gt;\Phi[f]&lt;/math&gt; in the above expression with an arbitrary operator, the resulting function {{math|''f''}} may depend on Planck's constant {{math|''ħ''}}, and may well describe quantum-mechanical processes, provided it is properly composed through the [[Moyal product|star product]], below.&lt;ref&gt;

===The Weyl quantization of polynomial observables===
While the above formulas give a nice understanding of the Weyl quantization of a very general observable on phase space, they are not very convenient for computing on simple observables, such as those that are polynomials in &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. In later sections, we will see that on such polynomials, the Weyl quantization represents the totally symmetric ordering of the noncommuting operators &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
For example, the Wigner map of the quantum angular-momentum-squared operator '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not just the classical angular momentum squared, but it further contains an offset term  {{math|&amp;minus;3''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2}},  which accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state [[Bohr model|Bohr orbit]].

==Properties==
===Weyl quantization of polynomials===
The action of the Weyl quantization on polynomial functions of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is completely determined by the following symmetric formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 13.3&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(aq+bp)^n\longmapsto (aQ+bP)^n&lt;/math&gt;
for all real numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. From this formula, it is not hard to show that the Weyl quantization on a function of the form &lt;math&gt;q^k p^l&lt;/math&gt; gives the average of all possible orderings of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; factors of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; factors of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. 
For example, we have
:&lt;math&gt;6 p^2 q^2 ~~ \longmapsto ~~ P^2 Q^2 + Q^2  P^2 + PQPQ+PQ^2P+QPQP+QP^2Q.&lt;/math&gt;
While this result is conceptually natural, it is not convenient for computations when &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; are large. In such cases, we can use instead McCoy's formula&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Neal (1932). "On the Function in Quantum Mechanics which Corresponds to a Given Function in Classical Mechanics", ''Proc Nat Acad Sci USA'' '''19''' 674, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/85974?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents online] .&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  p^m q^n ~~ \longmapsto ~~ {1 \over 2^n} 
\sum_{r=0}^{n} {n \choose r} 
Q^r  P^m  Q^{n-r}={1 \over 2^m}\sum_{s=0}^{m} {m \choose s} P^s Q^{n}P^{m-s}.&lt;/math&gt;
This expression gives an apparently different answer for the case of &lt;math&gt;p^2 q^2&lt;/math&gt; from the totally symmetric expression above. There is no contradiction, however, since the canonical commutation relations allow for more than one expression for the same operator. (The reader may find it instructive to use the commutation relations to rewrite the totally symmetric formula for the case of &lt;math&gt;p^2q^2&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the operators &lt;math&gt;P^2Q^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;QP^2Q&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q^2P^2&lt;/math&gt; and verify the first expression in McCoy's formula with &lt;math&gt;m=n=2&lt;/math&gt;.)

It is widely thought that the Weyl quantization, among all quantization schemes, comes as close as possible to mapping the Poisson bracket on the classical side to the commutator on the quantum side. (An exact correspondence is impossible, in light of [[Canonical_quantization#Issues_and_limitations|Groenewold's theorem]].) For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 13.11&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Theorem''': If &lt;math&gt;f(q,p)&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree at most 2 and &lt;math&gt;g(q,p)&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary polynomial, then we have &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\{f,g\})=\frac{1}{i\hbar}[\Phi(f),\Phi(g)]&lt;/math&gt;.

===Weyl quantization of general functions===
* If {{math|''f''}} is a [[real-valued function]], then its Weyl-map image {{math|''Φ''[''f'']}}  is [[self-adjoint]].
* If {{math|''f''}} is an element of [[Schwartz space]], then {{math|''Φ''[''f'']}} is [[trace-class]].
* More generally, {{math|''Φ''[''f'']}} is a densely defined [[unbounded operator]].
* The map {{math|''Φ''[''f'']}} is one-to-one on the Schwartz space (as a subspace of the square-integrable functions).

==Deformation quantization==
Intuitively, a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] of a mathematical object is a family of the same kind of objects that depend on some parameter(s). 
Here, it provides rules for how to deform the "classical" commutative algebra of observables to a quantum non-commutative algebra of observables.

The basic setup in deformation  theory is to start with an algebraic structure (say a [[Lie algebra]]) and ask: Does there exist a one or more parameter(s) family of ''similar'' structures, such that for an initial value of the parameter(s) one has the same structure (Lie algebra) one started with? (The oldest illustration of this may be the realization of [[Eratosthenes]] in the ancient world that a flat earth was deformable to a spherical earth, with deformation parameter 1/''R''&lt;sub&gt;⊕&lt;/sub&gt;.) E.g., one may define a [[Noncommutative geometry|noncommutative torus]] as a deformation quantization through  a  &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-product to implicitly address all convergence subtleties (usually not addressed in formal deformation quantization). Insofar as the algebra of functions on a space determines the geometry of that space, the study of the star product leads to the study of a [[non-commutative geometry]] deformation of that space.

In the context of the above flat phase-space example, the star product ([[Moyal product]], actually introduced by Groenewold in 1946),   &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ħ''&lt;/sub&gt;, of a pair of functions in  {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(ℜ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}},  is specified by
:::&lt;math&gt;\Phi [f_1 \star f_2] = \Phi [f_1]\Phi [f_2].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The star product is not commutative in general, but goes over to the ordinary commutative product of functions in the limit of  {{math|''ħ'' → 0}}. As such, it is said to define a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] of the commutative algebra of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(ℜ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

For the Weyl-map example above, the &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-product may be written in terms of the [[Poisson bracket]] as
:&lt;math&gt;f_1 \star f_2 = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac {1}{n!} \left(\frac{i\hbar}{2} \right)^n  \Pi^n(f_1, f_2).&lt;/math&gt;

Here,  Π is the [[Poisson manifold#The Poisson Bivector|Poisson bivector]], an operator defined such that its powers are
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^0(f_1,f_2)=f_1f_2&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^1(f_1,f_2)=\{f_1,f_2\}= 
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial q}
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial p} -
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial p}
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial q} ~,
&lt;/math&gt;
where {''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} is the [[Poisson bracket]]. More generally,
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^n(f_1,f_2)=  \sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \choose k}
\left(
\frac{\partial^k }{\partial p^k}
\frac{\partial^{n-k}}{\partial q^{n-k}} f_1
\right) \times \left(
\frac{\partial^{n-k} }{\partial p^{n-k}}
\frac{\partial^k}{\partial q^k} f_2
\right) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{n \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binomial coefficient]].

Thus, e.g.,&lt;ref name="Zachos"&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Gaussians compose [[Hyperbolic function#Comparison with circular trigonometric functions|hyperbolically]],
: &lt;math&gt;
\exp \left (-{a } (q^2+p^2)\right ) ~ \star ~
\exp \left (-{b} (q^2+p^2)\right ) = {1\over 1+\hbar^2 ab}
\exp \left (-{a+b\over 1+\hbar^2 ab} (q^2+p^2)\right ) ,
&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;
 \delta (q) ~ \star ~ \delta(p) = {2\over h}
\exp \left (2i{qp\over\hbar}\right ) ,
&lt;/math&gt;
etc.
These formulas are predicated on coordinates in which the [[Poisson bivector]] is constant (plain flat Poisson brackets). For the general formula on arbitrary [[Poisson manifold]]s, cf. the [[Kontsevich quantization formula]].

Antisymmetrization of this &lt;small&gt;★&lt;/small&gt;-product yields the [[Moyal bracket]], the proper quantum deformation of the [[Poisson bracket]], and the phase-space isomorph (Wigner transform) of the quantum [[commutator]] in the more usual Hilbert-space formulation of quantum mechanics. As such, it provides the cornerstone of the dynamical equations of observables in this phase-space formulation.

There results a complete [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics, '''''completely equivalent to the Hilbert-space operator representation''''', with star-multiplications paralleling operator multiplications isomorphically.&lt;ref name="Zachos" /&gt;

Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables {{mvar|Φ}} with the density matrix in Hilbert space:  they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables such as the above {{mvar|f}} with the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]] effectively serving as a measure.

Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the above Weyl map facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] (generalization, cf. [[correspondence principle]]) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter {{math|''ħ''/''S''}}.  (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics, with deformation parameter ''v/c''; or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into General Relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension. Conversely, [[group contraction]] leads to the vanishing-parameter undeformed theories—[[classical limit]]s.)

Classical expressions, observables,  and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by {{mvar|ħ}}-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the ''noncommutative star-multiplication'' characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle.

It should be emphasized, however, that, despite its name,  Deformation Quantization  does not constitute a successful [[Quantization_(physics)|quantization scheme]], namely a method to produce a quantum  theory out of a classical one. It amounts to a mere representation change from Hilbert space to phase space.

==Generalizations==
In more generality, Weyl quantization is studied in cases where the phase space is a [[symplectic manifold]], or possibly a [[Poisson manifold]]. Related structures include the [[Poisson–Lie group]]s and [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s.

'''Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Châtelet''' ({{IPA-fr|emili dy ʃɑtlɛ|-|Fr-Emilie du Châtelet.ogg}}; 17 December 1706 &amp;nbsp;– 10 September 1749) was a [[France|French]] natural philosopher, mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to childbirth in 1749. Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on [[Isaac Newton]]'s book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' containing basic laws of physics. The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation today.  Her commentary includes a profound contribution to [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]]—the postulate of an additional [[conservation law]] for total [[energy]], of which [[kinetic energy]] of motion is one element.

Her philosophical magnum opus, ''[http://www.e-rara.ch/doi/10.3931/e-rara-3844 Institutions de Physique]'' (Paris, 1740, first edition), or ''Foundations of Physics'', circulated widely, generated heated debates, and was republished and translated into several other languages within two years of its original publication. She participated in the famous ''[[vis viva]]'' debate, concerning the best way to measure the force of a body and the best means of thinking about conservation principles. Posthumously, her ideas were heavily represented in the most famous text of the French Enlightenment, the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|Jean le Rond D'Alembert]], first published shortly after Du Châtelet's death. Numerous biographies, books and plays have been written about her life and work in the two centuries since her death. In the early 21st century, her life and ideas have generated renewed interest.

== Contribution to philosophy ==
In addition to producing famous translations of works by authors such as [[Bernard Mandeville]] and [[Isaac Newton]], Du Châtelet wrote a number of significant philosophical essays, letters and books that were well known in her time.

Because of her well-known collaboration and romantic involvement with [[Voltaire]], which spanned much of her adult life, for generations Du Châtelet has been known as mistress and collaborator to her much better known intellectual companion. Her accomplishments and achievements have often been subsumed under his, and as a result, even today she is often mentioned only within the context of Voltaire's life and work during the period of the early French Enlightenment.

Recently, however, professional philosophers and historians{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} have transformed the reception of Du Châtelet. Historical evidence indicates that Du Châtelet's work had a very significant influence on the philosophical and scientific conversations of the 1730s and 1740s – in fact, she was famous and respected by the greatest thinkers of her time.

Du Châtelet corresponded with renowned mathematicians such as [[Johann II Bernoulli]] and [[Leonhard Euler]], early developers of calculus. She was also tutored by Bernoulli's prodigy students, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] and [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]]. [[Frederick the Great|Frederick the Great of Prussia]], who re-founded the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was her great admirer, and corresponded with both Voltaire and Du Châtelet regularly. He introduced Du Châtelet to Leibniz's philosophy by sending her the works of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], and Du Châtelet sent him a copy of her ''Institutions.''

Her works were published and republished in Paris, London, and Amsterdam; they were translated into German and Italian; and, they were discussed in the most important scholarly journals of the era, including the ''[[Journal de Trévoux|Memoires des Trévoux]]'', the ''[[Journal des sçavans|Journal des Sçavans]]'', the ''[[:de:Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen|Göttingische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen]]''''',''' and others. Perhaps most intriguingly, many of her ideas were represented in various sections of the ''Encyclopédie'' of Diderot and D'Alembert, and some of the articles in the ''Encyclopédie'' are a direct copy of her work (this is an active area of current academic research - the latest research can be found at [http://projectvox.library.duke.edu/content/du-ch%C3%A2telet-1706-1749 Project Vox], a Duke University research initiative).

===Early life===
Émilie du Châtelet was born on 17 December 1706 in [[Paris]], the only girl amongst six children. Three brothers lived to adulthood: René-Alexandre (b. 1698), Charles-Auguste (b. 1701), and Elisabeth-Théodore (b. 1710). Her eldest brother, René-Alexandre, died in 1720, and the next brother, Charles-Auguste, died in 1731. However, her younger brother, Elisabeth-Théodore, lived to a successful old age, becoming an abbé and eventually a bishop. Two other brothers died very young.&lt;ref&gt;Zinsser, pp. 19, 21, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Châtelet also had an illegitimate half-sister, Michelle, who was born of her father and Anne Bellinzani, an intelligent woman who was interested in astronomy and married to an important Parisian official.&lt;ref&gt;Zinsser, pp. 16–17; for a quite different account, see Bodanis, pp. 131–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father was [[Louis Nicolas le Tonnelier de Breteuil]], a member of the lesser nobility. At the time of Du Châtelet's birth, her father held the position of the Principal Secretary and Introducer of Ambassadors to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. He held a weekly ''salon'' on Thursdays, to which well-respected writers and scientists were invited. Her mother was Gabrielle Anne de Froullay, Baronne de Breteuil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/emilie-du-chatelet/|title=Émilie du Châtelet|last=Detlefsen|first=Karen|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early education===
Du Châtelet's education has been the subject of much speculation, but nothing is known with certainty.&lt;ref name="Zinsser"&gt;Zinsser.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among their acquaintances was [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the perpetual secretary of the French [[Académie des Sciences]]. Du Châtelet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy with her when she was 10 years old.&lt;ref name=Bodanis/&gt; Du Châtelet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, was brought up in a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women.&lt;ref name=Bodanis/&gt; While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of Émilie's intellectual curiosity,&lt;ref name=Bodanis/&gt; there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of Du Châtelet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.&lt;ref name=Zinsser2629&gt;Zinsser (2006: 26–29)&lt;/ref&gt;

In either case, such encouragement would have been seen as unusual for parents of their time and status.  When she was small, her father arranged training for her in physical activities such as [[fencing]] and [[Equestrianism|riding]], and as she grew older, he brought tutors to the house for her.&lt;ref name=Bodanis/&gt; As a result, by the age of twelve she was fluent in [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[German language|German]]; she was later to publish translations into French of Greek and Latin plays and philosophy. She received education in mathematics, literature, and science. Her mother Gabrielle-Anne was horrified at her progress and fought Louis-Nicolas at every step, once attempting to have Émilie sent to a convent.&lt;ref name=Zinsser2629/&gt;

Du Châtelet's also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the [[harpsichord]], sang opera, and was an amateur actress. As a teenager, short of money for books, she used her mathematical skills to devise highly successful strategies for gambling.&lt;ref name=Bodanis/&gt;

===Marriage===
On the 12 of June 1725, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel (1910: 5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The ''Lomont'' suffix indicates the branch of the ''du Chastellet'' family; another such branch was the ''du Chastellet-Clemont''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her marriage conferred the title of Marquise du Chastellet.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The spelling ''Châtelet'' (replacing the ''s'' by a circumflex over the ''a'') was introduced by [[Voltaire]], and has now become standard. ({{cite book|last=Andrew|first=Edward |title=Patrons of enlightenment|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2006|page=101|chapter=Voltaire and his female protectors|isbn=978-0-8020-9064-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; Like many marriages among the nobility, theirs was [[Arranged marriage|arranged]].  As a wedding gift, the husband was made governor of [[Semur-en-Auxois]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] by his father; the recently married couple moved there at the end of September 1725.  Du Châtelet was eighteen at the time, her husband thirty-four.

===Children===
The Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet and Émilie du Châtelet had three children: Françoise Gabriel Pauline (born 30 June 1726), [[Louis Marie Florent du Châtelet|Louis Marie Florent]] (born 20 November 1727), and Victor-Esprit (born 11 April 1733).&lt;ref name=Zinsser_pp39_58&gt;Zinsser, pp. 39 and 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  Victor-Esprit died as an infant in late summer 1734, likely the last Sunday in August.&lt;ref name=Zinsser_pp40_93&gt;Zinsser, pp. 40 and 93.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 September 1749 Émilie du Châtelet gave birth to Stanislas-Adélaïde du Châtelet (daughter of [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert]]). She died as an infant in [[Lunéville]] on 6 May 1751.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Smith, "Nouveaux regards sur la brève rencontre entre Mme Du Châtelet et Saint-Lambert." In The Enterprise of Enlightenment. A Tribute to David Williams from his friends. Ed. Terry Pratt and David McCallam. Oxford, Berne, etc.: Peter Lang, 2004, p. 329-343. See also Anne Soprani, ed., Mme Du Châtelet, Lettres d'amour au marquis de Saint-Lambert, Paris, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resumption of studies===
In 1733, aged 26, Du Châtelet resumed her mathematical studies. Initially, she was tutored in algebra and calculus by [[Moreau de Maupertuis]], a member of the Academy of Sciences; although [[mathematics]] was not his forte, he had received a solid education from [[Johann Bernoulli]], who also taught [[Leonhard Euler]]. However by 1735 Du Châtelet had turned for her mathematical training to [[Alexis Clairaut]], a mathematical prodigy known best for [[Clairaut's equation]] and [[Clairaut's theorem]]. Du Châtelet resourcefully sought some of France's best tutors and scholars to mentor her in mathematics. On one occasion at the Café Gradot, a place where men frequently gathered for intellectual discussion, she was politely ejected when she attempted to join one of her teachers. Undeterred, she simply had some men's clothing made for herself and strolled back in drag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Women|last=Tsjeng|first=Zing|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=978 1 78840 042 8|location=|pages=156-159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Voltaire===
[[Image:Voltaire Philosophy of Newton frontispiece.jpg|thumb|right| In the frontispiece to [[Voltaire]]'s book on Newton's philosophy, du Châtelet appears as Voltaire's muse, reflecting Newton's heavenly insights down to Voltaire.]]

Du Châtelet may have met Voltaire in her childhood at one of her father's ''salons''; Voltaire himself dates their meeting to 1729, when he returned from his exile in London. However, their friendship developed from May 1733 when she re-entered society after the birth of her third child.&lt;ref name="Zinsser"/&gt;

Du Châtelet invited Voltaire to live at her country house at [[Cirey-sur-Blaise]] in [[Haute-Marne]], northeastern France, and he became her long-time companion under the eyes of her tolerant husband. There she studied physics and mathematics and published scientific articles and translations. To judge from Voltaire's letters to friends and their commentaries on each other's work, they lived together with great mutual liking and respect. As a literary rather than scientific person, Voltaire implicitly acknowledged her contributions to his 1738 ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Newton]]'', where the chapters on [[optics]] show strong similarities with her own ''Essai sur l'optique''. She was able to contribute further to the campaign by a laudatory review in the ''[[Journal des savants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=Voltaire|first=J. B.|last=Shank|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2009|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2010/entries/voltaire/}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing a passion for science, Voltaire and Du Châtelet collaborated scientifically. They set up a laboratory in Du Châtelet's home. In a healthy competition, they both entered the 1738 Paris Academy prize contest on the nature of fire, since Du Châtelet disagreed with Voltaire's essay. Although neither of them won, both essays received honourable mention and were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Émilie du Châtelet|first=Karen |last=Detlefsen|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emilie-du-chatelet/|accessdate=2014-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She thus became the first woman to have a scientific paper published by the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social life after living with Voltaire====

Du Châtelet's relationship with Voltaire caused her to give up most of her social life to become more involved with her study in mathematics with the teacher of Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis. He introduced the ideas of Isaac Newton to her. Letters written by Du Châtelet explain how she felt during the transition from Parisian socialite to rural scholar, from "one life to the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectcontinua.org/emilie-du-chatelet/|title=Emilie Du Châtelet -|website=www.projectcontinua.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final pregnancy and death===
[[File:ChateauLuneville3.jpg|thumb|right|The chateau of Lunéville]]

In May 1748, Du Châtelet began an affair with the poet [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert]] and became pregnant. In a letter to a friend she confided her fears that she would not survive her pregnancy. On the night of 4 September 1749 she gave birth to a daughter, Stanislas-Adélaïde. Du Châtelet died on 10 September 1749,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Einstein's big idea|date=2005|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61843630|others=Johnstone, Gary, 1959-, McArdle, Aidan., Henderson, Shirley, 1965-, Lithgow, John, 1945-, Bodanis, David., Darlow Smithson Productions.|publisher=WGBH Boston Video|isbn=1593753179|oclc=61843630}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lunéville]], from a [[pulmonary embolism]]. She was 42. Her daughter died 20 months later.&lt;ref&gt;Zinsser (2006: 278)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific research and publications==

===Criticizing Locke and the debate on ''thinking matter''===
In her writing, Du Châtelet criticizes John Locke's philosophy. She emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience: Locke's idea of the possibility of ''thinking matter'' is […] abstruse. Her critique on Locke originates in her Bernard de Mandeville commentary [on the ''Fable of the Bees'']. She confronts us with her resolute statement in favor of universal principles which precondition human knowledge and action, and maintains that this kind of law is innate. […] Du Châtelet claims the necessity of a universal presupposition, because if there is no such beginning, all our knowledge is relative. In that way, Du Châtelet rejects John Locke's aversion of innate ideas and a priori principles. She also reverses Locke's negation of the principle of contradiction, which would constitute the basis of her methodic reflections in the ''Institutions''. On the contrary, she affirms her arguments in favor of the necessity of a priori and universal principles. "two and two could then make as well 4 as 6" if a priori principles did not exist.{{clarify |date=March 2018 |reason= The section is confusing - some of it is due to the nature of the ideas, which are complex, but some of it appears to be quotations from Du Chatelet herself, or others about her, and it's not clear who, what is quoted, what is reported views and what is the article's text.}}

Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis' and Julien Offray de La Mettrie's reference to Du Châtelet's deliberations on motion and free will, on ''thinking matter'' and numbers and on the way to do metaphysics indicate the importance of her reflections. She rebuts the claim to finding truth by using mathematical laws, […] and argues against Maupertuis.&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8–12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat and light===
[[File:Sur La Nature et La Propagation du feu 1744.tif|thumb|right | ''Dissertation Sur La Nature et La Propagation du feu'', 1744]]
In 1737 Châtelet published a paper entitled ''Dissertation sur la nature et la propagation du feu'', based upon her research into the science of fire, that predicted what is today known as [[infrared|infrared radiation]] and the nature of light.{{Citation needed|reason=a scientific source is needed for the claim that du Chatelet anticipated infrared radiation. Her remark that 'le feu n'est pas toujours chaud et lumineux' on the basis of the observing concentrated moon light, can be understood today with our knowledge of wavelength, but I find no indication that Mme du Chatelet proposes such an interpretation. The nature of light (the particle-wave duality) is an incredibly complex matter and is unlikely to have been anticipated in the 18th century, even by such a talented scientist as Mme du Chatelet.|date=March 2018}}

===''Institutions de Physique''===
Her book ''Institutions de Physique''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.e-rara.ch/doi/10.3931/e-rara-3844|title=Institutions de physique|last=Du Châtelet|first=Gabrielle Emilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil|publisher=chez Prault fils|year=1740|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Lessons in Physics") was published in 1740; it was presented as a review of new ideas in science and philosophy to be studied by her 13 year old son, but it incorporated and sought to reconcile complex ideas from the leading thinkers of the time. The book and subsequent debate contributed to her becoming a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna]] in 1746.

===Forces Vives===
[[File:Reponse de Madame Du Chatelet 1741 RGNb10349364.04.tp.tif|thumb|right | ''Réponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet'', 1741]]
In 1741 du Châtelet published a book titled ''Réponse de Madame la Marquise du Chastelet, a la lettre que M. de Mairan''. [[Dortous de Mairan]], secretary of the Academy of Sciences, had published a set of arguments addressed to her regarding the appropriate mathematical expression for ''forces vives''. Du Châtelet presented a spirited point by point rebuttal of de Mairan's arguments causing him to withdraw from the controversy.&lt;ref name=4Cent&gt;{{cite book|last=Smeltzer|first=Ronald K.|title=Extraordinary Women in Science &amp; Medicine: Four Centuries of Achievement|year=2013|publisher=The Grolier Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immanuel Kant's first publication in 1747 'Gedanken zur wahren Schätzung der lebendigen Kräfte' focuses on Du Châtelet's pamphlet against the secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, Mairan. Kant's opponent, [[Johann Augustus Eberhard]] accused Kant of taking ideas from Du Châtelet.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Hagengruber: "Émilie du Châtelet between Leibniz and Newton: The Transformation of Metaphysics", in: Hagengruber, Ruth 2011: Émilie du Châtelet between Leibniz and Newton, Springer 1-59, p. 1 and 23, footnote 4 and 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy of kinetic energy===
Although in the early 18th century the concepts of force and [[momentum]] had been long understood, the idea of ''energy'' as transferable between different systems was still in its infancy,  and would not be fully resolved until the 19th Century. It is now accepted that the total mechanical momentum of a system is conserved and none is lost to friction. Simply put, there is no 'momentum friction' and momentum can not transfer between different forms, and particularly there is no potential momentum. [[Emmy Noether]] proved this to be true for all problems where the initial state is symmetric in generalized coordinates. Mechanical energy, kinetic and potential, may be lost to another form, but the total is conserved in time. The Du Châtelet contribution was the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of [[Gottfried Leibniz]], she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's [[kinetic energy]] - as indicated by the quantity of material displaced - was shown to be proportional to the square of the [[velocity]]. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height the balls were dropped from, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, such as [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was indistinct from [[momentum]] and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In [[classical physics]] the correct formula is &lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of an object, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; its [[mass]] and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its speed.)  Energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat…). Newton's work assumed the exact conservation of only mechanical momentum. A broad range of mechanical problems are soluble only if energy conservation is included. The collision and scattering of two point masses is one of them. [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] established a more formal framework for mechanics using the results of du Châtelet.&lt;ref name="Hagengruber 2011"&gt;Hagengruber (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arianrhod 2012"&gt;Arianrhod (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and commentary on Newton's ''Principia''===
In 1749, the year of Du Châtelet's death, she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her commentary, of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (often referred to as simply the [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']]), including her derivation of the notion of [[conservation of energy]] from its principles of mechanics. Published ten years after her death, today Du Châtelet's translation of the ''Principia'' is still the standard translation of the work into French. Indeed, her translation and commentary of the ''Principia'' also contributed to the completion of the [[scientific revolution]] in France and to its acceptance in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential Calculus Early Transcendental Functions|last=Larson, Hostetler, Edwards|publisher=Richard Stratton|year=2008|isbn=978-0-618-87918-2|location=U.S.A|pages=344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contributions==

===Development of financial derivatives===
She lost the considerable sum for the time of 84,000 francs—some of it borrowed—in one evening at the table at the Court of Fontainebleau, to card cheats.&lt;ref name=Bodanis&gt;Bodanis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamel (1910: 286)&lt;/ref&gt; To raise the money to pay back her debts she devised an ingenious financing arrangement similar to modern [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], whereby she paid tax collectors a fairly low sum for the right to their future earnings (they were allowed to keep a portion of the taxes they collected for the King), and promised to pay the court gamblers part of these future earnings.&lt;ref name=Bodanis/&gt;

===Biblical scholarship===
Du Châtelet wrote a critical analysis of the entire Bible. A synthesis of her remarks on the book of Genesis was published in English in 1967 by Ira O. Wade of Princeton in his book ''Voltaire and Madame du Châtelet: An Essay on Intellectual Activity at Cirey'' and a book of her complete notes was published in 2011, in the original French, edited and annotated by Bertram Eugene Schwarzbach.

===Discourse on happiness===
Du Châtelet wrote a monograph, ''Discours sur le bonheur'', on the nature of happiness both in general and specialised to women.

===Translation of the ''Fable of the Bees'', and other works===
Du Châtelet translated ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in a free adaptation. She also wrote works on optics, rational linguistics, and the nature of free will.

===Support of women's education===
In her first independent work, the preface to her translation of the ''Fable of the Bees'', du Châtelet argues strongly for [[women's education]], particularly a strong secondary education as was available for young men in the French ''[[collèges]]''.   By denying women a good education, she argues, society prevents women from becoming eminent in the arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=Zinsser_p25&gt;Zinsser, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Châtelet made a crucial scientific contribution in making Newton's historic work more accessible in a timely, accurate and insightful French translation, augmented by her own original concept of energy conservation.

A [[12059 du Châtelet|main-belt minor planet]] and a [[List of craters on Venus|crater on Venus]] have been named in her honor, and she is the subject of three plays: ''Legacy of Light'' by Karen Zacarías; ''Émilie: La Marquise Du Châtelet Defends Her Life Tonight'' by [[Lauren Gunderson]] and ''Urania: the Life of Émilie du Châtelet'' by Jyl Bonaguro.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140710/river-north/urania-historical-play-by-local-artist-debuts-with-free-gallery-shows ''Urania, Historical Play by Local Artist, Debuts with Free Gallery Shows''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320025602/https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140710/river-north/urania-historical-play-by-local-artist-debuts-with-free-gallery-shows |date=2016-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ''[[Émilie (opera)|Émilie]]'' of [[Kaija Saariaho]] is about the last moments of her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera-lyon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/opera_0910/Emilie/Texte_Emilie.pdf ''Libretto of Émilie''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226035831/http://www.opera-lyon.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/opera_0910/Emilie/Texte_Emilie.pdf |date=2013-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Du Châtelet is often represented in portraits with mathematical iconography, such as holding a pair of dividers or a page of geometrical calculations. In the early nineteenth century, a French pamphlet of celebrated women (''Femmes célèbres'') introduced a possibly apocryphal story of Du Châtelet's childhood.&lt;ref name=Zinsser_p13&gt;Zinsser, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this story, a servant fashioned a doll for her by dressing up wooden [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] as a doll; however, du Châtelet undressed the dividers and intuiting their purpose, made a circle with them.
