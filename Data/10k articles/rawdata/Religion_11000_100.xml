The '''Aggressive Christianity Missions Training Corps''' (abbreviated '''ACMTC'''; also known as the Holy Tribal Nation, the Free Love Ministries, or the Life Force Team) is a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]], [[Biblicist]], [[theocratic]] [[cult]]. The [[Christian ministry|ministry]], founded in 1981 by James and Deborah Green (sometimes collectively referred to as ''the Generals''; James is often called ''General James'' and sometimes ''Jim''; Deborah is referred to as ''General Deborah'', formerly ''Lila''), still retains its [[military structure]], partially based on the original pattern of the [[Salvation Army]].&lt;ref name="What We Believe"&gt;{{cite web

The organization has been classified as a [[hate group]] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].&lt;ref name="SLPC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2017/active-hate-groups-2016 |title=Active Hate Groups 2016 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=15 February 2017 |website= |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Deborah Green and her son-in-law Peter Green were arrested on charges of sexual abuse of children. Peter Green, a manager at the ministry's Fence Lake location, has been charged with 100 counts of criminal sexual penetration of a child, while Deborah Green faces charges of child abuse, negligent abuse and criminal sexual penetration. Deborah Green's son Joshua Green was also arrested and charged with failure to register the birth of his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/crime/aggressive-christianity-missing-training-corps-leaders-sex-abuse/|title=Leader of Military-Style Christian Sect in New Mexico Accused of Sexually Abusing Young Girl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwnzm/cops-accuse-christian-commune-of-smuggling-and-raping-children|title=Cops Accuse Christian Commune of Abusing and Raping Children|date=August 23, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Four other members of the ministry in New Mexico, Amos River, Victoria River, Ruth River and Timothy River, were also arrested in August 2017 on felony charges of failure to register the births of their 11 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/authorities-arrest-4-paramilitary-religious-sect-members/2017/08/24/67d8357c-8900-11e7-96a7-d178cf3524eb_story.html|title=- The Washington Post|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2017, the ACMTC is under investigation by the Children, Youth and Families Department of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/crime/aggressive-christianity-missing-training-corps-leaders-sex-abuse/|title=Leader of Military-Style Christian Sect in New Mexico Accused of Sexually Abusing Young Girl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===James Green===
James Green was born in 1945 and was raised in [[Kentucky]]. As a teenager, he hitchhiked to [[California]] where he later became involved in a [[hippie]] lifestyle and the 1960s revolution, and met Deborah.&lt;ref name="MinistryFacts"/&gt;

===Montana prayer===
During the Greens' time with the Bear Tribe in California, they went to scout out land in [[Montana]]. The Greens converted to Christianity in 1971.

===Kentucky===
James and Deborah moved to Kentucky where they started attending a local church. James soon began training for a [[Minister (Christianity)|ministerial position]]. He trained for four years under a [[pastor]].&lt;ref name="MinistryFacts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StinkingRottingCorpse"&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 2012-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a missionary journey through Central America, the Greens ended up in [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref name="MinistryFacts"/&gt;

===Salvation Army, Miami===
In the late 1970s, James and Deborah worked at the large Miami [[Salvation Army]] center, participating in inner-city mission work. ACMTC may have taken its name from a sermon by Salvation Army co-founder Catherine Booth titled "Aggressive Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gospeltruth.net/booth/cath_booth/agressive_christianity/cbooth_1_agressive.htm|title=AGGRESSIVE CHRISTIANITY: --A Sermon of Catherine Booth|website=www.gospeltruth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==
===Free Love Ministries / Life Force Team===
In the early 1980s, the Greens moved into a house in Sacramento, California. The Greens' public [[Christian ministry|ministry]] started out as the Greens taking people in, as well as printing and distributing [[Gospel tracts]]. ACMTC eventually secured more houses and started using the name "Free Love Ministries". 

===Lawsuit===
In 1988, Maura Schmierer and several others filed a lawsuit against Free Love Ministries for abusive treatment, asking for 20 million dollars in [[damages]].&lt;ref name="Mother of 3 sues cult- tells of life in shed"&gt;{{cite news
  | first = Trinda
 | last = Pasquet
 | title = Mother of 3 sues cult- tells of life in shed
 | publisher = The Sacramento Union
 | date = 1988-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Greens lost the case by not appearing in court and went on the run from the law.  The court ordered ACMTC to pay Schmierer $1.02 million. After losing the lawsuit, all buildings they owned were seized by the court. The ministry destroyed the buildings, left Sacramento and settled in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]], and added another ministry name, "Death Force Team".&lt;ref name="Jodi Hernandez"&gt;[http://www.nbcbayarea.com/station/about-us/Jodi_Hernandez.html] Jodi Hernandez.

 | title = 'Soldiers of God' have New Mexico town abuzz
 | publisher = El Paso Times
 | date = 1995-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MinistryFacts"/&gt; 

In 1993, ACMTC secured an old school building in Berino, and established another camp in [[Gallup, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Soldiers of God"/&gt;

==Beliefs and practices==
===Primary beliefs===
In their 1987 "Responsibilities of Command" officer's manual, the ministry states its beliefs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We Believe:
  In the divine inspiration of the Bible (2nd Tim. 3:16).
  That in the One God there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost (1 John 5:7).
  That Jesus Christ is the Lord God Almighty, Creator of all things (John 1:1-3, 14, 29-34; Rev. 1:5, 6)
  In the virgin birth (Luke 1:26-35)
  That Jesus Christ died for our sins (Hebrews 9:15, 22, 28).
  In the baptism of the Holy Ghost with evidence of speaking tongues (Acts 2:4).
  All the supernatural gifts (healing, miracles, deliverance, tongues etc.), and practicing them (1 Cor. 12).&lt;ref name="Command"&gt;{{cite book
  | title = Responsibilities of Command
 | publisher = Free Love Ministries
 | date = 1987-01-01
 | page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ministry also states its spiritual beliefs that can be found in some of the earliest writings done in 1986 by James Green,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) His grace is demonstrated that we might be free from captivity, but this freedom is to be used for and unto His ultimate intention.
(2) God always asks that which is impossible to the natural man in order that His people will be dependent upon divine, spiritual resources.
(3) God designs all things to function properly under His control. He is not content to merely set us free, but longs to "turn our capacity"; that is, He longs to bring us back into His captivity.
(4) Man must either submit to God's purpose or become captive to some other law. God's plan will not allow us to live long in liberty apart from law.
(5) God's pattern is not spurts of consecration and dedication, but a consistent walk leading into a continuous unfolding revelation of His plan and purpose.&lt;ref name="What We Believe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Command"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In the media==

Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps has been described as a cult.

Apologetics Index says of the group:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While it presents itself as a Christian movement it has a number of un-biblical and extra-biblical teachings, including several that militate against the Bible’s teachings on grace. It has an elitist view of itself and its members. It encourages unreasonable corporal punishment for children, and reported prevents members from seeking medical aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apologetics Index|title=Aggressive Christianity Missions Training Corps|url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/2743-aggressive-christianity-mission-training-corps|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1989, Jodi Hernandez was part of a group of newspeople that reported on the Aggressive Christians from March to September through [[KOVR|KOVR-TV, CBS channel 13]] [[Sacramento]]. &lt;ref name="Jodi Hernandez"/&gt;

In December 1999, [[Darren White (politician)|Darren White]], former secretary of the Department of Public Safety for [[New Mexico]], and then reporter for [[KRQE|KRQE, CBS channel 13]], [[Albuquerque]], reported on the Greens.

On November 4, 2005, Jim Maniaci, of the Gallup Independent's [[Cibola County, New Mexico|Cibola County]] Bureau in [[Grants, New Mexico|Grants]], reported that a co-leader of a religious group was jailed on an aggravated battery with a deadly weapon charge. &lt;ref&gt;Maniaci, Jim. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060202101554/http://www.gallupindependent.com/2005/nov/110405bndsout.html "Religious leader bonds out"]. ''Gallup Independent''. November 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2006, Annie McCormick of [[KRQE|KRQE, CBS channel 13]], Albuquerque, also investigated the Greens with reports from former members and families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anniemccormick.com/] Annie McCormick, KRQE, CBS channel 13, Albuquerque.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, [[National Geographic Channel]] featured Maura Schmierer and her daughter Rebekah's accounts with the group. &lt;ref&gt;Kiger, Patrick J. [http://tvblogs.nationalgeographic.com/2012/04/09/i-escaped-a-cult-inside-the-greens/ "I Escaped a Cult – Inside the Greens"]. National Geographic Channel TVblogs. April 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 2, episode 4 of ''Dangerous Persuasions'' on Investigation Discover Channel tells Maura Schmierer's story. It is currently (2015) available on Amazon Video.

'''Atrocitus''' ('''Atros''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic books]] published by the [[DC Comics]]. Atrocitus is an enemy of the [[Guardians of the Universe]] and [[Sinestro]], their former [[Green Lantern]].

==Publication history==
Atrocitus first appears in ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' vol. 4 #25 in a two-page "War of Light" spread and was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]].&lt;ref name="gl25"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #25 (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Green Lantern: Secret Origin===
When the rogue [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] rampaged through Space Sector 666 Atros was one of only five beings in the entire sector to escape death, having been forced to witness his own wife and daughters killed by one of the rampaging robots.&lt;ref name="rl1"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #1 (September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Renaming himself "Atrocitus", he and the other four survivors formed a terrorist cabal known as the Five Inversions, bent on the destruction of the [[Guardians of the Universe]] and all who served them, with Atrocitus serving as their leader. The Five Inversions performed a ritual which allowed them to peer into the future and discover the prophecy of the [[Blackest Night]], which decreed that all life in the universe would end. Forming an "Empire of Tears", the Inversions attempted to destroy the Guardians, but were defeated and imprisoned on the planet [[Ysmault]].&lt;ref name="gl33"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #33 (July 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some time later, [[Abin Sur]] began making periodic visits to Ysmault, and began to ask questions regarding the Blackest Night.&lt;ref name="gl29"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #29 (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Sur even went so far as to free Atrocitus from his imprisonment so that he could lead the Green Lantern to Earth, the prophesied birthplace of "the black" that would one day end the universe. Taken to Earth by starship (due to fellow Inversion Qull predicting that Sur's ring would one day fail him when he most needed it) and bound by energy restraints created by Sur's ring, Atrocitus instilled fear in his captor, allowing the [[Parallax (comics)|yellow impurity]] to seep into his willpower constructs and weaken them enough to allow him to break free. After slashing the Green Lantern in the chest, mortally wounding him, Atrocitus jumped from a point high in Earth's atmosphere to escape Sur's failing ship.&lt;ref name="gl30"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #30 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

After landing near an airbase, and killing an unspecified number of Air Force troopers, Atrocitus recited what would later become the oath of the Red Lantern Corps, and performed a ritual that told him the name of the herald of the Blackest Night: [[Black Hand (comics)|William Hand]].&lt;ref name="gl32"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #32 (June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocitus created a device using stolen gun parts that acted as a cosmic divining rod, and used it to lead him to Hand. Once he tracked down the human who, it was said, would play a prominent role in the coming of the Blackest Night, he attacked, and planned to take Hand's innards back to Ysmault. Before his plan proceeded, however, Sinestro and rookie Green Lantern Hal Jordan intercepted him, spiriting William Hand to safety. Atrocitus used his newly constructed device to sap the power from their [[Power ring (DC Comics)|rings]], leaving them with only their wits to defend them from the master of the Five Inversions.&lt;ref name="gl33"/&gt; Sinestro was able to restore their rings' powers through his power battery, but Atrocitus still had the upper hand. Just as he was about to crush Sinestro with a power shovel, Jordan used his ring to blow up the yellow vehicle, which surprised Atrocitus greatly, as he believed Green Lantern rings did not work on anything colored yellow. Defeated, Atrocitus was contained by Sinestro, and brought to [[Oa]].&lt;ref name="gl34"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #34 (August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He was later returned to Ysmault by Sinestro, where he prophesied that Sinestro's home planet Korugar would soon erupt into chaos and disorder.&lt;ref name="gl35"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #35 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Through this act, it was implied that it was Atrocitus who planted the seeds of Sinestro's later fall from grace.

===Rage of the Red Lanterns===
{{see also|Final Crisis}}
In the aftermath of the ''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'', Atrocitus was seen forging a Red Lantern power battery, utilizing the power of rage. He said that his first new victim would be the one who called himself "the greatest Green Lantern": Sinestro, who had long since abandoned the Green Lantern Corps to forge a Corps in [[Sinestro Corps|his own namesake]]. He also murdered Qull of the Five Inversions, a fellow member of the Empire of Tears and the one responsible for telling Abin Sur the prophecy of the Blackest Night (which caused the Guardians of the Universe to continue the Empire of Tears' incarceration on Ysmault, rather than transfer them to Oa's sciencells, closer to the enemies of the Five Inversions), by bludgeoning him with the power battery. In this way, the first power battery was christened with blood.&lt;ref name="gl28"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #28 (March 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Atrocitus murdered the other members of the Five Inversions, using their blood to create red power rings, power batteries, and a Red Central Power Battery on Ysmault. Atrocitus soon donned his new red power ring, becoming the first Red Lantern. He recruited many other individuals from across the universe who possessed great anger and hate, including former Green Lantern [[Laira (comics)|Laira]]. Many of them had been wronged by the Sinestro Corps, and Atrocitus promises them that the [[Red Lantern Corps]] will eradicate Sinestro himself. He led his new corps in an assault against Sinestro while he was being transferred by some members of the Green Lantern Corps from the Oan Sciencells to his home planet of Korugar for execution.

The Red Lanterns interrupted a deadly fight between Sinestro's forces and the Green Lanterns, killing members of both sides without discrimination. Atrocitus personally slew the long-standing Green Lantern Remnant Nod. Eventually Sinestro was captured and taken to Ysmault for execution, and Hal Jordan, who had faced Atrocitus before, was left for dead in space.&lt;ref name="fcrl"&gt;''Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns'' one-shot (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; After bringing Sinestro to Ysmault, Atrocitus nailed the former Green Lantern to a cross to await his execution at his own hands. However, unlike the Guardians, who preferred a quick execution, Atrocitus wished to make Sinestro suffer first by taking revenge on everything he has ever cared about. His targets included Korugar, and Sinestro's previously unknown and hidden daughter, whose identity Atrocitus had learned through his blood prophecies.&lt;ref name="gl36"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #36 (December 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hal Jordan and the [[Blue Lantern Corps|Blue Lanterns]] arrived to recover Sinestro, Atrocitus revealed another prophecy to Jordan: that the Guardians will one day take his greatest love, and he will become a renegade once again because of their actions. Although Sinestro believes that Atrocitus' prophecy could be a form of [[reverse psychology]] to instill fear in Jordan of his [[Emerald Twilight|past actions]] under the influence of [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]]. After rescuing Sinestro, the Blue Lanterns began to leave, but Jordan wanted to go back for Laira, whom Sinestro killed to save Jordan. In a burst of outrage, Jordan prepared to carry out Sinestro's death sentence himself, against the wishes of the Blue Lanterns. The rage that Jordan felt drew Laira's red ring to him, converting Jordan into the newest member of the Red Lantern Corps.&lt;ref name="gl37"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #37 (January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan attacked the Blue Lanterns and Sinestro, until Saint Walker managed to get a Blue power ring onto his finger. The blue ring negated the effects of the red ring, restoring Jordan to normal. Jordan then attacked Atrocitus, using the power of the blue and green rings to make the red one explode in his face. Defeated, the Red Lanterns retreated to the dark side of Ysmault, where Atrocitus performed another blood ritual, seeking to discover the location of the Blue Lanterns' homeworld.&lt;ref name="gl38"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #38 (January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackest Night===
{{main|Blackest Night}}
During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] the [[List of Green Lanterns#The Lost Lanterns|Lost Lanterns]] came to Ysmault to retrieve Laira's body, but were opposed by Atrocitus and the Red Lanterns. During the conflict, several [[Black Lantern Corps|black power rings]] descended onto Ysmault, reanimating the bodies of Laira and Atrocitus' fellow Inversions.&lt;ref name="gl45"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #45 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The reanimated Qull ripped out Atrocitus' heart; However, because Red Lantern rings effectively replace their wearer's hearts, the attack did not kill Atrocitus.

Atrocitus later appeared on Okaara to steal [[Larfleeze]]'s power battery.&lt;ref name="gl47"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #47 (October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Hal Jordan]], [[Carol Ferris]], [[Sinestro]], [[Blue Lantern Corps|Saint Walker]], [[Ganthet]], [[Sayd]], and [[Indigo Tribe|Indigo-1]], save the two from Black Lanterns and stop Atrocitus. He was then brought back to Ryut, where his rage subsided into grief for his lost world. He agreed to help in the fight against the Black Lanterns, but promised to kill the Guardians when the conflict was over.&lt;ref name="gl48"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #48 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Black Lantern central power battery to Earth, the Corps leaders combined their lights to form the white light of creation, which, despite Indigo-1's claims, failed to destroy the battery, instead making the [[Nekron|force behind it]] stronger.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Ganthet then duplicated the leader's rings, in an attempt to bolster their forces. The duplicate of Atrocitus' ring found its way to [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], temporarily inducting her into the Red Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #6 (December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; When the Corps leaders and their deputies were being attacked by a Black Lantern [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], Atrocitus senses the spirit's true nature despite being influenced by the black ring; an embodiment of rage and vengeance. Atrocitus desires to harness the Spectre's powers for his vendettas against the Guardians after the spirit is free from the Black Lantern Corps.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #50 (January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; When Parallax frees the Spectre, Atrocitus attempts to convert him into his own rage entity, but fails, the Spectre warning him that the true rage entity is not to be trifled with.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #51 (February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brightest Day===
{{main|Brightest Day}}
Following the defeat of the Black Lanterns, Atrocitus returns to Ysmault, and is soon after approached by Ganthet and [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], who ask him to join them in an as-yet unidentified mission.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #53 (April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his utter hatred for the Guardians, Atrocitus agrees, sending the Red Lantern Bleez to assist Guy.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors'' #1 (August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime later, he appeared in New York City with the feline Red Lantern Corps member, [[Red Lantern Corps#Prominent members|Dex-Starr]] in search of the emotional spectrum entities. They killed several criminals in the subway, while sparing the remaining riders in the subway car. When he performed his blood ritual, it revealed to him the location of the entities except for Ion and Parallax. Hal, Carol and Sinestro confronted Atrocitus for his murderous actions as he finished the ritual; however, Atrocitus justified them by claiming they did what they did to protect innocents. Carol confirmed Atrocitus' sincerity by detecting a spark of love in his heart with her powers that was not there during their previous encounter, only to have her words ignite his anger. Enraged, Atrocitus blasts the trio out of the subway, and engages in combat. During the brawl, it is revealed that Atrocitus has learned how to create constructs with his powers. Their fight is then interrupted as [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] makes an appearance, incapacitating Hal.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #54 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The Lanterns join together to fight off Lobo, with Atrocitus revealing that he is on Earth to stop the being who is capturing the Emotional entities. It is later revealed that Atrocitus had hired Lobo to attack him, in order to gain the others trust.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #55 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; During his search for the Rage Entity, known as the Butcher, Atrocitus incinerates a prison bus full of murderers, claiming that "Those who take life do not deserve it."&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #58 (October 2010 )&lt;/ref&gt;

Atrocitus locates the Butcher, who is about to possess a man whose daughter had been killed by a death row inmate. Despite the Spectre's attempts to stop it, the Butcher succeeds, killing the criminal. The Butcher then attempts to possess Atrocitus, revealing that Atrocitus had a wife and children who were killed in the Manhunters' attack. With the Spectre's help, Atrocitus wards off the Butcher and imprisons it within his power battery. The Spectre attempts to judge the man that the Butcher possessed, but Atrocitus argues that his method of judgment is flawed. The Spectre calls off his judgment, and is unable to judge Atrocitus, discovering that his mission is a "holy" one.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #61 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

He returns to Jordan and the other New Guardians (Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris, Sinestro, Larfleeze/Agent Orange, Saint Walker, Indigo-1, and himself) just as a robed figure gained the upper hand in their fight. Catching him off guard with a burst of his napalm-acidic blood, Atrocitus vented his long suppressed rage against the Guardians upon [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], knowing of his [[Maltus (comics)|Maltus]] origins and how he was once connected to the Guardians of the Universe. Without the rage entity to control Atrocitus' powers, Krona fell victim to his attack as the Red Lantern viciously bites him in the jugular. Using the [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]] entity to counterattack, Krona used Ophidian to disrupt the New Guardians from fighting back (including Atrocitus). Learning that Atrocitus had trapped the Butcher inside of his lantern, Krona exorcized the rage entity from its prison, and made him his own. Atrocitus and the New Guardians were utterly defeated, and once again stuck together to find Krona using Larfleeze to track down the avarice entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #62 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the Green Lanterns===
Atrocitus and the rest of the New Guardians make their way to Ryut, where Larfleeze has detected Ophidian. [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and the entities are nowhere to be found but the group does come upon the Book of the Black. Inside they discover that it was Krona who purposefully reprogrammed the Manhunters to wipe out all life in Sector 666.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #63 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocitus reveals that he already knew this. Former [[Sinestro Corps]] member [[Lyssa Drak]] appears and quickly subdues the New Guardians trapping all but Hal in the Book of the Black.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #64 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hal meets up with Guy Gardner at the "Green House", Guy reveals the pact made between him, Ganthet, and Atrocitus. It is revealed that part of the pact was that once Krona had been defeated he would be turned over to Atrocitus to face justice. Hal told Guy that this most likely means executing Krona.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors'' #8 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In the final battle, Atrocitus is freed from the book by [[Kyle Rayner]], and his red ring returns to him. Although outraged at losing the chance to kill Krona due to Hal Jordan, Atrocitus is unable to vent his fury, as the Guardians of the Universe teleport him back home.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #67 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Atrocitus was confronted by Ganthet, who brings Krona's corpse to him to do what he wishes.&lt;ref&gt;''War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath'' #2 (August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Lanterns===
Following his return to Ysmault, Atrocitus feels his rage dimming, and fears that he may lose control over the Red Lantern hordes. Using Krona's innards to perform a blood ritual, Atrocitus sees many acts of evil across the universe. He resolves to lead his Red Lanterns in punishing the guilty.&lt;ref name="rl1"/&gt; However, feeling his control over the rampaging, animalistic Red Lanterns dimming, he also decides to uplift one of them to be his equal and helper.&lt;ref name="rl2"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #2 (October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; He settles for Bleez, restoring her mind and naming her his new right-hand.&lt;ref name="rl3"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #3 (November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed that he has kept Krona's corpse as a 'confidant', talking to the body when he needs to give voice to his feelings about the [[Red Lantern Corps]] and his plans to upgrade their intelligence. However, after granting intellects to three additional Red Lanterns to act as a check to Bleez, Atrocitus returns to the place where he has left Krona's body only to find it gone.&lt;ref name="rl4"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #4 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Atrocitus attempts to find Krona's body, he is left to consider both the worrying possibility that Krona has come back to life&lt;ref name="rl5"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #5 (January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and, when faced with a revolt from Bleez, Atrocitus starts to wonder if the loss of Krona's body has robbed him of the focus of his rage, as he has begun to try and justify his actions where he used to consider his mere identity enough of a justification.&lt;ref name="rl6"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #6 (February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly regains his focus and unbridled rage when he discovers how Krona did not resurrect: instead Abysmus, one of his early experiments at creating life by the use of necromancy and shamanic rituals, had stolen Krona's body, eaten and flayed him and used his skin to empower himself and similar demonic creatures, known as the Abysmorphs. Abysmus and the Abysmorphs manage to overpower Atrocitus, wounding him grievously, causing Atrocitus to summon John Moore, the new backup Red Lantern of the sector 2814.&lt;ref name="rl7"&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #7 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning that Kyle is attempting to acquire the power of the seven Corps, Atrocitus agrees to train Kyle to harness the red ring of rage to use that power against the Guardians. He attempts to provoke Kyle's rage by reminding him of the death of his girlfriend Alex after he got the ring, but when this fails (Kyle instead feels grief rather than anger), he takes Kyle to witness a group of people being threatened and executed in another country, Kyle's anger at this provoking the activation of the red power within him.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: New Guardians'' #13 (October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

During a confrontation with the First Lantern, Atrocitus is shown a world where the massacre of Sector 666 never took place, but witnesses a life where he became a brutal dictator after overthrowing his world's government, even killing his wife before he is finally killed by his own son. Horrified at this vision, Atroctius rejects the First Lantern's 'offer' to make that world the reality, believing that even the loss of his entire sector is better than being killed by his own son. Although he briefly orders the other Red Lanterns to kill him as he blames himself for the massacre,&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #18 (March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocitus later decides to use this experience to reconnect with the rage that drives his Corps, and leads them in the final assault against the First Lantern,&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #19 (April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; which culminates in him killing one of the last Guardians of the Universe&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #20 (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; after a Parallax-possessed Sinestro kills the others.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 5 #20 (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of ''Wrath of The First Lantern'', Atrocitus loses his ring to Guy Gardner, who has been recruited by Hal Jordan as a mole, and has his severely beaten body to be carried away by Dex-Starr.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #21 (June 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; After drifting in space for a while, he manages to merge with the Butcher, the red light living embodiment of rage&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #23 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; which he then loses to Kyle Rayner during the fight against Relic.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #24 (October 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocitus and Dex-Starr then find another feral Red Lantern,&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #25 (November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; kill it and take its ring.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #26 (December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; He then captures Rankorr&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #27 (January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and forces a bug inside him to make him feral. He then poisons the blood on Ysmult&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #32 (June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and using a second lake on Styge Prime he creates hundreds of rings and sends them to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #33 (July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; He then uses these new formed reds from Earth to fight Guy Gardner,&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns Annual'' #1 (July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; but Gardner bears him by proving his rage greater than Atrocitus' and takes away his ring along with Dex-Starr's and all the new formed red's as well. Although it is presumed he is dead, Gardner still refers to him as alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Red Lanterns'' #34 (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
In [[DC Rebirth]], Atrocitus resumes his reign over the Red Lanterns. He begins by enacting the prophecy of the Red Dawn on Earth. To do this, he began infecting humanity with rage and constructed a Hell Tower.&lt;ref&gt;Green Lanterns #1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Atrocitus wields a Red Lantern [[Red Lantern Corps#Powers and abilities|power ring]] similar to that of a [[Green Lantern]]'s, except it is powered by rage rather than willpower. The full extent of a red power ring's powers has not been revealed, but it is stated in ''Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns'' that the red ring acts as their heart and pumps their rage-tainted blood out of their body through their mouth. While initially unable to do so, Atrocitus learned to create red light constructs after observing the other lanterns during the Blackest Night. It is also shown&lt;ref name="gl36"/&gt; that the ring's red energy corrupts the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]s of other power rings and burns them away, possibly corrupting the ring beyond the ability of a Lantern to use. Unlike the other members of the Red Lantern Corps, whose rings reduce them to being mindless raging beasts, leaving them unable to create and maintain energy constructs as do Green and Blue Lanterns, Atrocitus is in full control of his mental faculties while wearing his ring and may not be affected in the same manner. However, the Red Lantern's corruptive energy can be overcome and purified by the Blue Lantern's energies.&lt;ref name="fcrl"/&gt; Atrocitus can deliberately override the corruptive influence of the red energy on his followers by using his magic, but never chooses to do so.&lt;ref name="rl3"/&gt;

Atrocitus possesses superhuman strength and durability; strong enough to toss a 14+ ton construction digger and durable enough to withstand knife attacks.&lt;ref name="gl31"&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #31 (April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Atrocitus' association with the Empire of Tears granted him a great deal of [[shamanistic]] magic, which he used to forge the Red Lantern rings and divine the location of William Hand.&lt;ref name="gl32"/&gt;

Atrocitus is highly intelligent, able to construct the energy-draining device later used by Black Hand from simple gun and computer parts.&lt;ref name="gl33"/&gt; Before the Manhunters destroyed sector 666, Atrocitus was a psychologist.&lt;ref name="rl1"/&gt;

==Other versions==

===Flashpoint===
In the alternate timeline of the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, dialogue states that Atrocitus, though still a Red Lantern, succeeded in killing William Hand, unleashing [[Nekron]] and the Black Lanterns. For this, Atrocitus was captured and crucified on planet Ysmault. Atrocitus is later visited by Sinestro (still a Green Lantern in this timeline), who had hoped to understand the meaning of the "Flashpoint".&lt;ref&gt;''Flastpoint: Abin Sur - The Green Lantern'' #1 (June 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocitus tells the "Flashpoint" prophecy is a moment when all of history will be changed and the "[[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]" who changed history and use his power to reset the universe to what he believes it should be. Sinestro killed him after what Atrocitus told him.&lt;ref&gt;''Flastpoint: Abin Sur - The Green Lantern'' #2 (July 2011). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* Atrocitus appears in ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]], where he serves as one of the main antagonists. Due to the animated series using CGI, his design was partially simplified for the show, giving him a more smooth, organic look with a scar on his face. He seeks vengeance against the Green Lanterns and particularly the [[Guardians of the Universe]] for the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]]' massacre of Space Sector 666, also known as "the Forgotten Zone" in the series. He devises a plan for the Red Lantern armada to use special planet-killing explosive devices called "Liberators" to blast through an asteroid belt protecting [[Oa]]. This incarnation is willing to destroy entire worlds in the name of "liberation" from the Guardians, and is willing to manipulate others into becoming his soldiers. He is eventually revealed to have murdered Razer's wife in hopes of making Razer his eventual successor. In the episode "Homecoming", when Jordan volunteers to help Atrocitus repair the damage done by the Manhunters, he responds by saying the only way to repair the damage is to kill the Guardians himself, though he is defeated by Jordan. He later reappears in "Love is a Battlefield", in which he is freed from his prison and given his ring back by Aya to be her champion of hate. Aya's offer is his freedom by killing [[Carol Ferris]]. While battling Carol, she uses her Star Sapphire ring to summon Hal Jordan and together they defeat him. In the episode "Larfleeze", Razer mentions that the Orange Lanterns once fought Atrocitus to a standstill and he was never able to conquer their territory.
* Atrocitus appears in the ''[[Justice League Action]]'' episode "Rage of the Red Lanterns", voiced by [[Michael Dorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blogofoa.com/2016/06/more-star-trek-alums-join-justice.html?platform=hootsuite |title=More Star Trek alums join Justice League Action (Exclusive) |publisher=The Blog of OA |date=2016-06-06 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He leads the Red Lantern Corps into pursuing the culprit who stole three newly-forged Red Lantern Rings. The culprit turned out to be Lobo who orchestrates events that led to the Red Lantern Corps fighting against Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Cyborg. Upon Lobo getting his hands on the Spider Gauntlet and attacking both sides, Superman tells Atrocitus that both sides need to work together to fight Lobo. Atrocitus agrees to the terms. After Lobo is defeated, Atrocitus reclaims the three Red Lantern Rings and departs with the Red Lantern Corps back to their base.

As Abin Sur takes him to prison, he warns him about his death and of a dire prophecy in which [[Sinestro]] betrays the [[Green Lantern Corps]], discovers the [[Parallax (comics)|yellow element]], and forms the [[Sinestro Corps]]. Abin Sur however refuses to believe in Atrocitus' words and leaves him.

* Atrocitus appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Ike Amadi]]. He is first shown having been captured by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] to fuel his shrink ray. After the device is disabled, he is sent back to Ysmault. The heroes arrive, fight the [[Red Lantern Corps]], and distract Atrocitus long enough for [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] to sneak away a few Red Lantern power cores. Angrier than usual, he joins with [[Sinestro]] and [[Larfleeze]] to get their power cores back in the final level, only to Superman focus his and the other Lanterns' energies in a duplicated crystal to shrink Earth back to its normal size, causing him to be teleported back to Ysmault again.

* Atrocitus appears as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', with Ike Amadi reprising the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160608005497/en/Warner-Bros.-Interactive-Entertainment-Announces-Injustice-2 |title=Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment Announces Injustice 2 |publisher=Business Wire |date=2016-06-08 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, Atrocitus arrives in Atlantis looking for Hal Jordan and seeking to turn him into a member of the Red Lantern Corps as vengeance for the time he was still a member of the Sinestro Corps, whose oppression threatened his home planet. Atrocitus tried to use Jordan's rage to secure his goal. Thanks to Hal's strong willpower, he is able to overcome his anger and defeat Atrocitus who returns to [[Ysmault]]. In Atrocitus' ending, his victory over Brainiac unintentionally destroys every city the Coluan collected, which enhances the rage of the Red Lantern Corps to an uncontrollable level. They attack him, but Atrocitus is saved by the [[Indigo Tribe|compassion entity, Proselyte]]. Coming to the realization that balance is necessary to uphold justice, Atrocitus creates a united army of all the Lanterns so as to punish the guilty and offer mercy to those who deserve it.
* Atrocitus appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.

'''Aumism''' is a minor religious sect founded in 1969 by Gilbert Bourdin (1924-1998). Centered on the "holy city" of Mandarom, near [[Castellane]] in the French Alps, it has approximately 400 members, down from 1200 at its peak. It is a synthesis of a number of religions, notably [[buddhism]]. Its name derives from the mystical "[[Om|aum]]" sound used in Hindu meditation.

==Bourdin==
Gilbert Bourdin (1924-1998), also known as Hamsah Manarah self-proclaimed "Cosmoplanetary Messiah of Synthesis" founded the movement in 1969 after immersing himself in many oriental religions.

==Mandarom==
The holy city of Mandarom Shambhasalem was founded in 1969, about 50 kilometres northwest of [[Cannes]]. Bourdin progressively built a number of temples and statues. Amongst these is a 22-metre statue of Buddha Maitreya, constructed in 1981, and a 21-metre statue of "Cosmic Christ" wielding a sword and shield, constructed in 1987. In 1990, a 33-metre statue of Bourdin was constructed at Mandarom. The legitimacy of the building permit was later challenged, and eventually, in June 2000, the statue was deemed illegal after a long legal dispute.&lt;ref name=Earth&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1528231.stm "French guru crashes to earth"], BBC News, 6 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it was demolished by the authorities on 6 September 2001.&lt;ref name=Earth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Boinet, [http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14070&amp;sec=55&amp;con=2 "Statue of Cult Leader Destroyed"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Associated Press (WorldWide Religious News), 6 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmo&gt;Pierre Thebault, [http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=14041&amp;sec=55&amp;con=2 "'Cosmoplanetary' French statue plunges to earth"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Reuters (WorldWide Religious News), 6 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The sect denounced the demolition of Bourdin's statue, saying that it was comparable to the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] by the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=Earth/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmo/&gt;

'''Brenda Chenowith''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' played by [[Rachel Griffiths]]. She was first introduced in the pilot, and remained until the series finale.

==Character biography==
===Prior to the pilot===
Brenda is the oldest daughter of a wealthy [[psychiatrist]], Bernard Chenowith, and [[psychologist]] Margaret Chenowith. During her childhood, Brenda's parents were sexually open to their children, along with being promiscuous, often deviating from their respective marital partner. Also during her childhood, Brenda was discovered to have an IQ of 185, and, as a result, was the subject of a study by psychiatrist Gareth Feinberg, published as the best-selling book ''Charlotte Light and Dark'', a book that would repeatedly haunt Brenda throughout her life. In fact, as a child Brenda realized she was being observed and began studying mental disorders and would fake symptoms to spite the doctors. At one point in her life, Brenda planned on attending [[Yale University]], but opted to remain at home in California and attend [[UCLA]] when her troubled brother, Billy, ostensibly attempted suicide.

===During the series===
Brenda is first seen exiting the [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles airport]] with [[Nate Fisher]]. The two have sex in a janitor's closet before Nate receives news that his father has died. The two part ways but continue their sexual relationship.&lt;ref name="Pilot"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pilot |series=Six Feet Under|serieslink=Six Feet Under (TV series) |credits=[[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] (director, writer) |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=2001-06-03 |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is now a [[shiatsu]] [[Massage therapy|massage therapist]], operating out of her home. Her relationship with Nate continues to grow more serious until Billy emotionally invades her relationship. Billy is a photographer who is often in and out of [[mental institutions]]. He exhibits extreme possessiveness over Brenda and even begins [[stalking]] her and Nate. The two share matching [[tattoos]] on their lower backs, Brenda's baring the name Nathaniel, Billy's being Isabel. These names are taken from their favorite childhood book series ''Nathaniel and Isabel''. Billy's obsession with Brenda eventually spirals out of control when he quits taking his medication and removes his tattoo by cutting his skin off. He attempts to remove Brenda's tattoo before she knocks him unconscious and has him institutionalized.

The next summer Brenda decides to return to college and begins the process of writing a novel. Her attraction to Nate has dwindled and she soon finds herself fantasizing about men outside of her relationship. Nonetheless, she proposes to Nate mid-season, and opts to stay with him, despite his admitting to a brain condition that may cause him to have a [[stroke]] at any time. Sex with Nate has all but subsided when Brenda begins a friendship with a client who is a [[prostitute]]. Brenda finds herself inspired by her new friend and eventually performs a [[handjob]] on one of her clients. Brenda then begins having more random encounters with men outside of her relationship with Nate until it escalates into [[Nymphomania|sexual addiction]]. Later Nate admits that he cheated on Brenda with Lisa, an old friend from Seattle, and the infidelity resulted in Lisa becoming [[pregnant]]. Brenda begins having sex in public areas, attending sex-themed parties and inviting strangers into her home. She details all of these accounts in her novel and Nate eventually discovers that Brenda's writings are not fictional. The two argue before Nate ends the engagement and storms off. Nate and Brenda have one last meeting, Brenda admits her sexual addiction and asks Nate if she can be there when he undergoes brain surgery. He refuses. Brenda packs up her things and leaves her home.

Brenda is next seen returning to [[Los Angeles]] after a lengthy absence. The reason for her return is initially unknown, but Brenda seems to be fully cured of her addictions. She makes amends with Nate, but discovers that he is now married to Lisa.&lt;ref name="The Trap"&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Trap |series=Six Feet Under|serieslink=Six Feet Under (TV series) |credits=[[Jeremy Podeswa]] (director) and [[Bruce Eric Kaplan]] (writer) |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=2003-03-30 |season=3 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Brenda's father dies of cancer, three months after being diagnosed. Nate attends the funeral with his new daughter, Maya, much to Lisa's chagrin.&lt;ref name="Timing and Space"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Timing and Space |series=Six Feet Under|serieslink=Six Feet Under (TV series) |credits=[[Nicole Holofcener]] (director) and [[Craig Wright (playwright)|Craig Wright]] (writer) |network=[[HBO]] |airdate=2003-04-13 |season=3 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brenda is staying with her mother, but soon moves out and moves in with Billy, however, she quickly departs from Billy's when he attempts to kiss her. She begins a friendship with Joe, a man who lives across the courtyard from her at her new apartment complex. Things grow complicated when Nate and Brenda share a kiss and even more complicated when Lisa goes missing without a trace. During this time, Brenda assists Nate's sister, Claire, in receiving an [[abortion]]. Lisa eventually turns up dead and Nate shows up at Brenda's doorstep badly beaten.

By this point, Brenda and Joe have developed a relationship. Things escalate quickly and the two move in together and begin trying to have a child. Brenda reverts to old habits when she begins sleeping with Nate out of fear of committing to Joe. She admits to sleeping with another man to Joe, and the two attempt to stay together despite Brenda's infidelity. Joe walks in on Brenda and Nate about to have sex and breaks it off with Brenda, permanently. Shortly after, she and Nate get back together and Nate moves in with her. Brenda becomes a surrogate mother to Maya but still desires a child of her own. Nate shows little interest in having another child. Lisa's sister, Barbara, shows considerable distaste in Brenda assisting Nate in raising Maya and eventually learns that Nate may have filled Lisa's [[urn]] with different ashes. She threatens to take Maya away, but it is revealed that her husband may be linked to Lisa's death before he [[Suicide|shoots himself]]. Following these events, Nate proposes that he and Brenda get married and have a child.

Brenda soon becomes pregnant, but [[Miscarriage|miscarries]] the day before her wedding to Nate. She opts to continue with the wedding, but soon begins to have doubts if she will ever be able to have the normal family she desires, due to her past indiscretions. Brenda begins work as a therapist. Conflict arises when Brenda debates revealing to Maya that she is not her biological mother. Nate believes it is too early to expose Maya to such things. Brenda becomes pregnant again and this time the baby is seemingly healthy, until the doctors begin to worry that the baby may develop [[Down syndrome]] or [[spina bifida]]. Nate pressures Brenda into having an [[amniocentesis]] and if the results are positive, considering an abortion, but Brenda resists. She and Nate face even more turbulence when Nate begins a friendship with Maggie Sibley and shows an interest in [[Quakerism]], much to Brenda's displeasure. Nate soon begins an [[Adultery|affair]] with Maggie, but suffers a [[hemorrhage]] after his first encounter with her. He goes into a [[coma]], but wakes up with Brenda at his side. He seems to be doing better, and breaks up with Brenda, most likely with the intention of beginning a relationship with Maggie. He dies before he leaves the hospital, leaving Brenda pregnant and alone. She grows scared and leaves Maya with Ruth, which later leads to conflict when Brenda wants Maya back. Brenda then confides in Billy, who had recently broken up with Claire. She soon feels uncomfortable with the incestuous overtones of their relationship and asks him to leave. She gives birth to a premature baby girl, Willa Fisher Chenowith, who eventually grows healthy enough to leave the hospital.

Brenda later becomes a professor and scholar, particularly in the development of gifted children. She marries a man named Daniel Nathanson and has another child, Forrest Nathanson. She seemingly remains close friends with Claire Fisher throughout her life. She dies at the age of 82 in 2051 of natural causes, suffering from early signs of [[Parkinson's disease]]. The audio commentary jokingly suggests that Billy bores Brenda to death as he is heard still talking about his failed relationship with Claire.

She remained an open, outspoken atheist throughout the entirety of the series.

'''Christian Theological libraries''' have their origins in the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] whose practice and transmission depended on the keeping and duplication of sacred texts. Like Judaism, [[Christianity]] depends fundamentally on the preservation and study of a [[sacred text]]. From this it follows that the texts and the secondary literature will be collected for the use of the literate members of the religious communities and passed on to succeeding generations.

==Early Christian libraries==
The integral relationship between [[Christianity]] and its texts has always ensured a central place for books, for learning, and for libraries among Christians. The passing of two millennia has witnessed changes in the manner and intensity of Christian scholarship, yet it has always been the case that [[theology|theological]] learning is inconceivable without libraries and librarians doing the work both of collecting the theological insights of the past and anticipating future theological and religious trends.

The establishment of the [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|Christian canon]] has classically been a subject of central interest to the Christian religion (though in more recent years it has become a special study for theologians and textual critics). It also has a direct bearing on the origins of Christian libraries. As preliminary consensus in the formation of a canon was arrived at, [[Early Christianity|early Christian communities]] would typically entrust to a member of the community the task of providing care and security for those documents that authentically represented the identity and cohesion of each community in this upstart (and frequently embattled) religion.

The impulse to keep valued texts and documents safe but accessible shaped the patterns of early collections, and the first recorded mention of early Christian library activity comes down to us from a context of hostility. Under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (3rd-century), a series of edicts against the Christians included orders that Christian books be seized and destroyed. From this it can reasonably be inferred that it was typical for a local Christian assembly to possess a collection of texts of one kind or another, and that the authorities considered the destruction of such materials to be an essential part of suppressing the Christian faith.

===The library at Jerusalem===
Bishop [[Alexander of Jerusalem]] established a library during his tenure (first half of the 3rd century): this is known from the records of an actual “reader”, [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], who mentions some of the works he found there. Possibly Alexander’s library had as its model the notable Classical collection of [[Alexandria]]: it may be that while still in the Egyptian city, [[Origen]] encouraged his student Alexander to initiate a center for study in [[Jerusalem]].

===The library at Caesarea===
Origen had a hand also in the establishment of the early Christian library of greatest renown, that at [[Caesarea]], based on his own private collection. The great [[Jerome]] was later associated with this library, although a lot of the specific library work appears to have been the task of [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|Pamphilus]] who, according to Jerome, “searched throughout the world for examples that were true and eternal monuments of gifted writers.” &lt;ref&gt;Gamble, ''Books'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Through these efforts, the library grew to include thousands of volumes, a staggering accomplishment when one considers the labor involved in copying by hand. The breadth and quality of this collection is attested by the range of sources cited by Eusebius, who relied on this library in research for his works. Primary collections included all the works of Origen, as well as contemporaries such as [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Sulpicius Apollinaris|Apollinaris]], [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], [[Irenaeus]], and virtually all the important ecclesiastical writers of the period. Since the library performed the critical functions of copying, revising and gathering texts into usable selections, scriptural texts were present in abundance.

Preservation issues also presented themselves: we have record of there having been projects to “convert” the library (or at least its most heavily used segments) from papyrus to parchment.  It needs to be emphasized that Caesarea’s was, in almost every modern sense, principally a research rather than a congregational or liturgical library.  In this setting ambitious critical works were housed, and ever more ambitious and critical works were written, and it would be some time before any Christian library again rose to the standard set in Caesarea.  (Regrettably, we cannot be certain what became of the collection, except that it is lost almost without a trace).

===The library at Alexandria===
Of a specifically Christian library in Alexandria (as distinct from the renowned Classical [[library of Alexandria]] of earlier centuries) less is known. Given the prominence of the city within the Greek world of letters, it is quite possible that authoritative teaching figures such as [[Pantaenus]] and Clement put their personal libraries at the disposal of students, and that over time a Christian library took shape.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===The early library of the Bishop of Rome===
It was not until the 4th and 5th centuries,  when political conditions permitted,  that “episcopal” libraries took shape in [[Rome]], situated in the [[Lateran Palace]]. Here were housed not only theological works, but, in keeping with the administrative function, archives as well.

===The library at Hippo Regius===
Of all the Christian libraries in the West in the first six centuries, we know most about the library at [[Hippo Regius|Hippo]], home of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. No distinction is made in the contemporary accounts between his personal library and that of the church, so it is probable that the two were housed together &lt;ref&gt;Gamble, 167&lt;/ref&gt; The librarian recorded over a thousand items under Augustine’s personal authorship, and the collection is certain to have included scriptural books, the works of other Latin and Greek Christian writers, and a rich selection of “secular” works.  We know that the collection was fully catalogued (perhaps Augustine himself had a hand in this), but along with the rest of the collection this index is lost.

===Further development===
When it was safe to do so, Christianity made the most of the accomplishments of Roman civilization with respect to books and libraries: if the possession of a well-stocked library was considered an enviable adornment to a Roman house, it is probable that a similar element of prestige was conferred on those Christian gathering places which possessed the premier collections of letters and texts. [[Jerome]] (4th and 5th century), for example, was able to assume that wherever there was a congregation, books would be found. In the course of things, those churches that became regional administrative centers tended to develop the best collections.

===The Near East===
Of early Christian libraries in the East, far less is known.  The Imperial Library of [[Constantinople]] encompassed at its peak over 100,000 items but in no sense was it primarily  a theological library.

==Libraries in the monastic setting==

The earliest examples come from Egypt. Monasteries under the direction of [[Pachomius]] (4th century) and [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|Shenouda]] (5th century) required that members learn to read, and it was further expected that they would borrow and study texts from the community’s collection. (Twentieth-century archeological discoveries—Phobaimmon and [[Nag Hammadi]], for example–-have indicated that there was a tremendous amount of activity in writing and copying texts, and one library “catalog” from the period lists eighty titles.)  Collections were composed of biblical texts, lectionaries, church canons, hagiography/biography, etc.

In [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christendom]],  monastic libraries developed on a similar pattern.  “Catalogs” were simply inventories of items held by the community.  On those rare occasions when a community's benefactor would give donate a personal collection, the tendency was not to dispose of questionable or even heretical works:  given the short supply of texts, almost any item would be considered a “rare book.”  The common practice in monastic life was for the abbot (or equivalent) to be charged with the responsibility for securing and caring for the collection.

It is from southern Italy that we receive the most enduring image of early Christian (and monastic) libraries and librarianship, in the person of [[Cassiodorus]].  Like no one else of his time, he leaves us a compendious work of bibliography, the Institituiones divinarum et saecularum litterarum, which surveys first Christian and then secular texts, providing notes and commentary along the way.   An earlier attempt at Rome to establish a theological school had been frustrated, and so on his family’s estate at Calabria he established the “Vivarium”, as a setting in which “to incorporate systematic theological study into monastic life.”  (Gamble, 1990)  With this in view he assembled a large library of both Christian and Classical texts and designed a curriculum of study.  He undertook his monastic and bibliographic work only after a long and well-rewarded career in the service of the [[Goths]], and hence the work we remember him for can be seen as aspiring  “to combat the growing chaos of the world” (Southern, “ Benedictine,” 167). We learn from the Institutiones how he had these sub-collections housed, what they included, together with how they were obtained.

==The Later Middle Ages==

Cassiodorus may have been aware of  the inception of the library at [[Monte Cassino]] under the influence of [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]]  (LeJay and Otten, “Cassiodorus.”)  In any event, with the Imperial City increasingly under attack, the locus of library activity shifted increasingly to the rural monastic houses.  Benedict supported and energized the place of the library in the community by  delegating one or two senior brothers to walk on “patrol” at a set hour, to ensure that no one is engaged in idle chatter, rather than being diligent in his reading.  (Thurston, “Libraries,”   228-32.)

During the succeeding centuries, such libraries played an increasingly strategic role in defending the tradition of learning from decay, pillage, and even disappearance.  By the standards of the later Middle Ages, a monastery collection numbering more than a thousand would have been considered very large. Quality and utility rather than mass were most to be desired.  Catalogs varied in complexity and in volume, and “chained books” were common enough to indicate that security was a lively concern.

We know a little about the physical design of some libraries of the period from extant documents.  Typically a large, pillared hall would serve as a reading room, with built-in cupboards to store the books.  Carrels for study were often set around the perimeter to exploit available light.  An additional floor might house a [[scriptorium]].

The same period saw the flowering of monastic libraries in Britain. Once the Roman occupation ended in the mid-Fifth century, [[Columba]] founded the meditation and copying center at Iona off the coast of Scotland.  A century later witnessed the arrival of [[Augustine of Canterbury]], sent to England by [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]], and this set in motion the establishment of greater conformity to the will of Rome on the part of the English church.  A side-effect of this harmony was a marked increase in monastic library development in England, and a key figure in this maturing was [[Benedict Biscop]] of Wearmouth on the North Sea Coast.  In the tradition of Pamphilius and Cassiodorus, Biscop traveled far to get the works he required:  “he sought [books] where they were best to be found among the desolate remains of ancient civilization in Italy.”  (Southern, 168)  Most importantly, what he retrieved from the Continent contained everything that was necessary for understanding the main outlines of the Christian learning of the ancient world (Southern, 168).  The perfect testimony to the value of his diligent endeavors is that they  supported the scholarship of [Bede], “the greatest example of Benedictine scholarship and of the use to which a Benedictine library can be put.”  (Southern, 170)

The rise of [[university|universities]] and their libraries was energized greatly by bequests:  Bp. [[Robert Grosseteste]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] to [[university of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Robert de Sorbon]] to the [[University of Paris]], etc.  The emerging university libraries, small though they may have been at first, rapidly assumed a different function than the monastic libraries.  Research activity, rather than copying and preservation, predominated.  And it is fair to say that the advent of  new technology - the printing press - in the late 14th century helped take this distinction (the beginnings of a “demand” model) still further.

In France, prior to 1200 all of the major theological schools had all grown up in the environs of cathedrals:  [[St. Victor's Abbey, Paris|St. Victor]], [[Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève|Ste. Genevieve]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].  This association of the cathedral and academy proved to have a decisive influence in determining both where and how theological research and education  were to be carried out for centuries to come.

By 1500 there were between 75 and 85 universities in Western Europe.  Most began without formal libraries, but over the course of time the user of private tutors’ collections in faculties of theology and elsewhere gave way to more methodical and sustainable collection schemes.

==Early modern Europe==

===The Renaissance===
If the later Middle Ages were characterized by the “rescue and preservation” of Christian texts by monastics on the fringes of the world, the [[Renaissance]] (14th-17th centuries) was an era of recovery. It is doubtful whether the history of Western Civilization has ever seen, before or since, such a hunger for ancient texts and their contents. Admittedly, this appetite was more for Greek and Latin classical texts than for Christian works, but the general effect was a positive one for libraries.

The advent of the [[printing press]] had a direct and rapid effect on libraries, for it offered not only the prospect of more copies of more volumes being on the market, but made the unprecedented range of available editions a consideration: “the desired classics were appearing in versions more reliable than their predecessors because of the Humanist scholarship, and far more stable once in print than anything the manuscript age could have produced.”&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, ''Libraries'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

This change-of-focus showed itself first in Italy: [[Petrarch]], [[Boccacio]], [[Salutati]] and others rediscovered, aggressively collected, and copied manuscripts from all-but-lost collections during the 14th century. Significantly, when this appetite turned into something of a “gold-rush”, it was almost invariably to places such as the Benedictine library of [[Monte Cassino]] where text-hunters turned. For economic and other reasons, Florence became the center of such activity.  Across Europe the focus for library expansion and activity became the royal or princely libraries:  aggressive activity in collecting, gathering and protecting texts from their scattered locations was characterized by individuals rather than churches or even universities.

The greatest of these book-hunters were personal agents of wealthy noblemen. Perhaps this is why the greatest legacy for theological librarianship of this essentially humanist cultural movement was the effect it had on the [[Vatican Library]]. Its earlier collection had been dispersed during the [[Avignon Papacy|interval]] at [[Avignon]], so that on his accession [[Pope Nicholas V|Pope Nicholas]] found only 350 volumes extant. The library of the Vatican was brought back to health essentially as a combination of personal library collections, such as that of the [[Duke of Urbino]] (1120 volumes added to the Vatican Library after his death).

In the Low Countries and in England the effect of the Renaissance was somewhat different: [[Erasmus]] in Rotterdam was not only a fine and aggressive collector in his own right, but with great erudition brought together the best of the specifically Christian tradition with the emergent [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] of the Continent. The effects of such efforts on the Reformation period and beyond are impossible to calculate.

===The Protestant Reformation===
The turmoil generated by the English monarchy’s break with Rome in the 16th century had a devastating effect on theological library collections. In Yorkshire alone, for example, under the aegis of various religious orders, there may have been more than fifty abbeys, priories, etc., each of them having at least a modest library. Yet within the space of little more than a generation, this whole structure was crudely dismantled. State-authorized visitations during the reigns of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Edward VI]] meant the break-up of collections not only in the monasteries but also at the Universities as well.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, ”Monastic,” p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as this process was guided by any principle, it was to suppress that which was medieval and to elevate that which was Classical and Humanist in character. In large measure this had the desired effects of cutting British libraries loose from the literary tradition associated with Rome, and  of turning interest toward the Anglo-Saxon church. There is some evidence that the abrupt “change of fashion” in theological literature and learning brought in by the Henrician Reformation had the curious effect of extracting significant portions of monastic collections from purely religious surroundings. So quickly did materials intrinsic to the Catholic tradition become devalued (the monarchy was aggressive and quite ruthless in moving the Church in the direction of Protestant humanism) that it was not uncommon for displaced monks, friars and abbots to be able to take with them, gratis, items from monastic libraries.

Additionally, some private collectors ([[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], [[Matthew Parker]], [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], etc.) were able to save some of the monastic holdings from destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Clement, ''Renaissance Libraries'', p. 551&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the spirit of such  private generosity that efforts to overturn  the Reformation’s more destructive impulses that moved [[Thomas Bodley]] to help re-establish the [[Bodleian Library|library at Oxford]].

Similar currents can be observed in the Continental  Reformation, with some books taken from the monasteries moved to [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation|Lutheran churches]]. A more enduring effect was the shift of surviving monastic collections to the universities. Many universities which were founded in the 16th century had their libraries enriched tremendously by works taken from Dominican and Jesuit libraries, especially. Leipzig’s collection, for example, received 1500 manuscripts and 4,000 printed books in this fashion. Basel received the contents of both the city’s cathedral library and a nearby Dominican library. This can hardly have been what the monks and scribes had in mind amid their earlier toils, but at least the works lived on in active use. Many libraries suffered damage or disruption  during the [[Thirty Years’ War]] in the 17th century, but in general the 17th and 18th centuries were a period of remarkable growth in theological collections of Continental Europe: again, the uniform trend was away from the cloisters and into the academy.

===The Enlightenment===

====Great Britain====
Religious dissent in England had the effect of prompting some dissenters to leave for America, where their views on Church, State and education found expression in new colleges. Many of those who remained in England found themselves denied access to the universities by the [[Act of Uniformity|Acts of Uniformity]] (1549 and after). Their response was to found their own “academies”, 35 of which were established between 1680 and 1780. Library resources for these schools were chiefly supplied by the private collections of the academies’ benefactors.

During the same time period were also established endowed libraries for the use of parishioners.  In this case it appears that literature was made available to keep readers from lapsing into the “easy moral ways” thought to be characteristic of the Restoration era.

The labors of Rev. [[Thomas Bray]] demonstrate how far a  “philanthropic” vision for Christian libraries could sometimes extend. It came to Bray’s attention that many ministers, both Anglican and Dissenting, in Britain and in the Colonies, simply lacked the means to procure theological books, and were effectively consigned to rural parishes where they were not within reasonable distance of books to borrow. The result was the formulation of “Parochial and Lending Libraries”.  He drafted a six-page list of titles to be included, and aimed to set up such a collection for every deanery in England,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and appealed for donations of books and money to the aristocracy.  Eventually the [[SPCK]] (which he helped found late in the 17th century) thought well enough of the enterprise to undertake its sponsorship.

The new idea of a regional, or even a lending library of theological literature was taken even further by a Non-Conformist Scot, [[James Kirkwood (Church of Scotland)|James Kirkwood]], who proposed the support of such ventures with a property tax. Kirkwood won the support of the scientist [[Robert Boyle]] for the translation and distribution of Gaelic Bible translations in the north of Scotland. In this formerly deprived region he also helped establish 77 “lending libraries” in the early decades of the 18th century.

====France====
By contrast, the paroxysm that rocked France at the end of the 18th century was felt first by the libraries of the Jesuits. Whether impelled by the jealousy of other orders, or whether anti-clerical sentiment was simply an explosion looking for a place to occur, the Jesuits took the brunt. A series of edicts meant to rein in their influence and holdings culminated with the actual dissolution of the order in 1773. Most French universities, having close ties with the Church, did not survive the Revolution. As was the case in the Reformation, their book and manuscript collections were dispersed mostly to university or private libraries, in Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, etc.

The French Revolution brought similar changes  to ecclesiastical libraries, though there seemed to be a more overtly destructive impulse at the root of changes. The idea was to confiscate collections, and redistribute them for the benefit of the public. One contemporary estimate put the number of books seized at 12 million.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, 275&lt;/ref&gt;  The urge to protect one’s own literary property had its effect once again, however, and many of the items made their way into clandestine or private collections.

==North American seminary libraries==

===Origin and development===
Theological collections had almost always been a component part, often indeed the central  part, of cathedral or university libraries.  In North America this situation was altered forever by several factors:

1. After the Enlightenment, theology was reassessed to the status of one subject of inquiry among many, rather than retaining its place as the “Queen of the Sciences.
2. Emigration to American afforded the opportunity to reconsider the entire system of theological education.
3. In  North America, theological education would no longer be driven, dominated or informed by a state church. Other factors – new schools of thought as well as “market forces”, personal philanthropy, etc. - would play a stronger role than previously.&lt;ref&gt;Endy, "Theology and Learning in Early America,” in: Henry, ''Schools of Thought'', pp. 125-51&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that the idea of an independent seminary had occasional antecedents in Europe, but the model that emerged in America was in almost every respect unique. Harvard and Yale and other colleges were established for the training of clergy, but at the time this was not considered to be a specialized and professional education. The lines of demarcation between secular and theological learning were not clear. Of the 400 books donated by [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] shortly after the founding of the [[Harvard University|college]], about two thirds  were theological, and since the collection’s growth depended largely on donations from clergy, this proportion did not change rapidly. The Harvard “shelf-list” was compared with a recommended-list of the time, [[Richard Baxter]]’s Christian Directory, which indicated that the collection at Harvard was at best meager. (Baxter, as well as [[Samuel Willard]]’s ''Brief Directions to a Young Scholar'', [[Cotton Mather]]'s’ ''Manductio ad Ministerium'', ''Directions for a Candidate of the Ministry'', and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]’s ''The Preacher, as Discourse ... to which is added a Catalogue of Some Authors were some of the conspectuses for theological literature which were used at the time''.)

In 18th-century America, consensus on theology and theological training came under considerable strain. Traditionally, it was thought that theological training was best carried out through a rigorous program in academic subjects. But revivalist trends outside the academy and theological ferment within it led to increasing distrust.

The option of personal apprenticeship in the home of a respected clergyman—what came to be called the  “Schools of  the Prophets”–-grew in popularity in the aftermath of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1740 and after) [[Joseph Bellamy]] of Bethlehem, CT, was probably the best example: his personal library consisted of approximately 100 books and at least 350 pamphlets (an essential medium for “broadcasting” sermons at the time). There is some irony in the fact that, though it removed many of the best divinity students from the academy, this “unorthodox” approach produced more than its share of highly learned pastors, on the strength of the erudition of the "Prophets”, the power of example, and perhaps sometimes of the quality of their personal libraries.

This “un-orthodox” trend in the training of Protestant ministers helped prepare the ground for another development in theological libraries: the institution of “free-standing” schools of theology. Some of these ([[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]]) remained affiliated with the original colleges, others ([[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary|Pittsburgh]]) became independent entities. But what is of signal importance in all cases is that here were assembled collections for theology and divinity and nothing else. Again, donations of private theological collections provided the foundation &lt;ref&gt;Hadidian, “Seminary,” pp. 220 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several seminary libraries were formed on this basis by the end of the 18th century (New Brunswick, Service Seminary in PA, St. Mary’s-Baltimore). The first part of the 19th century saw excellent theological collections being gathered at Andover (later merged with the Harvard Divinity Collection), [[Hartford]] (sold much later to [[Candler School of Theology]] at [[Emory University]]), Yale, Auburn/[[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union in New York]], [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|Colgate-Rochester]] (and subsequent mergers from [[Bexley Hall]] and [[Crozer Theological Seminary]]), [[General Theological Seminary|General]], [[Drew University|Drew]], Princeton, Gettysburg, St. Charles Borromeo,  etc. In the midwest, the [[St. Mary of the Lake Seminary]] was founded in 1844, and on the west coast what is now the [[Pacific School of Religion]] came into existence in 1866.

===Situation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries===

In North America, both denominational and non-denominational schools of theology had seen remarkable proliferation by the middle of the 19th century. When, in 1924, the first comprehensive study of ministerial education was undertaken, 161 Protestant schools were listed. This number had increased to 224 by a decade later. In his important survey of theological libraries in 1930, Yale’s Raymond Morris indicated that theological libraries ranged in collections from a few hundred volumes up to almost 200,000. This was impressive numerical growth, but he found that libraries were almost always under-supported financially, with repercussions being felt in collections, facilities and staffing.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''Libraries'', pp. 149-91&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Catholic communion in North America, growth patterns had also been phenomenal. An overview in 1960 listed 93 diocesan seminaries (50 considered “major”), as well as 294 “houses of study”, with a total of almost 20,000 students in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington. ''Catholic'', pp.  155-57&lt;/ref&gt; While at that time none of the Catholic collections were on the same scale as the largest Protestant libraries, many contained more than 100,000 items.

It is clear now that by the time the surveys by Beach and Harrington were carried out (1960), a watershed had been crossed, and that demographics of theological education and of church attendance were in the process of rapid change. Among Catholic seminaries, the number of candidates for the priesthood has fallen drastically in the past thirty years (by 2/3, according to some estimates). On the Protestant side, while the overall number of students has remained strong, at the same time attendance patterns have been in sharp decline, and this has drastically reduced the number of graduates who end up serving in parishes. The second half of the 20th century contrasted sharply with the first, and the number of theological colleges and libraries had grown too quickly and too broadly to correspond with trends in the last three decades of the century. This has posed enormous, complex challenges for seminaries and their librarians: serious dislocation, and too many, unevenly distributed, schools.

===The Character of present-day collections===

The magnificent wealth of resources now in evidence is the result of a complex and lengthy development process.  Which is another way of saying that there have been slightly different routes taken to attain the caliber enjoyed by many collections today.  Some have relied principally on rapid denominational growth (which generated demand for clergy and brought in funding required from denominations and benefactors); some have prospered from the skill and vision of exceptional library leadership; some libraries have built their reputations on exquisite collections purchased and then donated by private individuals;  still others have excelled in cultivating niche collections or services.

The individual collections are unique, and the product of many sets of circumstances, so summarizing adequately here would be difficult. (Though dated, earlier overviews by Allison, Walker, Gapp, and Hadidian still provide useful outlines of the distinctive strengths of most collections. A useful, centralized source for current information  on seminaries and their libraries is [https://web.archive.org/web/20070720224744/http://www.atla.com/tsig/catalogs/onlineindex.html American Theological Library Association index]

As the 21st century begins, it is fair to say that the legacy remains strong, but the structure which supports it is showing signs of strain.

For example:
*Decline in church membership within many denominations
*The smaller number of students in seminary (and the tuition revenue they contribute)
*The steadily increasing costs of adding to collections, which makes it difficult for all but a few libraries to maintain acquisitions budgets.
*The rapid incursion of Communications Technology and Electronic Resources is beginning to call into question the continued need for  physical library collections
*The growing demand for distance-learning programs pushes the seminary to reconfigure the way it offers access to course materials

No one can predict what effect these developments might have on theological libraries in the 21st Century.  In cases where the parent institutions have found it impossible to remain in operation, libraries have been sold intact or dispersed. Where there are a number of reasonably compatible schools in a specific area, on some occasions libraries have been merged outright, or retained separate libraries but established a consortial arrangement. In the latter case, efficiencies result from reciprocal borrowing privileges and from avoiding duplicate acquisitions where possible.

It seems a foregone conclusion that there will be further such retrenchments in the coming years, quite likely on a more widespread basis. With trends like these emerging in recent years, the role of the [[American Theological Library Association]] (founded 1947) has been of vital importance.  The primary function of the association has been to offer coordination and support of theological library activity in the USA and Canada.

ATLA’s other notable contributions have been the development and production of the Religion Indexes (1949 ff.) in  print and more recently in electronic versions, its preservation initiatives in assembling core theological collections in microform (1973 and after)

The most recent initiative from ATLA has been the ATLAS serials project, which will bring fifty key theological periodicals to market in an alternative, electronic format.  ATLA has ongoing relationships with  sister agencies, such as the CONSEIL (International Council of Theological Library Associations) and  ANZTLA (Australian  and New Zealand Theological Library Association).

==The twentieth century and beyond: growth, retrenchment, redefinition==

Depending upon one’s perspective, trends during the 20th century can be seen as evidence of a bright or an uncertain future for theological libraries.

In Europe, by the end of the 19th century theological education and training for the ministry had come almost universally under the auspices of the universities. Among other things this usually meant the demise of discrete theological collections within separate facilities, though this did not necessarily mean the devaluation of such collections. Indeed, it is fair to say that as the 20th century opened, not only the finest theological collections but the most erudite and distinguished centers of theological research were in Germany and in Britain (Heidelberg, Tübingen, Göttingen, Berlin, Oxford and Cambridge, to name only a few).

What no one could have predicted was the devastation brought by wars, from the beginning to the end of the century. The [[University of Nancy]] in France lost its library in 1914, as did [[Université catholique de Louvain|Louvain]] in the same year. Great libraries of theology at Monte Cassino, at Dresden, and at Caen were wrecked in 1944. As recently as 1992 the state library at Sarajevo fell victim to a rocket attack. The numerical losses here and elsewhere were high: Hamburg and Frankfurt each lost 600,000 vols., Würzburg 350,000, and so on.

Political as well as military upheavals have had an adverse effect on European theological library collections and activity. Libraries in Eastern Europe illustrate this vividly: collection priorities in places such as Jena, Rostock and Leipzig could hardly be said to have been favorable to theological research during the years 1945-1990. Moreover, since the reunification of the two German states, the massive amounts of money and personnel which it would take to bring theological collections back to acceptable standards has not been easy to come by.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''History'', p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all Continental theological collections, few managed to navigate the various catastrophes of the century better than the [[Vatican Library]]. Steadily enriched by a sequence of outstanding gifts over several centuries, even the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era did little lasting harm. By the end of the 19th century the Library encompassed close to half a million books, and tens of thousands of manuscripts. Several of the Popes ([[Leo XIII]] and [[Pius XI]]) have taken a keen and active interest in the library, and great effort and expense has been taken to ensure that the collections not only continue to grow but are well cared-for. Like many of Europe’s great theological libraries, bibliographic searching is now enabled globally via the WWW. Increasingly, well-financed libraries such as the Vatican’s are working aggressively to develop plans for mounting digital versions of some of their treasures (most often archival materials) on web-servers.

==Summary==

This overview has demonstrated that the role and function of theological libraries have always been characterized by continuity amid turmoil, resourcefulness amid frequently inadequate resources, and advocacy of that which is of lasting value within a setting of constant ecclesiastical, societal and political change.  In the words of Cassiodorus:

We aim  both to preserve what is old and to build something new; we desire to raise up things that are modern without diminishing the works of our ancestors.  (cited in Southern, 169)

Only on very rare occasions have the legacy and contributions of theological libraries been noticed, and then usually long after the fact. (Thomas Cahill’s ''[[How the Irish Saved Civilization]]'' provides a pleasant exception.)   But lasting acclaim is quite beside the point:  from Pamphilius of Caesarea onward, theological libraries have most often been energized by the efforts of those who savor a degree of anonymity.

The “Age of Information”  is commonly considered as posing a dire threat (or at least a plausible alternative) to the perpetuity of printed texts and paper-based library collections.  But of course it also holds out the promise of unprecedented collaboration between the excellent collections and the astute librarians who work in them.  Hence there is reason for hope that the best days for theological libraries lie not in the past but in the future.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Christina of Stommeln''' (24 July 1242 – 6 November 1312), also known as ''Christina Bruso'' and ''Christina Bruzo'', was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]], and [[Stigmata|stigmatic]].

Christina is believed to have been born on July 24, 1242, to farmers Heinrich and Hilla Bruso in the village of Stumbeln (now [[Stommeln]]), northwest of [[Cologne]]. At the age of five, she began to experience religious visions. When she was twelve her parents wished to arrange her marriage, but she left home without their permission and joined a [[Beguine]] community in Cologne. At the age of fifteen, she manifested stigmata on her hands, feet, and head. This, combined with other mystic experiences, convinced others in the community that she was insane and she was treated with contempt, leading her to return to her home village in 1267.

On her return to Stommeln, she was taken in by the parish priest, Johannes. While in his care, Christina met [[Petrus de Dacia (Swedish monk)|Peter of Dacia]], a [[Dominican order|Dominican]], who became a lifelong friend. Following Peter's death in 1288, Christine's mystic experiences ceased. She left the priest's household and moved into a small cloister, where she lived a quiet life until her death at the age of 70 on November 6, 1312. She was first buried in the Stommeln churchyard, but her remains have been moved several times: first into the church, then in 1342 to [[Nideggen]], and finally in 1569 to the Propsteikirche (Provost's Church) in [[Jülich]], where a monument to Christine still exists. Her relics survived the destruction of the Provost's Church during the Allies' air raid on Jülich on November 16, 1944.

[[Pope Pius X]] beatified her on 8 November 1908 and her liturgical feast was affixed to the date of her death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1370">'''Criobolium''' is the [[ritual sacrifice]] of a [[Sheep|ram]] in the cult of [[Attis]] and the [[Great Mother of the Gods]]. It seems to have been a special ceremony instituted after the rise, and on the analogy of the [[taurobolium]], which was performed in honor of the Great Mother, for the purpose of giving fuller recognition to Attis in the duality which he formed with the Mother. There is no evidence of its existence either in Asia or in Italy before the taurobolium came into prominence (after AD 134). When the criobolium was performed in conjunction with the taurobolium, the altar was almost invariably inscribed to both the Mother and Attis, while the inscription was to the Mother alone when the taurobolium only was performed. The celebration of the criobolium was widespread, and its importance such that it was sometimes performed in place of the taurobolium (Corp. Inscr. Lat. vi. 505, 506). The details and effect of the ceremony were no doubt similar to those of the taurobolium.

A '''dryad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|aɪ|.|æ|d}}; {{lang-el|Δρυάδες}}, ''sing''.: {{lang|el|Δρυάς}}) is a [[Tree (mythology)|tree]] [[nymph]] or tree spirit in [[Greek mythology]]. ''Drys'' signifies "oak" in Greek, and dryads are specifically the [[nymph]]s of [[oak]] trees, but the term has come to be used for all tree nymphs in general.&lt;ref name=Graves862&gt;Graves, ch. 86.2; p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; They were normally considered to be very shy creatures except around the goddess [[Artemis]], who was known to be a friend to most nymphs.

== Types ==
{{Greek myth (nymph)}}

===Daphnaie===
{{main|Daphnaie}}
These were nymphs of the laurel trees.

===Epimelides===
{{main|Epimeliad}}
The Maliades, Meliades or Epimelides were nymphs of apple and other fruit trees and the protectors of sheep. The Greek word ''melas''--from which their name derives--means both apple and sheep. [[Hesperides]], the guardians of the golden apples were regarded as these type of dryad.

===Hamadryad===
{{main|Hamadryad}}
Dryads, like all [[nymph]]s, were supernaturally long-lived and tied to their homes, but some were a step beyond most nymphs. These were the [[hamadryad]]s who were an integral part of their trees, such that if the tree died, the hamadryad associated with it died as well. For these reasons, dryads and the [[Greek god]]s punished any mortals who harmed trees without first [[wiktionary:propitiate|propitiating]] the tree-nymphs. (associated with Oak trees)

===Meliai===
{{main|Meliae}}
The dryads of [[ash tree]]s were called the [[Meliae]].&lt;ref name=Graves862/&gt; The ash-tree sisters tended the infant [[Zeus]] in [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]'s [[Crete|Cretan]] cave. Gaea gave birth to the Meliae after being made fertile by the blood of castrated [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]. The [[Epimeliad]] were nymphs associated with [[apple]] trees, and the [[Caryatid]]s were associated with walnut trees.&lt;ref name=Graves862/&gt;

==Names==
Some of the individual dryads or hamadryads are:

*Atlanteia and Phoebe, two of the many wives or concubines of [[Danaus]]&lt;ref&gt;''
[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 2. 1. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Chrysopeleia (mythology)|Chrysopeleia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]] on [[Lycophron]], 480&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dryope]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 9.330 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoninus Liberalis]], ''Metamorphoses'' 32&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Erato (dryad)|Erato]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 8. 4. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Eurydice]]
*[[Pitys (mythology)|Pitys]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]], Elegies 1. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' 2. 92 ff :&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graeme Charles Edge''' (born 30 March 1941) is an English musician, songwriter and poet best known as the [[drummer]] and one of the [[songwriter]]s for the English band [[the Moody Blues]]. Edge is the only remaining original member of the Moody Blues still performing in the band. In addition to his work with the Moody Blues, Edge has worked as the [[bandleader]] of his own outfit, the Graeme Edge Band. He has contributed his talents to a variety of other projects throughout his career. In 2018, Edge was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Moody Blues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Moody Blues|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/moody-blues|website=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=17 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===The Moody Blues (1964-1966)===
Graeme Edge is one of the original members of The Moody Blues, alongside singer/guitarist [[Denny Laine]], singer/bassist [[Clint Warwick]], singer/keyboardist [[Mike Pinder]] and singer/flautist/harmonica player [[Ray Thomas]]. Edge provided a foundation for the original [[R&amp;B]] and [[Rock music|rock]]-flavoured band [[Frontman|fronted]] by Laine, playing on all their [[Decca records|Decca]] singles, including the UK chart-topping "[[Go Now]]" (January 1965), and other 1965 hit songs; "[[I Don't Want To Go On Without You]]", "Everyday", and "From The Bottom of my Heart (I Love You)", which were additionally released in that year.

===Core seven period (1966-1974)===
After the departure of Laine and Clint Warwick and the later recruitment of [[Justin Hayward]] and [[John Lodge (musician)|John Lodge]] in 1966, the band continued initially to play the R&amp;B style material; however, after an irate fan dismissed one of their concert performances as poor, Edge is quoted as speaking up to say to his bandmates: "That guy was right ... we WERE rubbish!" leading the band to decide henceforth to drop the blues-style covers and begin writing and recording their own songs only.

Edge initially was a poet for the band, contributing "Morning Glory" and "Late Lament" to ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' in 1967 (narrated by Pinder). Edge himself opened ''[[In Search of the Lost Chord]]'' (1968) with his brief poem "Departure", though Justin Hayward narrated his "The Word" poem later on that set. Further poems provided by Edge included "In The Beginning" (co-narrated by Hayward, Edge and Pinder in turn) and "The Dream" (spoken by Pinder) for ''On The Threshold of A Dream'' (1969). Edge says that the reason why most of his poetry was recited by Pinder was because he smoked so many [[cigarettes]] and drank so much [[whisky]] that he had the best voice for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/entertainment/39954/breathe-deep-the-moody-blues-cruise-graeme-edge-gets-moody/|title=Moody Blues drummer Graeme Edge interviewed - TechnologyTell|work=TechnologyTell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1969, as the Moodies launched their own label, Threshold Records, Edge began contributing songs; his "Higher and Higher" (a spoken lyric over music with a dramatic 'rocket blast off' opening; as usual, it was recited by Pinder) commenced ''[[To Our Children's Children's Children]]'', which also featured his instrumental composition "Beyond".

Edge whispered the lyrics to his song "Don't You Feel Small" over band-sung vocals (Pinder, Thomas, Lodge and Hayward) on ''[[A Question of Balance]]'' (1970), on which he also contributed a closing poem/song co-written with Ray Thomas, "The Balance" (recited by Pinder).

Edge co-wrote and claims pole position as 'lead grunt' on the unusual band-composed opening track "Procession" on their album ''[[Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (album)|Every Good Boy Deserves Favour]]'' in 1971, on which his song "After You Came" features the four lead vocalists (Thomas, Pinder, Hayward and Lodge) both together and taking brief solo lead lines in turn. Edge's song was later used as UK B-side to the chart hit "[[Isn't Life Strange]]?" in 1972. The first [[electronic drum]] is said to have been created by Edge in collaboration with Sussex University Professor Brian Groves. The device was used in the song "Procession" from the 1971 album ''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour''.

For their 1972 ''[[Seventh Sojourn]]'' album, Edge co-wrote "You And Me" with Hayward, who took lead vocal. In 2013 Edge said of ''Seventh Sojourn'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I didn't [listen to] that album, because I was going through a divorce at the same time and so it was very, very painful for me. Once it was finished, I didn't play it for years and years and years. ''Never'' played it. Not that I play our stuff very much anyway, but I never ever played that one. And I hadn't really heard it apart from the [singles] from it, until [2007 when] it came out first time on CD and I had to listen to it digitalised just to sort of say "Yeah, that's fine by me." And I thought, "Well actually, that's not too bad an album!" That's the closest I'll ever be to hearing a Moodies album for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Leach |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWKE9eivuy8 |title=Moody Blues Docu part IV 2013 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Band hiatus===
After the Moodies' world tour ended in 1974, the band members took a break, during which, between his two solo albums, Edge sailed on a round-the-world voyage with a small crew in his yacht ''Delia''.

Edge returned to recording later in 1974, forming his studio-based The Graeme Edge Band (featuring guitarist/vocalist [[Adrian Gurvitz]])and Paul Gurvitz, which first issued a non-album single, "We Like To Do it", on Threshold (TH 18) in July 1974 (this was later added to his first Graeme Edge Band album as a [[bonus track]] on the CD release). The Graeme Edge Band then released two [[album]]s in the mid 1970s. The first was ''Kick Off Your Muddy Boots'' in September 1975 on the [[Threshold Records|Threshold]] [[record label]], a subsidiary of [[Decca Records]], catalogue number THS 15. It was released as a [[gatefold]] with album art by [[Joe Petagno]] and featured Adrian Gurvitz and Paul Gurvitz, plus a guest appearance co-drumming with Edge by Ginger Baker (on 'Gew Janna Woman'), and backing vocals by fellow Moodies member Ray Thomas. This first album reached No. 107 in the US on the ''Billboard'' chart. Their second album was ''Paradise Ballroom'' in 1977, on the main Decca label, catalogue number TXS 121, and in the US on the [[London Records]] label, catalogue number PS 686 The album charted in the US reaching No. 164 on the ''Billboard'' chart. It was also released as a gatefold with album art by Joe Petagno, again featuring Adrian and Paul Gurvitz. He also appeared as himself in the 2016 film comedy [[Characterz]].

A single, "Everybody Needs Somebody" (taken from the latest album), was issued on Decca (F.13698) with the non-album B-side "Be My Eyes" in June 1977.

===Band reformation (1978-present)===
After the Moodies' reunion in 1978, Edge provided "I'll Be Level With You" (sung by the group, led by Hayward) for the album ''Octave'' on Decca. After the album was released, Pinder declined to tour with the band and was replaced by ex-[[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Patrick Moraz]].

For ''Long Distance Voyager'' in 1981 Edge contributed "22,000 Days"&amp;mdash;the length of an average human lifespan in days&amp;mdash;sung by Thomas, Lodge and Hayward; this was also used as the UK B-side of the single "Gemini Dream".

Edge's "Going Nowhere" (sung by Ray Thomas) was his lone composition on ''The Present''' album in 1983, and he teamed with Moraz for "The Spirit" (sung by the group's vocalists in harmony) on ''The Other Side of Life'' album in 1986.

Edge was not featured as a songwriter or poet on either ''Sur La Mer'' (1988) or ''Keys of the Kingdom'' (1991) and was not drummer on every track on the latter album; however, he contributed the closing poem/song "Nothing Changes", which was initially narrated by himself and then sung by the Moodies (Hayward featured) on the ''Strange Times'' album issued in 1999.

Edge has been joined onstage by Gordon Marshall as second drummer for Moodies concerts from 1991 to 2015, and by Billy Ashbaugh since 2016. In addition to drums, Edge has provided varied assorted percussion instrumentation, plus additional piano to the Moodies' works, and featured his electronic drum kit from the early '70s onwards on Moodies albums, his drumming style being recognisable and distinctive.

Edge participated in the 2011 Moody Blues [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tribute album ''[[Moody Bluegrass]] TWO ... Much Love'', providing the lead vocal on a bluegrass-tinged version of his poem "Higher And Higher".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twomuchlove.com/index.php |title=Moody Blues TWO ... Much Love |accessdate=2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edge once admitted on ''[[Rockline]]'' that his second wife Susan would not marry him because she did not want to be named 'Sue Edge' ([[sewage]]).

Edge is a fan of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. An article about him said he has "plenty of time for overseeing some rental properties, doing charity work, playing lots of golf and watching ''Deep Space Nine'' at his Sarasota home on Florida's Gulf Coast".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/music/16742108.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224172833/http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/music/16742108.htm |date=24 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Justin Hayward spoke of Edge's learning [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, along with other members of the Moody Blues.&lt;ref name=rcm2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleason|first1=Paul|title=Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues on His Days of Future Passed (and Present)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/justin-hayward-interview-moody-blues-spirits-western-sky/#sthash.joDRnadl.dpuf|website=Rockcellar Magazine|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 April 2013|quote=We went to the TM Center at the same time that The Beatles did.  Four of us went: me, Mike, Graeme, and Ray. We went through the whole process.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edge is the only remaining original member of The Moody Blues still performing in the band. However, Justin Hayward and John Lodge, from the best-known version of the band, are also still with the band.

Edge uses DW drums, [[Zildjian]] cymbals and Regal Tip drumsticks, namely their 5A model.

{{Hinduism by country}}
Hinduism is a minority faith in Kenya,constituting 0.14% of the population of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130115103229/http://www.knbs.or.ke/docs/PresentationbyMinisterforPlanningrevised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;Kenya is also the only African Country after Mauritius and South Africa to recognise Hinduism.Hinduism become recognised in Kenya ,only by the activities of Hindu Council of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vhp.org/englishsite/d.Dimensions_of_VHP/qVishwa%20Samanvya/vishvahinduparishadabroad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420111815/http://www.vhp.org/englishsite/d.Dimensions_of_VHP/qVishwa%20Samanvya/vishvahinduparishadabroad.htm |archivedate=2007-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike north and northeast African countries which do not allow construction of Hindu temples or open practice of Hinduism, Kenya allows religious freedom to practice Hinduism; several of Kenyan cities have a number of [[Hindu temple]]s from different schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hck.or.ke/index.php/tree-menu Hindu temples - Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924202822/http://hck.or.ke/index.php/tree-menu |date=2014-09-24 }} Hindu council of Kenya&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu temples in Kenya are mostly of north and west Indian architectural style.

==History==
'''Hinduism in Kenya''' mainly comes from coastal trade routes between primarily between [[Gujarat]], [[Marwar]] and [[Odisha]] in [[India]] and [[East Africa]].

The influence of '''Hinduism in Kenya''' began in early 1st millennium AD when there was trade between East Africa and Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=cjjr&gt;Constance Jones and James D. Ryan, Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0816073368}}, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence of small Hindu settlements have been found mainly in [[Zanzibar]] and coastal parts of [[Kenya]], Swahili coast, Zimbabwe and Madagascar.&lt;ref name=cjjr/&gt; Many words in [[Swahili language]] have their etymological roots in Indian languages associated with [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Lodhi (2000), Oriental influences in Swahili: a study in language and culture contacts, {{ISBN|978-9173463775}}, pp. 72-84&lt;/ref&gt;The origin of the Kenyan Gujarati dates back to the late 1800s (early 1900s), when British colonialists brought laborers from India to build the Uganda–Kenya railway. Many of the laborers, rather than travel back to the Indian subcontinent, simply settled in Kenya, and slowly brought with them a host of hopefuls willing to start afresh.
==Demographics==
One percent of Kenyan population practiced Hinduism as reported by IRF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71307.htm|title=Kenya|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to the 2009 Census ,there are 53,393 Hindus in Kenya,who constitute 0.14% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20130115103229/http://www.knbs.or.ke/docs/PresentationbyMinisterforPlanningrevised.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Pew Research Center estimates there were 60,000 Hindus in Kenya in 2010, or less than 0.25% of the total Kenyan population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/table-religious-composition-by-country-in-numbers/ Table: Religious Composition by Country, in Numbers] Pew Research Center (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindus in Kenya==

Today, the Gujarati community in Kenya is estimated at over ninety thousand, and is dispersed throughout the country. Despite varying degrees of acculturation, most have retained their strong Gujarati ties.

[[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|HSS (RSS)]] and [[ISKCON]] are the main contributors to the society in large by organizing public events and introducing many welfare programs such as the food relief programs and other services which has attracted many Kenyans and created a good reputation of the Hindu community at large.

Pushtimarg Vaishnav Sangh and [[Brahma Kumaris]] are also active in Kenya.

==Hindu Council of Kenya==
Hindu Council of Kenya is an umbrella body of Hindus in Kenya. The Council is recognized by the Government{{Fact|date=February 2008}}. Until a few years back, the Hindus were described in the voter’s register as 'Non-Muslims'. Due to the efforts of the Council, they are now described as 'Hindus'. The Council has been busy in preparing syllabus and books for Hindu religious education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vhp.org/englishsite/d.Dimensions_of_VHP/qVishwa%20Samanvya/vishvahinduparishadabroad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420111815/http://www.vhp.org/englishsite/d.Dimensions_of_VHP/qVishwa%20Samanvya/vishvahinduparishadabroad.htm |archivedate=2007-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Hare Krishna - ISKCON in Kenya==
The [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] ([[ISKCON]]) also known as [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] or "The Hare Krishna Movement" has successfully established 4 Temples in Kenya till date. With all efforts and hard work, they preach the glories of Lord Sri Radha Krishna, love of godhead (Bhakti Yoga), the message of [[Bhagavad-Gītā as It Is]] and also other Vedic scriptures. Also organize wonderful festivals such as [[Krishna Janmashtami]], [[Radhastami]], [[Rama Navami]], [[Gaura-purnima]], [[Narasimha | Narasimha Chaturdashi]] and many.

The most famous is the [[Jagannath]] [[Ratha-Yatra]] also known as the "Festival of Chariots" which attracts over 5000 Kenyans to dance and sing the holy names of [[Jagannath | Lord Sri Jagannath]] (The Lord of the Universe).

[[Hare Krishna Food for Life]] is the world's largest vegetarian non-profit food relief organization. Its efforts span the globe, with projects occupying over 108 countries, including Kenya. Volunteers in Kenya provide up to 20,000 free meals daily. Food For Life does not only tackle one form of hunger but reaches out to all in need, including; the homeless and disadvantaged children.

Food for Life project is a modern-day revival of the ancient Vedic culture of hospitality with its belief in the equality of all beings.

The popular nickname of "Hare Krishnas" for Krishna Devotees comes from the vedic mantra that devotees sing aloud (Kirtan) or Chant (Japa) on Tulsi-mala. This mantra, known also as the Maha Mantra comes from the ancient Vedic Scriptures.

The Maha Mantra: {{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa''
''kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare''
''hare rāma hare rāma''
''rāma rāma hare hare''&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Always Chant and be Happy!

==Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS) - RSS in Kenya==
HSS is part of [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh | Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)]]. HSS is known to have started in 14 November 1947 in Nairobi, and since then it has developed and has its centers in different cities like Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu and Meru.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37736">The Bahá'í Faith takes no position on the sexual practices of those who are not adherents.{{sfn|Office of Community Administration|2015}} Within the Bahá'í community, where membership is freely chosen, permissible sexual relations are limited to those between a man and a woman in marriage.{{sfn|Coward|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|Lepard|2008|p=100}} Adherents are expected to abstain from sex outside of matrimony, thus premarital, extramarital, or homosexual intimacy are excluded from allowable Bahá'í practices.

The scriptural basis for Bahá'í practices comes from the writings of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] (1817-1892), the faith's founder, who forbade fornication, adultery, and sodomy. The Bahá'í position towards homosexuality became more refined with the writings of [[Shoghi Effendi]], Bahá'u'lláh's great grandson and appointed head of the religion from 1921 to 1957. He answered specific questions and described homosexuality as an affliction that should be overcome, while leaving Bahá'í membership open to anyone regardless of sexual orientation. This position leaves Bahá'ís with a same-sex orientation under the same guidance as a heterosexual person, that is, if they find themselves unable to contract a marriage with someone of the opposite sex, they should remain celibate.

The supreme governing institution of the Bahá'í Faith is the [[Universal House of Justice]], first elected in 1963, which has written more extensively on the subject of homosexuality. For example, they have clarified that Bahá'ís should not single out homosexuality over other transgressions of Bahá'í conduct, should not treat those with a homosexual orientation with disdain or prejudice,{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1987}} should not expect that non-Bahá'ís follow Bahá'í standards, and should neither promote nor necessarily oppose efforts to legalize same-sex marriage.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|2010}}

==Bahá'í views on sexuality==

Bahá'í teachings stress the importance of absolute [[chastity]] for any unmarried person,{{sfn|Effendi|1975}} and focus on personal restraint. The Bahá'í Faith, however, leaves the application of laws of social conduct largely up to the individual, and Bahá'ís do not advocate for or discriminate against homosexual people.{{sfn|Gallagher|Ashcroft|2006}}

While in authoritative teachings [[homosexuality]] is described as a condition that an individual should control and overcome,{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1973a}} Bahá'ís are left to apply the teachings at their own discretion, and are discouraged from singling out homosexuality over other [[Bahá'í laws|transgressions]], such as the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], or heterosexual promiscuity.{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1950}} Membership in the Bahá'í community is therefore open to lesbian and gay adherents.{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1948}}{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1954}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1987}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1988}}

The Bahá'í Faith has been described as a religion "ambiguous or contested on the issue of [[LGBT]] inclusion".{{sfn|Gallagher|Ashcroft|2006}} The religion has a strong emphasis on traditional values found in [[Abrahamic religions]], which discourage liberal sexuality. 

Bahá'í teachings state that Bahá'ís should not treat homosexual people as condemned outcasts, nor expect people who are not Bahá'í to follow Bahá'í laws.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1992a}} The Bahá'í writings teach adherents to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and to eschew an attitude of discrimination and social intolerance toward homosexuals.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1995}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|2010}}

The opportunity for civil [[same-sex marriage]] was mentioned in a 2010 letter by the [[Universal House of Justice]] as being a public issue that is not in keeping with the Bahá'í teachings, but one that Bahá'ís "would neither promote nor necessarily oppose."{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|2010}}

==Homosexual Bahá'ís==
===New converts===
Individuals with a same-sex orientation are not prevented from entering the religion and joining in community life; however, someone involved in a same-sex marriage or union will be prevented from registering as a Bahá'í.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1999}} Like other Abrahamic religions, Bahá'í teachings make a distinction between those who have a same-sex attraction and those who practice homosexual relations.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1993}}

The faith's guidelines recommend not emphasizing Bahá'í standards of conduct to new believers, but gradually introducing the idea of fully accepting all Bahá'í practices.{{sfn|Shoghi Effendi|1938|p=52}}{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1955}} [[Spiritual Assemblies]], the local elected bodies that manage the affairs of the religion, are instructed to act patiently and persuade members to accept principles inwardly and “out of pure conviction and desire.”{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1935}} Although Bahá'ís are forbidden to have sexual relationships outside of marriage, heterosexual or homosexual, new converts who are already engaged in such a relationship will be expected to make a sincere effort to conform to the Bahá'í teachings over a period of time.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1988}}

===Role of Spiritual Assemblies===
As a general rule, the Spiritual Assemblies do not get involved in the private lives of believers, unless their actions are considered flagrantly immoral or to be causing some harm to the community.{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1956}}{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1980b}} 

An individual may be subject to administrative sanctions if a Spiritual Assembly decides that they are openly disregarding the Bahá'í teachings and their actions are damaging to the image of the Bahá'í Faith. This response removes the right to contribute to funds, vote in elections for spiritual assemblies, hold office, or attend the [[Nineteen Day Feast]]. It may be applied to extreme cases of alcoholism, sexual promiscuity, and anything that is considered flagrant immorality. However, this consequence is meant only to be applied in cases of "public scandal", "very flagrant cases", or if the conduct of the Bahá'í is "seriously injuring the Faith in the eyes of the public".{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1955}} In cases of Bahá'ís who are flagrantly promiscuous, they are to be approached by a Spiritual Assembly and informed of the teachings on personal conduct. If after a probational period the person continues to present a disregard towards the laws in a public way, then the assembly may remove the person's administrative rights, "administratively expelled from membership in the Bahá'í community",{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1991}} though this action is not the same as ex-communication, as there is no directive to avoid fellowship with the individual.

===Overcoming homosexuality===
Early letters written by [[Shoghi Effendi]]'s secretaries on his behalf described those with a homosexual orientation as having a handicap that can be overcome "through the advice and help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through prayer".{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1950}}

The reference to overcoming or reversing a sexual orientation has garnered considerable criticism from those who regard it as innate and unchangeable. [[Conversion therapy]] has been largely condemned by many medical organizations, particularly in the United States and United Kingdom, who see it as unethical to view a heterosexual orientation as preferable to a homosexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Position Statement on Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation |date=2000 |url=https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/About-APA/Organization-Documents-Policies/Policies/Position-2000-Therapies-Change-Sexual-Orientation.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-07-26 |author=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy]] |title=Conversion therapy |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/about-ukcp/public-policy/conversion-therapy/ |accessdate=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal House of Justice has written its own correspondence to individuals, encouraging them to divert thoughts into spiritual channels and the nature of man, and to "resist wayward impulses each time they arise".{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1980a}} The Universal House of Justice has responded to research that claims that homosexuality is innate and not changeable by asserting that homosexuality is one of
:"many problems, both physical and psychological. Some are the result of the individual’s own behaviour, some are caused by the circumstances in which he grew up, some are congenital... homosexuality is an abnormality, is a great problem for the individual so afflicted, and... he or she should strive to overcome it."{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1992a}}

It also argues that statistics may be distorted due to under-reporting,{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1995}} that other genetic predispositions to undesirable behaviors exist, and that other types of bias may exist in the present-day research.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1993}}

==Basis from texts==
In one passage of the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]'', [[Bahá'u'lláh]] writes "we shrink, for very shame, from treating the subject of boys."{{sfn|Bahá'u'lláh|1873|loc=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-6.html#gr107 gr. 107]}} In the context of the original Arabic text, this passage implies [[pederasty]], or erotic relations between adult males and adolescent boys.{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1992b|loc=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-151.html note 134]}} Such practices were not uncommon during the time of Bahá'u'lláh in the Islamic world, and in some cases were socially acceptable (see [[bacha bazi]]). Bahá'u'lláh condemned such relations, and [[Shoghi Effendi]], the authorized interpreter of the Bahá'í writings, has more clearly defined a prohibition on all homosexual relations,{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1949}} stating that, "No matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really forbidden by Bahá'u'lláh, and homosexual relationships, He looks upon as such, besides being against nature."{{sfn|On behalf of Shoghi Effendi|1950}} 

Bahá'u'lláh clearly forbade fornication and adultery,{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1992b|loc=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-53.html Note 36]}} referring to any form of premarital or extramarital sexual intercourse. He also forbade sodomy and lechery.{{sfn|Homosexuality|1993}} The Universal House of Justice, in its notes on the text of the ''Kitab-i-Aqdas'', stated that the Baha'i laws restrict "permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married".{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1992b|loc=[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-151.html note 134]}}

== Letters from the Universal House of Justice==
The head of the Bahá'í Faith, the [[Universal House of Justice]], has addressed the issue in letters in recent years and brief excerpts:
*9 May 2014 to an individual{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|2014}}
**"The contemporary discussion surrounding homosexuality, which began in the West and is increasingly promoted in other parts of the world, generally takes the form of a false dichotomy, which compels one to choose between a position that is either affirming or rejecting."
**"While Bahá’ís hold specific beliefs about human identity, sexuality, personal morality, and individual and social transformation, they also believe that individuals must be free to investigate truth and should not be coerced."
**"To regard a person who has a homosexual orientation with prejudice or disdain is entirely against the spirit of the Faith. And where occasion demands, it would be appropriate to speak out or act against unjust or oppressive measures directed towards homosexuals."
**"Just as Bahá’ís do not impose their views on others, they cannot relinquish their principles because of changing trends in popular thought."

*23 April 2013 letter to a National Spiritual Assembly{{sfn|Office of Community Administration|2015|p=21}}
**"…their ("institutions of the Faith") aim (should) be to raise consciousness and to increase understanding. Theirs is not the duty to pry into personal lives or to impose Bahá’í law on the individual…"
**"Gossip and backbiting have no place in the Bahá’í community; nor do judgmental attitudes and self-righteousness."

*19 April 2013 letter to a group of individuals{{sfn|Office of Community Administration|2015|p=21}}
**"The result (of "the expenditure of enormous energy and vast amounts of resources in an attempt to bend truth to conform to personal desire") is a culture that distorts human nature and purpose, trapping human beings in pursuit of idle fancies and vain imaginings and turning them into pliable objects in the hands of the powerful. Yet, the happiness and well-being of humanity-depend upon the opposite: cultivating human character and social order in conformity with reality."
**"(Bahá'u'lláh's) teachings serve, then, to empower humanity; they are the harbinger of human happiness, whose call, far from compelling obedience to an arbitrary and dictatorial regimen of behaviour, leads to true freedom."
**"Throughout the world, in diverse cultures, Bahá’ís encounter values and practices that stand in sharp contrast to the teachings of the Faith. Some are embedded in social structures, for instance, racial prejudice and gender discrimination, economic exploitation and political corruption. Others pertain to personal conduct, especially with respect to the use of alcohol and drugs, to sexual behaviour, and to self-indulgence in general."
**"The institutions of the Faith, for their part, strive to ensure that such an environment ("in which a spirit of unity animates one and all") is fostered. They do not pry into the personal lives of individuals. Nor are they vindictive and judgmental, eager to punish those who fall short of the Bahá’í standard."

Our teachings, as outlined in the Advent of Divine Justice, on the subject of living a chaste life, should be emphasized to them just as every other applicant, but certainly no ruling whatsoever should be laid down in this matter. The Bahá’ís have certainly not yet reached that stage of moral perfection where they are in a position to too harshly scrutinize the private lives of other souls, and each individual should be accepted on the basis of his faith, and sincere willingness to try to live up to the Divine Standards;"

*{{citation | author=On behalf of Shoghi Effendi | date=25 October 1949 | title=Letter | ref=harv | postscript=. cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Bahá'u'lláh has spoken very strongly against this shameful sexual aberration, as He has against adultery and immoral conduct in general."

To say that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really forbidden by Bahá'u'lláh, and homosexual relationships he looks upon as such, besides being against nature.&lt;br&gt;"To be afflicted this way is a great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through prayer, a soul can overcome this handicap."

Cited in {{harvnb|Lights of Guidance|1983|loc=[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance&amp;chapter=2#n1221 1221]}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Amongst the many other evils afflicting society in this spiritual low water mark in history is the question of immorality, and over-emphasis of sex. Homosexuality, according to the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh, is spiritually condemned. This does not mean that people so afflicted must not be helped and advised and sympathized with."

*{{citation | author=On behalf of Shoghi Effendi | date=20 August 1955 | title=Letter to a National Spiritual Assembly | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Lights of Guidance|1983|loc=[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=2#1230 #1230]}} }}&lt;br&gt;"The question of how to deal with homosexuals is a very difficult one. Homosexuality is forbidden in the Bahá'í Faith by Bahá'u'lláh; so, for that matter, is immorality and adultery. If one is going to start imposing heavy sanctions on people who are the victims of this abnormality, however repulsive it may be to others, then it is only fair to impose equally heavy sanctions on any Bahá'ís who step beyond the moral limits defined by Bahá'u'lláh. Obviously at the present time this would create an impossible and ridiculous situation.&lt;br /&gt; “He feels, therefore, that, through loving advice, through repeated warnings, any friends who are flagrantly immoral should be assisted, and, if possible, restrained. If their activities overstep all bounds and become a matter of public scandal, then the Assembly can consider depriving them of their voting rights. However, he does not advise this course of action and feels that it should only be resorted to in very flagrant cases."

*{{citation | author=On behalf of Shoghi Effendi | date=6 October 1956 | title=Letter to a National Spiritual Assembly | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Homosexuality is highly condemned and often a great trial and cause of suffering to a person, as a Bahá'í. Any individual so afflicted must, through prayer, and any other means, seek to overcome this handicap. But, unless the actions of such individuals are flagrantly immoral, it cannot be a pretext for depriving them of their voting rights." 

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=12 January 1973a | title=Letter to an Individual | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Lights of Guidance|1983|loc=[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance&amp;chapter=2#n1222 #1222]}} }}&lt;br&gt;"...it is clear from the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh that homosexuality is not a condition to which a person should be reconciled, but is a distortion of his or her nature which should be controlled or overcome. This may require a hard struggle, but so also can be the struggle of a heterosexual person to control his or her desires."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=14 March 1973b | title=Letter to an Individual | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Lights of Guidance|1983|loc=[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=2#n1225 #1225]}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Bahá'í law restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married. Thus, it should not be so much a matter of whether a practicing homosexual can be a Bahá'í as whether, having become a Bahá'í, the homosexual can overcome his problem through knowledge of the teachings and reliance on Bahá'u'lláh."

*{{citation | author=On behalf of Shoghi Effendi | date=5 March 1975 | ref=harv | title=Letter to an Individual | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993|p=4}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Concerning your question whether there are any legitimate forms of expression of the sex instinct outside of marriage; according to the Bahá'í Teachings no sexual act can be considered lawful unless performed between lawfully married persons. Outside of marital life there can be no lawful or healthy use of the sex impulse." 

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=9 January 1977 | title=Letter to an individual believer | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Lights of Guidance|1983|loc=[http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=2#n1226 1226]}} }}&lt;br&gt;"While recognizing the divine origin and force of the sex impulse in man, religion teaches that it must be controlled, and Bahá'u'lláh's law confines its expression to the marriage relationship. The unmarried homosexual is therefore in the same position as anyone else who does not marry. The Law of God requires them to practice chastity."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=16 July 1980a | title=Letter written to an individual | ref=harv | postscript=.

If you are sincerely intent on overcoming your problem, you must yourself determine to resist wayward impulses each time they arise and the House of Justice feels that there is no better way than to turn to the Writings to divert our thoughts into spiritual channels..."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=2 December 1980b | title=Letter to a National Spiritual Assembly | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Assemblies, of course, must exercise care not to pry into the private lives of the believers to ensure that they are behaving properly…."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=22 March 1987 | title=Letter written to an individual | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993}} }}&lt;br&gt;"…the Faith does not recognize homosexuality as a "natural" or permanent phenomenon. Rather, it sees this as an aberration subject to treatment, however intractable exclusive homosexuality may now seem to be. To the question of alteration of homosexual bents, much study must be given, and doubtless in the future clear principles of prevention and treatment will emerge. As for those now afflicted, a homosexual does not decide to be a problem human, but he does, as you rightly state, have decision in choosing his way of life, i.e. abstaining from homosexual acts.&lt;br&gt;"Your plea for understanding and of justice extended to homosexuals is well taken in many respects, and the House of Justice assures you of its concern for the large number of persons so afflicted. Your work with the homosexual community is praiseworthy, and it permits you personally to exercise the support which is necessary for these often harassed persons, support which you call for in your essay. Moreover, your interest cannot but be therapeutic, at least for the more superficial elements of the problem; however, definitive therapy of the underlying predisposition, which you consider to be innate but the Teachings do not, may have to await additional investigations. As for the responsibility of Assemblies and of individual Bahá’ís, certainly all are called upon to be understanding, supportive and helpful to any individual who carries the burden of homosexuality."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=30 June 1988 | title=Letter | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993}} }}&lt;br&gt;"As you know, Bahá'u'lláh has clearly forbidden the expression of sexual love between individuals of the same sex. However, the doors are open for all of humanity to enter the Cause of God, irrespective of their present circumstance; this invitation applies to homosexuals as well as to any others who are engaged in practices contrary to the Bahá'í teachings. Associated with this invitation is the expectation that all believers will make a sincere and persistent effort to eradicate those aspects of their conduct which are not in conformity with Divine Law."

*{{cite web | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=9 December 1991 | title=Application of Law | url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_application_bahai_law | ref=harv }}&lt;br&gt;"A survey of the letters written on behalf of the Guardian shows that he advised the National Spiritual Assemblies that they should resort to the severe sanction of deprivation of a believer's administrative rights only for such matters as 'disgraceful conduct, flagrantly contrary to our Teachings', 'seriously injuring the Faith in the eyes of the public through his conduct or flagrantly breaking the laws of God', 'gross immorality and open opposition to the administrative functions of the Faith, and disregard for the laws of personal status', 'conduct which is disgracing the Cause', and 'breaking of laws, such as the consent of parents to marriage', or 'acts of such an immoral character as to damage the good name of the Faith'.&lt;p&gt;"It is clear that the removal of voting rights is a serious action which an Assembly should take reluctantly when the circumstances require that the Bahá'í community or its reputation in the eyes of the public must be protected from the effects of an individual's behaviour, and where the authority of the laws of the Faith must be upheld. It should be the hope and prayer of the Assembly that the believer who has been administratively expelled from membership in the Bahá'í community will come to see that his behaviour is in violation of the teachings, will endeavour to rectify his conduct, and will thus open the way to being welcomed back into the community so that he can lend his support to the vital and glorious task of establishing the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=16 March 1992a | title=Letter | ref=harv | postscript=. Cited in {{harvnb|Homosexuality|1993}} }}&lt;br&gt;"Human beings suffer from many problems, both physical and psychological. Some are the result of the individual's own behaviour, some are caused by the circumstances in which he grew up, some are congenital. Some human beings are born blind, some suffer from incapacitating accidents or diseases. Such conditions present the individual affected, and those around him, with serious problems, and it is one of the challenges of the human condition that all those concerned should strive to overcome such problems and have understanding and sympathy for the individual so afflicted.&lt;br&gt;"There is a wide range of sexual abnormalities. Some people nowadays maintain that homosexuality is not an abnormality and that homosexuals should be encouraged to establish sexual relations with one or more partners of the same sex. The Faith, on the contrary, makes it abundantly clear that homosexuality is an abnormality, is a great problem for the individual so afflicted, and that he or she should strive to overcome it. The social implications of such an attitude are very important.&lt;br&gt;"...If a homosexual cannot so overcome his or her condition to the extent of being able to have a heterosexual marriage, he or she must remain single, and abstain from sexual relations. These are the same requirements as for a heterosexual person who does not marry.&lt;br&gt;"This law is no reason for Bahá'ís to consider homosexuals as outcasts. If they are not Bahá'ís there is also no reason to expect them to obey the Bahá'í law in this respect any more than we would expect a non-Baha i to abstain from drinking alcohol."

*{{citation | author=Universal House of Justice | author-link=Universal House of Justice | date=17 September 1993 | title=Letter to an individual | url=http://www.bnasaa.org/sexuality.html/%23homosexuality | ref=harv | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://archive.li/20091028101940/http://www.bnasaa.org/sexuality.html/%23homosexuality | archivedate=28 October 2009 | df= }}&lt;br&gt;"The statistics which indicate that homosexuality is incurable are undoubtedly distorted by the fact that many of those who overcome the problem never speak about it in public, and others solve their problems without even consulting professional counsellors.&lt;br&gt;"Bahá'í Assemblies can testify to the number of Bahá'ís who, although having had homosexual orientations, have been able to lead normally happy married lives and raise families.&lt;br&gt;"Nevertheless there are undoubtedly cases in which the individual finds himself (or herself) unable to eliminate a physical attraction to members of the same sex, even though he succeeds in controlling his behaviour. This is but one of the many trials and temptations to which human beings are subject in this life. For Bahá'ís it cannot alter the basic concept taught by Bahá'u'lláh, that the kind of sexuality purposed by God is the love between a man and a woman, and that its primary (but not its only) purpose is the bringing of children into this world and providing them with a loving and protective environment in which they can be reared to know and love God.&lt;br&gt;"The condition of being sexually attracted to some object other than to a mature member of the opposite sex, a condition of which homosexuality is but one manifestation, is regarded by the Faith as a distortion of true human nature, as a problem to be overcome, no matter what specific physical or psychological condition may be the immediate cause. Any Bahá'í who suffers from such a disability should be treated with understanding, and should be helped to control and overcome it. All of us suffer from imperfections which we must struggle to overcome and we all need one another’s understanding and patience.&lt;br&gt;"To regard homosexuals with prejudice and disdain would be entirely against the spirit of Bahá'í teachings. A Bahá'í who has a homosexual orientation is not automatically barred from Bahá'í community life or acceptance or excluded from worship. It is only as a result of behaviour which flagrantly violates the laws and principles of the Faith that a Bahá'í would be advised and cautioned and, if he did not rectify his behaviour, would be deprived of his or her administrative rights."

The Bahá'í position should be patiently explained to such persons, who should also be given to understand that although in their hearts they may accept Bahá'u'lláh, they cannot join the Bahá'í community in the current condition of their relationship. They will then be free to draw their own conclusions and act accordingly. Within this context, the question you pose about the possibility of the removal of administrative rights should, therefore, not arise."

The '''International New Thought Alliance''' (INTA) is an umbrella organization for New Thought adherents "dedicated to serving the New Thought Movement’s various branches, organizations and individuals".&lt;ref name="website"&gt;[http://newthoughtalliance.org/ International New Thought Alliance website], accessed May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The antecedents of the International New Thought Alliance date back to an 1899 [[New England]] convention of the Metaphysical Club,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 327.  Dresser, p. 195, who says "out of its [the Metaphysical Club's] efforts there came in time the first really international organization".  Miller states that the conference was in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] while Dresser states that the convention was held at "Lorimer Hall, [[Tremont Temple]], Boston, October 24–26, 1899".&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first [[New Thought]] organizations,&lt;ref&gt;Dresser (p. 183) calls it the "first permanent New Thought club". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' says "this society, through its active propaganda, was the first which made a determined effort to spread its views and try to gain a general following" (p. 538).&lt;/ref&gt; formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1895 by, among others, L. B. Macdonald, J. W. Lindy and Frederick Reed.  The first public lecture sponsored by the club was an address by [[Julia Ward Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;Dresser, pp.  181-182.&lt;/ref&gt; This convention led to the founding of the International Metaphysical League the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Dresser, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;  This League held the "International New Thought Convention" in Chicago in 1903, which was followed by similar conventions in 1906 and 1907.  In 1908, the organization was renamed the "National New Thought Alliance".  This organization held national conventions annually through 1914. The first international convention, held in [[London, England]] June 21–26, 1914, saw the renaming and re-organizing of the National New Thought Alliance into the International New Thought Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Satter, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Thought Bulletin'' was the newsletter for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] held a New Thought Day on August 28, 1915. The following day opened the [[First International New Thought Congress]], held until September 5. The first International New Thought Alliance Annual World Congress was held here, with a variety of New Thought luminaries leading the organization, such as [[James A. Edgerton]], [[Annie Rix Militz]], [[Thomas Troward]], and many others. Throughout its history, other New Thought notables such as [[William Walker Atkinson]], [[Clara Bewick Colby]], [[Florence Crawford]], [[Horatio W. Dresser]], [[George Wharton James]], Edgar L. Larkin, [[Orison Swett Marden]], and [[Elizabeth Towne]] were involved in the INTA.

The organization continues to conduct its Annual World Congress, publishes ''[[New Thought magazine]]'', and asserts that it houses the largest New Thought Archives known.&lt;ref name="website" /&gt;

'''Irving Penn''' (June 16, 1917{{spaced ndash}}October 7, 2009)&lt;ref name="Grundberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08penn.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=Irving Penn, Fashion Photographer, Is Dead at 92|last=Grundberg|first=Andy|date=2009-10-07|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American photographer known for his [[fashion photography]], [[portraits]], and [[still life]]s.  Penn's career included work at [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]], and independent advertising work for clients including [[Issey Miyake]] and [[Clinique]].  His work has been exhibited internationally and continues to inform the art of photography.

==Biography==
Penn was born to a [[Russian Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/bonnie_and_clyde_director_arthur_penn_dies_at_88_20100929/ Jewish Journal: "‘Bonnie and Clyde’ director Arthur Penn dies at 88" by Danielle Berrin] September 29, 2010 (Age 0)&lt;/ref&gt; on June 16, 1917 in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], to Harry Penn and Sonia Greenberg. Penn's younger brother, [[Arthur Penn]], was born in 1922 and would go on to become a film director and producer. Penn attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (now the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]) from 1934 to 1938, where he studied drawing, painting, graphics, and industrial arts under [[Alexey Brodovitch]]. While still a student, Penn worked under Brodovitch at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' which published several of Penn's drawings.

Penn worked for two years as a freelance designer and making his first amateur photographs before taking Brodovitch's position as the art director at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] in 1940. Penn remained at Saks Fifth Avenue for a year before leaving to spend a year painting and taking photographs in Mexico and across the US. When Penn returned to New York, [[Alexander Liberman]] offered him a position as an associate in the [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]] Art Department. Penn worked on layout for the magazine before Liberman asked him to try photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Penn|first=Irving|title=Passage|year=1991|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-40491-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn's first photographic cover for ''Vogue'' magazine appeared in October 1943. The art department of the Office of War Information in London offered him a job as an "artist-photographer" but he volunteered with the [[American Field Service]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d22dvihj4pfop3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2017/05/01152009/AFS-Janus-2010-January.pdf|title=AFS Janus - January 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Naples with a boatload of American troops in November 1944. Penn drove an ambulance in support of the [[British Eighth Army]] as it alternately waited out weather and slogged its way north through a miserable winter in the Italian [[Apennines]]. In July 1945, he was transferred from Italy to India. He photographed the soldiers, medical operations, and camp life for the AFS, and various subjects while bivouacked in India. He sailed back to New York in November 1945.

Penn continued to work at ''Vogue'' throughout his career, photographing covers, portraits, still lifes, fashion, and photographic essays. In the 1950s, Penn founded his own studio in New York and began making advertising photographs.  Over the years, Penn's list of clients grew to include [[General Foods]], [[De Beers]], [[Issey Miyake]], and [[Clinique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenough|first=Sarah|title=Irving Penn Platinum Prints|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10906-7|pages=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn met Swedish fashion model [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] at a photo shoot in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Irving Penn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/6272245/Irving-Penn.html|date=2009-10-08|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mightypenn&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mighty Penn|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguedaily/2009/10/the-mighty-penn/|date=July 2007|work=Vogue|author=Fraser, Kennedy|df=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the two married at [[Chelsea Register Office]], and two years later Lisa gave birth to their son, Tom Penn, who would go on to become a metal designer.&lt;ref name=mightypenn /&gt; Lisa Fonssagrives died in 1992. Penn died aged 92 on October 7, 2009&lt;ref&gt;https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/irving-penn-92-is-dead/?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; at his home in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08penn.html ''New York Times'' obituary by Andy Grundberg, October 8, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"/&gt;

==Photography==
Best known for his fashion photography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gan|first=Vicky|title=Iconic Photography by the Legendary Irving Penn Comes to the American Art Museum|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/iconic-photography-by-the-legendary-irving-penn-comes-to-the-american-art-museum-25926352/|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn's repertoire also includes portraits of creative greats; ethnographic photographs from around the world; [[Modernist]] still lifes of food, bones, bottles, metal, and found objects; and photographic travel essays.&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quintana"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurría-Quintana|first=Angel|title=Irving Penn retrospective|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1a5c191a-1ce5-11df-aef7-00144feab49a.html#axzz2qhTe2IjK|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn was among the first photographers to pose subjects against a simple grey or white backdrop and he effectively used it's simplicity.&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|title=Irving Penn, 92: Fashion, Celebrity Photographer Found Beauty in the Commonplace|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/07/AR2009100703848.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=8 October 2009|author2=Rees-Shapiro, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quintana"/&gt;  Expanding his austere studio surroundings, Penn constructed a set of upright angled backdrops, to form a stark, acute corner. Subjects photographed with this technique included [[Martha Graham]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

Penn's still life compositions are sparse and highly organized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jffrank.com/home/latest/london-photography-exhibitions-7-january-2016/|title=London Photography Exhibitions January 2016|date=2016-01-07|newspaper=jfFrank online|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; assemblages of food or objects that articulate the abstract interplay of line and volume. Penn's photographs are composed with a great attention to detail, which continues into his craft of developing and making prints of his photographs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Photography Exhibitions November 2017|url=https://www.jffrank.com/home/latest/london-photography-exhibitions-november-2017/|website=jfFrank online|publisher=jfFrank|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Penn experimented with many printing techniques, including prints made on aluminum sheets coated with a platinum emulsion rendering the image with a warmth that untoned silver prints lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenough|first=Sarah|title=Irving Penn Platinum Prints|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10906-7|pages=5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His black and white prints are notable for their deep contrast, giving them a clean, crisp look.

While steeped in the Modernist tradition, Penn also ventured beyond creative boundaries. The exhibition ''Earthly Bodies'' consisted of series of posed nudes whose physical shapes range from thin to plump; while the photographs were taken in 1949 and 1950, they were not exhibited until 1980.

The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM)]] possesses a large collection of Penn's works, including a silver gelatin print of Penn's ''The Tarot Reader'', a photograph from 1949 of [[Jean Patchett]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Bridget Bate Tichenor|Bridget Tichenor]].&lt;ref name="Irving Penn"&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=19489 The Tarot Reader (Jean Patchett and Bridget Tichenor) - New York 1949 by Irving Penn SAAM]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the museum received 100 images as a gift from the Irving Penn Foundation, significantly increasing the number of Penn's works in the collection to 161 images.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Southall (August 9, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/irving-penn-photographs-to-bolster-smithsonian-collection/ Irving Penn Photographs to Bolster Smithsonian Collection] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irving Penn Foundation's gift forms the basis of the exhibition, ''Irving Penn: Beyond Beauty'', which is on view at SAAM before traveling to other museum venues around the United States.&lt;ref name=beyondbeauty /&gt;

==Quotations==
:"Photographing a cake can be art." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photo-seminars.com/Fame/irving_penn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209043128/http://www.photo-seminars.com/Fame/irving_penn.htm |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A good photograph is one that communicates a fact, touches the heart, and leaves the viewer a changed person for having seen it; it is in one word, effective." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn.

:"Sensitive people faced with the prospect of a camera portrait put on a face they think is one they would like to show the world. ...Very often what lies behind the facade is rare and more wonderful than the subject knows or dares to believe." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn, 1975.

:"I found pictures trying to show peoples in their natural circumstances generally disappointing [but] feel secure in the artificial circumstances of the studio [accepting] for myself a stylization that I felt was more valid than a simulated naturalism." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L., “Ethnographic Portraits, 1967-71.” Pp. 212-219, 366-367.

== Origin ==
The term “Islamopolitan” was coined in 2014 by the Italian artist Giuseppe Moscatello and the Emirati designer Khalid Shafar. They co-curated an [[art exhibition]] at Maraya Art Centre with the same name to highlight the universal topic and dialogue between Islam and design. The structure of work and daily life, religion, architecture, rituals and decoration have been interpreted in relation to the present day. Designers of twelve different nationalities present works that take a contemporary look at the rituals of an ancient culture, through the media of furniture, jewellery, photography, video, art, installations, objects, upholstery, carpets, fashion, ceramics and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamopolitan exhibit a proposed conversation between Islam and design|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/art/islamopolitan-exhibit-a-proposed-conversation-between-islam-and-design#full|website=The National|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual pieces each highlight the Islamic spirit but leave the issue of interpretation up to the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shafar|first1=Khalid|title=Islamopolitan|url=http://www.designdaysdubai.ae/news/more-news/2014/06/islamopolitan/|website=Design Days Dubai|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''LaMerhav''''' ({{Lang-he|למרחב}}) was a [[Hebrew language]] daily newspaper published in [[Israel]] between 1954 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00586.html AḤDUT HA-AVODAH-PO'ALEI ZION] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper was owned by the [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] party and later [[HaKibbutz HaMeuhad]], and was edited by Yisrael Even-Nur, [[Moshe Carmel]] and David Padhatzor, though most of its articles were written by [[Yisrael Galili]].

==History==
The paper's first edition was released on 2 June 1954, when it was defined as a political magazine. In December 1954 it became a daily newspaper following the party's separation from Mapam. In 1968 control of the newspaper passed to [[HaKibbutz HaMeuhad]] following the merger of Ahdut HaAvoda into the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]]. The last edition was published on 31 May 1971, with the paper merged into the Histadrut-affiliated [[Davar]], which was officially renamed "''Davar - Meuhad Im LaMerhav''" (lit. ''Davar - united with LaMerhav'').

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Lachoneus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|n|i|ə|s}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «la-kō´nē-us»&lt;/ref&gt;  was the [[chief judge]] of the [[Nephites]] during the time of the birth of Christ, or AD 1, the 92nd year of the [[Nephites#Judges|reign of the judges]]. His reign started at a date unknown but not earlier than about 23-20 BC, the approximate time of the assassination of chief judge [[List of Book of Mormon people#C|Cezoram]] ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=1|verse=1|range=}}).

No record of his life prior to the year AD 16 exists. In this year [[Giddianhi]], leader of the band of [[Gadianton robbers]] at the time, sent Lachoneus a letter demanding that the Nephites surrender or be destroyed. Lachoneus rejected the demands and began preparations for war. He commanded his people to gather together in one place and there build fortifications against the robbers, appointed captains including [[Gidgiddoni]], "great commander all the armies of the Nephites." Both Lachoneus and Gidgiddoni were great prophets, and both preached repentance to the Nephites ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=|range=}}). The people accepted the leadership and counsel of these two great prophet-leaders, and the Nephites were eventually victorious ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=6|verse=6|range=}}).

Lachoneus died about AD 30 and was succeeded by his son, also named [[#Lachoneus II, son of Lachoneus|Lachoneus]].

==Lachoneus II, son of Lachoneus==
'''Lachoneus II''', son of the above Lachoneus, succeeded his father as chief judge. He reigned for one year before the [[king-men]] assassinated him as part of an attempt to establish a monarchy. The monarchy was never established nor a new judge instated; the central government instead crumbled to be replaced by a tribal structure ({{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=6|verse=19|range=}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=7|verse=1|range=-4|nobook=}}).

{{Liberal Catholic Movement sidebar}}

The '''Liberal Catholic Movement''' refers to those churches whose foundation traces back to the founding bishops of the [[Liberal Catholic Church]]. It is different from the [[Roman Catholic Church]].  The Liberal Catholic Movement is one of the most recognized [[Old Catholic]] groups in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, William J. Separated Brethren: A Survey Of Protestant, Anglican, Eastern Orthodox And Other Denominations in the United States. P. 153&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated total worldwide membership of 45,000.

== Movement background ==

The founding bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church was [[J. I. Wedgwood]] who was ordained as a priest in the [[Old Catholic]] movement on July 22, 1913 by [[Arnold Harris Mathew]] (whose membership in the Union of Utrecht was terminated in 1910).  Thus all Liberal Catholic churches claim to trace their [[apostolic succession]] back to [[Rome]] through Old Catholicism.

==Differences of Opinion==

===First schism and the LCCI===
In 1941, there was a schism in the Liberal Catholic Church in the United States, surrounding a controversy involving Bishop [[Charles Hampton (bishop)|Charles Hampton]] who, while he was himself a Theosophist, wished to keep adherence to Theosophical tenets optional for the clergy.  This was in keeping with what was taken to be the original intent of the church's founders who, although they were Theosophists, wanted the church to remain primarily open to everyone.

The controversy surrounding Bishop Hampton led to a legal battle in the United States which eventually split into two different divisions, both of which claimed to be the Liberal Catholic Church. [[Frank W. Pigott]], the church's 3rd Presiding Bishop in England, who held to a more Theosophical ideal for the church, removed Hampton and then ordered the confiscation of certain church property at the regionary headquarters in California and forced the resignation of those clergy under Hampton who refused to support his new [[bishop|episcopal]] replacement.  At the time the majority of Liberal Catholics in the United States supported Hampton and saw his removal from the office of regionary and the other subsequent proceedings as a breach of canon law and a violation of some of the laws of California under which the church had been incorporated in America.  These clergy continued on their own and won the right to be called the Liberal Catholic Church in the United States (while being called the [[Liberal Catholic Church International]] in the rest of the world).  Those who followed Bishop Pigott in England became known in America as The [[Liberal Catholic Church, Province of the United States of America]]. Both divisions have similar structures of government and administration.

After Frank W. Pigott retired as the Presiding Bishop, and after attempts at a reconciliation, some of the clergy in the LCCI returned to the [[Liberal Catholic Church, Province of the United States of America]]. Bishop Hampton died before the litigation was settled.  While some clergy wish for more cooperation between the two divisions, they still exist independently.

===The LCC Schism===

In 2003 the issue of the limitation of the right of a bishop to ordain candidates of his choice gave rise to a schism into two groups: a 'conservative' and a more 'liberal' one. The ordination of women was the primary point of conflict.

The 'liberal' parishes in the Dutch, Belgian and Canadian provinces elected their own Episcopal Synod under the presidency of the Right Reverend Tom Degenaars, continuing to use the name 'the Liberal Catholic Church'.  In 2003 the new General Episcopal Synod declared that women may be ordained.  As of 2007 this Synod was represented in the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Cameroon, both Congos, and Sweden.

The 'conservatives' remained under the presidency of the Right Reverent Ian Hooker.  In 2002 the 'conservative' wing opened 'The Order of Our Lady' as an alternative for women seeking ordination. Representation of the original Synod continues its presence worldwide.

Since both groups call themselves The Liberal Catholic Church, distinguishing between the two may be confusing.  It has been suggested that the 'liberal' synod be known as the 'reform' synod.&lt;ref&gt;Rt. Rev. Maurice Warnon, Liberal Catholic Church in the USA Newsletter, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===LCC Theosophia Synod===

Right Reverend Ernest W.Jackson had been the Regionary Bishop of The Liberal Catholic Church Province of Canada. The GES of the LCC deposed Jackson and dissolved the Province of Canada.  Jackson then founded the Liberal Catholic Church Theosophia Synod, 1982.

===The Old Catholic Apostolic Church===

Founded by a small autocephalous group of Christians in 1999, it was first called the British Liberal Free Church and then later the Society of the Divine Spirit (SDS). Subsequent developments saw the evolution of the SDS into the English Liberal Free Church (ELFC). In 2006, it underwent a major change. Specifically, those on its ministerial team set in place a reorganization and renewal of its mission. Having used the name Independent Old Catholic Church of the Utrecht Succession (IOCCUS) in the interim period, the Presiding Bishop announced on 1 January 2007 that the denomination would bear the name The Liberal Rite.

In 2008, following a year of significant growth, in which John Kersey was consecrated to the episcopacy for the [[Apostolic Episcopal Church]] by Archbishop [[Bertil Persson (bishop)|Bertil Persson]] and the addition of the orders of the Ancient Catholic Church of Archbishop Harold Percival Nicholson, The Liberal Rite was renamed the Liberal Catholic Apostolic Church (LCAC). In 2010, a major split took place. The more esoteric members formed under the [[Ecclesia Apostolica Divinorum Mysteriorum]], with Archbishop Kersey becoming the Prince-Abbot of the [[Abbey-Principality of San Luigi]]. The remaining members of the LCAC continued working in the denomination before changing the name of the church to the [http://www.liberalcatholics.co.uk/index.html Old Catholic Apostolic Church] in 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberalcatholics.co.uk/canons.pdf Canon Law of the Old Catholic Apostolic Church]. July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect its now dominant Old Catholic membership. The current Presiding Bishop is [http://www.liberalcatholics.co.uk/glover.html Adrian Glover], consecrated to the episcopacy in 2009 by John Kersey. He was joined in 2015 by Bridget Wilson Hall, consecrated by Adrian Glover and Bishop Louise Lombard. Later Brishop Bridget founded The Liberal Catholic Universalist Church.

===Old Catholic Church of British Columbia===

The Old Catholic Church of British Columbia was established in 1921 as in independent communion.  They use the [[Liberal Rite]] in their church.  In 2006, the church was granted conditional status as a member of the [[Utrecht Union]].  This lasted only a short period, as they withdrew from the Union the following year due to differences of opinion.

===Reformed LCC===

In the United Kingdom another Liberal Catholic Jurisdiction exists under the leadership of Bishop Richard Palmer. This Church was founded by mandate in May 1999 and is known as 'The Reformed Liberal Catholic Church ([[Old Catholic]])'. The RLCC does not emphasise [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[vegetarianism]] nor belief in the Masters as it holds that the individual has the right to choose whether to subscribe to these beliefs and practices.

Palmer was consecrated to the episcopate in the 'conservative' wing in 1997 and subsequently [[consecrated]] Professor Elizabeth Stuart of the  [[University of Winchester]] as a bishop in the Open Episcopal Church on 10 April 2003 at the chapel of [[Royal Holloway]], Egham assisted by Bishop Jonathan Blake and Bishop Michael Wilson. Stuart has since left the [[Open Episcopal Church]] and has been appointed the regionary [[bishop]] for the British Province of the Liberal Catholic Church International.

===The Church of Saint Thomas Int===
Another Liberal Catholic Jurisdiction exists under the leadership of Bishop David D.La Rochelle (David Lindley). This Church was founded by mandate in May 2009 and is known as [[The Church of Saint Thomas Int.]] (Old Catholic)'. The CSTI does not emphasise theosophy, vegetarianism nor belief in the Masters as it holds that the individual has the right to choose whether to subscribe to these beliefs and practices.

Bishop La Rochelle was consecrated to the episcopate March 7, 2009 in Southampton,UK by Bishop Palmer (RLCC)

Bishop La Rochelle holds the RLCC USA mandate as an ordaining body. The St.Thomas jurisdiction also serves as the North American Province of The EVCL.

===Universal Catholic Church===

In April 2007, former LCCI Presiding Bishop Dean Bekken, Bishop Alain Miller, several Priests and St Francis Parish of San Diego left the LCCI to form the Liberal Catholic Church of California, later renamed the [[Universal Catholic Church]].  In 2008 Bishop Bekken elevated Father Robert Winzens to the Episcopate.

===Young Rite===

In 2006 another reform resulted in the formation of a new group called the Young Rite. The past Presiding Bishop of the "mother" Liberal Catholic Church, Johannes van Alphen, who had resigned from the LCC in 2002, had consecrated Mario Manuel Herrera (in 2002) who in turn had consecrated Benito Rodriguez Cruz (in 2005). These three bishops consecrated to the episcopacy + Marcus van Alphen,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youngrite.org/what-is-it/apostolic-succession/&lt;/ref&gt; a former priest of the Dutch Liberal Catholic Church, in June 2006 in Hilversum, The Netherlands. Bishop Johannes subsequently joined the Young Rite and remained active in it until his death on the 25th of January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcc.cc/yr/news/200901.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706215604/http://lcc.cc/yr/news/200901.htm |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 the bishops of the Young Rite and bishop (Aristid Havilcek of Slovenia) to the episcopacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youngrite.org/what-is-it/consecration-aristid/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225102726/http://www.youngrite.org/what-is-it/consecration-aristid/ |archivedate=2013-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, +Domen Kocevar was consecrated bishop at Celje in Slovenia, by +Marcus van Alphen, +Aristid Havilcek, +Alistair Bate and +Bruno Pedrini.

Bishop Marcus started the Young Rite as an autocephalous group operating within the Liberal Catholic tradition, yet separate from any of the Liberal Catholic Church organizations. Although the Young Rite shares many beliefs and customs with the Liberal Catholic Church and derives its apostolic succession from it, they are not affiliated with any of the Liberal Catholic Church organizations. The major difference between the traditional LCC and the Young Rite lies in the abolition of the separation between clergy and congregation. Everyone is allowed to request and receive ordination up to and including the priesthood. The book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youngrite.org/resources/training-materials/ The Pillars of the Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; expounds further on the doctrine and philosophy regarding this rite. The Young Rite operates in Slovenia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skc-slo.si Svobodna Katoliška Cerkev]&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Greece, the Netherlands, Canada and the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheYoungRiteUsa&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ascended Church of Christ===

In 2014 the Liberal Orthodox Church Universal changed its name to The Ascended Church of Christ. In 2009 Bishop Teklemariam Gezahagne, presiding Patriarch of the Ethiopian Apostolic Church, commissioned and ordained the Rev. Didymos Judas Thomas(W. L. Vincent) as the presiding Patriarch of North American branch of the EAC. The EAC draws its Apostolic succession from a unique line descending from the Apostle Philip and being passed forward in the Ethiopian Churches. As newly appointed Patriarch D. Judas Thomas changed the name of the North American Church to the Liberal Orthodox Church Universal. In 2014 Patriarch Didymos Judas Thomas was appointed as the reigning patriarch of all Churches in the LOCU  and forthwith changed the name of the Church to the Ascended Church of Christ. The Church has since focused on establishing communities and training ministers to expand the Church worldwide. Also in 2014 the ACC opened Alpha &amp; Omega Institute, a distance learning Seminary with the mission of training laymen and clergy for service in the Church.

===The Liberal Catholic Union===
The Liberal Catholic Union is an autocephalous branch of the Liberal Catholic Movement formed after the Consecration of Tau Meinrad(Michael Robert Lawrence) McDonald, OSM/EBOE to the office of Bishop in the old/Liberal Catholic and Gnostic lineages of Apostolic succession held by Tau [[Michael Bertiaux]]  through Tau [[Allen H. Greenfield]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/gnostickos/bbishopsmcdonald&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with several Bishops and Clergy the Liberal Catholic Union formed as a vehicle for reintroducting Theosophical context that they felt had been stripped from common Liberal Catholic Practice.  The LCU creates a distinct practice through the incorporation and infusion of not only Theosophical but French Gnostic theological concepts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liberalcatholicunion.com/who-we-are&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church is active in several states with its largest community established in Indiana.  The LCU does not have a seminary and instead relies on the "apprentice" method that they believe was originally the model of training used in the early Christian community.
The Liberal Catholic Union is seen as a heavily esoteric order and promotes such practices as open communion offered to Christians as well as Non Christians without distinction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.liberalcatholicunion.com/the-foundation-document&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences of various branches==

*The (original)General Episcopal Synod of The Liberal Catholic Church worldwide permits its [[clergy]] to believe in such Theosophical tenets as [[reincarnation]] and the [[ascended master]]s. It encourages its priests and its bishops to have a [[vegetarian]] diet and to refrain from using [[tobacco]] as well as [[alcohol]]. Significantly it also continues to require [[deacon]]s, [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s to be male.
*The (new) GES of the Liberal Catholic Church (Dutch, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Sweden), retains the emphasis on the tenets defined by the founders of the Liberal Catholic Church, but practices the [[ordination of women]] to the [[Holy Orders]], including the episcopate.
*The Liberal Catholic Church International does not as a group require any belief in theosophical tenets, while it continues to accept them if they are the personal choice of the individual.  Since 2004, the Liberal Catholic Church International opens the [[ordination of women]] to all [[Holy Orders]] up to and including bishop.
*The Reformed Liberal Catholic Church began facilitating the ordination of women to all orders before other branches of the Liberal Catholic Church. It doesn't emphasise theosophy but holds that theosophy is a lens through which we can gain a deeper and broader understanding of religion. Clergy and laity are free to accept or reject this, but are expected to accept those who have differing views.
*The Church of Saint Thomas Int. Ordination of women to all orders. There are no barriers to holy orders for any qualified individual. It doesn't emphasise theosophy but holds that theosophy is a lens through which we can gain a deeper and broader understanding of religion. Clergy and laity are free to accept or reject this, but are expected to accept those who have differing views. CSTI does concentrate on the teachings of the founding Bishops of the Liberal Catholic Church in the training of Clergy.
*The Universal Catholic Church, like the LCCI, does not require any belief in theosophical tenets, leaving that to the individual.  It practices the ordination of women to all Holy Orders, including the episcopate.
*The Ascended Church of Christ (formerly called the Liberal Orthodox Church Universal) under the direction of Patriarch Didymos Judas Thomas appointed 2014, permits its [[clergy]] to believe in such Theosophical tenets as [[reincarnation]]. It promotes ascetic practices such as dietary restriction and to refrain from using [[tobacco]] as well as [[alcohol]] abuse. It allows for the ordination of women into all offices.
*The Catholic Universalist Church places a special emphasis on the doctrine of [[Universal Reconciliation]]. Like the UCC, it does not require its lay faithful and clergy to believe in theosophical tenets, leaving that to the individual. It allows for the ordination of women to the episcopate, as well as members of the LGBT community.
* The Old Catholic Apostolic Church allows belief in theosophical tenets to remain a matter for personal belief, while seeing them as a vital part of its history. It ordains and consecrates those seen as qualified and called, regardless of gender, sexuality, or gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liberalcatholics.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbanded and inactive churches==

===International Liberal Catholic Church===

The International Liberal Catholic Church was founded in 1966 by Bishop Edmund Walter Sheehan and others who left the Liberal Catholic Church branch led by Bishop Edward M. Matthews. He had previously served as an auxiliary bishop under Bishop Charles Hampton. His disagreement with Matthews concerned administrative matters.

Sheehan linked the International Liberal Catholic Church to the Brotherhood of the Blessed Sacrament, a Dutch group which had broken with the British headquarters of the Liberal Catholic Church. The Brotherhood had originally sided with Matthews but had broken relations with him in 1962.

The International Liberal Catholic Church followed the Matthews faction in doctrinal and liturgical matters. While reporting 9 bishops, 25 clergy, and 3,000 members in 1969, the International Church dwindled to only a few parishes during the 1970s, and in the early 1980s was disbanded.

===Independent Catholic Church International===

The Independent Catholic Church International was formed in 1981 as both a new jurisdiction out of the Anglican heritage and an ecumenical body which related a variety of independent episcopal bodies, some out of the theosophical Liberal Catholic tradition. The first primate was Peter Wayne Goodrich. Goodrich resigned in 1983 and was succeeded by R. V. Bernard Dawe (b. 1925), who had been consecrated in 1980 and had served as the church's international legate.

As constituted, the small jurisdiction has freely developed interchanges with a variety of Old Catholic and Anglican jurisdictions and has remained open to theosophical currents. It is a member of the Synod of Independent Sacramental Churches.

===Free Liberal Catholic Church===

The Free Liberal Catholic Church was founded in 1975 by a group of Liberal Catholic priests including Bishops Donald M. Berry (1935- ) and John Russell (1920–1985). Bishop Berry was consecrated by Bishop William H. Daw of the Liberal Catholic Church International. Bishop Russell was consecrated by Bishop William A. Henley of the American Orthodox Catholic Church. Archbishop John Shelton Davis, vicar general at the time of the formation of the Free Liberal Catholic Church, is currently the presiding bishop. Davis was consecrated by Berry in 1979.

The Free Liberal Catholic Church follows the Liberal Catholic tradition. The [[Bible]] is accepted as the guide and rule of life by members and priests, but no one is required to subscribe to a creedal summary or to a particular formulation of faith. Freedom of inquiry is encouraged. There are seven sacraments that operate by the power of the [[Holy Spirit]] and depend for their efficacy on the clear conscience of the supplicant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The '''list  Christian holy sites in the Holy Land''' outlines sites within cities located in the [[Holy Land]] that are regarded as having a special significance to Christians, usually by association with Jesus or other persons mentioned in the [[New Testament]].

The identification of these are  sites became important during the [[Crusades]], when Christian [[pilgrims]] often sought out ''[[holy places]]'' in the [[Outremer]], especially in early 12th century immediately after the capture of [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Martin, ''The Knights Templar: The History &amp; Myths of the Legendary Military Order'', 2005. {{ISBN|1-56025-645-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for the Christian holy sites was the foundation of 19th-century European [[Biblical archaeology]] in [[Ottoman Syria]] and later [[Mandate Palestine]].

The holy sites in cities for Christians of all denominations are:
* The [[Calvary|Golgotha]] sometimes called Calvary: hill outside of ancient Jerusalem’s early 1st century walls that contains the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and the [[Church of All Nations]], but many other Christian institutions as well. Jerusalem is believed to be the site of some of Jesus's teaching, the [[Last Supper]] which is believed to have occurred at the [[Cenacle]], and the subsequent institution of the [[Holy Eucharist]] as well as His entombment; Christians believe he was crucified on a nearby hill.
* the city of [[Bethlehem]] with the [[Church of the Nativity]] is believed to mark the birthplace of Jesus, and also the Shepherd's Fields in the neighboring village of [[Beit Sahour]], the location of the angel's visitation to the shepherds to announce the birth of Christ.
* [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] in [[Basilica]] and [[Mary's Well]] in [[Nazareth]] which is believed to be Jesus's hometown, and the site of other holy places.
* [[Tzippori|Sephoria]] (Tzippori), where the [[Virgin Mary]] was said to have spent her childhood.
* Cave dwelling of [[John the Baptist]].
* [[Sidon]]
* tyre Lebanon 
* [[Damascus]]
* [[Qana]]
* Upper/Lower [[Galilee]]
* [[Mount Hermon]]
* [[Sea of Galilee]].
* The site of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on [[Mount Tabor, Israel|Mount Tabor]].
* The Jerusalem to [[Jericho]] road which was the location of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]]'s charity.
*The [[Mount of Temptation]] in Jericho which was the site of Satan's failed attempts to tempt Jesus.({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:8|NIV}})
*[[Jacob's Well]] in [[Nablus]] mentioned in {{bibleverse||John|4:5-6|NIV}} as the site where Jesus revealed to a Samaritan woman that he was the Messiah. ({{bibleverse||John|4:7-15|NIV}})
* [[Al-Maghtas]], this site has been recognized as the real (and only true) site where Jesus was baptized by all the major traditional Christian Churches. The site is in [[Jordan]]
* [[Machaerus]], the Herodias fortress where [[beheading of St. John the Baptist|John the Baptist]] was imprisoned and beheaded. The site is in [[Jordan]]
* [[Mount Nebo]], traditional site of the death of [[Moses]] and where he looked over to the "promised land". The site is in [[Jordan]]

The [[Society of the Divine Word]] or SVD missionaries work primarily where the Gospel has not been preached at all, or only insufficiently, and where the local Church is not yet viable on its own. The SVD's membership reflects the international nature of the congregation and representative of the areas of the world they serve. The SVD missionaries serve according to the needs of the local Church and the particular expertise they bring to the task.

In Asia, the SVDs are involved in education, especially in the [[Philippines]] and [[Japan]]. They are also involved in pastoral and developmental work, and other specialized ministries such as Bible apostolate, the youth, communications, and refugee apostolate in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. Their work in the [[United States]] involves the minority communities, especially [[African-American]] and [[Hispanic]] communities, as well as poor areas such as [[Appalachia]].

IMPORTANT: Do not add a name to this list unless they are notable for their atheism, and, in the case of living persons, self-identify as atheists. Entries that do not include a source reference will be deleted. Celebatheists is NOT a reliable source. A statement by a living person that they do not believe in God is not a sufficient criterion for inclusion in this list, neither is description in a third-party source as a self-confessed atheist. The person should have described themselves as an atheist in their own speech or writing, to satisfy the BLP policy requirements spelled out in [[WP:BLPCAT]].

Please make sure that you have read the criteria for posting on the list and that the person you are adding conforms to those standards. Also ensure that you are posting in the same format as the other entries (including date of birth and, where applicable, date of death).

Do not delete properly sourced entries without justification. Discuss it on the Talk page first, unless the entry is clearly nonsense or vandalism.

When adding nationalities, please disambiguate links where necessary. E.g., use [[England|English]] rather than just [[English]], since [[English]] is a disambiguation page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4423">The '''Moslem League of the Western Province''' was a [[political party]] in the [[Western Province (Eritrea)|Western Province]], [[Eritrea]]. The party was founded by [[Sheikh Ali Mohammed Mussa Radai]], whose family originally migrated from the [[Hejaz]] region in Western Saudi Arabia and later became the President of the Eritrean Assembly.&lt;ref name="spen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ammar, Woldeyesus. ''[http://www.nharnet.com/Archives/Arch_2005/Jan2005/WoldeyesusAmmar_Jan18.htm Blocco Indipendenza and Khartoum Meeting of the Opposition: What Similarities?]''&lt;/ref&gt; The party was formed after a split away from the [[Moslem League]] in 1949. The Moslem League of the Western Province was able to overtake half of the party membership of the pre-split Moslem League.&lt;ref&gt;Negash, Tekeste. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CBrImoJfFboC Eritrea and Ethiopia: The Federal Experience]''. New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1997. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Okbazgi Yohannes claims that the split was caused intrigues of behalf of the [[Italian Eritrea#British occupation and the end of the colony|British Military Administration]], who was able to convince Muslim chiefs that the Moslem League leader [[Ibrahim Sultan Ali]] was an [[Italy|Italian]] agent.&lt;ref name="yoh"&gt;Yohannes, Okbazghi. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sG41eDVRDnoC Eritrea, a pawn in world politics]''. Gainesville: Univ. of Florida Press, 1991. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; However this assertion is contested, as it overlooks internal social and political cleavages within the Eritrean Muslim community.&lt;ref name="ven"/&gt;

By late 1949, following the defection of the [[Independent Moslem League]], the party left the [[Independence Bloc]]. The Muslim League of the Western Province became the second of various factions that departed from the Independence Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.clarissa.it/documenti/scarica.php?id=38&amp;file=20080409145350LAQUESTIONEERITREA.doc La Questione Eritrea]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ven"&gt;Venosa, Joseph L. ''[http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/send-pdf.cgi/Venosa%20Joseph%20L.pdf?ohiou1187294262 Faith in the nation: examining the contributions of Eritrean Muslims in the nationalist movement, 1946-1961]''&lt;/ref&gt; The party sought to exclude [[Italian-Eritreans]] from the political process in the country, a policy that sharply contradicted the line of the Moslem League.&lt;ref name="ven"/&gt;

The party won 14&lt;!-- Several other sources say 15??? --&gt; out of 68 seats in the [[Eritrean Assembly election, 1952|1952 Eritrean Assembly election]] (which was held through direct [[suffrage]] in some cities, and indirect vote in other areas).&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, John H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w5q7NV-vSPwC Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years]''. [S.l.]: Tsehai Pub, 2006. pp. 249-250&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the Moslem League of the Western Province had called for continued British governance for a period of ten years, after which the future of the Western Province could be decided.&lt;ref name="spen"&gt;Spencer, John H. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w5q7NV-vSPwC Ethiopia at Bay: A Personal Account of the Haile Selassie Years]''. [S.l.]: Tsehai Pub, 2006. p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith-Simonsen, Christine. ''[http://www.ub.uit.no/munin/bitstream/10037/598/1/thesis.pdf Eritrea i våre hjerter? En studie av norske relasjoner til Eritrea]''&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1953, nine months after the Federation between Ethiopia and Eritrea had come into effect, the party began calling for the creation of an independent [[Beja people|Beja]] state, formed out of the Western Province of Eritrea and the Eastern Province&lt;!-- This would be the Kassala province, not the current Kassala state --&gt; of Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Negash, Tekeste. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CBrImoJfFboC Eritrea and Ethiopia: The Federal Experience]''. New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 1997. pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt; However, as it became clear to the party that the British would not support creating an independent state out of the Western Province the party began supporting unification with [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="spen"/&gt; At this point integration into Ethiopia appeared more favourable to the party than a possible integration into [[Sudan]], as it feared domination from Sudanese rival clans.&lt;ref name="spen"/&gt;

'''Multiculturalism and Christianity''' have a long historical association.  [[Christianity]] originated as a sect of [[Judaism]] in the [[Middle East]],&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R. Woodward | title =Religions of the World | publisher =Pearson | year =2005 | location =Saddle River, New Jersey | pages=290–1 | id =0131195158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Jesus]], the founder and central figure of Christianity, lived and held his ministry in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R. Woodward | title =Religions of the World | publisher =Pearson | year =2005 | location =Saddle River, New Jersey | pages=280 | id =0131195158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], an ethnic Jew&lt;ref&gt;Paul describes himself as "an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin, circumcised on the eighth day" {{Bibleverse|Phil|3:5|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was born and lived in the Middle East, holds such importance to Christianity that some call him the religion's "Second Founder".&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R. Woodward | title =Religions of the World | publisher =Pearson | year =2005 | location =Saddle River, New Jersey | pages=291–2 | id =0131195158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest influence on Christianity after Paul, [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Church Father]], a [[Doctor of the Church]], and an eminent [[theologian]], was North African.&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R. Woodward | title =Religions of the World | publisher =Pearson | year =2005 | location =Saddle River, New Jersey | pages=299 | id =0131195158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the influence of Paul, Christianity soon spread widely among non-Jews ([[Gentile]]s) of the [[Roman Empire]].

==Edict of Galerius==
The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Galerius]] issued an edict permitting the practice of the Christian religion under his rule in April 311.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius, [https://www.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#XXXIV ''De Mortibus Persecutorum''] ("On the Deaths of the Persecutors") ch. 35–34&lt;/ref&gt; In 313 [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] announced toleration of Christianity in the [[Edict of Milan]]. Constantine would become the first Christian emperor. By 391, under the reign of [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had become the most popular, or [[state religion]]. Constantine I, the first emperor to embrace Christianity, was also the first emperor to openly promote the newly legalized religion.  As the political boundaries of the Western Roman Empire diminished and then collapsed, Christianity spread beyond the old borders of the Empire and into lands that never had been Romanized.

==Age of Discovery==
The Age of Discovery began with the voyage of Christopher Columbus ''c''. 1492. It is characterized by European colonization of missionary activity.

During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] as well as other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism.

==Evangelization by Catholics and Protestants==
The most famous colonization by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelize the native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; The Puritans, or [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, and thus they set out for the New World and the hopes of a Puritan utopia.

==International Christianity in the Modern Era==
{{see also|Christianity by country}}
[[File:Christianity percent population in each nation World Map Christian data by Pew Research.svg|thumb|250px|Christianity by country]]
Christianity is a religion open to all [[human race|humanity]]&lt;ref name="hopfe"/&gt; that counts one out of every three people on earth among its members.&lt;ref name="hopfe"/&gt; [[The Christian world]] encompasses a greater area of land than that of any other religious territory.&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R. Woodward | title =Religions of the World | publisher =Pearson | year =2005 | location =Saddle River, New Jersey | pages=381 | id =0131195158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of both population and geography, Christianity is the world's largest religion.&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R. Woodward | title =Religions of the World | publisher =Pearson | year =2005 | location =Saddle River, New Jersey | pages=280, 381 | id =0131195158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Christianity contains a great diversity,&lt;ref name="hopfe"/&gt; and has followers from a wide range of ethnicities, nationalities, and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Predominant Religions | publisher =Adherents.com | url =http://www.adherents.com/adh_predom.html | accessdate =2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Europeans and non-Hispanic Whites are shrinking minorities in the Church.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Europe==
In his book ''Enlarging the Story: Perspectives on Writing World Christian History'', Richard Fox Young views the connection between Christianity and Eurocentrism as tenuous, and points to the [[postcolonial]] and non-European nature of the [[emerging Church]] and its impact on the development of World Christianity. In the postcolonial world, Christianity has lost its association with the West.&lt;ref name="hopfe"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hopfe | first =Lewis M. |author2=Mark R.

Died January 9, 2018.
'''Nema Andahadna''' was an occultist and writer best known for her magical writings about the [[Ma'at]]ian current. She practiced and wrote about [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]] (magical working, as defined by [[Aleister Crowley]]) for over twenty-five years. From her experience with [[Thelema|Thelemic]] magick (a system designed by Crowley), she developed her own system of magic called [[Maat Magick]] which has the aim of transforming the human race. Her writings have appeared in many publications, including the ''[[Cincinnati Journal of Ceremonial Magick]]'', ''[[Aeon (magazine)|Aeon]]'', ''[[Starfire (magazine)|Starfire]]'', and others.

In 1974, she [[channelled]] a short book called ''[[Wikisource:Liber Pennae Praenumbra|Liber Pennae Praenumbra]]''. Her ideas have been featured in the writings of [[Kenneth Grant]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Kenneth. ''Outside the Circles of Time'', Muller 1980, contains a lengthy account of the writing of Nema's ''Liber Pennae Praenumbra''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Kenneth. ''Beyond the Mauve Zone'', London: Starfire, 1999, contains a photo facsimile of ''Liber Pennae Praenumbra''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, she co-founded the Horus-Maat Lodge. According to [[Donald Michael Kraig]]:

{{quote|Nema has been one of the most influential occultists of the last quarter century although most occultists have never read her works. What Nema has done is influence those who have been writers and teachers. They, in turn, influenced the rest of us.&lt;ref&gt;Kraig, D. M. [http://www.nmrising.com/archive/issues/45/756.htm Review of ''Maat Magick'']. Retrieved Dec. 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Opus Sanctorum Angelorum''' (English: "Work of the Holy Angels"), more commonly known as '''Opus Angelorum''' (English: "Work of the Angels"; German: "Engelwerk"), is a [[Roman Catholic]] association which promotes devotion to [[angels]]. According to [[Pope]] [[Benedict XVI]] (2008) it was a public association of the Church in conformity with traditional doctrine and with the directives of the Holy See. It spreads devotion to the Holy Angels among the faithful, exhorts them to pray for priests, and promotes love for Christ in His Passion and union with it.&lt;ref name=CDF/&gt;

The association is active particularly in [[Austria]], where it originated, and in [[Germany]], but also in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]],  [[Mexico]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusangelorum.org/HistoryORC/Orderofcanonsregular.html Order of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes lay members, religious sisters and priests. Critics keep calling it a [[sect]] inside the Roman Catholic Church in spite of having been approved papally in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/aichach/Ingo-Dollinger-ist-tot-id41742436.html Christian Lichtenstern: ''Ingo Dollinger ist tot.''] [[Augsburger Allgemeine]], 16 of June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was often linked to the [[Catholic Scouts of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20161126004653/http://www.mainwelle.fm/news/realschule-auerbach-weitere-beweise-fuer-engelwerk-naehe-und-kondom-verteil-aktion-lassen-die ''Realschule Auerbach: Weitere Beweise für Engelwerk-Nähe und Kondom-Verteil-Aktion lassen die Schule nicht zur Ruhe kommen.''] [[Radio Mainwelle]], 13 of November 2001, retrieved from [[archive.org]] 26 of October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr.de/politik/engelwerk-zurueck-im-schoss-der-kirche-a-977161 Jörg Schindler: ''Zurück im Schoß der Kirche.''] [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 10 of October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Schneider: ''Sex-Streit von Auerbach: Wird er unterschätzt?'' [[Abendzeitung]] vom 9.&amp;nbsp;November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heiner Boberski: ''Das Engelwerk. Theorie und Praxis des Opus Sanctorum Angelorum.'' Otto Müller Verlag Salzburg 1993, pages 230 to 233. {{ISBN|3-7013-0853-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The association was founded in 1949 by a group of priests and seminarians in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, to seek the aid of the angels in support of the Church and the priesthood and for the salvation of souls.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.engelwerk.at/ueberuns/geschichte/geschichte.html Werk der Hl. Engel: Wer wir sind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013061250/http://www.engelwerk.at/ueberuns/geschichte/geschichte.html |date=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association drew inspiration from the accounts that [[Gabriele Bitterlich]] (1896-1978) gave of her [[private revelation]]s. She claimed to have received visions of the angels, including their names and their functions.

==Controversies==
===Vatican===

Some of Mrs Bitterlich's followers were circulating sensational theories of "spiritual warfare" between angels and demons, based on her writings.&lt;ref name=CNA&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/controversial-angels-religious-order-given-vatican-ok/ Controversial angels' order given Vatican OK]&lt;/ref&gt; In view of the controversy over these theories, Cardinal [[Joseph Höffner]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], wrote on 1 December 1977, shortly before the death of Mrs Bitterlich, to ask the [[Holy See]] to institute an enquiry.

The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] carried out the requested investigation and responded on 24 September 1983 with a [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19830924_card-hoffner_lt.html letter], known by its [[incipit]], ''Litteris diei'', which laid down:
#In fostering devotion to the Holy Angels, Opus Angelorum must respect the teaching of the Church and of the Holy Fathers and Doctors. In particular, it is not to spread a form of devotion to the Angels using the "names" derived from the alleged private revelation attributed to Mrs  Gabriele Bitterlich, nor may it use those names in any prayers of the community.
#Opus Angelorum is not to demand or even propose to its members what is called the Promise of Secrecy, although with regard to the internal affairs of the Opus Angelorum, it is lawful to maintain the discretion that befits members of the Church's institutes.
# The Opus Angelorum and its members will strictly observe the norms of the [[liturgy]], especially regarding the [[Eucharist]]. This holds in particular for the so-called "Communion of expiation".

This was followed up by a [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19920606_opus-angelorum_lt.html decree of 6 June 1992], which repeated the contents of the 1983 letter and, in view of incorrect interpretation and application of that letter, laid down the following rules:
#The theories originating from the alleged revelations of Mrs Gabriele Bitterlich concerning the world of the angels and their personal names, groupings and functions cannot be taught or in any way, whether explicitly or implicitly, be used in the organization and structure of the Opus Angelorum, such as its worship, prayers, spiritual formation, public or private spirituality, ministry and apostolate. The same rule holds for any other Church-approved institute or association.
#The various forms of acts of consecration to the angels used in the Opus Angelorum are prohibited
# Also prohibited are the so-called distance administration of the sacraments and the insertion into the [[Eucharist]]ic [[liturgy]] and the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] of texts, prayers and rites directly or indirectly related to the aforesaid theories.
#Exorcisms may be carried out only in line with the Church's norms and discipline on the matter, and with the use of formulas approved by the Church.
#A Delegate with special faculties, appointed by the Holy See, will in contact with the bishops oversee and promote  the application of these norms. He will also clarify and determine the relations between the Opus Angelorum and the Order of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19920606_opus-angelorum_lt.html Decree ''Litteris diei'' of 6 June 1992 on the Teaching and Particular Usages of the Opus Angelorum Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delegate chosen was the Dominican priest, Father Benoit Duroux, who handed over to another Dominican priest, Father Daniel Ols, in March 2010.&lt;ref name=CDF/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNA/&gt;

===Murder cases===
Until 2018 there were two reported cases of [[consummated]] [[murder]] linked legally to the "Work of the Holy Angels". Both murders were related to [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church]].

In [[India]]’s state of [[Kerala]], an [[exorcism]] performed by Opus Sanctorum Angelorum’s priests led to a case of [[murder]] in 1990. The involved priests had failed to report the exorcized person, who had committed [[sexual abuse of a minor|sexual abuse of minors]], to [[Law enforcement in India|Indian police]] although the report was mandatory according to [[Indian Penal Code]]. The OSA tried to justify abuse and murder with the fictitious "demons Dragon, Varina and Selithareth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=UuI7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT157&amp;lpg=PT157&amp;dq=dragon+varina+und+selithareth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jKx3GG23Zy&amp;sig=rP1PlV7RtFuJ2jyWmtKzHsMMfjE&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH1Zjs7-HZAhXRjqQKHXUMCPIQ6AEIbjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=dragon%20varina%20und%20selithareth&amp;f=false Heiner Boberski: ''Im Reich der Engel und Dämonen.''] Published in: [[Heiner Boberski]]: ''Mächtig – Männlich –Mysteriös.''

In 1994, the high-ranking Brazilian OSA member [[Frederico Cunha]] [[Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Coimbra|ORC]] was found guilty of first degree murder and sexual abuse of minors. Several Opus Sanctorum Angelorum priests had tried to cover up his crimes committed on the Portuguese Madeira Island in May 1992, bribing witnesses and instigating perjury. In April 1998 Cunha fled to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he still lived in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Axtmann: ''Engelwerk: Mord auf Madeira''.

Retrieved 22 of October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2014 several [[attempt|attempts]] of killing a German priest, who had left the OSA before, have failed. He returned to common Roman Catholic spiritual welfare after his survival.&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;[https://archive.is/UguMa Mariat: ''Wer hat das "Engelwerk" (Opus Angelorum) wirklich gegründet?''] [[Augsburger Allgemeine]], 1 of June 2014. Retrieved 26 of October 2018 from [[archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approval==

On 31 May 2000, a revised form of the Act of Consecration to the Angels was approved by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engelwerk.at/briefe/pdf/engelweihe.pdf Die Weihe an die heiligen Engel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314184209/http://www.engelwerk.at/briefe/pdf/engelweihe.pdf |date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

In the year 2002, a female branch of the Canons Regular, which is known as the Sisters of the Holy Cross, was established in Innsbruck.&lt;ref name=Storia&gt;[http://www.operadeisantiangeli.org/home/storia/ Storia dell’Opera dei Santi Angeli]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, 2003, the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life]] granted definitive approval to the [[Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Coimbra]], a [[religious institute]] founded in 1131 and, after becoming defunct in the 19th century, refounded in 1977, receiving the formal approval of the [[Holy See]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opusangelorum.org/HistoryORC/Historyoforder.html History of the Order of the Holy Cross]&lt;/ref&gt; To it, in accordance with [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P29.HTM canons 677 §2] and [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P11.HTM  303] of the Code of Canon Law, the care of ''Opus Angelorum'' movement is committed.&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

On 7 November 2008, the same Congregation approved the statutes of the Opus Angelorum as a public association of the faithful.&lt;ref name=Storia/&gt;

On 4 November 2010, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared: "Today, thanks to the obedience of its members, the Opus Angelorum can be considered to be living loyally and serenely in conformity with the doctrine of the Church and with canonical and liturgical law. Therefore, in its present state, the Opus Angelorum is a public association of the Church in conformity with traditional doctrine and with the directives of the Holy See."&lt;ref name=CDF&gt;[http://www.zenit.org/article-30858?l=english Doctrinal Congregation's Note on Opus Angelorum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misinterpretations==

Some news sources presented the Holy See's statement of approval of the association as instead a warning to beware of  it. An example was the BBC's news item [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11699849 "Vatican warns of 'wayward' Opus Angelorum sect"]. The warning issued was not against the association but against some ex-members, who had either been expelled or who had left of their own accord, and who were endeavouring to form a rival movement that would reject the norms issued by the Holy See.

A '''Rakshasa''' ({{lang-sa|राक्षस}}, ''{{IAST|rākṣasa}}'') is a mythological being in [[Hindu mythology]]. As this mythology influenced other religions, the rakshasa was later incorporated into [[Buddhism]]. Rakshasas are also called "Maneaters" (''Nri-chakshas,'' ''Kravyads''). A female rakshasa is known as a '''Rakshasi'''. A female Rakshasa in human form is a '''Rakshesha'''. The terms ''[[Asura]]'' and Rakshasa are sometimes used interchangeably.

== Hindu lore ==
===Vedic and Puranic stories===
[[File:Varaha avtar, killing a demon to protect Bhu, c1740.jpg|thumb|Death of [[Hiranyaksha]], the son of Diti, at the hands of Vishnu's [[avatar]], [[Varaha]].]]
Rakshasas were believed to have been created from the breath of [[Brahma]] when he was asleep at the end of the [[Satya Yuga]]. As soon as they were created, they were so filled with bloodlust that they started eating Brahma himself. Brahma shouted "''Rakshama!''" (Sanskrit for "Protect me!") and [[Vishnu]] came to his aid, banishing to Earth all Rakshasas (named after Brahma's cry for help).

Their literary origins can be traced to Vedic sources through Hymn 87 of the tenth [[mandala]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]''. They are classified amongst the ''Yatudhanas'', mythological beings that consume raw flesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/the-rig-veda-mandala-10-hymn-87 Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 87]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Description===
Rakshasas were most often depicted as ugly, fierce-looking and enormous creatures, with two [[fang]]s protruding from the top of the mouth and having sharp, claw-like fingernails. They are shown as being mean, growling like beasts, and as insatiable [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] that could smell the scent of human flesh. Some of the more ferocious ones were shown with flaming red eyes and hair, drinking [[blood]] with their palms or from a human skull (similar to representations of [[vampire]]s in later Western mythology). Generally they could fly, vanish, and had ''Maya'' (magical powers of illusion), which enabled them to change size at will and assume the form of any creature. The female equivalent of rakshasa is rakshasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the Ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 72|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Hindu epics ===
In the world of the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], Rakshasas were a populous race. There were both good and evil rakshasas, and as warriors they fought alongside the armies of both good and evil. They were powerful warriors, expert magicians and illusionists. As shape-changers, they could assume different physical forms. It was not always clear whether they had a true or natural form.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} As illusionists, they were capable of creating appearances which were real to those who believed in them or who failed to dispel them. Some of the rakshasas were said to be man-eaters, and made their gleeful appearance when the slaughter on a battlefield was at its worst. Occasionally they served as rank-and-file soldiers in the service of one or another warlord.

Aside from its treatment of unnamed rank-and-file Rakshasas, the epics tell the stories of certain members of the "race" who rose to prominence, some of them as heroes, most of them as villains.

====In the ''Ramayana''====
The Battle of Lanka pitted an army of Rakshasas under [[Ravana]] against an army of [[Vanara]]s, or monkeys, under [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]].
[[File:Ravana British Museum.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Ravana]] the king of [[Lanka]] with ten heads, was the commander of Rakshasas.]]
[[File:Maruti slew Jambumali with one stroke of an iron rod.jpg|thumb|Maruti slew Jambumali the commander, with one stroke of an iron rod]]

* [[Ravana]] was the King of Lanka. He had ten heads and was the commander of the Rakshasas. He was the immortal enemy of [[Rama]], the hero of the ''[[Ramayana]].'' In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book III: Vana Parva, Section 271 ff.), the Sage [[Markandeya]] recounts the story of how Ravana kidnapped Rama's wife [[Sita]] and whisked her off to his stronghold Lanka. Rama, aided by the monkey King [[Sugriva]] and his army of monkeys, laid siege to Lanka, slew Ravana, and rescued Sita.
* [[Vibhishana]] was [[Ravana]]'s younger brother. He was beautiful, pious and assiduous in his religious observances. When [[Brahma]] granted him a boon, he asked never to swerve from the path of righteousness and to always be illumined by divine knowledge (Book III, Vana Parva: Section 273.) Vibhishana joined [[Rama]] in his campaign against Ravana and helped Rama's army to cross the ocean into Lanka (Section 281). When invisible Rakshasas infiltrated Rama's camp, Vibhishana caused them to become visible; this enabled Rama's monkey soldiers to destroy them (Section 283). After Rama's final victory over Ravana, the loyal Vibhishana was made king of Lanka and remaining Rakshasas (Section 289).
* [[Kumbhakarna]] was another brother of [[Ravana]]; he was sometimes referred to as a Rakshasa because of his frightening appearance and size. Like Rakshasas, he had an enormous appetite and ate large quantities of food and meat. A fearsome warrior and master of illusion, he slept through most of the Battle of Lanka (having long before requested and received a gift of long-lasting sleep from [[Brahma]]). When Ravana awakened him with alarming news about the conflict, he arose and took the field. Upon marching out of the city, Kumbhakarna was immediately swarmed by [[Rama]]'s monkeys; he just laughed and wreaked great mayhem amidst them. When the monkey king [[Sugriva]] attacked, Kumbhakarna grabbed him and started to drag him off. At that point [[Rama]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]] used arrows and a secret ''[[Brahmastra]]'' ("Brahma's weapon") to kill [[Kumbhakarna]], dropping him "like a huge tree cleft in twain by a thunderbolt." (''Ramayana,'' Book III: Vana Parva, Section 285.)

Other Rakshasas that are featured in the Ramayana include [[Kabandha]], [[Tataka]] (sometimes called Taraka), [[Shurpanakha]], [[Maricha]], [[Subahu]], [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]], [[Prahasta]], [[Akshayakumara]], [[Atikaya]], and [[Indrajit]] - the most powerful son of [[Ravana]].

====In the Mahabharata====
The [[Pandava]] hero [[Bhima]] was the nemesis of forest-dwelling Rakshasas who dined on human travellers and terrorized human settlements.
* Bhima killed [[Hidimba]], a cannibal Rakshasa. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 154) describes him as a cruel cannibal with sharp, long teeth and prodigious strength. When Hidimba saw the Pandavas sleeping in his forest, he decided to eat them. He sent his sister [[Hidimbi]] to reconnoiter the situation, and the young woman fell in love with the handsome Bhima, whom she warned of danger. Infuriated, Hidimba declared he was ready to kill not only the Pandavas but also his sister, but he was thwarted by the heroism of Bhima, who defeated and killed him in a duel.
[[File:Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba.jpg|thumb|Hidimbi - the sister of Hidimba]]

* [[Ghatotkacha]], a Rakshasa who fought on the side of the Pandavas, was the son of Bhima and the Rakshasa Hidimbi, who had fallen in love with the hero and warned him of danger from her brother. Bhima killed the evil Rakshasa Hidimba. Their son's name refers to his round bald head; ''ghata'' means 'pot' and ''utkacha'' means 'head' in [[Sanskrit]]. Ghatotkacha is considered a loyal and humble figure. He and his followers were available to his father Bhima at any time; all Bhima had to do was to think of him and he would appear. Like his father, Ghatotkacha primarily fought with the [[Gada (mace)|mace]]. His wife was [[Ahilawati]] and his son was [[Barbarika]].

In the ''Mahabharata,'' Ghatotkacha was summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side in the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Invoking his magical powers, he wrought great havoc in the Kaurava army. In particular, after the death of [[Jayadratha]], when the battle continued on past sunset, his powers were at their most effective (at night). After performing many heroic deeds on the battlefield and fighting numerous duels with other great warriors (including the Rakshasa Alamvusha, the elephant-riding King [[Bhagadatta]], and [[Ashwatthama|Aswatthaman]], the son of [[Drona]]), Ghatotkacha encountered the human hero [[Karna]]. At this point in the battle, the Kaurava leader [[Duryodhana]] had appealed to his best fighter, [[Karna]], to kill Ghatotkacha, as the entire Kaurava army was near annihilation due to his ceaseless strikes from the air. Karna possessed a divine weapon, [[Shakti]], granted by the god Indra. It could be used only once and Karna had been saving it to use on his arch-enemy [[Arjuna]], the best Pandava fighter. Unable to refuse Duryodhana, Karna used the Shakti against Ghatotkacha, killing him. This is considered to be the turning point of the war. After his death, the Pandava counselor [[Krishna]] smiled, as he considered the Pandava prince Arjuna to be saved from certain death, as Karna had used the ''Shakta'' divine weapon. A temple in [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], honors Ghatotkacha; it is located near the [[Hidimba Devi Temple]].
* [[Bakasura]] was a cannibalistic forest-dwelling Rakshasa who terrorized the nearby human population by forcing them to take turns making him regular deliveries of food, including human victims. The Pandavas travelled into the area and took up residence with a local [[Brahmin]] family. Their turn came when they had to make a delivery to Bakasura, and they debated who among them should be sacrificed. The rugged Bhima volunteered to take care of the matter. Bhima went into the forest with the food delivery (consuming it on the way to annoy Bakasura). He engaged Bakasura in a ferocious wrestling match, and broke his back. The human townspeople were amazed and grateful. The local Rakshasas begged for mercy, which Bhima granted them on the condition that they give up cannibalism. The Rakshasas agreed and soon acquired a reputation for being peaceful towards humans. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 159-166.)
* [[Kirmira]], the brother of Bakasura, was a cannibal and master illusionist. He haunted the wood of Kamyaka, dining on human travellers. Like his brother before him, Kirmira also made the mistake of fighting the Pandav hero Bhima, who killed him with his bare hands (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 11).
* [[Jatasura]] was a cunning Rakshasa who, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], attempted to steal the Pandavas' weapons and to ravish [[Draupadi]], wife of . Bhima arrived in time to intervene, and killed Jatasur in a duel. (Book III: Varna Parva, Section 156). Jatasur's son was Alamvush, who fought on the side of the [[Kaurava]]s at [[Kurukshetra]].

[[File:Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha.jpg|thumb|Karna Attacks Ghatotkacha]]
Rakshasa heroes fought on both sides in the Kurukshetra war.

* Alamvusha was a Rakshasa skilled at fighting with both conventional weapons and the powers of illusion. According to the ''Mahabharata'', he fought on the side of the Kauravas. [[Arjuna]] defeated him in a duel (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 167), as did Arjuna's son [[Abhimanyu]] (Book VI: Bhishma Parva, Section 101–102). But Alamvusha in turn killed [[Iravan]], Arjuna's son by a [[Nāga]] princess [[Ulupi]], when the Rakshasa used his powers of illusion to take on the form of [[Garuda]]. Alamvusha was also defeated by Bhima (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 107). He was slain by Bhima's son, the Rakshasa Ghatotkacha (Book VII: Drona Parva, Section 108).

==In Buddhist lore==
===Theravada Buddhist literature===
In the Maha Samaya Sutta, [[Mara (demon)|Mara]] (also known as ''Namuci'' or the "Dark One") is the defeated antagonist of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. He is described as a corrupted Asura, whose army consisted of "Sensual passions, Discontent, Hunger and Thirst, Craving, Sloth and Drowsiness, Terror, Uncertainty, Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, Gains, Offerings, Fame and Status wrongly gained, and whoever would praise self and disparage others" (Sn 3.2 Padhana Sutta). The Asuras try to capture the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and bind them. However, not all Asuras are Rakshasas.

The Alavaka Sutta (SN 10.12) of the [[Pāli Canon]] recounts a story in which the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was harassed by a Rakshasa. The latter asked him to leave and then to return, over and over. When the Buddha refused to leave, the Rakshasa threatened to harm him if he could not answer his questions. The rest of the sutta concerns the question and answer dialogue. At the end, the rakshasa is convinced of the Buddha's holiness and becomes a follower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn10/sn10.012.piya.html Alavaka Sutta (SN 10.12)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lanka]]n (Sinhala) ancestral legends refer to Yakshas as well.

One of Buddha's ten titles is “Purisa Dama Sarati sata deva manusanam Buddho baghavati” meaning the teacher of gods, men, animals and Rakshasas.

===Mahayana Buddhist literature===
Chapter 26 of the [[Lotus Sutra]] includes a dialogue between the Buddha and a group of Rakshasa daughters, who swear to uphold and protect the [[Lotus Sutra]]. They also teach magical [[dhāraṇī]]s to protect followers who also uphold the sutra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lotus.nichirenshu.org/lotus/sutra/english/watson/lsw_chap26.htm Lotus Sutra, chapter 26, Burton Watson translation] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030325001524/http://lotus.nichirenshu.org/lotus/sutra/english/watson/lsw_chap26.htm |date=25 March 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Lotus-Born: The Life Story of Padmasambhava, recorded by [[Yeshe Tsogyal]],'' [[Padmasambhava]] receives the [[nickname]] of "Rakshasa" during one of his wrathful conquests to subdue Buddhist [[Heresy|heretics]].

In Chinese tradition Rakshasas are known as ''Luo Sha'' (羅剎), pronounced as "La-Ksha" in ancient China.

==Jainism lore==
{{Main|Rama in Jainism}}
[[Jainism|Jain]] accounts vary from the [[Hindu]] accounts of Rakshasa. According to [[Jain literature]], Rakshasa was a kingdom of civilized and vegetarian people belonging to the race of [[Vidyadhara]], who were devotees of [[Tirthankara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/article/antiquity.htm Harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic and folkloric depictions==
[[File:Ramayana war - angkor.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief |bas-relief]] at [[Preah Khan]] in [[Cambodia]] depicts the Battle of Lanka between Rakshasas and monkeys.]]
The artists of [[Angkor]] in [[Cambodia]] frequently depicted [[Ravana]] in stone sculpture and [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]]. The "[[Nāga]] bridge" at the entrance to the 12th-century city of [[Angkor Thom]] is lined with large stone statues of [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and Asuras engaged in churning the [[Kshir Sagar|Ocean of Milk]]. The ten-headed [[Ravana]] is shown anchoring the line of Asuras.&lt;ref&gt;Rovedo, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bas-relief at the 12th-century temple of [[Angkor Wat]] depicts the figures churning the ocean. It includes [[Ravana]] anchoring the line of Asuras that are pulling on the serpent's head. Scholars have speculated that one of the figures in the line of [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] is Ravana's brother [[Vibhishana]]. They pull on a serpent's tail to churn the Ocean of Milk.&lt;ref&gt;Rovedo, pp.108-110; Freeman and Jacques, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; Another bas-relief at Angkor Wat shows a 20-armed Ravana shaking [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman and Jacques, p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists of Angkor also depicted the Battle of Lanka between the Rakshasas under the command of [[Ravana]] and the Vanaras or monkeys under the command of [[Rama]] and [[Sugriva]]. The 12th-century Angkor Wat contains a dramatic bas-relief of the Battle of Lanka between Ravana's Rakshasas and [[Rama]]'s monkeys. Ravana is depicted with ten heads and twenty arms, mounted on a chariot drawn by creatures that appear to be a mixture of horse, lion, and bird. Vibhishana is shown standing behind and aligned with Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]]. [[Kumbhakarna]], mounted on a similar chariot, is shown fighting [[Sugriva]].&lt;ref&gt;Rovedo, pp.116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

This battle is also depicted in a less refined bas-relief at the 12th-century temple of [[Preah Khan]].

== In languages ==
In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], ''raksasa'' now means "giant", "gigantic,"  "huge and strong," or "monster" in colloquial usage.&lt;ref name=kamus&gt;{{Cite book | last = Atmosumarto | first = Sutanto | title = A learner's comprehensive dictionary of Indonesian | publisher = Atma Stanton | year = 2004 | pages = 445 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0PV0NSjCdFAC&amp;pg=PA445 | isbn = 9780954682804}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian and Malay are closely related languages with significant [[Sanskrit]] influence.

In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], ''rakhosh'' (রাক্ষস) is used as term for a person who eats incessantly and without need to stop. This derivation also occurs in Malay and Indonesian as ''rakus,'' which means "greedy".&lt;ref name="kamus" /&gt;

'''Richard Carlile''' (8 December 1790 – 10 February 1843) was an important agitator for the establishment of [[universal suffrage]] and [[freedom of the press]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4685 |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |chapter=Carlile, Richard |author=Philip W. Martin |year=2004 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4685 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Ashburton, Devon]], he was the son of a shoemaker who died in 1794; leaving Richard's mother struggling to support her three children on the income from running a small shop. At the age of six he went for free education to the local [[Church of England]] school, then at the age of twelve he left school for  a seven-year apprenticeship to a [[tinsmith]] in [[Plymouth]].

==Personal life==
In 1813 he married, and shortly afterwards the couple moved to [[Holborn]] Hill in London where he found work as a tinsmith. Jane Carlile gave birth to five children, three of whom survived.

Some time after 1829, Carlile met [[Eliza Sharples]] and she became his common law wife. Together they had at least four children.

== Politics and publishing ==
[[File:Richard Carlile's writing table.jpg|thumb|right|His favourite writing table in the library of the [[South Place Ethical Society]].]] 
[[File:Richard Carlile's writing table plaque.JPG|thumb|right|"The favorite writing table and fellow prisoner for more than nine years of Richard Carlile during his struggle to obtain the [[freedom of the press]] 1816 to 1834."]] 
His interest in politics was kindled first by economic conditions in the winter of 1816 when Carlile was put on short-time work by his employer creating serious problems for the family: "I shared the general distress of 1816 and it was this that opened my eyes." He began attending political meetings where speakers like [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]] complained that only three men in a hundred had the vote, and was also influenced by the publications of [[William Cobbett]].

As a way of making a living he sold the writings of parliamentary reformers such as [[Tom Paine]] on the streets of London, often walking "thirty miles for a profit of eighteen pence". In April 1817 he formed a publishing business with the printer William Sherwin and rented a shop in [[Fleet Street]]. To make political texts such as Paine's books ''[[The Rights of Man]]'' and the ''[[Principles of Government]]'' available to the poor he split them into sections which he sold as small pamphlets, similarly publishing ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' and ''[[Principles of Nature]]''. He issued unauthorized copies of Southey's ''[[Wat Tyler]]'' and after the radical [[William Hone]]'s arrest in May, he reissued the parody of parts of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] for which Hone was to be tried,  then was himself arrested in August and held without charge until Hone was acquitted in December.

He took on distributing the banned [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] weekly ''[[The Black Dwarf]]'' at a time when the government was prosecuting publishers: "The Habeas Corpus Act being suspended ... all was terror and alarm, but I take credit to myself in defeating the effect of these two Acts upon the Press... Of imprisonment I made sure, but I felt inclined to court it than to shrink from it".

Carlile then brought out a radical journal, ''Sherwin's Political Register'', which reported political meetings and included extracts from books and poems by supporters of the reform movement such as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]]. The popularity of this helped to soon bring his profit from his publishing venture to £50 a week.

== Peterloo and ''The Republican'' ==
[[File:Peterloo carlile.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Print of the [[Peterloo Massacre]] published by Richard Carlile]]
Carlile was one of the scheduled main speakers at the reform meeting on 16 August 1819 at St. Peter's Fields in [[Manchester]]. Just as [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]] was about to speak, the crowd was attacked by the yeomanry in what became known as the [[Peterloo massacre]].  Carlile escaped and was hidden by radical friends before he caught the mail coach to London and published his eyewitness account, giving the first full report of what had happened, in ''Sherwin's Weekly Political Register'' of 18 August 1819. His placards proclaimed "Horrid Massacres at Manchester".

The government responded by closing ''Sherwin's Political Register'', confiscating the stock of newspapers and pamphlets. Carlile changed the name to ''The Republican'' and in its issue of 27 August 1819 demanded that "The massacre... should be the daily theme of the Press until the murderers are brought to justice.... Every man in Manchester who avows his opinions on the necessity of reform, should never go unarmed – retaliation has become a duty, and revenge an act of justice."

Carlile was prosecuted for [[blasphemy]], [[blasphemous libel]] and [[sedition]] for  publishing material that might encourage people to hate the government in his newspaper, and for publishing [[Tom Paine]]'s ''Common Sense'', ''The Rights of Man'' and the ''Age of Reason'' (which criticised the [[Church of England]]). In October 1819 he was found guilty of [[blasphemy]] and [[seditious libel]] and sentenced to three years in [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] [[Gaol]] with a fine of £1,500. When he refused to pay the fine, his premises in [[Fleet Street]] were raided and his stock was confiscated. While he was in jail he continued to write articles for ''The Republican'' which was now published by Carlile's wife Jane, and thanks to the publicity it now outsold pro-government newspapers such as ''[[The Times]]''.

To curb newspapers the government had raised the ½d tax on newspapers first imposed in 1712 to 3½d in 1797 then 4d in 1815. From December 1819 it set a minimum price of 7d and further restrictions. At a time when workers earned less than 10 shillings (120d.) a week this made it hard for them to afford radical newspapers, and publishers tried various strategies to evade the tax. Groups would pool their resources in reading societies and subscription societies to purchase a book or journal in common, and frequently read it aloud to one another as was the case with [[James Wilson (revolutionary)|James Wilson]].

By 1821, Carlile was a declared [[atheist]] (having previously been a [[Deist]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of the English Working Class|author=E.P. Thompson|publisher=Penguin|year=1968|page=796}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published his ''Address to Men of Science'', in favour of materialism and education. In the same year Jane Carlile was in turn sentenced to two years imprisonment for seditious libel, and her place as publisher was taken by Richard Carlile's sister, Mary. Within six months she was imprisoned for the same offence. The process was repeated with eight of his shop workers, and over 150 men and women were sent to prison for selling ''The Republican''. Carlile's sentence ended in 1823 but he was immediately arrested and returned to prison for not paying his £1,500 fine, so the process continued until he was eventually released on 25 November 1825. In the next edition of ''The Republican'' he expressed the hope that his long confinement would result in the freedom to publish radical political ideas. An example of the support he received from around the country is the £1.5.1 sent to him in Dorchester jail by forty working men in the West Yorkshire village of [[Hunslet]], accompanied by a noble letter on behalf of those "few Friends to Truth and Justice".&lt;ref&gt;The Republican, volume 8, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

He then published further journals, ''The Lion'' which campaigned against child labour and ''The Promptor''. He argued that "equality between the sexes" should be the objective of all reformers, and in 1826 published ''Every Woman's Book'' advocating birth control and the sexual emancipation of women. Cobbett denounced this book as "so filthy, so disgusting, so beastly, as to shock even the lewdest men and women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stack|first=David|title=Nature and Artifice|year=1998|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=0861932293|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlile was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]]. He did not believe that [[Jesus]] existed. He debated Unitarian minister [[John Relly Beard]] in ''The Republican'', 1826.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Relly Beard|Beard, J. R.]]. (1825). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3793657;view=1up;seq=817 ''To Mr. Richard Carlile, London'']. ''The Republican'' 12 (26): 803-828.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlile, Richard. (1826). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3793658;view=1up;seq=81 ''To Mr. J. R. Beard, Unitarian Preacher, Manchester'']. ''The Republican'' 13 (3): 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Devil's Chaplain ==
{{main|Robert Taylor (Radical)}}

He joined up with the radical and sceptical clergyman [[Robert Taylor (Radical)|Robert Taylor]] and set out on an "infidel home missionary tour" which reached [[Cambridge]] on Thursday 21 May 1829 and caused a considerable upset to the University of Cambridge where a young [[Charles Darwin]] was a second-year student.

At their meeting in [[Bolton]], Lancashire, Carlile met [[Eliza Sharples]], who was to become his long term mistress.&lt;ref name=Pythoness&gt;{{cite web|title='Pythoness of the Temple': Eliza Sharples and the gendered public of the Rotunda |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Radical+Spaces%3A+Venues+of+popular+politics+in+London,+1790%E2%80%93c.+1845/5621/ch08.xhtml|publisher=ANU|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlile then opened a ramshackle building on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], the [[Blackfriars Rotunda]], and in widespread public unrest in July 1830 this became a gathering place for [[Republicanism|republican]]s and [[atheist]]s. Taylor staged infidel melodramas, preaching outrageous sermons which got him dubbed "The Devil's Chaplain". Thousands of copies of these sermons were circulated in a seditious publication, ''The Devil's Pulpit''.

== Jailed again ==
In 1831 he was jailed, under the charge of seditious libel, given two and a half years for writing an article in support of agricultural labourers campaigning against wage cuts and advising the strikers to regard themselves as being at war with the government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/reportsstatetri07wallgoog#page/n245/mode/2up State Trials (New Series), II, 459: "The King against Richard Carlile, 1831]&lt;/ref&gt; He left prison deeply in debt, and government fines had taken from him the finances needed to publish newspapers.

His political and social opinions never altered, but his philosophy underwent a change in the 1830s. In 1837 H. Robinson published the results of his later thinking in the book ''Extraordinary Conversion and Public Declaration of Richard Carlile of London to Christianity''.

After living for some years in extreme poverty in [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], Carlile returned to Fleet Street in 1842, dying there the following year. He donated his body for medical research. Large numbers of people attended his funeral in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] on Sunday 26 February 1843, where his sons protested at the Christian burial rite being administered in the common grave he was being buried in - citing that he "passed his life in opposition to all priestcraft."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1407">'''Rishivanshi''' [[Rajputs]] are considered to be progeny of [[Rishi]] (saints) and [[Kshatriya]], also known as Brahmin([[yogis]]) Kshatriya.

There are several theories regarding the origin of the Rishivanshi Rajputs, According to A. H. Bingley, Caste, tribes &amp; culture of Rajputs, Ess Ess Publications, 1978 which is also substantiated by the folklore narratives of Rishivanshi Rajputs, that they are the descendants of the Rishi Shringa and his wife Shanta. As per the folk traditions, Shanta was from Raghuvansha clan and was a princess of Raghukul, therefore, the son of Rishi Shringa and Shanta became a Rishivansha Kshtriya. Henceforth, 'Sengar' clan of Rajputs which is of 'Shringya' or its further delineation into 'Sengar', thus, 'Sengar' are considered to be Rishivanshi Kshtriyas.

Another Rajput tradition believes that Sengar come from Gautam [[gotra]], where rishi Gautam who is one of the seven Saptarishi was their ancestor, therefore, Sengar claim to have Gautam gotra.&lt;ref&gt;Notes on the Origin of the 'Lunar' and 'Solar' Aryan Tribes, and on the 'Rājput' Clans (Continued from Page 328), B.

[[File:By seeing Ruru, the saint sahsrapada released from curse of serpent form.jpg|thumb|By seeing Ruru, the saint sahsrapada released from curse of serpent form]]
'''Saint Ruru''' is a hermit famous in the Hindu [[Purana]]s.

According to [[Devi Bhagavata]] (Skandha 2), [[Puloma]] was the wife of [[Bhrgu]]. He got the son [[Chyavana]] by Puloma. Chyavana married [[Sukanya]]. [[Pramati]] was born to them. The hermit Pramati married the beautiful damsel Pratapi and got a son named Ruru. He grew up to become a famous hermit.

Ruru happened to encounter exceedingly beautiful Pramadvara, the daughter of the [[king of gandharvas]] and [[Menaka]] and momentously fell in love with her. The father of Pramadvara came to know of this and decided to give her in marriage to him. During the marriage preparations, Pramadvara was bitten by a snake and fell down dead.

Ruru was greatly sad and disappointed. By his determination and sacrifising half of his life to her, Pramadvara came to life again and Ruru married her.

According to [[Mahabharata]] (Adi Parva), Ruru developed relentless hatred against serpents. He wandered about destroying every serpent he came across. Finally he confronted Dundubha, he was given exhortations and good advice regarding righteousness. Saint Ruru had taken a lively interest in the snake sacrifice known as Sarpa Satra held by king [[Janamejaya II|Janamejaya]] which was meant to exterminate all serpents.

The '''San Francisco Peaks''' ({{lang-es|Sierra de San Francisco}}) are a [[volcanic]] [[mountain range]] in north central [[Arizona]], just north of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and a remnant of the former '''San Francisco Mountain'''. The highest summit in the range, [[Humphreys Peak]], is the highest point in the state of Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft|m}} in elevation. The San Francisco Peaks are the remains of an eroded [[stratovolcano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Francisco Peaks|work=USGS factsheet|url=http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/fact-sheet/fs017-01/|accessdate=2006-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[aquifer]] within the [[caldera]] supplies much of Flagstaff's water while the mountain itself is in the [[Coconino National Forest]], a popular recreation site. The [[Arizona Snowbowl]] [[ski area]] is on the western slopes of Humphreys Peak, and has been the subject of major controversy involving several tribes and environmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=10874 | title=San Francisco Peaks, AZ | publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] | accessdate=2006-05-23 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930231257/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=10874 | archivedate=2006-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15176711|title=Indians oppose 'recycled' sewage for Arizona skiing|first=Daniel|last=Nasaw|newspaper=BBC News Magazine|publisher=BBC|date=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bellemont Arizona View.jpg|thumb|The San Francisco Peaks as seen from Bellemont, Arizona, Winter 2014.]]

The six highest individual peaks in Arizona are contained in the range:
*[[Humphreys Peak]], {{convert|12633|ft|m|0}}
*[[Agassiz Peak]], {{convert|12356|ft|m|0}}
*[[Fremont Peak (Arizona)|Fremont Peak]], {{convert|11969|ft|m|0}}

* Rees Peak, {{convert|11474|ft|m|0}}
*[[Doyle Peak]], {{convert|11460|ft|m|0}}

The mountain provides a number of recreational opportunities, including wintertime snow [[skiing]] and [[hiking]] the rest of the year. Hart Prairie is a popular hiking area and [[Nature Conservancy]] preserve located below the mountain's ski resort, [[Arizona Snowbowl]].

Humphreys Peak (latitude 35°20'47" N) and Agassiz Peak (latitude 35°19'33" N) are the two farthest south-lying mountain peaks in the contiguous United States which rise to a height of more than 12,000 feet above sea level.

Prior to its collapse due to a [[lateral eruption]] to the northeast (around 200,000 years ago) and subsequent glacial erosion, the San Francisco Peaks fully matured elevation is estimated to have been around 16,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kachinapeaks.org/pdf/peaks_history.pdf|title=The History of the San Francisco Peaks|first=James A.|last=Hardy|publisher=Flagstaff Visitor Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717233942/http://www.kachinapeaks.org/pdf/peaks_history.pdf|archivedate=2013-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1629, 147 years before [[San Francisco, California]], received that name, Spanish friars founded a [[List of Spanish missions|mission]] at a [[Hopi]] Indian village in honor of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], 65 miles from the peaks. Seventeenth century [[Franciscan]]s at [[Orayvi|Oraibi]] village gave the name San Francisco to the peaks to honor St. [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of their order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Platt|last=Cline|year=1976|title=They Came to the Mountain|location=Flagstaff|publisher=Northern Arizona University with Old Town Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[mountain man]] [[Antoine Leroux]] visited the San Francisco Peaks in the mid-1850s, and guided several American expeditions exploring and surveying northern Arizona. Leroux guided them to the only reliable spring, one on the western side of the peaks, which was later named Leroux Springs.

Around 1877, [[John Willard Young]], a son of the Mormon leader [[Brigham Young]], claimed the area around Leroux Springs, and he built Fort Moroni, a log [[stockade]], to house railroad tie-cutters for the [[Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad]], which was then being built across northern Arizona.&lt;ref name="houk"&gt;{{cite book|first=Rose|last=Houk|chapter=San Francisco Peaks|title=The Mountains Know Arizona|year=2003|publisher=Arizona Highways Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, U.S. President [[William McKinley]] established the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve, at the request of [[Gifford Pinchot]], the head of the U.S. Division of Forestry. The local reaction was hostile—citizens of [[Williams, Arizona]], protested and the ''Williams News'' editorialized that the reserve "virtually destroys [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino County]]."&lt;ref name="houk"/&gt; In 1908, the San Francisco Mountain Forest Reserve became a part of the new [[Coconino National Forest]].

In 2002, [[Arizona Snowbowl]], the ski resort on the peaks, proposed a plan to expand and begin [[snowmaking]] using [[reclaimed water]] made of treated [[sewage]] [[effluent]]. A coalition of Indian tribes and environmental groups sued the [[Coconino National Forest]], which leases the land to the ski resort, in an attempt to stop the proposed expansion, citing serious impacts to [[Cultural practice|traditional culture]], public health, and the environment.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; In 2011, construction began on a wastewater pipeline to the peaks.  In response, there has been an ongoing series of protest actions including demonstrations and lockdowns in which protesters have chained themselves to construction equipment.&lt;ref name=hcn&gt;{{cite news|title=Diné activist protests wastewater-to-snow scheme|newspaper=High Country News|date=August 19, 2013|first=Leslie|last=MacMillan|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/45.14/a-dine-activist-protests-arizona-snowbowls-wastewater-to-snow-methods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable protesters include [[Navajo people|Navajo]] musician [[Klee Benally]], singer/guitarist for the [[punk rock]] band [[Blackfire (band)|Blackfire]], who has been arrested for disorderly conduct during his ten years of protests.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Resort’s Snow Won’t Be Pure This Year; It’ll Be Sewage|newspaper=New York Times|first=Leslie|last=MacMillan|date=September 26, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/us/arizona-ski-resorts-sewage-plan-creates-uproar.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of Arizona Snowbowl, and wastewater to snow conversion began in the 2012-2013 ski season.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Ecology==
The biologist [[Clinton Hart Merriam]] studied these mountains and surrounding areas in 1889, describing a set of six [[life zone]]s found from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the summit of the mountains, based on elevation, latitude, and average precipitation. He designated their characteristic flora, as follows:
[[File:SanFranciscoPeaks.ASTER,20031021.jpg|right|thumb|Composite image of the Peaks and the [[San Francisco volcanic field]], looking SW towards Flagstaff. [[NASA]] image from satellite imagery projected onto a [[digital elevation model]].]]

*Lower Sonoran Zone - [[Sonoran Desert]] plants
*Upper Sonoran Zone - pinyon and juniper woodlands
*Transition Zone - [[ponderosa pine]] forests
*Canadian Zone - mixed conifer forest
*Hudsonian Zone - spruce-fir or subalpine conifer forest
*Arctic-Alpine Zone - alpine [[tundra]]

Merriam considered that these life zones could be extended to cover all the world's vegetation types with the addition of only one more zone, the [[tropical]] zone.

The San Francisco Peaks themselves contain four of the six life zones. The four life zones which are found along the slopes of the San Francisco Peaks are listed below along with their approximate elevation ranges, dominant tree species found within each of the four life zones, and average annual precipitation of each life zone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/merriam.htm|publisher=Northern Arizona University and United States Geological Survey|title=Biotic Communities of the Colorado Plateau|accessdate=March 21, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EBRUtV6A?url=http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/merriam.htm|archivedate=February 4, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Ponderosa pine forests &amp;mdash; The elevation of the zone ranges from approximately {{convert|6000|to|8500|ft}}. The dominant tree species is the [[Pinus ponderosa|southwestern ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus brachyptera'' Engel.). [[Quercus gambelii|Gambel oak]] (''Quercus gambelii'') is a common associate of the ponderosa pine at lower elevations in the forest along with [[Robinia neomexicana|New Mexico locust]] (''Robina neomexicana''). At higher elevations, associates include [[Robinia neomexicana|southwestern white pine]] (''Pinus strobiformis''), [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]], (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.'' glauca''), [[Abies concolor|Rocky Mountain white fir]] (''Abies concolor'' var. ''concolor''), and [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides''). The average annual precipitation in this zone is {{convert|18|to|26|in|mm}}.
* Mixed conifer forest &amp;mdash; The elevation of this zone ranges from approximately {{convert|8000|to|9500|ft|m}}. Species such as [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''glauca''), [[Abies concolor|white fir]] (''Abies concolor''), [[limber pine]] (''Pinus flexilis'' var. ''reflexa''), [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]]. (''Picea pungens''), and less commonly [[Limber Pine|Southwestern white pine]] (''Pinus flexilis'') form mixed stands in this community, with [[Pinus ponderosa|Ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus brachyptera'' Engel.) joining the mix on warmer slopes. The average annual precipitation in the mixed conifer forest is {{convert|25|to|30|in|mm}}.
* [[Subalpine zone|Subalpine conifer forest]]  &amp;mdash; The elevation of this zone varies from approximately {{convert|9500|to|11500|ft|m}} feet. The dominant tree species of this zone are [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] (''Picea engelmannii'' subsp. ''engelmannii''), [[Abies lasiocarpa|corkbark fir]] (''Abies lasiocarpa'' var. ''arizonica''), [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') and the [[Pinus aristata|Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine]]. (''Pinus aristata'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5335029.pdf|publisher=United States Forest Service|work=Coconino National Forest Plan Revision|title=Alpine Tundra|accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual precipitation in the subalpine forest is {{convert|30|to|40|in|mm}}.

==In native culture==
The San Francisco Peaks have considerable religious significance to thirteen local [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes (including the [[Havasupai]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], and [[Zuni people|Zuni]].) In particular, the peaks form the Navajo sacred mountain of the west, called {{spell-nv|Dook'o'oosłííd}}. The peaks are associated with the color yellow, and they are said to contain [[abalone]] inside, to be secured to the ground with a sunbeam, and to be covered with yellow clouds and evening twilight. They are gendered female.&lt;ref name="mcpherson"&gt;Robert S. McPherson, ''Sacred Land, Sacred View: Navajo perceptions of the Four Corners Region'', [[Brigham Young University]], {{ISBN|1-56085-008-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Hopi people, the San Francisco Peaks are associated with the [[cardinal direction|intercardinal direction]] southwest. They constitute ritually pure sacred spaces, and are used as sources for ceremonial objects.&lt;ref name=Glowacka&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/599069 | issn = 0011-3204 | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 547 | last = Glowacka | first = Maria |author2=Dorothy Washburn |author3=Justin Richland  | title = Nuvatukya'ovi, San Francisco Peaks | journal = Current Anthropology | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553-556}} The alignment of the sunset from the peaks to Hopi villages on [[Black Mesa (Warm Springs, Arizona)|Black Mesa]] is used to calculate the winter solstice, signifying "the beginning of a new year, with a new planting season and new life."&lt;ref name=Glowacka/&gt; The peaks are seen as the home of the katsinam or [[kachina]] spirits, ancestors who have become clouds following their death.&lt;ref name=Glowacka/&gt; ''Katsinam'' are invited to Hopi villages to serve as ethical and spiritual guides to the Hopi community from midwinter to midsummer. ''Aaloosaktukwi'' or Humphrey's Peak holds particular religious significance and is associated with the deity ''Aaloosaka'', a symbol of the Two-Horn Society, a religious group among the Hopi dating to the occupation of the [[Awatovi Ruins|Awat’ovi]] village on Antelope Mesa.&lt;ref name=Glowacka/&gt; Depiction of the peaks in association with calendar-keeping is attested in a kiva at the [[Hisatsinom]] settlement of Homol'ovi, which was occupied from 1250 to 1425;&lt;ref name=Glowacka/&gt; katsinam imagery dates to the 13th century as well.&lt;ref name=Glowacka/&gt;{{RP|556}} Other Native American peoples also relate kachina spirits to heavy snowfalls on the peaks.

'''Sedna''' ({{lang-iu|ᓴᓐᓇ}}, ''Sanna'') is the goddess of the sea and marine animals in [[Inuit mythology]], also known as the Mother of the Sea or Mistress of the Sea. Sedna is also known as [[Arnakuagsak]] or Arnaqquassaaq ([[Greenlandic language|Greenland]]) and Sassuma Arnaa ("Mother of the Deep", West [[Greenland]]) and [[Nerrivik]] ("Table", northern Greenland) or [[Nuliajuk]] ([[District of Keewatin]], Northwest Territories, Canada). She is sometimes known by other names by different Inuit groups such as  [[Arnapkapfaaluk]] ("Big Bad Woman") of the [[Copper Inuit]] from the [[Coronation Gulf]] area&lt;ref&gt;Richard G Condon, Julia Ogina and the [[Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories|Holman Elders]], ''The Northern Copper Inuit'' ({{ISBN|0-8020-0849-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; and Takánakapsâluk or Takannaaluk ([[Igloolik]]). The story of Sedna, which is a creation myth, describes how she came to rule over [[Adlivun]], the [[Inuit]] [[underworld]].
==Myth==
More than one version of the Sedna legend exists. In one legend Sedna is a giant, the daughter of the creator-god [[Anguta]], with a great hunger that causes her to attack her parents. Angered, Anguta takes her out to sea and throws her over the side of his [[kayak]]. As she clings to the sides, he chops off her fingers and she sinks to the underworld, becoming the ruler of the monsters of the deep. Her huge fingers become the [[Ringed Seal|seal]]s, [[walrus]]es, and [[whale]]s hunted by the Inuit.

In another version of the legend, she is dissatisfied with men found for her by her father and so marries a dog. Her father is so angry at this that he throws her into the sea and, when she tries to climb back into the boat, he cuts off her fingers. Her fingers become the first seals and she becomes a mighty [[water deity|sea goddess]].  When she is angered, the [[angekok|shaman]] travels to wash and comb her hair for her, after which she is placated and releases the animals to the hunters.

In the Netsilik region, the story states that Nuliayuk was a mistreated orphan. One day the people tried to get rid of her by attempting to drown her by chopping off her finger tips. But the fingertips would transform to seals and walruses. Eventually Nuliayuk marries a [[sculpin]] and lives in the sea controlling all sea mammals.

Other versions of the legend depict Sedna as a beautiful maiden who rejects marriage proposals from the hunters of her village. When an unknown hunter appears, Sedna's father agrees to give her to him as wife in return for fish. Sedna's father gives Sedna a sleeping potion and gives her to the hunter who takes her to a large nest on a cliff, revealing his true form: a great bird-spirit (variously described as a [[raven]], a [[fulmar]] or a Kokksaut/[[petrel]]-spirit). She wakes surrounded by birds. Her father attempts to rescue her, but the bird-spirit becomes angry, causing a great storm. In desperation, Sedna's father throws her into the raging sea. Attempting to cling to the kayak, her hands freeze and her fingers fall off becoming the creatures of the sea. She falls to the bottom of the sea and grows a fish tail.

Sedna is kidnapped by a different bird creature in yet another version. Her father then leaves in his kayak to rescue her from the floating ice-island where she is imprisoned while the bird creature is away. The creature, enraged by her disappearance, calls to a spirit of the sea to help him. The sea spirit locates the kayak with the two humans aboard and creates huge waves to kill them. Her father throws Sedna overboard in the hope that this will appease the angry god. Sedna clings to the kayak but her father grabs a little axe and chops three of her fingers off before striking her on the head. The three fingers each become a different species of seal. The stroke to her head sends Sedna to the ocean floor where she resides, commanding the animals of the sea.

The varying legends each give different rationales for Sedna's death. Yet, in each version, her father takes her to sea in his kayak, chopping off her fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Osbourne, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  In each version she sinks to the bottom of the sea, worshiped by hunters who depend on her goodwill to supply food.  She is generally considered a vengeful goddess, and hunters must placate and pray to her to release the sea animals from the ocean depths for their hunt.&lt;ref&gt;Tchana, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==In astronomy==
[[90377 Sedna]], a [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered by [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]] ([[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]), [[Chad Trujillo]] ([[Gemini Observatory]]) and [[David L. Rabinowitz|David Rabinowitz]] ([[Yale University]]) on November 14, 2003, is named for her.

==In popular culture==
South Carolina based experimental folk band Apricot Blush released an album about the myth of Sedna in May of 2018. The album is entitled "Where Blew a Flower, May a Flower No More"  The songs on the record follow Sedna's journey and plight as it relates to the spiritual practice of helping others in order to save oneself. 

Heather Dale's album ''The Road to Santiago'' includes a song called "Sedna", which relates a version of the myth.

One of [[Legenda Aurea]]'s album "Sedna" is named after her and contains a song of the same name which tells a version of her myth.

In the Deep Dive Daredevils [[webcomic]] ''Secret of the Beaufort Sea'', Sedna appears as an [[Inuit]] goddess who has control over a werewhale.  The crew of the Custer must create a perfume made from the [[ambergris]] of the werewhale to satisfy Sedna and have her release the curse which is causing the werewhale to rampage.

A version of Sedna's origin is recounted in [[Dan Simmons]]'s novel ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'', as part of the backstory for the novel's main antagonist, an Inuit demon called the Tuunbaq.

Sedna is mentioned in [[Douglas Orgill]]'s and [[John Gribbin]]'s novel ''[[The Sixth Winter (novel)|The Sixth Winter]]'': according to Inuit legend, she is responsible for the ice tornadoes that herald the coming of the new Ice Age.

In [[William T. Vollmann]]'s sixth's volume of his ''[[Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes]]'' series, ''[[The Rifles (novel)|The Rifles]]'', Sedna's myth is recounted, with the Inuit woman Reepah transforming into Sedna at one point.

Sedna appears in the Fimbulwinter Game during the events of the Niven &amp; Barnes novel ''The Barsoom Project''. A team of live-action role players must rid the ailing goddess's hair of pestilent manifestations of mortal sins, as her damaged fingers prevent Sedna from combing them away herself.

A sculpture of Sedna by [[Kiugak Ashoona]] appeared on a Canadian postage stamp in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadianpostagestamps.ca/stamps/16146/sedna&lt;/ref&gt;

An article based on Sedna and the legends surrounding her, notably her marriage to a bird spirit, appears in the [[SCP Foundation]] collaborative fiction project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1836&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 Canadian film, [[The Legend of Sarila]], has the goddess prominently featured as she took the animals away from an Inuit clan as punishment for the shaman who turned away from her.

==History==

{{main|Akali movement}}

In 1920 the emerging [[Akali movement|Akali]] leadership summoned a general assembly of the Sikhs holding all shades of opinion on 15 November 1920 in vicinity of the [[Akal Takht]] in [[Amritsar]].  The purpose of this assembly was to elect a representative committee of the Sikhs to administer the [[Harimandir Sahib]] Complex and other important historical [[gurdwara]]s. Two days before the proposed conference the British government set up its own committee consisting of 36 [[Sikhs]] to manage the Harimandir Sahib. Sikhs held their scheduled meeting and elected a bigger committee consisting of 175 members and named it '''Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee'''. The members of the government appointed committee were also included in it. Harbans Singh Attari became vice president and Sunder Singh Ramgarhia became secretary of the committee. By that time [[Master Tara Singh]] had started taking interest in Sikh religious affairs. He was one of the 175 members elected to the committee. The formation of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee provided a focal point for the movement for the reformation of Sikh religious places. The Committee began to take over management of gurdwaras one by one, and were resisted by incumbent [[mahants]].

Starting in late 1920, a large number of reformers both in urban and rural Punjab had joined to form separate and independent religious orders called [[jatha]]s.  The primary purpose of a jatha was to gain control over local gurdwaras. A jatha under the command of a [[jathedar]] would occupy a shrine and try to take over management in its favor from its current incumbents. Sometimes the transfer went peacefully especially in the case of smaller Gurdwaras with less income resources.  This was done sometimes with the threat of force.

The Sikh leadership was fully aware of the importance of the press for the success of any movement. It enlisted the active support and sympathy of some of the important nationalist papers in the country like 'The Independent', Swaraj (Hindi), The Tribune, Liberal, Kesri (Urdu), Milap (Urdu), Zamindar (Urdu) and Bande Matram (Hindi).Two of the vernacular dailies Akali (Pbi.) and the Akali-te-Pardesi (Urdu), edited by [[Master Tara Singh]] also  played an important role. It brought the necessary awakening among the Sikh masses and prepared them to undertake the struggle for reform.With the direct and indirect support of the Central Sikh League, the [[Indian National Congress]] and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] started a non-violent struggle against the government for the control of the Gurdwaras. The reports of some immoral acts perpetrated at Tarn-Taran reached the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee at its meeting on 14 January 1921. A fortnight earlier a local jatha was beaten up and not allowed to perform [[kirtan]] at the gurdwara. It decided to send a jatha from [[Amritsar, Punjab|Amritsar]] under Jathedar Teja Singh Bhuchar. Jathedar [[Kartar Singh Jhabbar]] with Akalis from 'Khara Sauda Bar' joined him. On 25 January, a group of about forty workers took over the control of Sri Darbar Sahib Tarn-Taran from its Mahant. In the ensuing conflict two Akalis were killed and several others wounded by the henchmen of the Mahants. The Mahants were ousted from the Gurdwara and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee appointed a managing committee.

===Gurdwaras Act of 1925===
{{main|Gurdwaras Act of 1925}}
At the same time [[Malcolm Hailey]], the governor    of the Punjab showed his readiness to assist the Sikhs in taking possession of all the important Gurdwaras in the province through a five-member committee constituted by the Sikh members of the legislative council. Hailey presented a draft of a new Gurdwara Bill to the Akali leaders imprisoned in Lahore fort. Master Tara Singh, Bhag singh Advocate, gurcharn singh Advocate, Teja Singh Akerpuri(Jathedar AkalTakht Sahib) Sohan Singh Josh and Sardar Teja Singh Samundri studied each clause of the bill carefully. The bill met all the Akali demands and was passed into law on 28 July 1925 by the Governor General of India after its ratification by the Punjab legislative council. The Act came into force on 1 November 1925 with a gazette notification from the government of Punjab. According to the Act a Central Gurdwara Board elected by the Sikhs was to be the custodian of all-important Sikh places of worship. The first meeting of the Gurdwara board passed a resolution that its designation be changed to Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which was accepted by the government. Thus ended what came to be known in common parlance as the 'Third Sikh War'. The Punjab government withdrew its orders declaring the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and other Akali organs as unlawful associations and recognized the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee as a representative body of the Sikhs. In making the Punjab government agree to such recognition, the Akali leadership undoubtedly scored a victory over the bureaucracy. The Sikh Gurdwara bill met most of the demands of the Sikhs, but the government was willing to release the prisoners conditionally i.e. on the understanding to be given by the Akalis that they would agree to work for the Gurdwara Act. The Shiromani Akali Dal and the executive declared conditions imposed for the release of prisoners as wholly unnecessary, unjust and derogatory. Among the prominent Akalis, Mehtab Singh and Giani Sher Singh along with twenty other Akali leaders accepted the conditional release. Master Tara Singh, Bhag Singh Advocate, Teja Singh Samundari, Teja singh Akerpuri (Jathedar Akal Takht)and Fifteen other Akalis did not come out as government emphasis on eliciting written assurance and acceptance was to Master Tara Singh, an attack on the self-respect of the Sikhs. He said, "We ourselves have enacted this Act and we are responsible for implementing it, then why this condition?" Teja Singh Samundari died of a heart attack in the jail after some time. The Punjab Government failed to prove the charges against Master Tara Singh and the remaining Akalis, few months later they all were released unconditionally. The courage and sacrifice shown by the Akalis during the trial very soon drove the Mehtab Singh's group out of the political field and led to a rift in the Akali ranks, as the newly released Akalis condemned Mehtab Singh's group as collaborators. Mehtab Singh's group was also known as 'Rai Bahadur Party'. This group had majority in the committee and Mehtab Singh was elected its President. The Akali Party launched a campaign against the conditionally released leaders. When the new elections for the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee were held, the Akali Party won majority and the newly elected Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee elected Kharak Singh as the President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panwar|first1=Ranjit Singh,editor in chief|last2=Shankar|first2=Kripa,  editor,|title=Sikh achievers|date=2008|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788170103653|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfuDnpVlmlcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=KHARAK%20SINGH&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Master Tara Singh as the Vice President. Since [[Baba Kharak Singh]] had not yet been released the responsibility of the president fell on the shoulders of Master Tara Singh.

===1953 Amendment to Gurdwaras Act of 1925===

'''The New Church''' (or '''Swedenborgianism''') is the name for several historically related Christian denominations that developed as a [[new religious movement]], informed by the writings of scientist and [[Church of Sweden|Swedish Lutheran]] theologian [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] (1688–1772). Swedenborg claimed to have received a new revelation from Jesus Christ through continuous heavenly visions which he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years. In his writings, he predicted that God would replace the traditional Christian Church, establishing a "New Church", which would worship God in one person: Jesus Christ. The New Church doctrine is that each person must actively cooperate in repentance, reformation, and regeneration of one's life.&lt;ref name=TCR108,330,647&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''The True Christian Religion'', 1771 (TCR). 3 vols. Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 108, 330, 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement was founded on the belief that God explained the spiritual meaning of [[Bible|the Scriptures]] to Swedenborg as a means of revealing the truth of the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Jesus Christ]]. Swedenborg claimed [[revelation|divine inspiration]] for his writings&lt;ref name="Doc. II, page 404"&gt;Doc. II, page 404&lt;/ref&gt; and followers believe that Swedenborg witnessed the [[Last Judgment]] in the spiritual world, along with the inauguration of the New Church.

The New Church is seen by members of New Church organizations as something which the Lord is establishing with all those who believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the one God of heaven and Earth, and that obeying his commandments is necessary for salvation. Therefore, it is thought that any Christian holding these beliefs is part of this New Church movement. New Church organizations also acknowledge the universal nature of the Lord's church: all who do good from the truth of their religion will be accepted by the Lord into heaven, as God is goodness itself, and doing good conjoins one to God.&lt;ref name=TCR536&gt;TCR, n. 536.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents believe that the doctrine of the New Church is derived from scripture and provides the benefit of further enlightenment concerning the truth, and that this leads to diminished doubt, a recognition of personal faults, and thus a more directed and happier life.&lt;ref name=TCR225-231,352&gt;TCR, n. 225–231, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for the movement include '''Swedenborgian''', '''New Christians''', '''Neo-Christians''', '''Church of the New Jerusalem''', and '''The Lord's New Church'''. Those outside the church may refer to the movement as Swedenborgianism; however, some adherents seek to distance themselves from this title, since it implies a following of Swedenborg rather than Jesus Christ. Swedenborg published some of his theological works anonymously, and his writings promoted one Church based on love and charity, rather than multiple churches named after their founders based on belief or doctrine.&lt;ref name=AC1799.4&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Heavenly Arcana'' (or ''[[Arcana Coelestia]]''), 1749–58 (AC). 20 vols. Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 1799(4).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Swedenborg spoke of a "New Church" that would be founded on the theology in his works, but he himself never tried to establish an organization. In 1768, a heresy trial was initiated in Sweden against Swedenborg's writings and two men who promoted these ideas.  It essentially concerned whether Swedenborg's theological writings were consistent with the Christian doctrines. A royal ordinance in 1770 declared that Swedenborg's writings were "clearly mistaken" and should not be taught even though his system of theological thought was never examined.&lt;ref name="Jonsson, Inge 1999 pp.453"&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth (1999), pp.453–463.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's clerical supporters were ordered to cease using his teachings, and customs officials were directed to impound his books and stop their circulation in any district unless the nearest consistory granted permission. Swedenborg then begged the King for grace and protection in a letter from Amsterdam. A new investigation against Swedenborg stalled and was eventually dropped in 1778.&lt;ref name="Jonsson, Inge 1999 pp.453"/&gt;

At the time of Swedenborg's death, few efforts had been made to establish an organized church, but on May 7, 1787, 15 years after Swedenborg's death, the New Church movement was founded in England. It was a country Swedenborg had often visited and where he died. By 1789 a number of Churches had sprung up around England, and in April of that year the first General Conference of the New Church was held in Great Eastcheap, London. New Church ideas were carried to United States by missionaries. One famous missionary was [[Johnny Appleseed|John Chapman]], also known as Johnny Appleseed.

Early missionaries also traveled to parts of Africa. Swedenborg himself believed that the "African race" was "in greater enlightenment than others on this earth, since they are such that they think more "interiorly", and so receive truths and acknowledge them."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''The Final Judgment'', 1758 (FJ). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time these concepts of African enlightenment were judged highly liberal; Swedenborgians accepted freed African converts to their homes as early as 1790. Several of them were also involved in [[abolitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/abolition/wadstrom.htm |title=Carl Bernhard Wadström: biography and bibliography |website=Brycchancarey.com |date=2004-06-08 |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[occultism]] became increasingly popular especially in France and England. Some followers blended Swedenborg's writings with [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], [[alchemy]] and [[divination]]. What fascinated these followers most was Swedenborg's mystical side. They concentrated on his work ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]'' which tells of Swedenborg's visit to [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] to experience and report the conditions there. In structure, it was related to Dante's ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Some continue to combine the theology of the New Church with ideas from other systems, including [[Jungian psychology]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]].{{Citation needed|date = November 2012}}

[[File:Bryn Athyn Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The Bryn Athyn Cathedral of the General Church in Pennsylvania]]
In the US, the church was organized in 1817 with the founding of the ''General Convention of the New Church'' (sometimes referred to as the Convention), now also known as the ''[[Swedenborgian Church of North America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborg.org/Home.aspx Official website] of the Swedenborgian Church of North America.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement in the United States grew stronger until the late 19th century. There was a "New-Church Theology School" in Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New-Church Theology School |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n40/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A controversy about doctrinal issues and the authority of Swedenborg's writings caused a faction to split off to form the Academy of the New Church. It later became known as the [[General Church of New Jerusalem]] (sometimes referred to as the General Church,) with headquarters in [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]]. Other congregations felt doctrinally compelled to join the General Church at its inception. Two Convention congregations in Canada, one in Toronto and another in Kitchener, as well as two congregations from the British Conference, Michael Church in London and [[Colchester New Church]] joined the General Church at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Marguerite Beck. ''The New Church in the New World''. Swedenborg Publishing Association New York, p. 234 {{ISBN|0-87785-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annals of The General Church of the New Jerusalem, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, a doctrinal issue about the authority of Swedenborg's writings arose in the General Church. Members in the Hague branch of the General Church saw Swedenborg's theological writings as the Word of the Third Testament, which they wrote about extensively in their Dutch magazine ''De Hemelsche Leer''. Faced with discipline by the leading Bishop of the General Church, those holding this new doctrinal view split off to form the [[Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma]].{{citation needed|date = November 2012}}

The Swedenborgian Church of North America, with headquarters in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], now has 37 active churches with about 1,500 members in the US today. The [[General Church of the New Jerusalem]], with headquarters in Bryn Athyn, has about 5,000 members in 33 churches. The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma, also in Bryn Athyn, now has about 28 active churches with about 1900 members worldwide.{{citation needed|date = November 2012}}

The Lord's New Church is primarily associated with South Africa, although roughly 200 members are found in the United States. It is noted for its concern for [[social justice]]. Australia and Germany are estimated to have 504 and 200 members, respectively. Counting additional members in Asia, Africa, and South America, current sources put the total number of Swedenborgians between 25,000 and 30,000.{{Citation needed|date = November 2012}}

==Branches and membership==
{{As of|2000}} the most recent membership figures for the Four Church Organizations were:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010129041000/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/borg.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

*General Conference of the New Church (Great Britain): 1,314
*[[Swedenborgian Church of North America]], also known as The General Convention (USA): 2,029
*[[General Church of the New Jerusalem]]: 5,563
*[[The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma]]: 1,000

Membership in the New Church has always been small, and the different organizations have been heavily involved in publishing activities. In terms of doctrine, there is a striking similarity between the New Church and the [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] movement of the 20th century, which developed quite independently of the writings of Swedenborg. Although the movement is completely separate, some members make some acknowledgement of Emanuel Swedenborg, who preceded the foundation of their church by over 150 years.

== Main doctrines ==
[[File:New Jerusalem Church, Bridgewater, Massachusetts.jpg|thumb|New Jerusalem Church, Bridgewater, Massachusetts is a congregation of the Swedenborgian Church of North America.]]
There are two essential doctrines of the New Church: the first is that one God as one person in Jesus Christ is to be worshipped, and the second is that one must live according to His commandments. "There are two essentials which constitute the church, and hence two principal things of doctrine—one, that the Lord's Human is Divine; the other, that love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor constitute the church, and not faith separate from love and charity."&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 4723&lt;/ref&gt; These "two things, the acknowledgment of the Lord, and a life according to the precepts of the Decalogue, which are the two essentials of the New Church."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Apocalypse Revealed'', 1766 (AR). 3 vols. Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is by these two essential doctrines that conjunction with the Lord and salvation is effected.&lt;ref&gt;AR., n. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; "All things of the doctrine of the New Church have reference to these two, because they are its universals, on which all the particulars depend, and are its essentials, from which all the formalities proceed"&lt;ref&gt;AR., n. 903.&lt;/ref&gt; If one is unaware of these two essential doctrines of the New Church and yet has believed in one God and lived a good life, they will be taught this by angels after death.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Providence'', 1764 (DP). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 328. Also AR, n. 876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg held that God is one person revealed in Jesus Christ, which was later independently expressed by modern-day [[Oneness Pentecostalism]]. He stated that the doctrine of a trinity of three persons originated in the fourth century with the adoption of the [[Nicene Creed]] to combat the heresy of [[Arianism]], but this was unknown to the early Apostolic Church, as shown by the [[Apostles' Creed]] which preceded the Nicene Creed.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doctrine of the Lord ===

The universal principle of faith of the New Church is that the "Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah, came into the world to subjugate the hells and to glorify His Human; and without this no mortal could have been saved; and those are saved who believe in Him."&lt;ref name="TCR, n. 2"&gt;TCR, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "It is a universal principle of faith that God is one in essence and in person, in whom is a Divine trinity, and that He is the Lord God the Savior Jesus Christ. It is a universal principle of faith that no mortal could have been saved unless the Lord had come into the world. It is a universal principle of faith that He came into the world to remove hell from man, and that He did remove it by means of contests with it and victories over it, and thereby He subdued it and reduced it to order and made it obedient to Himself. It is a universal principle of faith that He came into the world to glorify His Human which He took on in the world, that is, to unite it with the Divine from which [are all things], and thereby He eternally holds hell in order and under obedience to Himself. As this could be accomplished only by means of temptations admitted into His Human, even to the last of them, which was the passion of the cross, He endured even that."&lt;ref name="TCR, n. 2"/&gt;

From this universal principle of faith of the New Church, the Divine Trinity is defined as "the three essentials of one God, and they make one as soul, body, and operation make one in man. Before the world was created this Trinity was not; but after creation, when God became incarnate, it was provided and brought about; and then in the Lord God the Redeemer and Savior Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="TCR, n. 163"&gt;TCR, n. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; As a trinity of soul, body and spirit exists in every man, so in Jesus this became the Holy Trinity. It is this doctrine of one God as one person which distinguishes the New Church from other Christian churches, most of which define the Trinity as three persons existing from eternity. The doctrine of three persons is regarded as inherently illogical by the New Church: "In the ideas of thought a Trinity of Divine Persons from eternity, or before the world was created, is a Trinity of Gods; and these ideas cannot be effaced by a lip-confession of one God."&lt;ref name="TCR, n. 163"/&gt;

In the New Church, monotheism is defined as one God who is one in person, and the immediate consequence of this doctrine is that only the Lord is worshipped, who is [[Jehovah]]. Worship and faith in Jesus is not placing worship in a created being: although born with a human body, His soul was the Divine from eternity. When He rose from the dead, He put off the human body he inherited from Mary, and put on a human body from the Divine within Him, which is known in the New Church as the ''Divine Human''.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Father is the inmost Divine which became outwardly manifest in a human form, known as the Son. As the Lord is one with the Father, the [[Lord's Prayer]] is directed to the Lord only. In the phrase "Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name" the word "name" is everything by which God is worshipped, especially His Divine Human, the Son, by which He is approached.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 6887; TCR, n. 112; AR, n. 584, 839.&lt;/ref&gt;

In scripture it is known that Jesus at times prayed to the Father, and at other times declared Himself one with the Father. This was because during His life Jesus progressed towards God by gradually making the human body he inherited at birth one with the Divine: the progress towards union with the Divine was his state of ''exinanition'' (see [[Kenosis]]), and the unification itself was His state of ''glorification''.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was this progress towards unification, completed by the passion on the cross, that is the means by which all of humanity was saved from hell.

===Doctrine of faith and charity===
A saving faith is in Jesus Christ, who is God and man, as he who approaches Jesus approaches the Father in Him.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; A faith in Jesus is a faith in a visible God, in whom is the invisible. Jesus is the image and form of the invisible God, by which focus can be retained on a finite form for the human mind. Without such an image or form for the thought, a belief in God falls into nothing and cannot be retained.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 339, 647.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Church takes this further, and states that God is Man Himself.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom'', 1763 (DLW). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Inasmuch as a person is in good and follows the truth, so far God abides in that person who becomes closer to being an image and likeness of Him.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas formerly the invisible God was worshipped, or God was worshipped by means of angelic intermediaries, or God was improperly divided into three persons, the revelation of the New Church is said to be the "crown of all churches which preceded it" as in it the one invisible God is worshipped in visible human form.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 786–787.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sum of faith is that he who lives well and believes alright is saved by the Lord. Faith is not mere persuasive belief: faith without charity is not faith, nor is charity without faith charity, for faith and charity make one in good works.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Faith and charity are one in the same way the will and the understanding in every person makes one: but they only become one in acts of good works or repentance.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 362, 509.&lt;/ref&gt; The union of faith and charity is a central tenet of the New Church, for all things of substance and form have relation to the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom,&lt;ref&gt;DLW, n. 40–46.&lt;/ref&gt; and the will and understanding in each person is a symbolic form or receptacle of God's Love and Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;DLW, n. 358–370.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus a person must not only through self-effort learn and accept the truths of faith, but also live by them, and in this manner a person becomes a receptacle and an abode of the Lord's presence. In this union between man and the Lord the faith becomes a living spiritual faith.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; All the precepts of how one should live is contained in the precepts of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; The first act of faith is repentance, which is a self-examination and acknowledgement of one's sins, and turning away from evil.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 510, 525–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doctrine of sacred scripture ===

All of sacred scripture concerns the Lord and his kingdom, and the Lord Himself is the Word.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Doctrine concerning the Lord'', 1763 (DL). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary doctrine, there are thus three essential doctrines or pillars of the New Church: the acknowledgment of the Divinity of the Lord, the acknowledgment of the holiness of the Word, and a life according to charity.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''The Final Judgment Continued'', 1763 (FJC). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 88, and DP, n. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Holy Scripture is Divinely inspired, as the literal sense contains a spiritual sense, which has been unveiled in the New Church through a series of symbolic correspondences.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Doctrine concerning Sacred Scripture'', 1763 (DS). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 5–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The literal sense, similar to a parable, hides the inner spiritual sense: "The truths of the sense of the letter of the Word are in part not naked truths, but are appearances of truth, and like similitudes and comparisons are taken from such things as are in nature; and thus are such as have been accommodated and adapted to the capacity of the simple and also of children."&lt;ref&gt;DS, n. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scripture will not be properly understood without doctrine, and doctrines of the church should be confirmed from scripture. True doctrine can only be known to those who are in enlightenment from the Lord,&lt;ref&gt;DS, n. 50–61.&lt;/ref&gt; and those who are not can derive heresies from it.&lt;ref&gt;DS, n. 91–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The literal sense of scripture contains the Divine truth in all of its fullness and power, thus a person becomes conjoined with the Lord and His angels when reading it.&lt;ref&gt;DS, n. 62–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sacraments ==

=== Baptism and Eucharist ===
There are two primary sacraments of the New Church: [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (also Communion, or Holy Supper).  These are external rituals that are symbolic of the inner spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 1083(2), TCR, n. 669.&lt;/ref&gt;  Baptism signifies one's entry into [[Christianity]], and signifies the reformation of the mind, where falsity is washed away by truth.  The baptism ritual should be done when one has reached the age of reason to make the decision to follow Jesus Christ, and yet, Swedenborg states that infants who are baptized are assigned a guardian angel until they reach the proper age, to guide them into the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 677–678.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Holy Supper, or Communion, signifies the regeneration of one's will in accordance with God's commandments, which causes the Lord to commune closely with man in his heart.  Thus everyone should examine his or her life before partaking in the Holy Supper, in order for the ritual to fulfill its purpose.

=== Marriage ===
A personal sacrament of the New Church is the rite of marriage, as administration by a priest is considered more of an expediency rather than a necessity.  It is not mentioned as a sacrament along with Baptism and the Holy Supper.  However elsewhere Swedenborg states that marriage should be administered by a priest "because marriages, considered in themselves, are spiritual, and thence holy; for they descend from the heavenly marriage of good and truth, and things conjugial correspond to the divine marriage of the Lord and the church; and hence they are from the Lord himself."&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''The Delights of Wisdom pertaining to Marriage Love'' (ML), 1768. Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, true marriage love is founded in religion, as they both originate from God.  Without a religious foundation, a marriage can turn cold.&lt;ref&gt;ML, n. 238–243.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marriage that is truly spiritual lasts forever, even in heaven after death. There, the two remain male and female as to form, and become one angel as to their soul. As a couple they live a life of useful service in the Lord's Heavenly Kingdom, which is perfected to eternity. If a person dies unmarried he or she will find a spouse in heaven.

Man is a form of truth, and woman is a form of love, and the two make one.  Marriage love comes directly from the sphere of heaven into all humans, and a life of [[celibacy]] interferes with this.&lt;ref&gt;ML, n. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus marriage is to be preferred to a state of remaining celibate.&lt;ref&gt;ML, n. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Afterlife ==
Before the universe was created, there was no space and time, and the realm where there is no space and time is the spiritual world. The spiritual world, which is divided between heaven and hell, is where the internal states of the soul become immediate realities. "All who die and become angels put off those two things proper to nature, which...are space and time; for they enter then into spiritual light, in which the objects of thought are truths, and the objects of sight are similar to the objects in the natural world, but correspondent to their thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;DLW, n. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of time, there are states of being, and instead of space or distance, there are affections and love.&lt;ref&gt;DLW, n. 70, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The more two souls love each other and are similar to each other, the closer they will appear to each other. God Himself is love itself, and the more one is in love towards God and others, the closer that person is to heaven, and the more one is into the love of self and the world, the closer they are to hell.

=== Origin of the soul ===

The soul is the recipient of life from God, and the body its natural clothing. The beginning of life, or the origin of one's soul, comes from the seed of the father, and the external body comes from the mother.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 103, 112, 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this, as Jesus was born of a virgin by the Holy Spirit, His soul was the Divine itself, and He had a pre-existence as Jehovah who always existed&lt;ref&gt;DL, n. 92, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; As souls originate from the seed of the father, for others there is no such thing as the pre-existence of souls, and thus there is no such thing as [[reincarnation]] or [[metempsychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 77, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with each person during their life are spirits and angels by which one obtains conjunction with heaven or hell, depending on how one lives their life. Generally, communication between spirits and man is not permitted, however in ancient times this communication was more open. Angels and spirits do retain their memories, and under certain mental states when communication is opened, a person may remember that spirit's memory as if it was one's own. In modern times this kind of mental state can be achieved under hypnosis and is known as "[[past life regression]]". It is from these types of experiences that some of the ancients derived a belief in the pre-existence of souls and reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Heaven and Hell'', 1758 (HH). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; However this is not true, one only lives once, and how one lives this life determines one's eternal destiny. At death, the soul sheds the physical body, after which one becomes aware of the spiritual society one's soul was associated with.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 438, 497.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Jesus said, ''The kingdom of God is inside of you'' (Luke 17:21).

=== The world of spirits ===

There is no such thing as [[purgatory]], a state after death where one suffers temporal punishments before entry into heaven. Punishment only takes place in hell. However immediately after the death of the body, one enters the world of spirits, an intermediate state where one awaits judgment to enter heaven or hell.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 784.&lt;/ref&gt; Insofar as the evil feign false appearances to appear good, or those who are good retain false ideas, one remains in this intermediate state until an exploration takes place.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 423–426.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are good and at the same time in truth pass immediately to heaven, and those who are in evil and the same time in falsity pass to hell. Otherwise, one gradually withdraws from exterior appearances and fallacies into one's interior intentions and affections in the world of spirits.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 491, 496, 499.&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is completed when one acts in complete freedom without any exterior restraint, and everything of a person's character is then made open and manifest. "Thus hidden things are laid open and secret things are uncovered, according to the Lord's words: ''There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not be known: whatsoever ye have said in the darkness, shall be heard in the light, and what ye have spoken in the ear in closets, shall be preached on the housetops'' (Luke xii. 2, 3). And in another place: ''I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment'' (Matt. xii. 36)."&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hell ===

When all external restraints are removed in the world of spirits, nothing remains to stop evil spirits except punishment. As evil spirits act according to their nature, they are then drawn downward towards similar evil societies in hell. "Every evil brings with itself punishment, the two making one; whoever therefore is in evil, is also in the punishment of evil. But still no one in the other world suffers punishment on account of the evils which he had done in this world, but on account of the evils which he then does. Yet it amounts to the same, and is the same thing, whether it be said that men suffer punishment on account of their evils in the world, or that they suffer punishment on account of the evils which they do in the other life, inasmuch as every one after death returns into his own life, and thus into similar evils, his nature remaining the same as it had been in the life of the body. That they are punished, is because the fear of punishment is the only means of subduing evils in this state. Exhortation is no longer of any avail, neither instruction, nor the fear of the law and loss of reputation, since every one now acts from his nature, which cannot be restrained nor broken except by punishments."&lt;ref name="HH, n. 509"&gt;HH, n. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; God casts no one to hell: as hell is the internal state of evil, and heaven is the internal state of good, each person enters a state that matches his or her internal nature.&lt;ref name="HH, n. 509"/&gt; Each person will remain to eternity according to his will or ruling love.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 480.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heaven ===

The Lord is the God of heaven, and heaven is made of the Divine which proceeds from Him.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 5, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In heaven the Lord is seen by the angels as a Sun which provides light to all of heaven, and at times He appears in the midst of heaven in the form of an angel.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Jesus stated that He is the light of the world, and at one time the apostles saw the face of Jesus shining like a sun. It is for this reason the ancients aligned their temples to the east to the rising sun.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In heaven there are innumerable societies each fulfilling a particular office, each arranged according to one's love. Altogether the form of heaven is that of a human form. Each angel has a spiritual body also in human form, and is a heaven in its least microcosmic form.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 41–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

All angels and demons in heaven and hell originated from the human race, and this is why angels have human form. There is no individual spirit known as the devil or satan: "in the whole heaven there is not one angel who was so created from the beginning, nor in hell any devil who was created an angel of light and cast down; but that all, both in heaven and in hell, are from the human race; in heaven those who lived in the world in heavenly love and faith, in hell those who lived in infernal love and faith; and that hell taken as a whole is what is called the devil and satan."&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free will, morality and salvation ==

Free will to choose between good and evil originates from the spiritual equilibrium that exists between heaven and hell. Hell continually influences man to do evil, and heaven continually influences man to do good. It is from this spiritual equilibrium that man has freedom to think rationally, and it is from this freedom that one can be spiritually reformed by acknowledging evil in one's self, then ceasing to do evil, and finally to hold that evil in aversion.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 589–590, 597–598.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why this choice is spiritual in origin is there is a constant spiritual influx into the soul and mind with every thought and action.&lt;ref name="HH, n. 599"&gt;HH, n. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inasmuch as one does good one becomes conjoined with angels, and inasmuch as one does evil one becomes conjoined with evil spirits.&lt;ref name="HH, n. 599"/&gt; One must become reformed and saved by means of Divine truth: for it is truth which fights against what is evil and false. When the truth is accepted and one sees an internal evil selfish desire, combat or temptation results. One must resist against evil temptation from one's own effort, which appears as a remorse of conscience, but in reality this is a combat that takes place between the Lord and the devil or hell.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 596.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "he who thinks that he fights from himself against the devil is enormously deceived."&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 1813.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvation or condemnation is a result of one's moral choices in life, based on one's intentions. Good is only considered good once evils are removed, not before. Good must be done for the sake of the Lord out of love, and not for profit or self-honor. And, one must acknowledge that all good comes from the Lord only, and only the Lord can conquer temptation. This is a continuous process during one's lifetime. If this is the case, the question then arises, why was it necessary for Jesus Christ to come to save the human race? The answer to that is before the time of Jesus, the spiritual equilibrium between heaven and hell had become imbalanced, and hell began to gain control and influence over humanity: more people began to choose evil, and an eternal damnation threatened the entire human race.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By becoming incarnate in human form, Jehovah could fight directly against all of hell, as Jesus suffered enormous temptations from the body He inherited from His human mother. This process continued until Jesus conquered all temptations, and thus all of hell, even to the point where His physical body was made one with the Divine. From His body the Divine proceeded forth as the Holy Spirit, by which He can directly operate through each person's will for reformation, so that each person can become conjoined directly with the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remission of sins is nothing more than their removal after repentance.&lt;ref&gt;DL, n. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the other point where the New Church differs from the older Christian churches. "The belief that the passion of the cross was redemption itself is a fundamental error of the church; and that error, together with the error concerning three Divine persons from eternity, has perverted the whole church, so that nothing spiritual is left in it."&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The passion of the cross was simply the last temptation that was endured before the human was made Divine.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no such thing as vicarious atonement, where sins are transferred from one person to another. Passages from scripture that refer to the body and blood of Jesus refer to the Divine Good and Divine Truth which proceeds from his Divine Human; and these are imbibed or imputed by a life of charity and faith.

== Biblical canon ==
The Word of God is contained in the Bible, which has a symbolic spiritual meaning hidden in its literal sense.  Swedenborg's visions primarily explain how and why the Bible is divinely inspired, and it is methodically delineated word by word in his massive multi-volume work, the [[Arcana Coelestia]] (meaning ''Heavenly Secrets'').  The symbolic language, where each passage follows the other in a coherent logical series, is what Swedenborg called "correspondences."  This inner meaning was kept hidden, and could only have been discovered through revelation, which was made available when mankind was ready to receive it.  It is this hidden inner meaning that separates the Bible from other books, and each statement Swedenborg makes is supported through numerous quotations of Biblical passages.  The books that have this inner spiritual meaning is what forms the true [[Biblical canon]], as follows:

=== Old Testament ===
According to Swedenborg, the original text of the [[Old Testament]] is preserved in the Hebrew [[Masoretic]] edition, where letters were counted by the [[Masorites]] to ensure that the scripture remained accurate and free from corruption.&lt;ref&gt;DS, n. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to [[Judaism]], Swedenborg divides the Old Testament into three main divisions: the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.  The same divisions were specified by Jesus Christ in the gospel of Luke (Luke 24:44). The books of the Bible that have an internal spiritual sense, and are thus divinely inspired, include the Law of Moses ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], and [[Books of Kings|Kings]]), the Prophets ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]], [[Book of Joel|Joel]], [[Book of Amos|Amos]], [[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]], [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]], [[Book of Micah|Micah]], [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]], [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]], [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]], [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]], [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]]) and the [[Psalms]].&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 2606, 10325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's groupings differ from Judaism's, as he assigned Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings to the Law of Moses, while according to the Jewish biblical canon the Law of Moses (the [[Torah]]) refers to the first five books, and these four books belong to the Prophets (''[[Nevi'im]]''). However, in other passages Swedenborg states that [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]] represent the Law and the Prophets respectively,&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 2135, 5922(5), 5922(8).&lt;/ref&gt; and as Elijah appears in the book of Kings that would indicate that this book should belong among the Prophets.

The other books of the Old Testament, which are not believed to be divinely inspired, include those that are generally grouped by the Jews under the "Writings" (''[[Ketuvim]]''). In the Greek [[Septuagint]] these works were mixed in with the rest of scripture, which largely determined the Biblical book order for all of Christianity. Moreover, the Greek Septuagint introduced other writings among the Hebrew scripture, which [[Martin Luther]] removed and placed among the [[Apocrypha]]. Among the Writings the Jews included Lamentations, Daniel, and sometimes the Psalms, which the New Church states are divinely inspired and are considered as primary sacred scripture. Of the other books in the Writings, Swedenborg takes special note of the [[Book of Job]] and the [[Song of Songs]]. These books do indeed contain symbolic representations similar to divinely inspired scripture, but not in a complete series.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 1756(2), 3540(2), 3942(2), 9942(5).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Testament ===
The New Church regards the words of Jesus as divinely inspired, and thus the canon of sacred scripture, and among the books of the [[New Testament]] includes only the four Gospels ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], [[Gospel of John|John]]) and the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 10325.&lt;/ref&gt; Only these books contain an internal symbolism in a series, and are thus divinely inspired.

Although this leaves out the [[Book of Acts]] and the [[epistles|letters of the apostles]], the New Church holds them in esteem similar to that of the Jews for the Writings of the Old Testament. Swedenborg stated that these books were included as an act of [[divine providence]], as books explaining Christian doctrine were needed for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''The Spiritual Diary'', 1747–65 (SD). Trans. by George Bush, John H. Smithson and Buss, 1883-9, n. 4824.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's letters, although not containing a word for word symbolic correspondence, was still Divinely influenced: "Paul indeed spoke from inspiration, but not in the same way as the prophets, to whom every single word was dictated but that his inspiration was that he received an influx, according to those things which were with him, which is quite a different inspiration, and has no conjunction with heaven by correspondences."&lt;ref&gt;SD, n. 6062.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Biblical texts ===
Swedenborg stated that there were a set of sacred texts among an "Ancient Church" in the Middle East which preceded Judaism, but the texts became lost over time. Some of these are quoted in the Bible, such as [[Book of the Wars of the Lord|''The Wars of Jehovah'']] (Num. 21:14–15) and another book similar to those in the Prophets (Num. 21:27–30).&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 1664(12), 2686, 9942(5); DS, n. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Another work that Swedenborg said belonged to the Ancient Church was [[Book of Jasher (Biblical references)|the Book of Jasher]], which is also quoted in the Bible (Josh. 10:12–13, 2 Sam. 1:17–18), which Swedenborg stated was still extant in [[Tartary]].&lt;ref&gt;AR, n. 11, and TCR, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hebrew midrash called Jasher (see [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]) was published in Venice in 1625 and an English translation was published in 1840. The Hebrew text was examined by the 19th-century biblical scholar [[George Bush (biblical scholar)|George Bush]] (a relative of the [[Bush political family]]), who later became a Swedenborgian minister. Although the New Church has no official position on this Hebrew text, Swedenborg stated that the first portions of Genesis was taken from the Ancient Word,&lt;ref&gt;TCR, Index to Memorable Relations, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and these portions do happen to be found in the book of Jasher.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'', ed. by Theodore Webber, 2012, preface. {{ISBN|978-0-9857796-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, however, have identified late additions to this Hebrew text.

== Assessments of other beliefs ==
In the doctrines of the New Church, there is a complete review and assessment of the doctrines of the former churches. Before the New Church can be received, the doctrines of the older churches must be exposed in the open and rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''Summary Exposition'', 1769 (SE). Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the faith of the New Church is so opposite to the doctrines of the older Christian churches that they cannot coexist.&lt;ref&gt;SE, n. 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment of other beliefs also helps to clarify the position of the New Church, and explains why a revelation was needed to correct the theological direction of the Christian churches.

=== Former Christian creeds ===

In the New Church, authority is based on divine revelation, not on creeds or church councils.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; All doctrine should be confirmed by scripture. However, one's interpretation of scripture is also determined by doctrine, and one should seek enlightenment from the Lord when reading the Word.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; As the New Church was established to correct errors that have been accepted as true throughout the history of Christianity, the following is an assessment of the foundational creeds and ecumenical councils of the Christian church:

==== Apostles' Creed ====

The [[Apostles' Creed]] is the Creed of the Apostolic Church, which contains no explicit statement of a trinity of persons, as indicated in the phrase, "I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary: also in the Holy Spirit." This creed is in agreement with the doctrines of the New Church, as it does not mention a Son who existed from eternity, but rather the Son born in time to the virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Church, the Son is not a separate person, but the human born in time to the virgin Mary by which God became man and man became God.

==== Nicene Creed ====

The [[Nicene Creed]], along with the [[Athanasian Creed]], introduced an idea of a trinity of persons, and perverted the entire Christian Church.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nicene Creed is a modified version of the Apostles' Creed, and in the view of the New Church a trinity of persons is equivalent to a trinity of Gods,&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; nor does the explanation that the three persons are of one substance or essence remove this idea of three Gods from the thought.&lt;ref&gt;SE, n. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nicene Creed also introduces the concept of a Son "begotten from eternity", and in the New Church the idea of a Son born from eternity assuming a human body is not only erroneous, but is the source of several theological errors.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 83, 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Church, "the Human, by which God sent Himself into the world, is the Son of God."&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Athanasian Creed ====

As with the [[Nicene Creed]], the [[Athanasian Creed]] is incorrect when it defines a trinity of persons. Despite this, in the New Church the Athanasian Creed can be corrected as long as a Trinity of one person in the Lord is understood when the creed speaks of a trinity of persons.&lt;ref&gt;DL, n. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Athanasian Creed expresses the correct doctrine of the Divine Human of the New Church, as it states: "That our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is both God and Man; and although He is God and Man, still there are not two, but there is one Christ. He is one, because the Divine took to itself the Human; yea, He is altogether one, for He is one Person: since as the soul and the body make one man, so God and Man is one Christ." In the doctrine of the New Church, the human nature of the Lord was fully glorified and was made Divine.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 10125(3), 10824, DL, n. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Council of Chalcedon ====

The [[Council of Chalcedon]] declared that Jesus has two natures, the Divine and the human, and is thus contrary to the doctrine of the New Church. As for this particular council, Swedenborg stated that it was revealed to him in a vision from heaven that "those who had the greatest influence in the council, and who were superior to the rest in rank and authority, came together in a dark room and there concluded that both a Divine and a human nature should be attributed to the Lord; principally for the reason, that otherwise the papal sway could not be maintained. For if they had acknowledged the Lord to be one with the Father, as He Himself says, no one could have been recognized as His vicar on earth; and schisms were arising at that time, by which the papal power might have fallen and been dissipated, if they had not made this distinction. Then to give their decision strength, they sought out confirmations from the Word, and persuaded the rest."&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 4738(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most other churches still maintain that Jesus has two natures, the New Church states that His Human was made Divine.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 10125(4).&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the New Church is thus similar or the same as the [[Monophysite]] theology of the ancient Christian Churches of the Middle East, which was suppressed by the western [[Chalcedonian]] churches.

=== Socinianism and Arianism ===

In [[Socinianism]] the Divinity of Jesus is denied, and Jesus is considered to be no different than any other man. [[Arianism]] is similar, which states that Jesus was a created being. As the acknowledgement of Jesus as the God-Man or Divine Human is a central tenet of the New Church, this type of theology is regarded as the worst and most abominable of all heresies. The Divine Human is the means by which all of humanity is saved, and as all those who are in heaven are in His presence, those in the Christian church who have denied His Divinity have no other place to go than hell. This condemnation, however, does not apply to those who have been born and lived outside the Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 3, 83; DP, n. 231, 256; AR, n. 571; TCR, n. 380, 795.&lt;/ref&gt; In the revelation of the New Church it was shown that many within the Christian church are Socinian at heart, denying that Jesus is Divine and are thus hypocrites. The reason why this is so is that this thought can be derived from a doctrine of three persons, from dividing Christ into two natures, and from calling Jesus as the mere son of Mary.&lt;ref&gt;DP, n. 262; TCR, n. 94, 111, 380, 637–638.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

The religion of [[Islam]] was established according to Divine Providence, in order to eliminate the idolatrous worship of many nations. It is regarded as a partial or introductory revelation, as Islam worships one God, teaches one to live well and to shun evil, teaches that Jesus was a great prophet and the son of the virgin Mary but not the son of God, as in Christianity, and the [[Quran]] contains teachings from portions of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 833.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Islam is a religion adapted to societies where polygamy is permitted. As polygamy is an opposite love from monogamous marriage, and a marriage between a husband and wife corresponds to the marriage of the Lord and the church, internal spiritual matters were not revealed or allowed to be known in Islam to prevent what is holy from being profaned.&lt;ref&gt;FJ, n. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus regarded differently from [[Socinianism]] or [[Arianism]], because only those within the Christian church can profane what is holy by distorting scripture, and those outside the church such as Muslims cannot.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 9021.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims will oppose any Christian church where a trinity of three Divine persons is accepted.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 831.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Church teaches that there is a society of Muslims in heaven, but only those who reject polygamy in favor of monogamy can be taught the true nature of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 832.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholic Church ===

According to Swedenborgian teaching, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] has perverted scripture for the purpose of obtaining primacy and dominion in spiritual matters. Specifically, the intent of the decision at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] to declare that Jesus has a Divine and human nature was so that the Papacy could claim to be the Vicar of Christ, and appropriate spiritual powers to the priesthood which belongs to Divinity alone. Thus authority is often claimed by the Papacy and the priesthood over that of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. ''New Jerusalem and its Heavenly Doctrine'', 1758. Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to spiritually rule over others or appearing pious for the sake of self-honor and reputation originates from self-love which is opposite to the love of God and others.&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 508, 535, 562, 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papal primacy is claimed by the Catholic Church from a false interpretation of Matt. 16:18–19, where the apostle Peter is declared to be the rock on which the church will be built, and he is given the keys of heaven. In the New Church, this passage is understood spiritually: the "rock" signifies the truth that Jesus is the Lord, "Peter" signifies faith in the Lord, and the "keys of the kingdom of heaven" signifies the power from faith that allows one to enter heaven.&lt;ref&gt;AC, n. 3769(4), 9410(2)-9410(3).&lt;/ref&gt; It was from Divine Providence that the Catholic Church was allowed to have spiritual dominion, as it helped spread the gospel and prevented the Christian church from being destroyed by [[Arianism]] or [[Socinianism]].&lt;ref&gt;DP, n. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those within the Catholic church who do not read scripture are in external worship only, but this again is from Divine Providence to prevent holy scripture from being profaned.&lt;ref&gt;AC, 10040(2).&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics who have avoided idolatrous worship, and out of a sincere heart adored the Lord alone and have done good works, can receive spiritual truth from scripture more easily than others.&lt;ref&gt;FJC, n. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Church is in agreement with the Catholic Church insofar as both do not separate faith from charity.

=== The Protestant or Reformed Churches ===

Although the [[Protestant]] churches have broken away from the Catholic Church and rejected many of its traditions, surprisingly on further analysis the basic theology has remained the same. For the most part, Catholics and Protestants agree on the belief of a trinity of three persons, original sin, the imputation of the merit of Christ, and justification by faith. The main difference is that the Protestants believe that faith alone saves, without works of charity.&lt;ref&gt;SE, n. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why the leading reformers separated faith from charity was for the sake of obtaining complete separation from the Catholic Church. Despite this, Protestants do adjoin good works to charity, but in man as a passive subject, whereas in the Catholic Church good works can be done by man as an active subject.&lt;ref&gt;SE, n. 21–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New Church good works must also be done according to faith in man also as an active subject, with the acknowledgment that all good originates from God and not from self. The Protestant doctrine of separating faith from good works is derived from a single verse from the apostle Paul, where he states that man is justified by faith without "works of the law" (Rom. 3:28). However this is a false interpretation, for by "works of the law" Paul had meant the external rituals of the Mosaic law, not the Decalogue or the ten commandments, nor works of charity. When it is recognized that the doctrine of faith alone is false, and true faith is joined to how one lives one's life, the rest of the theology falls apart.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus there is no instantaneous salvation by paying lip service to a belief in Christ, at which time "[[imputed righteousness]]" is transferred to the believer.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 626–646.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, everyone acquires a nature according to their works, and thus everyone must repent of their sins by refusing to do evil. "The faith of the former church is, that repentance, remission of sins, renewal, regeneration, sanctification, and salvation, follow of themselves the faith that is given and imputed, without any thing of man being mingled or joined with them: but the faith of the New Church teaches repentance, reformation, regeneration, and thus remission of sins, with man's cooperation. The faith of the former church teaches the imputation of Christ's merit, and the imputation embraced in the faith that is given: but the faith of the New Church teaches the imputation of good and evil, and at the same time of faith, and that this imputation is according to the Sacred Scripture, while the other is contrary to it."&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 647.&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as Protestant churches withdraw from the doctrine of faith alone (see ''[[Sola fide]]''), they tend to be in greater light than other churches, for "the Word is read by them, and the Lord is worshipped, and hence with them there is the greatest light; and spiritual light, which is from the Lord as the Sun, which in its essence is Divine love, proceeds and extends itself in every direction, and enlightens even those who are in the circumferences round about, and opens the faculty of understanding truths, so far as they can receive them in accordance with their religion."&lt;ref&gt;FJC, n. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eschatology ==
There is no "end of the world" where the visible heaven and earth will disappear.  Instead, the church has passed through different ages or dispensations, each ending with a [[Last Judgment]] that occurs in the spiritual world.  The last of these took place in the year 1757.  Previous last judgments had occurred at the time of Noah's Flood, and at the passion of the cross by Jesus Christ.  The purpose of these last judgments is to separate the good from the evil in the intermediate spiritual world, which lies between heaven and hell.  As a result of these periodic judgments, a new age or New Church begins among the people on earth.  The Second Coming of the Lord is not a coming in person as the Word incarnate, but His coming is the revelation of the spiritual symbolism in the Bible, and the formation of a New Church as a result of this revelation.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 776.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been four Churches or dispensations preceding the New Church on this earth: the first was the "Most Ancient Church" before the flood, where contact with heaven was direct.  The second was the "Ancient Church" which followed the flood, which was destroyed by idolatry.  The third was [[Judaism]], which began with the revelation of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] to [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai]].  The fourth is Christianity established by Jesus and his apostles, which over time became divided primarily into the [[Orthodox Church]], the [[Catholic Church]], and Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 760, 786.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Church, which is the final phase or dispensation, is a renewal of Christianity based on the Lord's [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 115, 753, 754, 772, 773.&lt;/ref&gt; The New Church is the fulfillment of the prophecy of the heavenly New Jerusalem which descends out of heaven in the book of Revelation.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 118, 182, 197, 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg stated that the establishment of the New Church would happen gradually, and not in a moment, as the false beliefs of the former Church had to first be set aside.&lt;ref&gt;TCR, 784.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and censorship ==
{{See also|Historical fires of Stockholm}}

Some Christians of other denominations have criticised the church's beliefs, due to the denial of a Holy Trinity of three persons and the denial of blood atonement.  The New Church believes that there is one God in one person, Jesus Christ, and it is this doctrine which causes some Christian theologians to classify the Church as a cult.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Martin. ''Kingdom of the Cults''.  Bloomington: Bethany House Publishers, 2003, pp. 636–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others reject the teachings on the basis that Swedenborg claimed to have visions. The late  Walter Martin, a well known [[Evangelical]] author and  [[apologist]], quoted an authority that his spiritual experiences "were admittedly of such a character, that in an ordinary man they would have sufficed to qualify him for an asylum."  In contrast, Martin stated that his theological writings were so systematic that "no one can reasonably say that Swedenborg was insane."&lt;ref name="Walter, p. 631"&gt;Walter, p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Martin argued that "Swedenborg was a rationalist, and paradoxically, a mystic. He was one who absorbed the introspective and subjective philosophy of Rene Descartes, and the empiricism of John Locke, which he combined with the transcendentalism of lmmanuel Kant, thus forming a mold into which Christian theology was poured, and what would not go into the mold (selected Old Testament works, the Pauline epistles, Acts, James, Peter, Jude, etc.), he simply discarded. What emerged was a deeply speculative philosophical system of theology, couched in a redefined Christian terminology, and buttressed with mystical visions, trances, and dreams."&lt;ref name="Walter, p. 641"&gt;Walter, p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest and most well known example of a dual treatment of Swedenborg came from German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]], who was a contemporary of Swedenborg.  Swedenborg was relatively unknown until 1759 when a fire broke out in Stockholm, Sweden, which threatened to burn down his house and all his writings.  At the time Swedenborg was at a dinner in Gothenburg, 480 kilometres away.  He suddenly turned pale and described to the guests exactly what was happening, until the fire was put out three houses down from his house.  This was investigated by Kant who wrote ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'', in which he criticized Swedenborg and knowledge derived from dreams and visions.  In private letters Kant stated that he clothed his views in irony, and had great admiration for Swedenborg, but did not publicly admit it for fear of ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dreams of a Spirit-Seer/Appendix 4|Kant, Immanuel. Dreams of a Spirit-Seer, trans. by Emanuel F. Goerwitz, 1900, Appendix IV.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians argue that Swedenborg was someone who channeled spirits, and that although he himself warned against such, he felt he had been given permission from God to do, and that the spirits Swedenborg contacted were "good spirits."  As many of Swedenborg's teachings disagree with what has been established as orthodox theology, they state that he received his information from evil spirits and that the revelation that Swedenborg's New Church has promoted  is "among the most antibiblical and anti-Christian material ever printed."&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, John and John Weldon. ''Cult Watch''. Eugene: Harvest House Publishers, 1991, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K5DyeKul6-0C&amp;pg=PA360&amp;lpg=PA360&amp;dq=John+and+John+Weldon+Cult+Watch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fGhZqP5vTd&amp;sig=4mvDeQpa3mvY3UGYvFS5XyF70nw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nevRUIvVBceP0QGC7YCIAw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=most%20antibiblical%20and%20anti-Christian%20material&amp;f=false Ankerberg, John and John Weldon ''Cult Watch''] Eugene: Harvest House Publishers, 1991, p. 172 (Google book, text search)&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin stated that Swedenborg "was apparently well aware of the fact that Pauline theology, if accepted at face value, would vitiate almost en toto his own. So he began with the basic assumption that he was right, and that the apostle Paul was wrong! In some of his visions and dreams, he stated that he actually argued with Paul, Luther, Calvin, and others. And, as ego triumphed, these great thinkers all retreated before Swedenborg’s new revelations. However, one factor must never be forgotten, and that is the statement that the New Testament is the criterion for measuring all subsequent revelations, and whatever is found to be contrary to it, must be and always has been, rejected by the Christian church."&lt;ref name="Walter, p. 638"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Cults-Walter-Martin/dp/0764228218#reader_0764228218 |title=The Kingdom of the Cults |author1=Walter Martin |author2=Ravi Zacharias |isbn=9780764228216 |website=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Christians emphasize that in distinguishing an evil spirit from an angel of light,  true angels must glorify Christ and any teaching must be based on scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Swedenborg's apologists argue that Swedenborg would agree, as he stated no evil spirit in hell can even utter the name of Jesus, as the name "Jesus" signifies salvation and those in the spiritual world must speak as they think.&lt;ref&gt;AR, n. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

They also contend that, unlike many spiritualists, Swedenborg consistently elevates Jesus Christ as the God of heaven and earth, and all doctrines are derived from numerous scriptural references. Moreover, Swedenborg states that none of the teachings originated from any angel or spirit, and that the spiritual world was revealed to him so that humanity may know that there is life after death:  "…when I think of what I am about to write and while I am writing, I enjoy a complete inspiration, for otherwise it would be my own; but now I know for certain that what I write is the living truth of God."&lt;ref name="Doc. II, page 404"/&gt;

"That the Lord manifested Himself before me His servant, and sent me to this office, and that He afterward opened the sight of my spirit, and so has admitted me into the spiritual world, and has granted to me to see the heavens and the hells, also to converse with angels and spirits, and this now continuously for many years, I testify in truth; likewise, that from the first day of that call I have not received any thing which pertains to the doctrines of that church from any angel, but from the Lord alone while I read the Word."&lt;ref&gt;TCR, n. 779. See also DP, n. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to claims of a Scriptural basis, Christian apologists point out that Swedenborg only held to 36  books of the [[Bible]] as being wholly inspired,&lt;ref&gt;Arcana Coelestia (10325)&lt;/ref&gt; and that  one of the devil's tactics is to masquerade as an entity of light,&lt;ref&gt;Ankerberg, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; and Swedenborg's allegorical and esoteric interpretations and paranormal encounters (of a type which are seen as occultic), contradict Scripture and render as spurious any claim to be Scriptural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchman.org/profile/swedenborgpro.htm |title=Page Redirection |website=Watchman.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter, pp. 638-641"&gt;Walter, pp. 638–641&lt;/ref&gt;

In his day Swedenborg had distributed his books to many of the bishops of England, and to the nobility, but although considered well-written they did not think them valuable and instructed as many as they could not to read them.&lt;ref&gt;AR, n. 716.&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship in the form of omission was claimed by [[Eric J. Sharpe]] in the evangelical biographies of Indian missionary [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]] (1889–1929). Singh was said to have a number of gifts, including healing and having visions.  Although Singh claimed to have seen Emanuel Swedenborg in his visions, Sharpe discovered that all the evangelical biographies would omit this fact, due to the fact they considered the teachings of Swedenborg as unorthodox (see "Biographical Controversies" in [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]]). Swedenborg apologists complain that censorship continues to this day as several Swedenborg websites on the internet are classified as a "malicious site" in web filtering software (see "Religious, anti-religious, and political censorship" in [[Content-control software]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Influence ==
The writings of Swedenborg cover a wide area of subjects.  Thus Swedenborg and the New Church have had influence in a number of other areas.

=== Mormonism ===
The researcher [[D. Michael Quinn]] suggests that [[Joseph Smith Jr.]], the founder of [[Mormonism]], was influenced by the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;see Early Mormonism and the Magic World View&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Swedenborg, Mormons believe in eternal marriage, but require that the ritual be performed in a Mormon temple (see [[Celestial Marriage]]).  Also Joseph Smith's idea of three heavens is similar to Swedenborg's view that there are three heavens (see [[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)]]).  Both Swedenborg and Joseph Smith refer to the highest heaven as "celestial", in concert with the usage of the apostle Paul (see 2 Corinthians 12:2) when he described a visit to the "third heaven".  Other historians, including [[William J. Hamblin]], seriously doubt whether Joseph Smith, living in rural upstate New York, could have had access to Swedenborg's book and so find Quinn's assertions problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Hamblin, William J. [http://mi.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=12&amp;num=2&amp;id=364 "That Old Black Magic."] FARMS Review 12.2 (2000): 225–394. The Neal A. Maxwell Institute For Religious Scholarship. Web. 01 Dec. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Edward Hunter, a Swedenborgian who later became a Mormon, reported that in 1839 Joseph Smith told him he was familiar with the writings of Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;William E. Hunter, Edward Hunter: Faithful Steward (Salt Lake City: Publishers Press, 1970), 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Thought movement ===
[[New Thought]] is a spiritual movement that began in the United States in the late 19th century which promotes positive thinking and healing.  One of its earliest proponents was [[Phineas Parkhurst Quimby]], a healer who said that illnesses in the body originated from false beliefs in the mind.  One of the people he healed was [[Warren Felt Evans]], a Swedenborgian minister, who himself became a healer and published several books promoting New Thought and explaining it in terms of New Church doctrines.  Swedenborg had stated that there was a correspondence of heaven with all things on earth,&lt;ref&gt;HH, n. 103–107.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus there is a correspondence between the mind and the body.  In general, the organized churches based on New Thought (e.g., [[Unity Church]], [[Religious Science]], [[Church of Divine Science]]) have developed their own teachings separate from those of Swedenborg and the New Church.

=== Psychology ===
[[Carl Jung]], founder of [[analytical psychology]] and a contemporary of [[Sigmund Freud]], was familiar with the works of Swedenborg.  He mentioned Swedenborg's clairvoyance of the fire of Stockholm in 1759 as an example of [[synchronicity]], writing "“When . . . the vision arose in Swedenborg’s mind of a fire in Stockholm, there was a real fire raging there at the same time, without there being any demonstrable or
even thinkable connection between the two”".&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl. ''Synchronicity'', 1960, para. 912, 915.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other notable adherents ===
Notable persons influenced either by Swedenborg's writing or by the New Church include:
* [[William Blake]]: An English poet and painter who wrote ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', a satirization of Swedenborg's work ''Heaven and Hell''. Blake and his wife, Catherine, attended the first General Conference of the New Jerusalem Church in 1789. It is worth noting, however, that Blake was influenced by an earlier version of the New Church. The doctrine of the church has gone through many revisions since his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blake and Swedenborg: Opposition Is True Friendship|last=Bellin|first=Harvey F.|last2=Ruhl|first2=Darrell|publisher=Swedenborg Foundation|year=1985|isbn=0-87785-127-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Daniel Burnham]]: His parents were Swedenborgians.
* [[Robert Carter (American founding father)|Robert Carter III]]: became a Swedenborgian in 1787 after his wife died{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

* [[Leonard Gyllenhaal]]: entomologist and dedicated Swedenborgian
* [[Stephen Gyllenhaal]]: descendant of Leonard who was raised Swedenborgian
* [[William Harbutt]]: inventor of Plasticine; was a member at Bath too
* [[George Inness]]: widely-admired American landscape painter, was a devout Swedenborgian
* [[Helen Keller]]: wrote ''[[Light in My Darkness]]'' which advocated the ideals of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]
* [[James Tyler Kent]]: late 19th-century American homeopathic physician who incorporated Swedenborgian principles into homeopathic theory of disease, as described in his ''Lectures on Homeopathic Philosophy''&lt;ref name=BritInfluence&gt;Peter Morrell, "Kent's Influence on British Homeopathy," ''Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy,'' vol. 92 (1999–2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoint.org/morrell/articles/pm_kent.htm |title=Kent'S Influence On British Homeopathy – Peter Morrell |website=Homeoint.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lucius Lyon]]: "In politics he was [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], in religion a Swedenborgian."
* [[William Rainey Marshall]]: fifth [[governor]] of [[Minnesota]]; advocate for black [[suffrage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/group/swedenborgian.html |title=Swedenborgian Politicians |publisher=The Political Graveyard |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mehmet Oz]]: influenced by the mysticism of Sufi Muslims, as well as the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg
* Sir [[Isaac Pitman]]: inventor of shorthand; prominent member of the Greek styled New Jerusalem church in [[Bath, England]]
* [[Arthur Sewall]]: Democratic candidate for vice-president in the 1896 US presidential election
* [[Ernest George Trobridge]]: architect and developer who was active in domestic architecture during the first half of the 20th century, especially in the North Western suburbs of London
* [[Lois Wilson (activist)|Lois Wilson]]: founder of [[Al-Anon]], raised Swedenborgian&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030219235745/http://www.mental-health-matters.com/articles/print.php?artID=245 ]&lt;/ref&gt; (Her husband [[Bill W.]], of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] fame, married her at her family's Swedenborgian chapel. Still the influence of the faith on him is disputed.)

There are 25 churches left in England and a handful of ministers. The denomination in the 19th century had over a hundred churches in the UK, often very grand churches very Anglican in style with large chancels, side pulpits and altars. Nearly all of these churches have closed or were rebuilt in the late 20th century.

'''Thomas Aubrey''' (1808–1867) was a Welsh [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan]] [[Methodist]] minister. 

==Early life==
Aubrey was born at [[Cefn-coed-y-cymmer]] on 13 May 1808. His parents were Thomas and Anne Aubrey of [[Cefn-coed-y-cymmer]].&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; He was schooled on the [[Arminianism]], within the context of the Wesleyan faith, by an elder and at about the age of 14, when he had a religious conversion.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; By the age of 15, he was preaching and became a Wesleyan Methodist minister by 1826&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; and ordained a full-time minister in 1830.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;  He married Elizabeth Williams of [[Ruthin]] on 6 April 1831.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

==Career==
Beginning in 1826, he preached in London, Liverpool, on circuits in North Wales, and in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] for 39 years. He was the chairman of the North Wales district meeting for eleven years beginning in 1854.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;  Within four years, he had become the superintendent minister of the Bangor circuit, where he ran a series of successful revival meetings and "sparked" a revival movement in Wales.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dyfed Wyn Roberts|title=Revival, Renewal, and the Holy Spirit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWJMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40|date=November 1, 2009|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60899-168-6|pages=40, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, he became a [[:wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]].&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

Thomas Aubrey memoir)&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;}}

According to biographer Albert Hughes Williams, he was "one of the outstanding figures in Welsh Wesleyan Methodist history", excelling as an administrator and an orator. He was instrumental in the creation of the North Wales District Chapel Fund and the home mission fund. He established revival meetings, circuit manses, and meetings within churches to discuss their spiritual condition.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; 

He died 16 November 1867 at [[Rhyl]].&lt;ref name="DWB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thomas Aubrey|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-AUBR-THO-1808.html|author=Albert Hughes Williams|year=1959|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual and ceremonial [[mask]]s are an essential feature of the traditional culture of the peoples of a part of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], e.g. roughly between the Sahara and the [[Kalahari Desert]]. While the specific implications associated  to ritual masks widely vary in different cultures, some traits are common to most [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]]. For instance, masks usually have a spiritual and religious meaning and they are used in ritual dances and social and religious events, and a special status is attributed to the artists that create masks to those that wear them in ceremonies. In most cases, mask-making is an art that is passed on from father to son, along with the knowledge of the symbolic meanings conveyed by such masks. African masks come in all different [[colours]], such as red, black, orange, and brown. 
[[File:African countries where masks are used.jpg|left|thumb|African countries where masks are used traditionally]]
'''Traditional African masks''' are one of the elements of great African art that have most evidently influenced [[Europe]] and [[Western art]] in general; in the 20th century, artistic movements such as [[cubism]], [[fauvism]] and [[expressionism]] have often taken inspiration from vast and diverse heritage of African masks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsnap.org/category/fauvism/ Fauvism] at Art Snap&lt;/ref&gt; Influences of this heritage can also be found in other traditions such as [[South America|South-]] and [[Central America]]n masked [[Carnival]] parades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crawfurd.dk/africa/carnival.htm A Short History of Carnival with a Touch of Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Fang Ngil Berlin IIIC6000.jpg|thumb|Ngil mask from [[Gabon]] or [[Cameroon]]; wood colored with kaolin (chiny clay); by [[Fang people]]; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany). Worn with full costume in a night masquerade to settle disputes and quell misbehavior, this calm visage was terrifying to wrong-doers]]

In most traditional African cultures, the person who wears a ritual mask conceptually loses his or her human life and turns into the spirit represented by the mask itself( it is sad).&lt;ref&gt;This idea has been literally portrayed in the well-known novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by [[Nigeria]]n writer [[Chinua Achebe]]. While the author hints at  the same novel, masked elders are particularly hostile towards the missionaries, a symbolical representation of the opposition of traditional Nigerian culture (as represented by the mask-spirits) and the new values brought along by European Christians.&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation of the mask wearer into a spirit usually relies on other practices, such as specific types of music and dance, or ritual costumes that contribute to conceal the mask-wearer's human identity. The mask wearer thus becomes a sort of [[Mediumship|medium]] that allows for a dialogue between the community and the spirits (usually [[veneration of the dead|those of the dead]] or nature-related spirits). Masked dances are a part of most traditional African ceremonies related to [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, [[initiation rite]]s, and so on. Some of the most complex rituals that have been studied by scholars are found in Nigerian cultures such as those of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Edo people|Edo]] peoples, that bear some resemblances to the Western notion of [[theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Analogies between Nigerian ceremonies and the [[theatre of Ancient Greece]] (as well as the Western theatre in general) have been developed by the [[Nobel Prize]] winning Nigerian writer [[Wole Soyinka]]. Soyinka wrote [[drama]]s based on the Yoruba traditions and, conversely, he has "africanized" classical works of the Western theatre such as [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]'' or [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 


Since every mask has a specific spiritual meaning, most traditions comprise several different traditional masks. The traditional religion of the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], for example, comprises three main cults (the ''Awa'' or cult of the dead, the ''Bini'' or cult of the communication with the spirits, and the ''Lebe'' or cult of nature); each of these has its pantheon of spirits, corresponding to 78 different types of masks overall. It is often the case that the artistic quality and complexity of a mask reflects the relative importance of the portrayed spirit in the systems of beliefs of a particular people; for example, simpler masks such as the ''kple kple'' of the [[Baoulé people|Baoulé]] people of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] (essentially a circle with minimal eyes, mouth and horns) are associated to minor spirits.&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;

==Subject and style==
African masks are usually shaped after a human face or some animal's [[Snout|muzzle]], albeit rendered in a sometimes highly abstract form. The inherent lack of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in African masks (and African art in general) is justified by the fact that most African cultures clearly distinguish the essence of a subject from its looks, the former, rather than the latter, being the actual subject of artistical representation. An extreme example is given by ''nwantantay'' masks of the [[Bwa people]] ([[Burkina Faso]]) that represent the flying spirits of the forest; since these spirits are deemed to be invisible, the corresponding masks are shaped after abstract, purely geometrical forms.

[[File:Makurian dancing mask.jpg|thumb|160px|Zoomorphic mask as depicted on a [[Makuria]]n mural from [[Old Dongola]] (12th/13th century)]]
Stylish elements in a mask's looks are codified by the tradition and may either identify a specific community or convey specific meanings. For example, both the Bwa and the [[Buna people]] of Burkina Faso have [[hawk]] masks, with the shape of the beak identifying a mask as either Bwa or Buna. In both cases, the hawk's wings are decorated with geometric patterns that have moral meanings; saw-shaped lines represent the hard path followed by ancestors, while chequered patterns represent the interaction of opposites (male-female, night-day, and so on)&lt;ref name="Essortment"&gt;See ''African Masks Symbolism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Traits representing moral values are found in many cultures. Masks from the [[Senufo people]] of [[Ivory Coast]], for example, have their eyes half closed, symbolizing a peaceful attitude, self-control, and patience. In [[Sierra Leone]] and elsewhere, small eyes and mouth represent [[humility]], and a wide, protruding forehead represents wisdom. In Gabon, large chins and mouths represent authority and strength.&lt;ref name=Essortment/&gt; The [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] of the Ivory Coast carve masks with round eyes to represent alertness and anger, with the straight nose to represent unwillingness to retreat.&lt;ref name="Essortment"/&gt;

===Animals===

Animals are common subjects in African masks. Animal masks might actually represent the spirit of animals, so that the mask-wearer becomes a medium to speak to animals themselves (e.g. to ask wild beasts to stay away from the village); in many cases, nevertheless, an animal is also (sometimes mainly) a symbol of specific virtues. Common animal subjects include the [[African buffalo|buffalo]] (usually representing strength, as in the Baoulé culture),&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks&gt;See ''African Masks''&lt;/ref&gt; [[crocodile]], hawk, [[hyena]], [[warthog]] and [[antelope]]. Antelopes have a fundamental role in many cultures of the Mali area (for example in Dogon and [[Bambara people|Bambara]] culture) as representatives of [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Many agricultural societies and associations in Mali have a stylized representation of an antelope in their symbols.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogon antelope masks are highly abstract, with a general rectangular shape and many horns (a representation of abundant harvest. Bambara antelope masks (called ''chiwara'') have long horns representing the thriving growth of [[millet]], [[legs]] (representing roots), long ears (representing the songs sung by the working women at harvest time), and a saw-shaped line that represents the path followed by the Sun between [[solstice]]s.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt; A 12th/13th century mural from [[Old Dongola]], the capital of the [[Nubians|Nubian]] kingdom of [[Makuria]], depicts dancing masks decorated with [[cowrie]] shells imitating some animal with long snouts and big ears.{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2008|p=120}}

A common variation on the animal-mask theme is the composition of several distinct animal traits in a single mask, sometimes along with human traits. Merging distinct animal traits together is sometimes a means to represent unusual, exceptional virtue or high status. For example, the Poro [[secret society|secret societies]] of the [[Senufo people]] of the Ivory Coast have masks that celebrate the exceptional power of the society by merging three different "danger" symbols: antelope horns, crocodile teeth, and warthog fangs.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;See ''Icons of Power''&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is that of ''kifwebe'' masks of the [[Songye people]] ([[Congo basin]]), that mix the stripes of a [[zebra]] (or [[okapi]]), the teeth of a [[crocodile]], the eyes of a [[chameleon]], the mouth of an [[aardvark]], the crest of a rooster, the feathers of an [[owl]] and more.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt;

===Feminine beauty===
[[File:Bete mask p1070041.jpg|thumb|Doei (or Kwere), female ancestor mask, [[Tanzania]]|left]]
Another common subject of African masks is a woman's face, usually based on a specific culture's [[ideal of feminine beauty]]. Female masks of the [[Punu people]] of Gabon, for example, have long curved eyelashes, almond-shaped eyes, thin chin, and traditional ornaments on their cheeks, as all these are considered good-looking traits.&lt;ref name=Virginia&gt;See ''Faces of the Spirit''&lt;/ref&gt; Feminine masks of the [[Baga people]] have [[Scarification|ornamental scars]] and breasts. In many cases, wearing masks that represent feminine beauty is strictly reserved to men.&lt;ref name=Essortment/&gt;

One of the well-known representations of female beauty is the ''[[Idia]]'' mask of [[Benin]]. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;See Bortolot&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestors masks (masks of the dead)===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1582 Mwaash aMbooy Mask.jpg|thumb|right|Mwaash aMbooy Mask [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
As the [[Veneration of the dead|veneration of defunct ancestors]] is a fundamental element of most African traditional cultures, it is not surprising that the dead is also a common subject for masks. Masks referring to dead ancestors are most often shaped after a [[human skull]]. A well-known example is the ''mwana pwo'' (literally, "young woman") of the [[Chokwe people]] ([[Angola]]), that mixes elements referring to feminine beauty (well-proportioned oval face, small nose and chin) and other referring to death (sunken eye sockets, cracked skin, and tears); it represents a female ancestor who died young, venerated in rites such as [[circumcision]] rites and ceremonies associated to the renewal of life.&lt;ref&gt;A male variant of this mask is called ''cihongo''.&lt;/ref&gt; As veneration of the dead is most often associated to fertility and reproduction, many dead-ancestor masks also have sexual symbols; the ''ndeemba'' mask of the [[Yaka people]] (Angola and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DR Congo]]), for example, is shaped after a skull complemented with a phallic-shaped nose.&lt;ref name=Virginia2&gt;See ''Images of Ancestors''&lt;/ref&gt;

A special class of ancestor masks are those related to notable, historical or legendary people. The ''mwaash ambooy'' mask of the [[Kuba people]] (DR Congo), for example, representing  the legendary founder of the [[Kuba Kingdom]], Woot, while the ''mgady amwaash'' mask represents his wife Mweel.&lt;ref name=Rulers&gt;See ''Portraits of Rulers''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials and structure==

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 74.64 Helmet Mask ndoli jowei for Sande Society.jpg|thumb|right|Helmet Mask for Sande Society [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The most commonly used material for masks is wood, although a wide variety of other elements can be used, including light stone such as [[steatite]], metals such as [[copper]] or [[bronze]], different types of [[fabric]], [[pottery]], and more. Some masks are painted (for example using [[ochre]] or other natural colorants). A wide array of ornamental items can be applied to the mask surface; example include animal [[hair]], horns, or teeth, [[sea shell]]s, [[seed]]s, straws, egg shell, and feathers. For example, animal hair or straws are often used for a mask's hair or beard.

The general structure of a mask varies depending on the way it is intended to be worn. The most common type applies to the wearer's face, like most Western (e.g., carnival) masks. Others are worn like hats on the top of the wearer's head; examples include those of the Ekhoi people of Nigeria and Bwa people of Burkina Faso, as well as the famous ''chiwara'' masks of the Bambara people.&lt;ref name=AfricanMasks/&gt; Some masks (for example those of the [[Sande society]] of [[Liberia]] and the [[Mende people]] of Sierra Leone, that are made from hollow tree stumps) are worn like helmets covering both the head and face. Some African cultures have mask-like ornaments that are worn on the chest rather than the head of face; this includes those used by the [[Makonde people]] of [[East Africa]] in ''ndimu'' ceremonies.&lt;ref name=Rebirth&gt;See ''Physical characteristics of African Tribal Masks''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercially-produced masks==
[[File:Commercial masks mwenge.jpg|thumb|Commercial masks for sale a in a shop in the [[Mwenge]] Makonde market, [[Dar es Salaam]]|left]]
As African masks are largely appreciated by Europeans, they are widely commercialized and sold in most tourist-oriented markets and shops in Africa (as well as "ethnic" shops in the [[Western World]]). As a consequence, the traditional art of mask-making has gradually ceased to be a privileged, status-related practice, and mass production of masks has become widespread. While, in most cases, commercial masks are (more or less faithful) reproductions of traditional masks, this connection is weakening over time, as the logics of mass-production make it harder to identify the actual geographical and cultural origins of the masks found in such venues as curio shops and tourist markets. For example, the [[Okahandja]] market in [[Namibia]] mostly sells masks that are produced in [[Zimbabwe]] (as they are cheaper and more easily available than local masks), and, in turn, Zimbabwean mask-makers reproduce masks from virtually everywhere in Africa rather than from their own local heritage.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Namibia'', [[Lonely Planet]] 2007, {{ISBN|978-88-6040-119-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
