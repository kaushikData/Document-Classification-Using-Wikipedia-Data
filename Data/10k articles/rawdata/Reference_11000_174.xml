'''Alcatraz Wharf''' is located on the southeast side of [[Alcatraz Island]], in [[San Francisco Bay]], [[California]], US. Classified as building number 33 of the Alcatraz Island National Historic Landmark, its historic name variants were "Alcatraz Dock" and "Alcatraz Pier". It is the main access point to Alcatraz. Another dock on the island's northwest side was only used for rock loading.&lt;ref name="nps.gov/goga"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:8g1Y2I7Xg_0J:www.nps.gov/goga/historyculture/upload/Physical%2520History%2520Part%25202.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShs1gH-ylMIdi-F5i_R9BtJaDSeH9LKjtOlcpczJoV7lTWs9Cv3aDVhC5adEKPKlfBey_eZmFyqPxDF1RplR9tnXdQZlzN6GhUpOgDjJgUyHKfgWWfJJY8h1SJZR5LMyDP3SOAy&amp;sig=AHIEtbRaYY9PKSDsUHf0s8qph6kKJ9shOg&amp;pli=1|title=Alcatraz Island - Golden Gate National Recreation Area|publisher=National Park Service|pages=1|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wharf contained many of the islands historic buildings, including [[Building 64]] (Alcatraz Defensive Barracks), the Bombproof Barracks, Chinatown, Ranger Office, Garage, Dock Tower, Storage Vault, and Firebox #3.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9u75zYJbcmwJ:www.nps.gov/goga/historyculture/upload/Ch-8-Alcatraz-CLR-Appendix.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESg6AJsF1P7GjCFjwI3FoRjuHZmLE7OYiCeD-IYvMfO5RICa2r3movb1LPYWgjqDPJ20y_MpmW4yJs_rfpQCVVQJv5RQnl3yQTL6081pr6MjFusqqJFVScnOR1PQhek-HVMPkN-x&amp;sig=AHIEtbTK8yJWcVa8V5WJPvyFyVcrXCiAHA|title=Appendix 1.

The wharf, or boat dock, was established on Alcatraz in the 1850s to permit the landing of men and building materials to construct [[Alcatraz Citadel|a fort]], completed in 1859. In 1867, the ''[[General McPherson (ship)|General McPherson]]'' was built to serve the island and other military institutions in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as Alcatraz became a long-term military prison from 1868. The steamer towed officers, prisoners and food and water supplies to island between 1867 and 1886, landing at the dock twice daily before being replaced.&lt;ref name="FanningWong2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fanning|first1=Branwell|last2=Wong|first2=William|title=Angel Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GJW2150AQzYC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=4 April 2007|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-4719-0|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Alcatraz wharf.jpg|thumb|left]]
During the time as a [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|federal penitentiary]], a prisoner once attempted to escape on a boat from the boat by dressing as an officer. The Sally Port led from the dock to the original citadel on Alcatraz along a walkway, 12&amp;nbsp;ft above a dry moat. Today the dock meets visitors to the museum on the island and is served by boat trips daily. [[Building 64]] lies in front of the dock, built in 1905.

In the mid-1880s, work on the wharf area was undertaken to repair it and to create coals sheds and a boathouse.&lt;ref name="nps.gov/goga" /&gt; The [[Alcatraz Citadel]]'s saltwater engine house was located on the wharf.&lt;ref name="alcatrazhistory.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatrazhistory.com/rock/rock-019.htm|title=Garrison Life on the Rock, 1859-1934 |work=alcatrazhistory.com|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil steamer "Rosecrans," owned by the [[Associated Oil Company]], was destroyed by fire above the water line and sank in deep water off the wharf in the early 1910s. Her crew of forty-two men escaped by jumping into the bay and swimming ashore.&lt;ref name="VanNess1912"&gt;{{cite book|title=Paint, oil and drug review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwRZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=10 September 2012|edition=Public domain|year=1912|publisher=D. Van Ness Pub. Co..|pages=174–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seismic rehabilitation of the wharf occurred in the early 2000s. The retrofit to the existing wharf and its facilities consisted of concrete demolition, excavation, and installation of tiebacks. Reinforced steel and concrete were added to a new deck. Work was also done on the deteriorated piles under the wharf deck.&lt;ref name="wattsconstructors.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wattsconstructors.com/viewproject.jsp?id=2&amp;index=0|title=Alcatraz Wharf Seismic Rehabilitation, Alcatraz Island, San Francisco, California|date=2007|publisher=Watts Constructors|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;David Finney is the youngest person to swim the South End Rowing Club Alcatraz Swim when he swam it in 2015 at ten years old.

{{History of Argentina}}
What today is commonly referred as the '''Independence of [[Argentina]]''' was declared on July 9, 1816 by the [[Congress of Tucumán|Congress]] of [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]]. In reality, the congressmen who were assembled in [[Tucumán, Argentina|Tucumán]] declared the independence of the [[United Provinces of South America]], which is still today one of the legal names of the Argentine Republic. The [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] Provinces,&lt;ref&gt;The Argentine ''Littoral'' provinces [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fé]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]] and [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], along with the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Province]] (present-day[[Uruguay]])&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Argentine Civil War|war]] with the United Provinces, were not allowed into the [[Congress of Tucumán|Congress]]. At the same time, several provinces from the [[Upper Peru]] that would later become part of present-day [[Bolivia]], were represented at the Congress.
[[Image:Independencia Argentina.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Allegory of the Declaration of Independence, by [[Luis de Servi]].]]

==Causes==
The 1810 [[May Revolution]] followed the [[Abdications of Bayonne|deposition]] of the [[Spanish Crown|Spanish king]] [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] by the [[Napoleonic France|Napoleonic French]]. The revolution ended the authority of the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Viceroy]] [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros|Cisneros]] and replaced it with the [[Primera Junta]].

When the Spanish monarchy resumed its functions in 1814, Spain was determined to recover control over its [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonies]] in the [[Americas]]. Moreover, the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] from [[Viceroyalty of Perú|Peru]] had been victorious at the battles of [[Battle of Sipe-Sipe|Sipe-Sipe]], [[Battle of Huaqui|Huaqui]], [[Battle of Vilcapugio|Vilcapugio]] and [[Battle of Ayohuma|Ayohuma]], in [[Upper Peru]], and seriously threatened the United Provinces from the north.

On April 15, 1815 a revolution ended the mandate of [[Carlos María de Alvear]] as [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]] and demanded that a [[Congress of Tucumán|General Congress]] be summoned. Delegate deputies, each representing 14,000 inhabitants, were sent from all the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] to the sessions, which started on March 24, 1816. However, the [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] Provinces did not send delegates: the Argentine ''littoral'' Provinces ([[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fé]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] and [[Misiones Province|Misiones]]), and the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Province]] (modern-day [[Uruguay]]).

==Development==
The Congress was inaugurated in the city of [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]], with 33 deputies.  The presidency of the Congress would be rotated monthly. Because the Congress had the freedom to choose topics to debate, endless discussions ensued.

The voting finally ended on July 9 with a declaration of independence. The Declaration pointed to the circumstances in Europe of the past six years—[[Peninsular War|the removal of the King of Spain by the Napoleon]] and the subsequent refusal of Ferdinand VII to accept [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|constitutional rule]] both in the Peninsula and overseas. The Document claimed that [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] recovered its sovereignty from the [[Crown of Castile]] in 1808, when Ferdinand VII had been deposed, and therefore, any union between the overseas dominions of Spain and the Peninsula had been dissolved. This was a legal concept that was also invoked by the [[Spanish American wars of independence|other Spanish American declarations of independence]], such as [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Venezuela's]] (1811) and [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|Mexico's]] (1810), which were responding to the same events. The president of the Congress at the time was [[Francisco Narciso de Laprida]], delegate from [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan Province]]. Subsequent discussions centered on what form of government the emerging state should adopt.

The congress continued its work in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1817, but it got stopped in 1820 after the [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|Battle of Cepeda]], which deepened the differences between the [[Unitarian Party]], who favored a strong central government, and the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federales]], who favored a weak central government.

The house where the declaration was adopted has been rebuilt and is now a museum and monument: the [[House of Tucumán]].

The '''BYU Family History Library''' (FHL) is located in the [[Harold B. Lee Library]] (HBLL) on the campus of [[Brigham Young University]] in [[Provo, Utah]].  It is the largest branch [[Family History Center]] of the [[Family History Library]] in Salt Lake City.

It was formerly known as the Utah Valley Regional Family History Center (UVRFHC).

Besides having a large permanent collection of microfilms, and access to the entire Family History Library collection, the library also houses the HBLL Library's academic microforms collection.

==History==
A branch of the genealogical library of the LDS Church was established in the BYU library in 1964. It contained the library of the Utah county [[Genealogical Society of Utah|Genealogical Historical Society]]&lt;!--I believe these two are equivalent, but there is another organization with a similar name--&gt; and a catalog of the materials in the main genealogical library in Salt Lake City. The genealogical library branch was located on the 4th floor, with specialized reference personnel. With the help of other library workers, Eve Nielsen recataloged the Genealogical Society of Utah's Utah county records over three years.&lt;ref name="Knight history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Hattie|title=Brigham Young University Library Centennial History 1875-1975|date=1976|publisher=Harold B.

The '''Boston City Archives''' are located in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts|West Roxbury]], MA, and are the repository for all official records that must be kept to honor both the history of the municipal government in [[Boston]] and the legal rights of its citizens.&lt;ref name=home&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/archivesandrecords/default.asp |title=Archives and Records - City of Boston |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Archives were established in 1988.&lt;ref name=act&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1988/1988Acts0068.pdf |title=archives.lib.state.ma.us - Acts 1968 - Chapter 68 |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was originally housed in an old school building in Hyde Park, until the importance of preserving the expanding number of records became a focus of attention.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/121667785.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=May%2025,%202002 |title=City's historic archives still seek a worthy home |format= |work=[[Boston Globe]] Archive |accessdate=2010-03-31|author=Sarah Schweitzer|date=2005-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mblc.state.ma.us/hypermail-archives/semls/0205/1901.php |title=Tobin files order for hearing on permanent home for city archives |format= |work=Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Globe-2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/02/27/this_city_has_real_baggage_and_soon_a_place_to_put_it/ |title=This city has real baggage, and soon a place to put it |format= |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |author=Johny Diaz |date=2005-02-27 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==
The City Archives holds records for over 60 current and historic government entities and departments. The bulk of these records consist of documentation of the history of Boston since incorporation as a city in 1822, although some records go back to the early 17th century. It is only recently that many city departments have begun to give their records to the archives, so the collection is constantly growing. This is aided by the movement of the collections to the new facility in West Roxbury. Prior to this move, the [[Heritage Health Index Report]] had found that the resources and facilities at the Hyde Park facilities had been lacking.&lt;ref name="heritage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/HHIsummary.pdf |title=The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America’s Collections |format= |work=www.heritagepreservation.org |accessdate=2010-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923094720/http://heritagepreservation.org/HHI/HHIsummary.pdf# |archive-date=2010-09-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notably, the collections include:
* Records relating to [[immigration]] and poverty at the time of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]]
* Documentation of Boston’s role in the [[American Civil War]]
* Boston Public Schools Desegregation-Era Records (assisted by a grant from the NHPRC and the city's largest department, [[Boston Public Schools]])&lt;ref name=NEA&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newenglandarchivists.org/pdfs/NEA_Newsletter_October2007.pdf |title=From Hemenway to Rivermoor: Relocating the Boston City Archives |author=John J.

'''Calendar''' is a personal [[calendaring software|calendar application]] made by [[Microsoft]]. It offers synchronization of calendars using [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], [[Outlook.com]] Apple's [[iCloud]] calendar service, and [[Google Calendar]]. It supports the popular iCalendar format.

==History==
Microsoft first included a Calendar app in [[Windows 1.0]], which was included until [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]], and was replaced by [[Schedule+]] in Windows for Workgroups and [[Windows NT 3.1]]. Schedule+ was later moved from Windows to the [[Microsoft Office]] suite,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9rGvyMX6n8cC&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=An appointment Calendar for Windows 95|last=Mefford|first=Michael|date=March 12, 1996|work=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|issue=5|volume=15|page=269|issn=0888-8507|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows did not include another Calendar application until Windows Calendar in [[Windows Vista]]. Calendar had been created by Beta 2 of Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l=180435&amp;a=178867&amp;po=12,00.asp|title=Windows Vista Beta 2|last=Clyman|first=John|date=June 8, 2006|work=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows Vista===
This version supports sharing, subscribing, and publishing of calendars on WebDAV-enabled web servers and network shares. It has always supported .ics files, and the subscription feature enables syncing with Google Calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/display-your-google-calendar-in-windows-calendar/|title=Display your Google Calendar in Windows Calendar|last=Heddings|first=Lowell|date=January 2, 2007|website=How-To Geek|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its interface matches Windows Vista Mail's, but the two apps are not connected in this operating system. The default calendar can be renamed.

===Windows 8===
A new version of Calendar with a text-heavy was added to [[Windows 8]] as one of many apps written to run full-screen or snapped as part of Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|Metro design language]] philosophy. It is one of three apps on Windows that originate from [[Microsoft Outlook]], the other two being [[Mail (Windows)|Mail]] and [[People (Windows)|People]] apps. Structurally, the three apps are one and are installed and uninstalled as such. But each has its own user interface. Calendar in Windows 8 originally supported [[Outlook.com]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]], [[Google Calendar]], and [[Facebook]] calendars. Because of API changes, Facebook and Google calendars can no longer be directly synced on Windows 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14091/windows-8-calendar-app-help|title=Calendar app help|last=|first=|date=April 28, 2016|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Microsoft apps introduced for Windows 8, many of the features are hidden in [[Windows shell#Charms|the charms]] or a menu at the bottom of the screen that is triggered by right clicking. Different calendars can be labeled with different colors. When a user with a Microsoft account adds a calendar account on one computer with Windows 8 Calendar, the account will be automatically added to all other Windows 8 computers the user is logged into. .ics files are not supported in this version.

===Windows 10===
Mail has preset server configurations for Outlook.com, Exchange, Google Calendar, and [[iCloud]] Calendar.&lt;ref name="SetUpEmailinMail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Set up email in Mail for Windows 10|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-in-Mail-for-Windows-10-7ff79e8b-439b-4b47-8ff9-3f9a33166c60|website=[[Office.com]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casey|first1=Henry T.|title=How to Set Up iCloud Email and Calendars on Windows 10|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/icloud-email-calendars-windows|website=LAPTOP|date=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACloserLook"&gt;{{cite web|title=A closer look at the new Mail app on Windows 10|url=http://mspoweruser.com/a-closer-look-at-the-new-mail-app-on-windows-10/|website=MSPoweruser|date=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can set it to use the system theme or choose a custom accent color, background image, and light/dark preference. Windows 10 Calendar has multi-window support for viewing and editing events. Different calendars can be labeled with different colors, and events can be rearranged by dragging and dropping. The default interface is Month View, but users can also use Day, Week, and Year views and print these views. The Windows 10 app also uses a flyout settings panel and a mini Ribbon interface in the viewing pane. The day of the year and calendar events show on the live tile. Like the Vista version, the important controls are readily visible and use icons to match the system's. Accounts can be grouped and relabeled, but folders cannot be edited from within the app. .ics support was added to this version in time for the [[Windows 10 Anniversary Update]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Mail-and-Calendar-for-Windows-10-9822b33c-b9ad-48bc-ac53-c1b6136e405b|title=What's new in Mail and Calendar for Windows 10|last=|first=|date=|website=Office.com|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DNS spoofing''', also referred to as '''DNS cache poisoning''', is a form of computer security hacking in which corrupt [[Domain Name System]] data is introduced into the [[DNS resolver]]'s [[DNS cache|cache]], causing the [[name server]] to return an incorrect result record, e.g. an [[IP address]]. This results in [[Man-in-the-middle attack|traffic being diverted]] to the attacker's computer (or any other computer).

==Overview of the domain name system==
{{Main article|Domain name system}}

A [[domain name server|domain name system server]] translates a human-readable [[domain name]] (such as &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;) into a numerical [[IP address]] that is used to [[Route (command)|route]] communications between [[Node (networking)|nodes]]. Normally if the server doesn't know a requested translation it will ask another server, and the process continues [[Recursion|recursively]]. To increase performance, a server will typically remember (cache) these translations for a certain amount of time. This means if it receives another request for the same translation, it can reply without needing to ask any other servers, until that cache expires.

When a DNS server has received a false translation and caches it for performance optimization, it is considered ''poisoned'', and it supplies the false data to clients. If a DNS server is poisoned, it may return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to another computer (often an attacker's).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/shmat_securecomm10.pdf |access-date=April 3, 2017 |title=The Hitchhiker’s Guide to DNS Cache Poisoning |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |first1=Sooel |last1=Son |first2=Vitaly |last2=Shmatikov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cache poisoning attacks==
Normally, a networked computer uses a DNS server provided by an Internet service provider (ISP) or the computer user's organization. DNS servers are used in an organization's network to improve resolution response performance by caching previously obtained query results. Poisoning attacks on a single DNS server can affect the users serviced directly by the compromised server or those serviced indirectly by its downstream server(s) if applicable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

To perform a cache poisoning attack, the attacker [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s  flaws in the DNS software.  A server should correctly validate DNS responses to ensure that they are from an authoritative source (for example by using [[DNSSEC]]); otherwise the server might end up caching the incorrect entries locally and serve them to other users that make the same request.

This attack can be used to redirect users from a website to another site of the attacker's choosing.  For example, an [[Spoofing attack|attacker]] [[IP address spoofing|spoofs]] the IP address DNS entries for a target website on a given DNS server and replaces them with the IP address of a server under their control. The attacker then creates files on the server under their control with names matching those on the target server. These files usually contain [[Malware|malicious]] content, such as [[computer worm]]s or [[computer virus|viruses]]. A user whose computer has referenced the poisoned DNS server gets tricked into accepting content coming from a non-authentic server and unknowingly downloads the malicious content. This technique can also be used for [[phishing]] attacks, where a fake version of a genuine website is created to gather personal details such as bank and credit/debit card details.

==Variants==
In the following variants, the entries for the server &lt;tt&gt;ns.target[[.example]]&lt;/tt&gt; would be poisoned and redirected to the attacker's name server at IP address &lt;tt&gt;w.x.y.z&lt;/tt&gt;. These attacks assume that the name server for &lt;tt&gt;target.example&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;ns.target.example&lt;/tt&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

To accomplish the attacks, the attacker must force the target DNS server to make a request for a domain controlled by one of the attacker's nameservers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Redirect the target domain's name server===
The first variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the name server of the attacker's domain to the name server of the target domain, then assigning that name server an IP address specified by the attacker.

DNS server's request: what are the address records for &lt;tt&gt;subdomain.attacker.example&lt;/tt&gt;?

 subdomain.attacker.example. IN A

Attacker's response:

 Answer:
 (no response)
 
 Authority section:
 attacker.example. 3600 IN NS ns.target.example.
 
 Additional section:
 ns.target.example. IN A w.x.y.z

A vulnerable server would cache the additional A-record (IP address) for &lt;tt&gt;ns.target.example&lt;/tt&gt;, allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire &lt;tt&gt;target.example&lt;/tt&gt; domain.

===Redirect the NS record to another target domain===
The second variant of DNS cache poisoning involves redirecting the nameserver of another domain unrelated to the original request to an IP address specified by the attacker.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

DNS server's request: what are the address records for &lt;tt&gt;subdomain.attacker.example&lt;/tt&gt;?

 subdomain.attacker.example. IN A

Attacker's response:

 Answer:
 (no response)
 
 Authority section:
 target.example. 3600 IN NS ns.attacker.example.
 
 Additional section:
 ns.attacker.example. IN A w.x.y.z

A vulnerable server would cache the unrelated authority information for &lt;tt&gt;target.example&lt;/tt&gt;'s NS-record (nameserver entry), allowing the attacker to resolve queries to the entire &lt;tt&gt;target.example&lt;/tt&gt; domain.

==Prevention and mitigation==
Many cache poisoning attacks against DNS servers can be prevented by being less trusting of the information passed to them by other DNS servers, and ignoring any DNS records passed back which are not directly relevant to the query. For example, versions of [[BIND]] 9.5.0-P1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIND Security Matrix|url=http://www.isc.org/software/bind/security/matrix|work=ISC Bind|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and above perform these checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISC Bind Security|url=http://www.isc.org/software/bind/security|work=ISC Bind|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source port randomization for DNS requests, combined with the use of cryptographically-secure random numbers for selecting both the source port and the 16-bit [[cryptographic nonce]], can greatly reduce the probability of successful DNS race attacks.

However, when routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices perform [[network address translation]] (NAT), or more specifically, port address translation (PAT), they may rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. When modifying source ports, PAT devices may remove source port randomness implemented by nameservers and stub resolvers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Secure DNS ([[DNSSEC]]) uses cryptographic digital signatures signed with a trusted [[public key certificate]] to determine the authenticity of data.  DNSSEC can counter cache poisoning attacks, but as of 2008 was not yet widely deployed. In 2010 DNSSEC was implemented in the Internet root zone servers.&lt;ref name="rootdnssec"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.root-dnssec.org/ | title=Root DNSSEC | publisher=ICANN/Verisign | accessdate=5 January 2012 | pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of attack can be mitigated at the [[transport layer]] or [[application layer]] by performing end-to-end validation once a connection is established. A common example of this is the use of [[Transport Layer Security]] and [[digital signature]]s.  For example, by using [[HTTPS]] (the secure version of [[HTTP]]), users may check whether the server's digital certificate is valid and belongs to a website's expected owner. Similarly, the [[secure shell]] remote login program checks digital certificates at endpoints (if known) before proceeding with the session. For applications that download updates automatically, the application can embed a copy of the signing certificate locally and validate the signature stored in the software update against the embedded certificate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The '''Dome of the Rock''' ({{lang-ar|قبة الصخرة|links=no}} ''Qubbat al-Sakhrah'', {{lang-he|כיפת הסלע|links=no}} ''Kippat ha-Sela'') is an Islamic shrine located on the [[Temple Mount]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].

It was initially completed in 691 CE at the order of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] during the [[Second Fitna]], built on the site of the Roman temple of ''Jupiter Capitolinus'', which had in turn been built on the site of the [[Second Temple|Second Jewish Temple]], destroyed during the Roman [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|Siege of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE.
The original dome collapsed in 1015 and was rebuilt in 1022–23. The Dome of the Rock is in its core one of the oldest extant works of [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref name="Slavik2001 p.60"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slavik|first= Diane|year= 2001|title=Cities through Time: Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Jerusalem|location=Geneva, Illinois|publisher= Runestone Press|page= 60| isbn= 978-0-8225-3218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces,&lt;ref name="avner43"&gt;{{ cite book | last=Avner | first=Rina | year=2010 | chapter=The Dome of the Rock in light of the development of concentric martyria in Jerusalem | title=Muqarnas | volume=Volume 27: An Annual on the Visual Cultures of the Islamic World | publisher=Brill | place=Leiden | isbn=978-900418511-1 | pages=31–50 [43–44] | jstor=25769691 | chapter-url=https://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/9484/original/DTP101967.pdf?1396907242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although its outside appearance has been significantly changed in the Ottoman period and again in the modern period, notably with the addition of the gold-plated roof, in 1959–61 and again in 1993. The [[octagon]]al plan of the structure may have been influenced by the Byzantine [[Church of the Seat of Mary (Kathisma)|Church of the Seat of Mary]] (also known as ''Kathisma'' in Greek and ''al-Qadismu'' in Arabic) built between 451 and 458 on the road between Jerusalem and [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref name="avner43" /&gt;

The site's great significance for Muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and to the belief that the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]] to heaven started from [[Foundation Stone|the rock]] at the center of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Anwarul Islam and Zaid F. Al-hamad | title = The Dome of the Rock: Origin of its octagonal plan | journal = Palestine Exploration Quarterly | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | pages = 109–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nasser Rabbat |title = The meaning of the Umayyad Dome of the Rock | journal = Muqarnas | volume = 6 | year = 1989 | pages = 12–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish tradition the rock bears great significance as the [[Foundation Stone]], the place from which the world expanded into its present form and where God gathered the dust used to create the first human, [[Adam]];&lt;ref name="Delaney"&gt;Carol Delaney, ''Abraham on Trial: The Social Legacy of Biblical Myth,'' Princeton University Press 2000 p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; as the site on [[Mount Moriah]] where Abraham attempted [[Binding of Isaac|to sacrifice his son]]; and as the place where [[God in Judaism|God's]] [[Shekhinah|divine presence]] is manifested more than in any other place, towards which Jews turn during prayer.

A UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], it has been called "Jerusalem's most recognizable landmark,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/01/29/arafats-gift |title=Arafat's Gift |first=Jeffrey |last=Goldberg |authorlink=Jeffrey Goldberg |date=29 January 2001 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=11 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with two nearby Old City structures, the [[Western Wall]], and the "Resurrection Rotunda" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/148|title=UNESCO World Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TempleMount HolylandModel.JPG|thumb|240px|Reconstruction of [[Herod's Temple]] as seen from the east ([[Holyland Model of Jerusalem]], 1966)]]

The Dome of the Rock is situated in the center of the Temple Mount, the site of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and the Jewish [[Second Temple]], which had been greatly expanded under [[Herod the Great]] in the 1st century BCE. Herod's Temple was destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] in 135 CE, a Roman temple to ''Jupiter Capitolinus'' was built at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Jerusalem was ruled by the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] throughout the 4th to 6th centuries. During this time, [[Christian pilgrimage]] to Jerusalem began to develop.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Linda Kay and David Martin Gitlitz [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVYkrNhPMQkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pilgrimage:+From+the+Ganges+to+Graceland+:+an+Encyclopedia,+Volume+1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mwjrUYO5IuHXygGO_oD4Bg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pilgrimage%3A%20From%20the%20Ganges%20to%20Graceland%20%3A%20an%20Encyclopedia%2C%20Volume%201&amp;f=false ''Pilgrimage: From the Ganges to Graceland : an Encyclopedia''] Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, Inc, Santa Barbara, CA 2002, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] was built under [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the 320s, but the Temple Mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the Jewish Temple under [[Julian the Apostate]].&lt;ref&gt;"Julian thought to rebuild at an extravagant expense the proud Temple once at Jerusalem, and committed this task to [[Alypius of Antioch]]. Alypius set vigorously to work, and was seconded by the governor of the province, when fearful balls of fire, breaking out near the foundations, continued their attacks, till the workmen, after repeated scorchings, could approach no more: and he gave up the attempt."

=== Original construction ===
The Dome of the Rock is now mostly assumed to have been built by the order of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] and his son and successor [[Al-Walid I]]. According to [[Sibt ibn al-Jawzi]], construction started in 687. Construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Lassner: ''Muslims on the sanctity of Jerusalem: preliminary thoughts on the search for a conceptual framework.'' In: ''Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam.'' Band 31 (2006), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

A dedicatory inscription in Kufic script is preserved inside the dome. The date is recorded as [[Hijri year|AH]] 72 (691/2 CE), the year historians believe the construction of the original Dome was completed.{{sfn|Necipoğlu|2008|p=22}} In this inscription, the name of al-Malik was deleted and replaced by the name of Abbasid caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]]. This alteration of the original inscription was first noted by [[Melchior de Vogüé]] in 1864.{{sfn|Vogüé|1864|p=[https://archive.org/stream/letempledejrusal00vogm#page/85/mode/1up 85]}} Some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building, built either by [[Muawiyah I]] (r. 661–680),&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Grabar: ''The Meaning of the Dome of the Rock.''&lt;/ref&gt; or indeed a Byzantine building dating to before the Muslim conquest, built under [[Heraclius]] (r. 610–641).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last=Busse | first=Heribert | year=1991 | title=Zur Geschichte und Deutung der frühislamischen Ḥarambauten in Jerusalem | language=German |journal= Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palästina-Vereins | volume=107 | pages=144–154 | jstor=27931418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby Byzantine churches and palaces.&lt;ref name="avner43" /&gt; The two engineers in charge of the project were [[Raja ibn Haywah]], a Muslim theologian from [[Beit She'an]] and Yazid Ibn Salam, a non-Arab who was Muslim and a native of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="avner43" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Ettinghausen|author2=Oleg Grabar|author3=Marilyn Jenkins|title=Islamic Art and Architecture 650–1250|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1uWZAzN_VcC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08869-4|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'During six weeks, I continued to investigate every part of the mosque and its precincts.'

[[Shelomo Dov Goitein]] of the [[Hebrew University]] has argued that the Dome of the Rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions: "The very form of a rotunda, given to the ''Qubbat as-Sakhra'', although it was foreign to Islam, was destined to rival the many Christian domes."&lt;ref name=SDG&gt;{{cite journal | last=Goitein | first=Shelomo Dov | author-link=Shelomo Dov Goitein | year=1950 | title=The historical background of the erection of the Dome of the Rock | journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=70 | issue=2 | pages=104–108 | jstor=595539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; K.A.C. Creswell in his book ''The Origin of the Plan of the Dome of the Rock'' notes that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. The diameter of the dome of the shrine is {{convert|20.20|m|ft|abbr=on}} and its height {{convert|20.48|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while the diameter of the dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is {{convert|20.90|m|ft|abbr=on}} and its height {{convert|21.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The structure was basically octagonal. It comprised a wooden dome, approximately {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, which was mounted on an elevated [[drum (architecture)|drum]] consisting of a circle of 16 piers and columns.&lt;ref name=BRIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9030854/Dome-of-the-Rock |work=Encyclopædia Britannica| title=Dome of the Rock |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding this circle was an octagonal arcade of 24 piers and columns.

=== Crusaders ===
{{Main|Templum Domini}}
[[File:Seal of Templars.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the ''Templum Domini'' on the reverse side of the seal of the Knights Templar]]
For centuries Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount, but escalating violence against pilgrims to Jerusalem ([[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], who ordered the destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]], was an example) instigated the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney. ''God's Battalions; a Case for the Crusades''. Harper Collins, NY, 2009, pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The Crusaders [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|captured Jerusalem]] in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, while the Al-Aqsa Mosque became a royal palace. The [[Knights Templar]], active from c. 1119, identified the Dome of the Rock as the site of the [[Temple of Solomon]] and set up their headquarters in the Al-Aqsa Mosque adjacent to the Dome for much of the 12th century. The ''[[Templum Domini]]'', as they called the Dome of the Rock, featured on the official [[Knights Templar Seal|seals]] of the Order's Grand Masters (such as [[Everard des Barres]] and [[Renaud de Vichiers]]), and soon became the architectural model for [[Round church|round Templar churches]] across Europe.

=== Ayyubids and Mamluks ===
Jerusalem was recaptured by [[Saladin]] on 2 October 1187, and the Dome of the Rock was reconsecrated as a Muslim shrine. The cross on top of the dome was replaced by a [[crescent]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
Saladin's nephew al-Malik al-Mu'azzam Isa carried out other restorations within the building, and added the porch to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Dome of the Rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] period, which lasted from 1250 until 1510.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Ottoman Empire (1517–1917) ===
During the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1520–1566) the exterior of the Dome of the Rock was covered with tiles. This work took seven years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with [[mosaic]], [[faience]] and [[marble]], much of which was added several centuries after its completion. It also contains Qur'anic inscriptions.
[[Surah]] [[Ya Sin]] (the "Heart of the Quran") is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the 16th century by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. [[Al-Isra]], the Surah 17 which tells the story of the ''Isra'' or Night Journey, is inscribed above this.

Adjacent to the Dome of the Rock, the Ottomans built the free-standing [[Dome of the Prophet]] in 1620.
Large-scale renovation was undertaken during the reign of [[Mahmud II]] in 1817.

In a major restoration project undertaken in 1874–75 during the reign of the Ottoman [[Abdülaziz|Sultan Abdülaziz]], all the tiles on the west and southwest walls of the octagonal part of the building were removed and replaced by copies that had been made in Turkey.{{sfn|Clermont-Ganneau|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/archaeologicalre01cler#page/179/mode/1up 179]}}&lt;ref name=laurent1993&gt;{{ cite book | last1=St. Laurent | first1=Beatrice | last2=Riedlmayer | first2=András | year=1993 |chapter=Restorations of Jerusalem and the Dome of the Rock and their political significance, 1537–1928 | editor-last=Necipoğlu | editor-first=Gülru | title=Muqarnas | volume=Volume 10: Essays in Honor of Oleg Grabar | pages=76–84 | publisher=Brill | place=Leiden | jstor=1523174 | chapter-url=https://archnet.org/system/publications/contents/3032/original/dpt0832.pdf?1384770145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Jerusalem Dome Rock.JPG|thumb|1920s photograph]]
[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]], appointed Grand Mufti by the British during the 1917 mandate of Palestine, along with [[Yaqub al-Ghusayn]], implemented the restoration of the Dome of the Rock and the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in Jerusalem.

The Dome of the Rock was badly shaken during the 11 July [[1927 Jericho earthquake]], damaging many of the repairs that had taken place over previous years.

In 1955, an extensive program of renovation was begun by the government of [[Jordan]], with funds supplied by Arab governments and Turkey. The work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, which had become dislodged by heavy rain. In 1965, as part of this restoration, the dome was covered with a durable [[aluminium bronze]] alloy made in Italy that replaced the lead exterior. Before 1959, the dome was covered in blackened [[lead]]. In the course of substantial restoration carried out from 1959 to 1962, the lead was replaced by aluminum-bronze plates covered with [[gold leaf]].

A few hours after the [[Israeli flag]] was hoisted over the Dome of the Rock in 1967 during the [[Six-Day War]], Israelis lowered it on the orders of [[Moshe Dayan]] and invested the Muslim ''[[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|waqf]]'' (religious trust) with the authority to manage the Temple Mount / Haram al-Sharif, in order to "keep the peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0111/abstracts/letter.html |title=Letter from Jerusalem: A Fight Over Sacred Turf by Sandra Scham |publisher=Archaeology.org |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of USD 8.2&amp;nbsp;million by King [[Hussein of Jordan]] who sold one of his houses in London to fund the 80 kilograms of gold required.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Other Islamic scholars believe that the Prophet ascended to Heaven from the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-miraj/ |title=Me'raj – The Night Ascension |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duas.org/articles/merajarticle.htm |title=Meraj Article |publisher=Duas.org |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe the location of the Dome of the Rock to be the site mentioned in [[Sura 17]] of the [[Qur'an]], which tells the story of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]], the miraculous Night Journey of Prophet Muhammad from [[Masjid al-Haram|Mecca]] to "the farthest mosque", where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from [[God in Islam|Allah]]. The Night Journey is mentioned in the Qur'an in a very brief form and is further elaborated by the [[hadith]]s. [[Caliph]] [[Umar ibn Al-Khattab]] (579–644) was advised by [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]], a Jewish rabbi who converted to Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alsadiqin.org/en/index.php?title=Yakub_of_Syria_(Ka'b_al-Ahbar)_Last_Jewish_Attempt_at_Islamic_Leadership Yakub of Syria (Ka'b al-Ahbar) Last Jewish Attempt at Islamic Leadership] Committee for Historical Research in Islam and Judaism, © 2004–2012, accessed July 2013.{{dead link|date=September 2016}} "He continued to follow Rabbinic tradition such that later Islamic historians questioned whether he ever 'converted' to Islam."&lt;/ref&gt; that "the farthest mosque" is identical with the site of the former Jewish Temples in Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Foundation Stone]] viewed from the dome. Photograph was taken between 1900 and 1920, before the removal of the surrounding iron grill.]]
The [[Foundation Stone]] and its surroundings is the holiest site in Judaism. Though Muslims now pray towards the [[Kaaba]] at Mecca, they once{{year needed|date=September 2016}} faced the Temple Mount as the Jews do. Muhammad changed the direction of prayer for Muslims after a revelation from Allah. Jews traditionally regarded{{year needed|date=September 2016}} the location of the stone as the holiest spot on Earth, the site of the [[Holy of Holies]] during the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple Period]].

According to Jewish tradition, the stone is the site where Abraham prepared to [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice his son Isaac]].

On the walls of the Dome of the Rock is an inscription in a [[mosaic]] [[frieze]] that includes an explicit rejection of the [[God the Son|divinity of Christ]], from Quran (19:33–35):
&lt;blockquote&gt;33. "So peace is upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!" 34. Such is Jesus, son of Mary. It is a statement of truth, about which they doubt. 35. It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should take himself a child. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, "Be", and it is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Goitein, the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against Christianity, whilst stressing at the same time the Qur'anic doctrine that Jesus was a true prophet. The formula ''la sharika lahu'' ("God has no companion") is repeated five times; the verses from Sura [[Maryam (sura)|Maryam]] 19:35–37, which strongly reaffirm Jesus' prophethood to God, are quoted together with the prayer: ''Allahumma salli ala rasulika wa'abdika 'Isa bin Maryam'' – "O Lord, send your blessings to your Prophet and Servant Jesus son of Mary." He believes that this shows that rivalry with Christendom, together with the spirit of Muslim mission to the Christians, was at work at the time of construction.&lt;ref name=SDG /&gt;

[[The Temple Institute]] wishes to relocate the Dome to another site and replace it with a [[Third Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = raisa| title = 'Third Temple' crowdfunding plan aims to relocate Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock| work = The Stream - Al Jazeera English| format = Text| accessdate = 2017-11-25| date = 2014-07-30| url = http://ajmn.tv/w8lmp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Israelis are ambivalent about the Movement's wishes.{{weasel inline|date=November 2017}} Some religious Jews, following rabbinic teaching, believe that the Temple should only be rebuilt in the [[messianic era]], and that it would be presumptuous of people to force God's hand.

All Christians would be immediately transported to Israel, he opined.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Esensten [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/anglo-file/u-s-born-knesset-candidate-jeremy-gimpel-and-his-dome-of-the-rock-joke.premium-1.494616 U.S.-born Knesset candidate, Jeremy Gimpel, and his Dome of the Rock 'joke'], ''[[Haaretz]]'' 20 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architectural homages ==
The Dome of the Rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings. These include the octagonal [[Church of St. Giacomo]] in Italy, the Mausoleum of Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in [[Istanbul]], the octagonal [[Moorish Revival]] style [[Rumbach Street Synagogue]] in [[Budapest]], and the [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue in Berlin]], Germany. It was long believed by Christians that the Dome of the Rock echoed the architecture of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], as can be seen in [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The Marriage of the Virgin (Raphael)|The Marriage of the Virgin]]'' and in [[Perugino]]'s ''[[Marriage of the Virgin (Perugino)|Marriage of the Virgin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance|authorlink=Jacob Burckhardt|first=Jacob| last=Burckhardt|author2=Peter Murray|author3=James C.

''Gazophylacium Anglicanum'' is a [[dictionary]] of the [[English language]] first published anonymously in [[London]] in 1689. Current scholarship attributes this work to Richard Hogarth and identifies it as a translation of Stephen Skinner's ''Etymologicon Linguae Anglicanae'' of 1671. The ''Gazophylacium Anglicanum'' was reprinted in 1691 as ''A New English Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;Miyoshi, Kusujiro. ''The First Century of English Monolingual Lexicography''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2017. Page xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full title==

'''Eugene Arthur Okerlund''' (born December 19, 1942)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mylife.com/eugene-okerlund/geneokerlund&lt;/ref&gt; also known by his [[ring name]] '''"Mean" Gene Okerlund''', is a semi-retired American [[professional wrestling]] [[interviewer]], [[announcer]] and wrestler. He is best known for his work in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and [[World Championship Wrestling]]. He was inducted into the [[List of members of the WWE Hall of Fame|WWE Hall of Fame]] in 2006 by [[Hulk Hogan]]. He is currently signed to a lifetime contract with WWE and works for promotional programs, mostly [[WWE Network]] programming and occasionally TV. He is the co-host of ''[[WWE Vintage Collection|Vintage Collection]]''.

==Professional career==

===Early career===
After studying broadcast journalism, Okerlund landed a job as a disc jockey at [[KOIL]], a popular radio station in Omaha, Nebraska.   Okerlund would later move to Minneapolis working for a local television station working in the front office.&lt;ref&gt;https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/good-gene-the-career-of-mean-gene-okerlund/&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Wrestling Association (1970–1984)===
Okerlund left the radio industry for a position at the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in 1970, where he occasionally filled in for ailing ring announcer and interviewer Marty O'Neill, eventually becoming O'Neill's permanent replacement by the end of the decade.

===World Wrestling Federation (1984–1993)===
He would stay with the AWA until the end of 1983, when he was one of many AWA personnel to join the expanding [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). He would stay with the WWF for nine years as their top interviewer, and was host of such WWF shows as ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#All American Wrestling (1983–1994)|All-American Wrestling]]'' and ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]''.

In 1984, Okerlund and [[Hulk Hogan]] faced [[Mr. Fuji]] and [[George Steele]] in [[Minneapolis]]. He was supposed to stay on the apron and let Hogan fight, but when Hogan gave him a [[high five]], the referee mistook it for a tag. Okerlund had to go in, but before his opponent touched him, he quickly got out of the way and tagged Hogan back in. The result: Okerlund pinned Mr. Fuji for the victory.

On March 31, 1985 Okerlund became the first person to sing the National Anthem at WrestleMania doing so at
[[WrestleMania I]].

On November 12, 1985, Okerlund, along with Hulk Hogan, Bobby Heenan, [[Ricky Steamboat]], [[Davey Boy Smith]], [[Corporal Kirchner]], [[Dynamite Kid]] and [[Big John Studd]], appeared on ''[[The A-Team]]''.

Okerlund was also part of one of the most infamous [[bloopers]] in pro wrestling history at [[SummerSlam (1989)|WWF SummerSlam 1989]]. Okerlund was set to interview [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]] [[Rick Rude|"Ravishing" Rick Rude]] and Rude's manager [[Bobby Heenan]] prior to Rude's title defense against [[The Ultimate Warrior]] when the SummerSlam backdrop fell backwards. The shot of the SummerSlam backdrop falling can be seen in the video induction of Mean Gene at the [[WWE Hall of Fame#2006|WWE Hall of Fame in 2006]]. Okerlund then turned around and said, "Fuck it," along with some other words with no audio. The cameras then cut away to a live shot of the crowd, with [[Play by play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Tony Schiavone]] and [[color commentator]] [[Jesse Ventura]] attempting to restore order. After a short while, Okerlund's interview with Rude and Heenan went as planned. According to a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] interview with Okerlund, conducted by RF Video, the SummerSlam 1989 blooper was actually taped beforehand. Okerlund explained that the wrong tape was aired during the live broadcast. Meanwhile, a frantic Vince McMahon was on a headset instructing Jesse Ventura to cover for Okerlund. Ventura instead made fun of Okerlund's on-air gaffe and jokingly regarded Okerlund as a "troublemaker."

Okerlund also made another unscripted gaffe when on live TV near the end of the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] PPV he, while doing his interview, famously turned towards someone off-camera and said "Put that cigarette out!", then went right on with his announcement.

===World Championship Wrestling (1993–2001)===
Okerlund appeared at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam 1993]] and made his final WWF appearance on the September 18, 1993 edition of ''[[WWE Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]''. He then left the WWF entirely when his contract expired. He stated in an RF shoot interview, that although he probably could've re-negotiated a new contract, he was never actually offered one, thus opting to become an interviewer for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). He claimed at the time of his hiring with WCW that he had not been on speaking terms with McMahon for the past few years he was working in the WWF. He debuted on the November 6, 1993 edition of ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]''. Three years later, his contract expired with WCW and he was off television for two months in the fall of 1996.  His final appearance was at WCW Fall Brawl on Sunday 09/15/1996.  He returned on Monday 11/11/1996 on WCW Monday Nitro.  Okerlund had reached out to the WWF once again to be re-hired but they passed on him.  Mike Tenay took over Special Interviews and the Pay Per View Reports. After that, he was with WCW until it was sold on March 26, 2001 to the WWF.

During an interview with [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Stevie Ray]], and [[Sherri Martel|Sister Sherri]] at [[Spring Stampede (1997)]], Okerlund was involved in another infamous botch when Booker T accidentally shouted out during an interview: "Hulk Hogan, we comin' for you, nigga!" (with Booker T noticeably immediately regretting his use of the epithet and Sherri trying to hold back laughter after the error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://wcwrules4lyf.wordpress.com/2011/07/26/spring-stampede-1997/ | title=Spring Stampede 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Always considered a neutral commentator throughout his career, he was given a "dirty old man" gimmick by [[Vince Russo]] in WCW, where he would stare at the breasts of the women he interviewed and make inappropriate, lustful comments toward WCW interviewer/announcer Pamela Paulshock.

Okerlund wrestled twice in WCW. The first was in mid-2000 when he and [[Buff Bagwell]] faced Chris Kanyon and fellow announcer [[Mark Madden]], with Bagwell and Okerlund winning. However, Madden wanted Okerlund back in the ring the next week in a one on one match-up. The two did wrestle again and Okerlund won the match with the assistance of Pamela Paulshock.

===Return to WWF/E (2001–present)===
[[File:Mene Gene Okerlund hof.jpg|thumb|250px|Gene in the Hall of Fame]]
Okerlund then returned to the WWF (renamed WWE in 2002), as his first post-WCW assignment for the company was as a commentator for the [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|Gimmick]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] during [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] on April 1, 2001, along with [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]]. He would go on to host ''[[WWE Confidential]]'' in 2002, which lasted for two years. Today, Okerlund still makes occasional WWE appearances.

Gene also hosts ''[[WWE Madison Square Garden Classics]]'', a weekly series, airing on the [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], featuring classic WWE matches that took place at [[Madison Square Garden]] from the last four decades. He's also the host for the [[WWE Classics On Demand]] Hall of Fame section, which takes a look at a different WWE Hall of Famer each month.

Okerlund was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] on April 1, 2006&lt;ref name="WWE-Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/geneokerlund/|title=WWE – Gene Okerlund profile|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=109|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his acceptance speech, he quoted a [[Bobby Knight]] speech and requested to be buried face down upon his death so his critics can "Kiss my ass".

In June 2008, Okerlund began hosting ''[[WWE Vintage Collection]]'', a program which showcases archive footage from the extensive [[WWE video library]].

On April 4, 2009, the night before [[WrestleMania XXV|the 25th anniversary of WrestleMania]], Okerlund inducted longtime WWE ring announcer [[Howard Finkel]] into the WWE Hall of Fame.

Okerlund conducted the interviews on the three-hour "Old School" episode of ''Raw'' on November 15, 2010, where he interviewed [[John Cena]], [[Randy Orton]], members of [[Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]] and [[Mae Young]] in similar fashion as to how interviews were done in the 1980s. Okerlund also appeared in a few Old School merchandising segments, promoting WWE's new Old School merchandise line.

Okerlund made an appearance at [[Wrestlemania XXVII]] in a segment with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Pee-wee Herman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wweppvs/article_48996.shtml

On April 10, 2012, during the ''WWE Smackdown: Blast from the Past'', Okerlund teamed with World Heavyweight Champion [[Sheamus]], in a winning effort, against the team of [[Daniel Bryan]] and [[Alberto Del Rio]].

On the December 17, 2012 edition of ''WWE Raw'', Gene Okerlund appeared alongside Jim Ross and Ricky ''The Dragon'' Steamboat to announce the winner of the Slammy Award for ''Match of the Year''.

On March 4, 2013, Okerlund appeared at the second ''Old School [[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' for Mae Young's 90th birthday party which was interrupted later by [[CM Punk]].

On January 7, 2014, Okerlund made an appearance at the third ''Old School [[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', in which he made references to the premium rate "wrestling hotlines" of the 1980s and 1990s.

Okerlund inducted [[Mr. T]] into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2014.

From April to June 2014, Okerlund was a regular cast member on the [[WWE Network]] original reality show ''[[WWE Legends' House|Legends' House]]''.

In November 2016, Okerlund became the narrator for the [[WWE Network]] original animated series ''WWE Story Time''.

On January 22, 2018, Okerlund appeared on the 25th anniversary episode of ''Raw'' to interview [[A.J. Styles]].

==Other media==
Okerlund was one of the professional wrestling legends on the WWE Network's show "Legends House".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/legends-house | title=Legends’ House Finale: Pat Patterson's big moment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Okerlund appeared as a "Celebrity Prognosticator" on [[ESPN Radio]]'s [[The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz]] on November 27, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://podbay.fm/show/301023639/e/1385598935?autostart=1 | title=Lebatard_5-12-15- Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Okerlund appeared in a [[Mountain Dew|Mountain Dew Kickstart]] commercial featuring [[Kevin Hart]] who during the commercial semi-impersonated [[Randy Savage]].

==Personal life==
Forming a band in his high school days, "Gene Carroll &amp; The Shades" were based out of [[Sisseton, South Dakota]], recording a single in 1959 "Red Devil / Do You Remember" (M&amp;L 1001). A second single was released in 1962 "Is It Ever Gonna Happen / Holly" (Wausau C-1100) as "Gene Carroll". They played parties throughout the Midwest and the Dakotas, and in 2009 were inducted into the South Dakota Rock and Roll Music Association's Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southdakotarockandrollmusicassociation.com/inductee?id=176#Gene-Carroll-and-the-Shades|title=Inductee - The South Dakota Rock and Roll Music Association|website=www.southdakotarockandrollmusicassociation.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his AWA days, Okerlund was given the [[nickname]] "Mean Gene" by [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] – an [[irony]], considering that throughout the years many wrestlers and promotion staff considered Okerlund the friendliest person in the game. Okerlund is close friends with [[Bobby Heenan]], [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Iron Sheik]]. Okerlund served as best man at the Iron Sheik's wedding.

His name has been associated with fast food concept, Mean Gene's Burgers, the brainchild of food-distributor Orion Food Systems (headed by two of Okerlund's nephews), which appeared on college campuses including [[Duke University]] and [[West Virginia University]], as well as a chain of pizzerias located within bowling alleys, Mean Gene's Pizza. These are owned by Hot Stuff Foods, which was headed by two of his nephews. Early in 2006, Okerlund and Hot Stuff split. Okerlund and one of the nephews were planning to start their own food company on the brands, but Hot Stuff sued, claiming they had "Mean Gene" trademarked. Okerlund lost, with the judge saying that Okerlund can't use the name "Mean Gene" for his new food company. Okerlund succeeded in canceling the trademark registrations held by Orion, but remains enjoined from competing with Orion.

Okerlund has been married to his wife Jeanne since March 27, 1964 and has two grown children. Gene's son [[Todd Okerlund|Todd]] starred on the [[University of Minnesota]] [[ice hockey]] team from 1983 to 1987. Todd played on the [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] [[United States national men's ice hockey team|United States Olympics team]] that competed in [[Calgary]]. He played four games with the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[New York Islanders]]. A chronic knee injury ultimately forced his early retirement.

Okerlund has had two [[kidney transplant]]s, his first in 1995 and his second in 2004, one of which he received from his wife.

He spends most of his time in [[Sarasota, Florida]].

'''Glass disease''', also referred to as '''sick glass''' or  '''glass illness''', is a degradation process of glass that can result in '''weeping''', '''crizzling''', '''spalling''', cracking and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunicki-Goldfinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunicki-Goldfinger|first1=Jerzy J.|title=Unstable historic glass: symptoms, causes, mechanisms and conservation|journal=Reviews in Conservation|date=2008|volume=9|pages=47-60 |url=https://www.iiconservation.org/node/2258|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Glass disease is caused by an inherent instability in the chemical composition of the original [[glass]] formula.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; 
Properties of a particular glass will vary with the type and proportions of [[silica]], [[alkali]] and [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] in its composition.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;
Once damage has occurred it is irreversible, but decay processes can be slowed by climate control to regulate surrounding temperature, humidity, and air flow.

==Chemical composition and decay==
Glass disease is caused by an inherent fault in the chemical composition of the original [[glass]] formula.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; 
Glass contains three types of components: ''network formers''  establish basic structure, ''network stabilizers'' make glass strong and water resistant, and ''[[Ceramic flux|flux]]'' lowers the melting point at which the glass can be formed.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=   Cansler |first1=Clay  |title=From Ancient to Art Nouveau |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=2 |pages=24-25 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common formulations of glass may include [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a former, alkali oxides such as [[Sodium oxide|soda]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) or [[potash]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for flux, and alkaline earth oxides such as [[Lime (material)|lime]] (CaO) for stabilizing.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogg|first1=Simon|last2=McPhail|first2=David|last3=Oakley|first3=Victoria|last4=Rogers|first4=Philip|title=Cracking Crizzling - Eight Years of Collaborative Research|journal=Conservation Journal|date=1998|issue=29|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-29/cracking-crizzling-eight-years-of-collaborative-research/|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Structurally, glass is composed of a network of SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-tetrahedrons. In addition to the ''network former'' silicon which establishes its principal structure, glass contains ''network modifying agents'' such as the alkali ions Na+ and K+ and the alkali earth ions Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ and Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+.  Glass does not have a defined [[stoichiometry]], rather the network is flexible. It can incorporate other ions, depending upon factors such as the main composition and firing conditions of the glass.&lt;ref name="Gradmann"/&gt; This causes almost all glass to be chemically unstable to some extent.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt;

Electron charge differences of ions within the structure form the basis of its bonding. Both viscosity and transition temperature are related to the availability of oxygen bonds in the glass's composition.  Modifying agents tend to lower the melting point of the silica.   Higher contents of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase [[acidity]] of the glass. Higher contents of CaO, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increase [[basicity]].&lt;ref name="Gradmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gradmann|first1=Rena|title=Analysis of historical islamic glazes and the development of a substitution|date=2016 |publisher=Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg|location=w|url=https://d-nb.info/1112041508/34|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chemical stability of glass decreases when only Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are added as flux, because bonding becomes weaker. The chemical stability of glass can be increased by adding CaO, MgO, ZnO, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. To be stable, glass composition must balance temperature lowering agents with stabilizing agents.&lt;ref name="Gradmann"/&gt;

Exposure of a glass surface to moisture, either in solution or from humidity in the atmosphere, causes chemical reactions to occur on and below the surface of the glass. The exchange of alkali metal ions (from within the glass) and hydrogen ions (from outside) can cause chemical and structural changes to the glass. When alkali metal cations in the near-surface layer are replaced by smaller hydrogen ions, structural differences between the affected surface layer and the unaffected lower layers of glass cause increasing tensile stress, which in turn can cause cracking.&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakley|first1=Victoria|last2=Rogers|first2=Philip |last3=McPhail|first3=David|last4=Amaku|first4=Afi|title=Vessel Glass Deterioration in the Museum Environment: A Quantitative Study by Surface Analysis|journal=Conservation Journal|date=April 1992|issue=3 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-03/vessel-glass-deterioration-in-the-museum-environment-a-quantitative-study-by-surface-analysis/|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=20 years ago - Investigating crizzling|journal=Chemistry World (originally appeared in ''Chemistry in Britain'', 1992.)|date=3 October 2012|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/20-years-ago-investigating-crizzling/5499.article|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of degradation due to glass disease depends on the amount and proportion of alkaline compounds mixed with silica, and on surrounding conditions.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;
Inadequate [[calcium oxide]] causes the alkalis in the glass to remain water-soluble at a low level of humidity. Exposure to higher levels of [[relative humidity]] during storage or display causes alkali to hydrate and leach out of the glass. Repeated changes in humidity can be particularly damaging. It is important to realize that any glass object can deteriorate if it is exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt; Crystal, historic glass, or treasured family items should never be exposed to the high temperatures and water pressure of a dishwasher.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for Your Glass|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/caring-for-your-glass/|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|Energy dispersive x-ray analysis]] (EDXA),&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"/&gt; [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) and [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) can be used to study exchange reactions in different types of glass. By quantifying and studying chemical structure and reactions at the near-surface layer, the mechanisms of glass disease can be better understood.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; 
Measurement of the pH of glass surfaces is particularly important if glass objects have a matte surface, or have been exposed to [[kaolin]] or other substances. In the case of extremely small objects such as glass beads, pH measurement may be necessary to determine whether alkaline salts are present and changes in the glass are occurring.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovell"/&gt;

==Stages of deterioration==
The processes involved in glass disease can reduce the transparency of the glass or even threaten the integrity of the structure.  Glass disease causes a complex disintegration of the glass which can be identified through a variety of symptoms, including weeping, crizzling, spalling, cracking and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Steve|title=Museum tries to stem disease affecting glass: Chemists are being used to combat a disease that is shattering exhibits|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/museum-tries-to-stem-disease-affecting-glass-chemists-are-being-used-to-combat-a-disease-that-is-1556872.html|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=The Independent|date=11 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
The following description of glass beads from an object in the collection of the [[British Museum]], effectively illustrates the range of symptoms that can occur with glass disease:  
{{quote|"Two factors indicated that the deterioration was the result of the phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘glass disease’; first, damage was limited to beads of one particular  colour  (pale  yellow)  and  second,  visible  signs  of  all the  various  stages  of  glass  disease  were  present  on  these beads.  This  included  the  presence  of  small  white crystals  on  the  surface  of  most  pale  yellow  beads  and  a fine network of uniform cracks or ‘crizzling’ crossing the surface of 55 of the 69 beads. This crizzling appeared to be more prevalent around the bead holes. A total of 32 beads had areas of spalling, or advanced crizzling, where cracks had  extended  further  into  the  glass  structure... Many had areas that had already spalled and the fragments lost.  Vertical  cracks  extending  through  the  glass  were  present on 37 beads and four beads had become detached due  to  complete  fragmentation."&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;}}

===Stage One===
The initial stage of glass disease occurs when moisture causes alkali to be leached out of the glass. This becomes apparent when [[hygroscopic]] alkali deposits on the glass give it a cloudy or hazy appearance.&lt;ref name= "Oakley"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/article/crizzling |title=Crizzling |author= |date=April 26, 2012 |work= |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This may occur within as little as five to 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. 
The glass may feel slippery or slimy&lt;ref name="Laidman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laidman|first1=Jenni |title=Seeking cures for glass disease |work=The Blade|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/frontpage/2002/05/13/Seeking-cures-for-glass-disease.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|date=May 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
and tiny droplets, or ''weeping'', may be seen in high humidity (above 55%).&lt;ref name= "Koob"/&gt; 
The hydrated alkali can form fine crystals on the surface of the glass in low relative humidity (below 40%).&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;

At this stage, it may be possible to gently wash the glass and remove the surface alkali.&lt;ref name= "Koob"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koob |first=Stephen |title=Conservation and Care of Glass Objects |publisher=Archetype Publications |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=1-904982-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This will help to stabilize the glass by reducing the surface pH, and by removing dust, soiling, and hygroscopic components that attract further moisture.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;

===Stage Two===
If alkali builds up due to ion exchange, and remains on the surface of the glass, the decay process will accelerate. The presence of sodium or potassium ions in the alkali build up will increase the pH on the surface of the glass, causing it to become basic. This will dissolve silica from the glass as well as releasing more alkali ions.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Oakley" /&gt;

The haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks like tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt; A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks. The cracks are caused by the loss of alkali, which leaves microscopic gaps in the structure of the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

===Stage Three===
As higher amounts of alkali leach from the glass cracks are likely to become deeper. ''Crizzling'' is a distinctive network of fine cracks in the glass which is visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brill|first1=Robert H.|title=Crizzling – a problem in glass conservation|journal=Journal of  Glass Studies|date=1975|volume=20|pages=121–131.|url=https://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/34/348E74A3-0852-4509-8F50-B4BC45EBD363.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, the crazing can gain a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;  However, crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

===Stage Four===
Distinct cracks may appear on the surface of the glass, and surface material may flake or chip, a process referred to as ''spalling.''&lt;ref name="Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

===Stage Five===

In the most severe stage of deterioration, the structural integrity of the glass has been lost and the glass may  separate into pieces.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
A survey of glass objects at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, in 1992, found that more than 1 in 10 objects in the collection were affected by crizzling, ranging from 16th century Venetian to 20th century Scandinavian glass.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Fi|last2=Oakley|first2=Victoria|title=In pursuit of a clear answer: An Exhibition Road partnership|journal=Conservation Journal|date=2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/in-pursuit-of-a-clear-answer-an-exhibition-road-partnership/|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Venetian glass is particularly susceptible because artisans minimized the use of lime, to make the glass as clear as possible.  
The works of modern glassmakers who experiment with their glass formulas, such as [[Ettore Sottsass]], can also be at high risk for damage.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;

Museums such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] may find glass disease an issue of great importance because many of the Native American cultural materials in their collections incorporate [[glass beads]].&lt;ref name="O'Hern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Hern|first1=Robin |last2=McHugh |first2=Kelly |title=Red, Blue, and Wound all over: Evaluating Condition Change and Cleaning of  Glass  Disease on Beads|journal=Objects Specialty Group Postprints|date=2014|volume=Twenty-One|pages=205-228 |url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/osg-postprints/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/03/osg021-09.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohern |first1=Robin |last2=McHugh |first2=Kelly |title=Deterioration and Conservation of Unstable Glass Beads  on Native American Objects|journal=The Bead Forum|date=2013|volume=63 |url=https://beadresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/Repeating_Material/The_Bead_Forum_Archive/The-Bead-Forum-Issue-63-Autumn-2013.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Small ornamental glass beads were often made cheaply, using recipes with a high flux to silica ratio. This makes them more susceptible to glass disease.  Blues, reds, and black are often affected by glass disease. The combination of glass beads with other materials (cordage, fabric, leather, metal, bone, surface colorants, ceremonial substances, and kaolin) complicates deterioration and conservation of ethnographic objects.&lt;ref name="Lovell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovell|first1=Adam|title=GLASS BEAD DETERIORATION OF ETHNOGRAPHIC  OBJECTS: IDENTIFICATION, PREVENTION, AND  TREATMENT|date=July 18, 2006|publisher=John F. Kennedy University|location=Pleasant Hill, CA|url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Glass_Bead_Deterioration.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
In the earliest stage of glass disease, it may be possible to wash the glass to remove the surface alkali. The Corning Museum of Glass recommends washing with tap water (tepid, not hot&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;) and a mild (non-ionic&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;) conservation detergent. This should be  followed by rinsing with de-ionized or distilled water, and careful drying to remove moisture. Careful washing can remove surface deposits, restore the appearance of clearness to the glass, and help to slow further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Washing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Washing Glass|url=https://blog.cmog.org/2011/12/09/washing-glass/|website=Corning Museum of Glass|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Roy|last1=Newton|first2=Sandra|last2=Davison |title=Conservation of glass|date=1996|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0750624485|pages=207-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ethanol]] has also been suggested for cleaning, particularly for glass beads, depending on the surrounding materials that may be affected.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;

Once more serious damage has occurred, it cannot be reversed.  Climate control of humidity and temperature is a possible intervention.  Because crizzling results from the reaction of components of the glass with water vapour, controlling humidity and temperature can slow its occurrence.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; At the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], items in the collection are kept at stable levels of relative humidity, between 40 and 55 percent.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt; 
Fans may be used within a case to encourage the movement of air and minimize adsorption of moisture on the glass surface. Deterioration is more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow which allow moisture to remain on the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt; Chemical methods for retarding corrosion rates and stabilizing surfaces are being investigated.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt; 

When a composite object contains a variety of materials, one of which is sick glass, the considerations involved in conserving and displaying the object become more complicated. For example, the [[British Museum]] chose to conserve and display a Siberian shamanic apron made of leather, glass and other materials. They weighed the likelihood that it would decay more quickly if shown against the desirability of making a unique object visible and the inevitability of its eventual degradation. "Its conservation and display ensures that access to this beautiful and unique object is maximized before the pale yellow beads, which are intrinsic to the object, are inevitably lost beyond repair."&lt;ref name="Swift"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Rachel|last2=Meek|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Rode|first3=Nicole|last4=Komlosy|first4=Anouska|title=A radioactive shamanic apron with glass disease|journal=The British Museum Technical Research Bulletin|date=2012|volume=6|pages=25-32|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/BMTRB_6_Swift-et-al.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guardian''' is a hereditary office of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] that is first mentioned in the ''[[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]''.  [[Shoghi Effendi]] was named as the first Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, and future Guardians were to be appointed from among the [[Aghsán|male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh]].  However, since Shoghi Effendi died without having named a successor Guardian, no person could be named to fulfill the position after his death on November 4, 1957, and he remains the only individual acknowledged as Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, but his guidance remains in the written record of his many writings.&lt;ref name="Smith Shoghi Effendi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)  |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Shoghi Effendi |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 314–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Guradianship"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)  |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Guardianship |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Being `Abdu'l-Bahá's eldest grandson, the first son of `Abdu'l-Bahá's eldest daughter Ḍiyá'iyyih Khánum, Shoghi Effendi had a special relationship with his grandfather.

`Abdu'l-Bahá's family physician, a German doctor who later became a Bahá'í, would relate that in 1910, when Shoghi Effendi was thirteen years old, `Abdu'l-Bahá named him his successor, referring to him as his "future Elisha."&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R. |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum | url= http://bahai-library.com/khanum_priceless_pearl | chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/khanum_priceless_pearl&amp;chapter=1 | year = 1969 |title = The Priceless Pearl |page = 13 | chapter= The Childhood and Youth of Shoghi Effendi | edition = Hardcover |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust: 2000 |location = London, UK |isbn = 978-1-870989-91-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Gail| first = Marzieh | title = ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Portrayals from East and West | journal = World Order | volume = 06 | issue = 01  | pages = 29–41 | date =  | year = 1971 | url = http://bahai-library.com/essays/portrayals.html | doi =  | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shoghi Effendi remained close to his grandfather during his years as a student, first at the [[De La Salle Brothers|LaSallian]] [http://cdf.edu.ps/en/?page_id=182 Collège des Frères] in Haifa and later as a boarder in Beirut, first at a Catholic school and later at the [[Syrian Protestant College]].

`Abdu'l-Bahá's will provided a framework for the Guardian within the [[Bahá'í administration]] including:

*`A requirement that the Guardian appoint his successor "in his own life-time ... that differences may not arise after his [the Guardian's] passing."&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appointee was required to be either the first-born son of the Guardian, or one of the [[Aghsán]] (literally: Branches; male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh).&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; Finally, `Abdu'l-Bahá left a responsibility to [[Custodians|nine Hands of the Cause]], elected from all of the Hands, who "whether unanimously or by a majority vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the Guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor."&lt;ref name="ency_hands"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*`Abdu'l-Bahá's will also stated that the [[Hands of the Cause]] were to be nominated and appointed by the Guardian and are to be under his direction and obey his command.&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt;
*The Guardian is to be the head of the [[Universal House of Justice]] and either attend its deliberations in person or appoint a representative to do so.&lt;ref name="Will 14-15"&gt;{{cite book |author=‘Abdu’l-Bahá |authorlink=‘Abdu’l-Bahá |origyear=1901-08 |year=1990 |title=The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA| chapter= Part One| pages=14–15 | chapter-url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-1.html#pg14 | isbn= 978-0877433736 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointing Shoghi Effendi as Guardian===
Although in the [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|''Kitáb-i-‘Ahd'']] Bahá'u'lláh designates [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]] as `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |origyear=1873-92 |year=1994 |title=Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-174-4 |chapter= Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant) |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html#pg222 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/ | page=223 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; in his ''Will,'' `Abdu'l-Bahá reprimands his brother as "The Center of Sedition, the Prime Mover of mischief"&lt;ref name="Will 9"&gt;{{cite book |author=‘Abdu’l-Bahá |authorlink=‘Abdu’l-Bahá |origyear=1901-08 |year=1990 |title=The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA| chapter= Part One| chapter-url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-1.html#pg9| page=9| isbn= 978-0877433736 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishes the institution of the Guardianship, appointing Shoghi Effendi to this newly created office:&lt;ref name="Smith Shoghi Effendi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Guradianship"/&gt;

==Shoghi Effendi writings on the Institution of the Guardianship ==
As Guardian, Shoghi Effendi held a new and distinct role.  Building on the foundation that had been established in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's will, Shoghi Effendi elaborated on the role of the Guardian in the developing [[Bahá'í administration|Bahá'í Administrative Order]] in several works, including ''[[Bahá'í Administration (book)|Bahá'í Administration]]'' and the ''[[World Order of Bahá'u'lláh]],'' in the chapter entitled ''The Administrative Order.''&lt;ref name="Smith Shoghi Effendi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Guradianship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoghi Effendi, Writings of "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)  |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Shoghi Effendi, Writings of |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 317–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those works, Shoghi Effendi goes to great lengths to emphasize that the Guardianship is a distinct station from that of [[Manifestation of God|Manifestation]] or Center of the [[Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh|Covenant]]:&lt;ref name="Smith Shoghi Effendi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Guradianship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoghi Effendi, Writings of "/&gt; Shoghi Effendi also was critical of Bahá'ís referring to him as a holy personage, asking them not to celebrate his birthday or have his picture on display.&lt;ref name="Shoghi Effendi, Writings of "/&gt;  Furthermore, he did not refer to his own personal role as an individual, but instead to the institution of the Guardianship.&lt;ref name="Smith Shoghi Effendi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Guradianship"/&gt;  In his correspondences, Shoghi Effendi signed his letters to Bahá'ís as "brother" and "co-worker," to the extent that even when addressing youth, he referred to himself as "Your True Brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Effendi |first= Shoghi |date= April 1, 1991 |title= Your True Brother: Messages to Junior Youth Written |url= http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_your_true_brother   |location=  |publisher= George Ronald  |page= |isbn= 978-0853983248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |year = 1974 |title = Bahá'í Administration | page=  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 978-0-87743-166-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/BA/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Shoghi Effendi goes to great lengths to emphasize the significance of the "Institution of Guardianship," which he calls the "head cornerstone of the [[Bahá'í administration|Administrative Order]] of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh,"&lt;ref name="MA 21"&gt;{{cite book |last=Effendi |first=Shoghi |date=1947 |title=Messages to America: Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the Baha'i of North America 1932-1946 |url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ |location= |publisher=Baha'i Publishing Committee |page=8 |chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-21.html | chapter= Institution of Guardianship Now Further Reinforced |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his writings, Shoghi Effendi delineates a distinct separation of powers between the "twin pillars that support this mighty Administrative Structure—the institutions of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice."&lt;ref name="Shoghi WOB 148"&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |year=1938 |title=The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-231-7 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/index.html| chapter=The Administrative Order| page=148| chapter-url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-40.html#pg148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Munirih Khánum#Family|all living male descendants of Bahá'u'lláh having been declared Covenant-breakers]] by either `Abdu'l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi, no suitable qualifying candidates remained for appointment to the office of Guardian.&lt;ref name="Smith Shoghi Effendi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Guradianship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Custodians"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)  |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Custodians |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |page= 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 1957, nine of the [[Hands of the Cause]] issued an "Official Statement" after searching through Shogi Effendi's personal affects in Haifa, Israel, affirming that "the safe and desk have been opened and searched and the non existence of a Will and Testament executed by Shoghi Effendi was definitely established."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R. |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum | url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians | year = 1992 |title = Ministry of the Custodians: An Account of the Stewardship of the Hands of the Cause 1957-1963| chapter-url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=1#27 | chapter= Official Statement| page=27  |edition = Hardcover |publisher = Baha'i World Centre |location = Haifa |isbn = 978-0853983507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent "Unanimous Proclamation of the 27 [[Hands of the Cause of God]]" on November 25 confirmed that Shoghi Effendi had died "without having appointed his successor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R. |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum | url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians | year = 1992 |title = Ministry of the Custodians: An Account of the Stewardship of the Hands of the Cause 1957-1963| chapter-url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=1#28 | page=28 | chapter= Unanimous Proclamation of the 27 Hands of the Cause of God | edition = Hardcover |publisher = Baha'i World Centre |location = Haifa |isbn = 978-0853983507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hands of the Cause unanimously voted it was impossible to legitimately recognize and assent to a successor.&lt;ref name = "Momen 2003 G.2.e"&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|2003|loc=§G.2.e}} [http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant#5.%20Dealing%20with%20Covenant-breaking.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í community was in a situation not dealt with explicitly in the provisions of the Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name="ency_guardianship"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Universal House of Justice]] had not yet been elected, which represented the only Bahá'í institution authorized to adjudicate on matters not covered by the religion's three central figures.&lt;ref name="ency_hands"/&gt;

The Hands of the Cause of God elected from among their own nine individuals who would serve as [[Custodians]] to help lead the transition of the [[International Bahá'í Council]], whose members had previously been appointed by Shoghi Effendi, into the Universal House of Justice, whose members are elected by all the members of each Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R. |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum | url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians | year = 1992 |title = Ministry of the Custodians: An Account of the Stewardship of the Hands of the Cause 1957-1963| chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians&amp;chapter=1#34 | chapter= Resolution of the Hands of Cause of God | page=34 | edition = Hardcover |publisher = Baha'i World Centre |location = Haifa |isbn = 978-0853983507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 1960, [[Mason Remey]] one of the Hands of the Cause and president of the [[International Bahá'í Council]], issued a written announcement claiming that he was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.  He based his claim on the idea that by appointing him as President of the International Bahá'í Council, the embryonic form of the Universal House of Justice which would be led by the Guardian, Shoghi Effendi had in fact implicitly named him as the second Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Smith (historian)  |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |page= 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason Remey's claim was largely rejected with several notable exceptions, including five members of the National Spiritual Assembly of France led by Joel Marangella.  The remaining 26 Hands of the Cause unanimously declared Remey and whoever followed him Covenant-breakers.

The Universal House of Justice later announced that it could not legislate to make possible the appointment of a successor Guardian to Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last= Marks |editor1-first= Geoffry W. |last=Universal House of Justice |first= |date= 1996  |title= Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963-86 |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full&amp;chapter=2#14 |location= |publisher= Baha'i Publishing Trust |page= 14 |isbn= 978-0877432395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Universal House of Justice also determined that it could not appoint any further [[Hands of the Cause]], whose work is now carried out by other [[Bahá'í administration#Appointed institutions|appointed institutions]] such as the [[Continental Counsellors]] and the [[Bahá'í administration#Auxiliary Boards|Auxiliary Boards]].

'''''Gundwana v Steko Development and Others'''''&lt;ref&gt;2011 (3) SA 608 (CC).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]], heard before the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]]&lt;ref&gt;Moseneke DCJ, Cameron J, Froneman J, Jafta J, Khampepe J, Mogoeng J, Nkabinde J, Van Der Westhuizen J, Yacoob J and Mthiyane AJ.&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 February 2011.

== Facts ==
Elsie Gundwana bought a home through a loan provided by the bank, securing her debt by a mortgage bond on the property. When subsequently she fell into arrears, the bank obtained, by default judgement, an order declaring her property to be executable. The property was accordingly sold four years later. An order for eviction was sought against Ms Gundwana, and the matter ended up at the Constitutional Court.

== Issue ==
Gundwana sought orders that the registrar, acting under the Uniform Rules of Court,&lt;ref&gt;s 31(5).&lt;/ref&gt; could not grant an order declaring a mortgaged home to be executable.

== Judgment ==
The court held that the registrar's order, under section 31(5) of the Uniform Rules of Court, declaring residential property to be executable, was unconstitutional, because judicial oversight is required where execution is sought against indigent debtors.

== Consequences ==
The Uniform Rules of Court now contains an amendment&lt;ref&gt;46(1).&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the consequences of this judgment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1)(a) No writ of execution against the immovable property of any judgment debtor shall issue until—
:(i) a return shall have been made of any process which may have been issued against the movable property of the judgment debtor from which it appears that the said person has not sufficient movable property to satisfy the writ; or
:(ii) such immovable property shall have been declared to be specially executable by the court or, in the case of a judgment granted in terms of rule 31(5), by the registrar: Provided that, where the property sought to be attached is the primary residence of the judgment debtor, no writ shall issue unless the court, having considered all the relevant circumstances, orders execution against such property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Hamichlol''' ({{lang-he-n|המכלול}} "The Entirety") is a [[censored]] [[wiki]]-based [[Internet encyclopedia project]] for the [[:he:שומר תורה ומצוות|Torah-observant public]] (ציבור שומר תורה ומצוות). The site is managed and operated by the Institute for Literacy and Proper Knowledge, which was established for the purpose of creating the site. The articles mainly censor any mentioning of [[homosexuality]], information that contradicts a [[Creationism|creationist]] worldview, and other behaviors deemed [[Tzniut|immodest]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C:%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9F/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9F]&lt;/ref&gt; The site is referred to by the site owners as an ''aspeklaria'' ({{lang-he-n|אספקלריה}}), which means in [[Latin]] "mirror", as it is a re-edited edition of the Hebrew Wikipedia. 

The site was launched on January 11, 2015. As of August 9, 2018 the site contained 111,466 articles for a total approximating half the number of articles found on the [[Hebrew Wikipedia]].

As of August 9, 2018, the site's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]'s ranking was 1,359 in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hamichlol.org.il |title=Hamichlol.org.il Traffic, Demographics and Competitors |publisher=Alexa |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2014 the Israeli [[Hasidic]] rabbi Yosef Kaminer founded the Institute for Literacy and Proper Knowledge ({{lang-he-n|המכון לאוריינות וידע כהלכה}}) through which the site would be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date = December 10, 2017|url = http://m.ch10.co.il/news/409776/#.WpssmXOIZ-F|title = Rabbi Yosef Kaminer presents 'the Haredi Wikipedia'|author = Nochi Gold|access-date = March 3, 2018|publisher = m.ch10.co.il }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the site owners the site is intended to be used by the [[:he:ציבור שומר תורה|Torah-observant public]] (ציבור שומר תורה ומצוות), and especially by the ''[[Haredi]]'' (Ultra-Orthodox Jewry) whom are very conservative and refrain from using Wikipedia's content according to their stringent interpretations of ''[[halakha]]''. Hamichlol aspires to be "the largest Jewish encyclopedia in history, which includes articles on all issues pertaining to the Torah, Jewish values and the history of the Jewish people, but also knowledge pertaining to mankind and from all the secular" ({{lang-he-n|חולין}} [transliteration: ''hulin'']) "fields&amp;ndash;written in clean language according to the Jewish worldview."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Kosher considerations==
In order to create the site's foundation, the creators of the site chose, as part of the initial development of the site, to import the entire [[Hebrew Wikipedia]] and re-edit or delete the content which is not proper for the Torah-observant public, and specifically the [[ultra-Orthodox]] readers. The content is imported from the Hebrew Wikipedia in accordance with Wikipedia's free license, which enables editors to perform such a "[[Fork (software development)|split]]". Since much of the existing content is copied from Wikipedia and re-edited it is easy to find information which was omitted by comparing specific articles on the site with the parallel articles at the Hebrew Wikipedia. Examples of such differences include:

* In the '''[[Biology]]''' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92%D7%99%D7%94 |title=ביולוגיה – המכלול |language= |publisher=Hamichlol.org.il |date=2001-01-30 |accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was initially copied entirely from the Hebrew Wikipedia and then re-edited, the "Evolution" ({{lang-he-n|אבולוציה}}) section was re-named to "The Order of the Creation of Creatures" ({{lang-he-n|סדר הבריאה של היצורים}}) and the content of this section was changed so that instead of saying that all organisms on the Earth have descended from a common ancestor, it was changed to say that all forms of life were created in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Six Days of Genesis]].
* In the '''[[Beit Zeit]]''' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-9zVYJ4CwrsJ:www.hamichlol.org.il/%25D7%2591%25D7%2599%25D7%25AA_%25D7%2596%25D7%2599%25D7%25AA+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=no&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=no |title=בית זית – המכלול |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was initially copied entirely from the Hebrew Wikipedia and then re-edited, the mentioning of the "[[Beit Zeit#Dinosaur Footprints|Dinosaur Footprints]]" site in Israel was omitted as it is a site which contains a layer of ancient rock that contains some 200 traces of dinosaur tracks from tens of millions of years ago. Other articles and references on the site which present dates or periods that contradict the age of the world according to the Torah are removed from all the articles imported from the Hebrew Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamichlol.org.il/המכלול:סינון/מדיניות_הסינון]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the article about '''[[The Holocaust]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%90%D7%94 |title=השואה – המכלול |language= |publisher=Hamichlol.org.il |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was copied entirely from the Hebrew Wikipedia and then re-edited, the mentioning in the intro that [[homosexuals]] were also murdered by Nazi Germany in World War II was completely removed. Other articles and references on the site to homosexuality or homosexuals are removed from all articles imported from the Hebrew Wikipedia.
* Because many [[Haredi]] avoid '''pictures of [[women]]''', any pictures on the site that include women, such as historical pictures or group photos inclusive of men and women (for example, a photo of the [[Thirty-fourth government of Israel#Cabinet members|thirty-fourth government of Israel's cabinet]]) are [[photoshopped]] to remove women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-ultra-orthodox-wikipedia-is-literally-rewriting-history-1.5866754|title=Without Women or Evolution: 'Ultra-Orthodox Wikipedia' Is Literally Rewriting History|first=Omer|last=Benjakob|date=1 March 2018|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9C:%D7%90%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA |title=המכלול:אודות – המכלול |language={{he icon}} |publisher=Hamichlol.org.il |date= |accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances, with articles about prominent historical female figures the portraits of the women are replaced with pictures of their graves. 

As of August 25, 2018, out of the 121,929 articles imported from Wikipedia, 22,791 of the imported articles currently are not accessible to the readers as long as the editorial team hasn't yet produced a censored and/or re-edited versions of these articles. The owners of the website explicitly state that in the instances in which imported articles from Wikipedia contain content deemed "problematic", the editorial team of the website will gradually review all of these articles and determine whether the content is appropriate - problematic articles with proper content will be rewritten while problematic articles with inappropriate content will eventually be permanently deleted. As of August 25, 2018 of all temporarily blocked imported articles awaiting to be reviewed, some of the articles that are most sought-after at the Hebrew Wikipedia include: [[YouTube]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ten Commandments]], [[Eyal Golan]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Christianity]], [[Independence Day (Israel)]], [[Judaism]], [[New Testament]], [[Sports]], [[Racism]], [[Academy Awards]], [[Human evolution]], [[Woman]], [[Status quo (Israel)]] [[Age of Enlightenment]], [[Breast cancer]], [[Tower of Babel]], [[Muslims]] , [[The Simpsons]], [[Apocalypse]], [[Hell]], [[Table tennis]], [[Homo]], [[Platonic love]], [[Sport in Israel]], [[Bourekas film]], [[Handball]], [[Race (human categorization)]], [[Jewish and democratic state]], [[Maccabiah Games]], [[Catholic Church]], [[Satire]], [[Paganism]], [[Samaritanism]].

'''Harvey Corporation Ltd v Barker''' [2002] 2 NZLR 213 is a cited [[case (law)|case]] regarding relief for [[misrepresentation]] under the [[Fair Trading Act 1986]].&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Harvey Corporation, a real estate agency, sold via auction a house on behalf of their vendors, Mr and Mrs Daniel. The purchasors, the Bakers, subsequently discovered that the large ornamental gates at the front of the property, were situated on a "paper road" of the local council, something that the Daniels were aware of when they sold the property, but had neglected to inform their agent, Harvey's.

The Bakers subsequently sued both the Daniels, and Harveys in the District Court, and were awarded $55,000 in damages.

Harveys then appealed unsuccessfully to the High Court.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal overturned the earlier award for damages.

The '''Index Herbariorum''' provides a global directory of [[herbaria]] and their associated staff. This searchable online index allows scientists rapid access to data related to 3,400 locations where a total of 350&amp;nbsp;million botanical [[Biological specimen|specimens]] are permanently housed (singular, [[herbarium]]; plural, herbaria). The Index Herbariorum has its own staff and website. Overtime, six editions of the Index were published from 1952 to 1974. The Index became available on-line in 1997.&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/|title=Index Herbariorum|publisher=sweetgum.nybg.org|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The index was originally published by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]], which sponsored the first six editions (1952–1974); subsequently the [[New York Botanical Garden]] took over the responsibility for the index. The Index provides the supporting institution's name (often a university, botanical garden, or not-for-profit organization) its city and state, each herbarium's acronym, along with contact information for staff members along with their research specialties and the important holdings of each herbarium's collection.

==Editors==

A '''letter''' is one person's [[written]] [[message]] to another pertaining to some matter of common concern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Letters have several different types: Formal letters and informal letters. Letters contribute to the protection and conservation of literacy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blake |first1=Gary |author-link1=Gary Blake |last2=Bly |first2=Robert W. |author-link2=Robert W.

==History of letter writing==

{{expand section|date=December 2013}}
Historically, letters have existed from the time of [[History of India|ancient India]], [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Sumer]], through [[ancient Rome|Rome]], [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]], up to the present day. During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, letters were used to self-educate. Letters were a way to practice critical reading, self-expressive writing, polemical writing and also exchange ideas with like-minded others. For some people, letters were seen as a written performance. For others, it was not only seen as a performance but also as a way of communication and a method of gaining feedback. Letters make up several of the books of the [[Bible]]. [[Archives]] of correspondence, whether for personal, diplomatic, or business reasons, serve as [[primary source]]s for [[historian]]s. At certain times, the writing of letters was thought to be an art form and a [[genre]] of [[literature]], for instance in Byzantine [[epistolography]].&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Epistolography" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 718. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient world letters were written on a various different materials, including metal, lead, wax-coated wooden tablets, pottery fragments, animal skin, and papyrus. From [[Ovid]], we learn that [[Acontius]] used an apple for his letter to [[Cydippe]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Her''. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[communication technology]] has diversified, posted letters have become less important as a routine form of communication. For example, the development of the [[telegraph]] drastically shortened the time taken to send a communication, by sending it between distant points as an electrical signal. At the telegraph office closest to the destination, the signal was converted back into writing on paper and delivered to the recipient. The next step was the [[telex]] which avoided the need for local delivery. Then followed the [[fax]] (facsimile) machine: a letter could be transferred electrically from the sender to the receiver through the telephone network as an image. Today, the [[internet]], by means of [[email]], plays a large part in written communications; however, these email communications are not generally referred to as letters but rather as e-mail (or email) messages, messages or simply emails or e-mails, with only the term "letter" generally being reserved for communications on paper.

==The study of letter writing==
Due to the timelessness and universality of letter writing, there is a wealth of letters and instructional materials (for example, [[Style guide|manuals]], as in the medieval [[ars dictaminis]]) on letter writing throughout history. The study of letter writing usually involves both the study of [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Carol Poster and Linda C. Mitchell, eds., ''Letter-Writing Manuals and Instruction from Antiquity to the Present'' (Columbia, SC: U of South Carolina Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of letters==
[[File:François Boucher - The Secret Message.jpg|thumbnail|[[François Boucher]] - ''The Secret Message'', 1767 ([[Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum]])]]

Letters are a way to connect with someone not through the internet. Despite email, letters are still popular, particularly in business and for official communications. Letters have the following advantages over email:
*No special device is needed to receive a letter, just a postal address, and the letter can be read immediately on receipt.
*An advertising mailing can reach every address in a particular area.
*A letter provides immediate, and in principle permanent, physical record of communication, without the need for printing. Letters, especially those with a signature and/or on an organization's own notepaper, are more difficult to falsify than is an email and thus provide much better evidence of the contents of the communication.
*A letter in the sender's own handwriting is more personal than an email.
*If required, small physical objects can be enclosed in the envelope with the letter.
*Letters are unable to transmit [[malware]] or other harmful files that can be transmitted by email.
*Letter writing leads to the mastery of the technique of good writing.
*Letter writing can provide an extension of the face-to-face therapeutic encounter.

==The letter delivery process==

Here is how a letter gets from the sender to the recipient:
# Sender writes letter and places it in an [[envelope]] on which the recipient's address is written in the centre front of the envelope. Sender ensures that the recipient's address includes the Zip or Postal Code (if applicable) and often includes his/her return address on the envelope.
# Sender buys a [[postage stamp]] and attaches it to the front of the [[envelope]] on the top right corner on the front of the envelope. (For large amount mailings, postage stamps are not used: a [[franking machine]] or other methods are used to pay for postage.)
# Sender puts the letter in a postbox.
# The national postal service of the sender's country (e.g. [[Royal Mail]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]; [[US Postal Service]], [[United States|US]]; [[Australia Post]] in [[Australia]]; or [[Canada Post]] in [[Canada]]) empties the postbox and takes all the contents to the regional sorting office.
# The sorting office then sorts each letter by address and postcode and delivers the letters destined for a particular area to that area's [[post office]]. Letters addressed to a different region are sent to that region's sorting office, to be sorted further.
# The local post office dispatches the letters to their delivery personnel who deliver them to the proper addresses.

This whole process, depending on how far the sender is from the recipient, can take anywhere from a day to 3–4 weeks. International mail is sent via [[trains]] and [[airplane]]s to other countries.

However, in 2008, Janet Barrett from the UK, received a RSVP to a party invitation addressed to 'Percy Bateman', from 'Buffy', originally posted on 29 November 1919. It had taken 89 years to be delivered by the Royal Mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Royal Mail denied this, saying that it would be impossible for a letter to have remained in their system for so long, as checks are carried out regularly. Instead, the letter dated 1919 may have "been a collector's item which was being sent in another envelope and somehow came free of the outer packaging".&lt;ref name="tele1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3683828/Royal-Mail-delivers-letter-89-years-late.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413195911/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3683828/Royal-Mail-delivers-letter-89-years-late.html|archivedate=13 April 2017|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=13 April 2017|title=Royal Mail delivers letter 89 years late|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letters patent''' ([[plurale tantum|always in the plural]]) are a type of [[legal instrument]] in the form of a published written order issued by a [[monarch]], [[president]], or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, [[government-granted monopoly|monopoly]], title, or status to a person or [[corporation]].  Letters patent can be used for the creation of [[corporation]]s or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a [[heraldry|coat of arms]]. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of [[the Crown]], such as [[governor]]s and [[governor-general|governors-general]] of [[Commonwealth realm]]s, as well as appointing a [[Royal Commission]]. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern [[patent]] (referred to as a utility patent or [[design patent]] in [[United States patent law]]) granting exclusive rights in an [[invention]] (or a design in the case of a [[design patent]]). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to "practice" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.

The opposite of letters patent are ''[[letters close]]'' ({{lang-la|litterae clausae}}), which are personal in nature and sealed so that only the recipient can read their contents. Letters patent are thus comparable to other kinds of [[open letter]] in that their audience is wide. It is not clear how the contents of letters patent became widely published before collection by the addressee, for example whether they were left after sealing by the king for inspection during a certain period by courtiers in a royal palace, who would disseminate the contents back to the gentry in the shires through normal conversation and social intercourse. Today, for example, it is a convention for the British prime minister to announce that they have left a document they wish to enter the public domain "in the library of the House of Commons", where it may be freely perused by all Members of Parliament.

==Meaning==
Letters patent are so named from the Latin verb ''{{lang|la|pateo}}'', to lie open, exposed, accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised by Marchant &amp; Charles, 260th. thousand&lt;/ref&gt; The originator's [[seal (emblem)|seal]] was attached ''[[seal (emblem)#Sealing practices|pendent]]'' from the document, so that it did not have to be broken in order for the document to be read.

''{{lang|la|Litterae}}'' in Latin meant "that which is written" or "writing", in the sense of letters of the alphabet placed together in meaningful sequence on a writing surface, not a specific format of composition as the modern word "letter" suggests. Thus letters patent do not equate to an [[open letter]] but rather to any form of document, deed, contract, letter, despatch, edict, decree, epistle etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, op.cit., p.321&lt;/ref&gt; made public.

They are called "letters" (plural) from their Latin name ''{{lang|la|litterae patentes}}'', used by medieval and later scribes when the documents were written in Latin. This loanword preserves the collective plural "letters" (''litterae'') Latin language uses to denote a message as opposed to a single alphabet letter&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised by Marchant &amp; Charles, 260th. thousand: "Literae, Plur: that which is written; Cicero: ''Dare alicui literas'' (plur) ''ad aliquem'': to give to a messenger a letter for a third person"&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Usage==
Letters patent are a form of open or public proclamation&lt;ref&gt;E.g. document dated 13 July 1527 issued ''Teste Rege'' titled: "A Proclamation for establishing of trade and merchandizing and traffique within the towne and marches of Callice with divers immunities and freedoms concerning the same", which is self-referenced  in the document by the phrase "by theis his lettres patentes of proclamacion" [[John Gough Nichols|Nichols, John Gough]]. [https://archive.org/stream/chronicleofcalai00turprich/chronicleofcalai00turprich_djvu.txt ''The Chronicle of Calais from the Reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII to the year 1540'', London, 1846] p.102&lt;/ref&gt; and a vestigial exercise of extra-parliamentary power by a monarch or president. Prior to the establishment of Parliament, the monarch ruled absolutely by the issuing of his personal written orders, open or closed.

They can thus be contrasted with the [[Act of Parliament]], which is in effect a written order by Parliament, approved by the monarch whose signature gives it force. No explicit government approval is contained within letters patent, only the seal or signature of the monarch.

Parliament today tolerates only a very narrow exercise of the royal prerogative by issuance of letters patent, and such documents are issued with prior informal government approval, or indeed are now generated by government itself with the monarch's seal affixed as a mere formality. In their original form they were simply written instructions or orders from the sovereign, whose order was law, which were made public to reinforce their effect.

For the sake of good governance it is clearly of little use if the sovereign appoints a person to a position of authority if he does not at the same time inform those over whom such authority is to be exercised of the validity of the appointment.

According to the United Kingdom [[Ministry of Justice]], there are 92 different types of letters patent.&lt;ref name="what_"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Letter from Sarah Whiteside to Steve Elibank regarding Freedom of Information Request | author =  | work = whatdotheyknow.com | date = 28 May 2012 | accessdate = 2018-08-16 | url = https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/108336/response/284995/attach/html/3/FOI%2076096%20Elibank.doc.html | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Patent Rolls]] are made up of office copies of English (and later United Kingdom) royal letters patent, which run in an almost unbroken series from 1201 to the present day, with most of those to 1625 having been published.

==Form of British letters patent creating peers==
The form of letters patent for creating peerages has been fixed by the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992 (SI 1992/1730). Part III of the schedule lays down nine ''[[pro forma]]'' texts for creating various ranks of the peerage, lords of appeal in ordinary, and baronets.

The following table organises the text from the letters patent by columns for each rank, with common text spanning multiple columns, depicting some of the similarities and differences among the proclamations.  Gender-specific differences are highlighted in italics.

The words "may have hold and possess" to "his heirs male aforesaid successively" and "have heretofore used and enjoyed or as they" (shown in brackets above) were deleted for Dukes and Duchesses, Marquesses and Marchionesses, Earls and Countesses, Viscounts, and hereditary Barons by the Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) (Amendment) Order 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3064/contents/made Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules)(Amendment) Order 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonwealth realms==
In [[Commonwealth realm]]s, letters patent are issued under the prerogative powers of the head of state, as an executive or [[royal prerogative]]. They are a rare, though significant, form of [[legislation]] which does not require the consent of [[parliament]]. Letters patent may also be used to grant [[royal assent]] to legislation.

==In the United States==
[[File:US General Land Office Deed 1845.jpg|thumb|Letters patent issued by the United States [[General Land Office]]]]

The primary source of letters patent in the [[United States]] are intellectual property [[patent]]s and [[land patent]]s, though letters patent are issued for a variety of other purposes. They function dually as public records and personal certificates.

In the United States, the [[forgery]] of letters patent granted by the [[President of the United States|President]] is a [[crime]] subject to fine, [[imprisonment]] up to ten years or both ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|497}}). Without letters patent, a person is unable to assume an appointed office. Such an issue prompted the ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' suit, where [[William Marbury]] and three others petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] to order [[James Madison]] to deliver their letters for appointments made under the previous administration.

===Form of United States letters patent===
United States letters patent generally do not fit a specific form, except for the [[eschatocol]], or formal ending:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, the undersigned [public official], in accordance with [relevant law], has in the name of the United States, Caused these letters to be made Patent and the Seal of [relevant agency or government official] to be hereunto affixed.

GIVEN under my hand, in [city] the [date] in the year of our Lord [year] and of the Independence of the United States the [years since July 4, 1776].

By [signature of public official issuing letter]

The '''Tammar Luxoro Atlas''', or '''Atlante Luxoro''', is an anonymous collection of  [[Italy|Italian]] [[portolan chart]]s from the early 15th century, currently held at the [[Biblioteca Civica Berio]] in [[Genoa]], Italy.  The author is unknown, although believed to have been made by [[Francesco de Cesanis]] of [[Venice]].

== Background ==

The Luxoro Atlas is named after [[Tammar Luxoro]], a 19th-century [[Genoa|Genoese]] artist and collector, who once owned it.  It was acquired by the city of [[Genoa]] in 1899, and is currently held at the [[Biblioteca Civica Berio]] in [[Genoa]], Italy.

The Luxoro Atlas was once believed to originate from the early 14th century, and sometimes said to have been authored by the Genoese cartographer [[Pietro Vesconte]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Canale (1866: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ibNTJcARquYC&amp;pg=PA436#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.436])&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to more recent scholars, the Luxoro Atlas was probably made by the [[Venice|Venetian]] cartographer [[Francesco de Cesanis]], probably a little time before 1421.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

The atlas is composed of eight sheets of nautical charts. With each sheet at 11&amp;nbsp;cm x 16&amp;nbsp;cm, making it the smallest [[portolan chart]] from the period still extant.&lt;ref&gt;See Campbell "Census of pre-sixteenth-century portolan charts: Corrections and updates" (2011: [http://www.maphistory.info/portolancensus.html entry 81])&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been designed for on-board use.&lt;ref name=berio&gt;Exhibition note, on the [http://www.e-corpus.org/fre/ref/10651/m.r.Cf.Arm.2/ Portolano Atlante Luxoro] at [[e-corpus]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is very much that of the Italian school of [[portolan chart]]s.

The eight sheets are separate nautical charts, together covering the "normal portolan" range.

# north Atlantic (oriented with South on top, depicting southern England, French coasts, northern Spain)
# west Mediterranean (oriented E on top, depicting southern Spain, Balearic islands and northwest Africa)
# central-west Mediterranean (oriented N, depicting southern France, Corsica, Sardinia, Tunisia)
# central-east Mediterranean (oriented N, with southern Italy, Sicily, western Greece and Tripolitana)
# Adriatic Sea (oriented S)
# Aegean Sea (oriented N)
# East Mediterranean (oriented W, Nile delta, Levantine coast, southern Anatolia)
# Black Sea (oriented E)

Unlike many earlier charts, the Luxoro Atlas makes no attempt to depict any [[Atlantic islands]] (not even the [[Canary Island]]s), ending the west African coast around [[Salé]], Morocco.

The '''Lviv Chronicle'''&lt;ref&gt;sometimes ''Lvov Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-uk|Львівський літопис}}) is a [[Rus (name)|Ruthenian]] chronicle from the early seventeenth century [[Halychyna]].

This chronicle reflects the events in [[Kievan Rus]] from year 1498 to 1649, revealing valuable information about the political and economic conditions of the Ukrainian lands, as well as their relations with other polities, such as [[Poland]], [[Muscovy]], and the [[Crimean Khanate]]. It describes such events as the [[Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands|Crimean Tatar raids]], imposition of Catholicism in [[Western Ukraine]] by [[Uniate]] clergy and nobility, [[Ukrainian Cossack]] rebellion of 1630s, and the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648—1654). It mentions a number of unique facts from Ukrainian history that are not available from any other source.

The text of the Lviv Chronicle was discovered in the beginning of 19th century by the [[Western Ukrainian Russophile]] historian [[Denis Zubrytsky]]. The manuscript of the Chronicle was kept at the [[Stauropegion Institute]] and is now stored in the Central Scientific Library of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] in [[Kyiv]], [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="itop89"&gt;[http://litopys.org.ua/ostrog/ostr05.htm АРХІВНА І БІБЛІОГРАФІЧНА  ДОВІДКА ПРО ЛЬВІВСЬКИЙ ЛІТОПИС І ОСТРОЗЬКИЙ ЛІТОПИСЕЦЬ] {{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first published in [[Moscow]] in 1839 by the Russian historian [[Mikhail Pogodin]] and later published in [[Lviv]] in the 1870s. The Etterov copy of the Lviv Chronicle (GPB F.IV.144) is stored in the [[Russian State Library]].

The Lviv Chronicle is very similar to the [[Sofia Second Chronicle]] and the latter is thought to have been based on the former.&lt;ref&gt;See the entry on the L'vov Chronicle in Ia. S. Lur'e, ed., ''Slovar' knizhnikov i knizhnostei drevnei Rusi'', available online at http://lib.pushkinskijdom.ru/Default.aspx?tabid=4283&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meir David HaKohen Kahane''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|n|ə}}; {{lang-he-n|מאיר דוד כהנא}}; August 1, 1932 – November 5, 1990) was an American-Israeli ordained [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]], writer and [[ultra-nationalist]] politician who served one term in [[Israel]]'s [[Knesset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = biography | url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/kahane.html | contribution = Rabbi Meir Kahane | title = Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced most modern Jewish militant and [[far-right]] political groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/israel/kach-kahane-chai-israel-extremists/p9178 |title=Kach, Kahane Chai (Israel, extremists) – Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahane spent years reaching out to [[Jews]] through published works, weekly articles, speeches, debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. He was an extreme advocate for [[Jewish]] causes, such as organizing defense squads and patrols in Jewish neighborhoods and demanding for the [[Soviet Union]] to "release its oppressed Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kahane | first = Libby | url = http://www.urimpublications.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=UP&amp;Product_Code=Kahane | title = Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought | format = abstract | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100813142154/http://www.urimpublications.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=UP&amp;Product_Code=Kahane | archivedate = August 13, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported [[violence]] against those he regarded as enemies of the Jewish people, called for immediate Jewish [[mass migration]] to Israel to avoid a potential "[[Holocaust]]" in the United States, supported the restriction of Israel's democracy to its Jewish citizens, hoped that Israel would eventually adopt [[Halacha|Jewish religious law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Meir Kahane | title = Uncomfortable Questions for Comfortable Jews | quote = The pity is-the tragedy is-that most Jews do not believe that Judaism is Divine and therefore do not accept it as the foundation of the state. And so, because of that-but only because any attempt to establish a true Torah state would lead to bitter civil war among Jews-I would not be prepared to establish a state that would bar elections involving parties that do not accept Torah law as authority.| pages= 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and endorsed the annexation of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncomfortable Questions for Comfortable Jews|year=1987|publisher=Lyle Stuart|isbn=978-0818404382|author=Meir Kahane|page=270|quote= The Jew is forbidden to give up any part of the Land of Israel, which has been liberated. The land belongs to the G-d of Israel, and the Jew, given it by G-d, has no right to give away any part of it. All the areas liberated in 1967 will be annexed and made part of the State of Israel. Jewish settlement in every part of the land, including cities that today are sadly ''Judenrein'', will be unlimited.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Do1tAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahane proposed enforcing Jewish law, as codified by [[Maimonides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Maimonides | title = Mishne Torah, Laws of Kings, Ch. 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Jews wishing to dwell in Israel would have three options: remain as "resident strangers" with limited rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Meir Kahane | title = Uncomfortable Questions for Comfortable Jews | quote = All [[Arabs]] who are prepared to accept the State of Israel as the exclusive state of the Jewish people and of no one else, will be allowed to remain in the land with the status of "resident stranger", as per Jewish laws. They will be granted personal rights, but no national ones. They will have general economic, social, cultural, and religious freedom, but will not be citizens of the Jewish State and will have nothing to say in its future in any way. Accepting this status, they are welcome to remain, and are entitled to all the respect and decency that Judaism demands we grant to all humans who are resident strangers in our land and who bow to its laws and concepts. | pages= 250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leave Israel and receive compensation for their property, or be forcibly removed without compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Meir Kahane | title = They Must Go | quote = Those who refuse to accept noncitizen status shall be compensated for property, but not given a bonus, and shall be transferred only to Arab - not Western - lands. The transfer shall be effected peacefully, if possible, but if the Arab still refuses, then forcibly and without compensation. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was serving in the Knesset in the mid-1980s Kahane proposed numerous laws, none of which passed, to emphasize Judaism in public schools, do away with Israel's bureaucracy, forbid sexual relations between non-Jews and Jews, and end cultural meetings between Jewish and Arab students.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Brinkley, Joel.

In 1968, Kahane was one of the cofounders of the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL) in the United States. In 1971, he co-founded [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] ("Thus"), a new [[list of political parties in Israel|political party in Israel]]. The same year, he was convicted in New York for conspiracy to manufacture explosives and received a suspended sentence of five years.&lt;ref name="NYT19710714"/&gt; In 1984, he became a member of the Knesset, when Kach gained its only-ever seat in parliamentary elections. In 1988, after polls showed Kach gaining popularity, the Israeli government banned Kach for being "[[racist]]" and "anti-democratic" under the terms of a law that it had just passed.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Kahane was assassinated in a [[Manhattan]] hotel by an Arab gunman in November 1990.

==Early life==
Martin David Kahane&lt;ref name="mart"&gt;{{Cite book | url ={{Google books |id=yhejdNH9nMkC |page=141 |plainurl=yes }} |title=When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone: The Epic Struggle to Save Soviet Jewry|isbn=9780547504438|author1=Beckerman|first1=Gal|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1932 to an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] family. His father, Yechezkel (Charles) Kahane, the author of the "Torah Yesharah", studied at Polish and Czech [[yeshiva]]s, was involved in the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionist]] movement, and was a close friend of [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/kahane.html |title=Rabbi Meir Kahane |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=August 1, 1932 |accessdate=October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Kahane became an ardent admirer of Jabotinsky and [[Peter Bergson]], who were frequent guests in his parents' home. He joined the [[Betar]] (Brit Trumpeldor) youth wing of Revisionist Zionism. He was active in protests against [[Ernest Bevin]], the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] who maintained restrictions on the immigration of Jews, even Nazi [[death camp]] survivors, to Palestine after the end of the [[Second World War]]. In 1947, Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin, who was disembarking at Pier 84 on a visit to New York. A photo of the arrest appeared in the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Robert I. ''The false prophet – Rabbi Meir Kahane – from FBI informant to Knesset member'', New York, 1990, p.9. {{ISBN|1-55652-078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he became the mazkir (director) of Greater New York City's 16 [[Bnei Akiva]] chapters.

Kahane's formal education included elementary school at the [[Yeshiva of Flatbush]], and he attended high school at both Abraham Lincoln High School and the [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy|Brooklyn Talmudical Academy]]. Kahane received his [[Semicha|rabbinical ordination]] from the [[Mir (Brooklyn)|Mir Yeshiva]], in Brooklyn, where he was especially admired by the head Rabbi [[Avraham Kalmanowitz|Abraham Kalmanowitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Libby Kahane | title = Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought (Vol. 1) | quote = Rabbi Abraham Kalmanowitz had a great love for Meir... [He once told Meir:] 'Because you sanctified G-d's name... your name and fame shall spread far and wide.' | pages= 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he began going by his Hebrew name, Meir.&lt;ref name=mart/&gt; He was fully conversant in the [[Tanakh]] (Jewish Bible), the [[Talmud]], the [[Midrash]] and [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. Subsequently, Kahane earned a B.A. in [[Political Science]] from [[Brooklyn College]], a Bachelor of Law - LL.B. from [[New York Law School]], and an M.A. in International Relations from [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;Libby Kahane, "Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought" vol. 2, chap 6, note 3 p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
===Pulpit rabbi===
In 1956 Kahane married Libby Blum, with whom he had four children:&lt;ref name=carrying&gt;Nathan-Kazis, Josh.

Although the synagogue was originally [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] rather than strictly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], the board of directors agreed to Kahane's conditions, which included resigning from the Conservative movement's [[United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism|United Synagogue of America]], installing a [[Mechitza|partition separating men and women]] during prayer, instituting traditional prayers, and maintaining a safe and [[kosher]] kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought Vol. One: 1932-1975|last = Kahane|first = Libby|publisher = Urim Publications|year = 2008|isbn = 978-965-524-008-5|location = Israel|pages = 42|quote = Meir accepted the rabbinical position at the Howard Beach Jewish Center (HBJC) with certain conditions. He demanded Orthodox practices, even though none of the synagogue's members were observant: a kosher kitchen, traditional prayers, and separate seating for men and women with a mechitza (partition) between them. Another condition was that the synagogue resign from the Conservative movement's United Synagogues of America. Remarkably, the board of directors agreed to all these terms, perhaps because the salary which Meir accepted was far lower than that of a Reform or Conservative rabbi.|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pK4RAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Jewish Center, Kahane influenced many of the synagogue's youngsters to adopt a more observant lifestyle, which often troubled parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= From Washington Avenue to Washington Street|year=2011|publisher=Gefen Books|isbn=978-965-229-5651|author= Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff |quote= Meir's primary success in this position was to be his undoing.

===Infiltrating the John Birch Society===
In the late 1950s and the early 1960s, Kahane's life of secrecy and his strong [[anticommunism]] landed him a position as a consultant with the [[FBI]]. According to his wife, Libby, his assignment was to infiltrate the anticommunist [[John Birch Society]] and report his findings to the FBI.&lt;ref name=carrying /&gt; Later, [[Michael T. Kaufman]] published an article claiming that Kahane then confided in him that he had been in a relationship with Gloria Jean D'Argenio. According to these allegations, Kahane allegedly sent a letter to D'Argenio in which he unilaterally ended their relationship. In response, D'Argenio jumped off the [[Queensboro Bridge]] and died of her injuries the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/06/weekinreview/remembering-kahane-and-the-woman-on-the-bridge.html?src=pm Remembering Kahane, and the Woman on the Bridge] New York Times; March 6, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaboration with Joseph Churba===
At some time in the late 1950s, Kahane assumed the persona of a [[Gentile]] individual, along with the pseudonym Michael King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=7vQud4yM3R0C |title=When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone: The Epic Struggle to Save Soviet Jewry }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahane began openly expressing his anticommunism. He and [[Joseph Churba]] created the July Fourth Movement, which was formed to counteract widespread opposition towards U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Libby Kahane | title = Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought (Vol. 1) | pages= 79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, they coauthored the book ''The Jewish Stake in Vietnam'', an attempt to convince American Jews of the "evil of Communism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=Mf5AAAAAIAAJ |title=The Jewish stake in Vietnam}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction states that, "All Americans have a stake in this grim war against Communism... It is vital that Jews realize the threat to their very survival [should Communism succeed]." Churba had a major falling out with Kahane over the use of paramilitary activities{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}, and they parted ways permanently. Churba went on to pursue his own career, joining the [[U.S. Air Force]], writing many books on the Middle East, and eventually becoming one of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s consultants. Kahane chose to fight for Jewish rights, and was willing to use extreme measures. He even attempted to acquire and grow [[biological weapons]] to use on a Soviet military installation.&lt;ref name="ussr-attack"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://intelwire.egoplex.com/2007_10_06_blogarchive.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629032555/http://intelwire.egoplex.com/2007_10_06_blogarchive.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 29, 2013|title=Informant: Meir Kahane Planned Biological Terror Attack On USSR|date=October 6, 2007|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began using the phrase "Never Again"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=But Meir Kahane's Message Refuses to Die; Source of 'Never Again'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/19/opinion/l-but-meir-kahane-s-message-refuses-to-die-source-of-never-again-080490.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=November 16, 2013|date=November 19, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conceived the Jewish Star and fist insignia, a symbol resembling that of the [[Black Panther Party]]. Howerver, Kahane himself opposed the Black Panthers because they had supported anti-Jewish riots in [[Massachusetts]] and had [[left-wing]] views.

==Jewish Defense League==
The [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL) was founded by Kahane in New York City in 1968. Its self-described purpose was to protect Jews from local manifestations of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref name="backgrounder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp |title=Anti-Defamation League on JDL |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414090038/http://www.adl.org/extremism/jdl_chron.asp |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The JDL said it was committed to five fundamental principles:

* Love of Jewry: One Jewish people, indivisible and united, from which flows the love for, and the feeling of pain of, all Jews.
* Dignity and Pride: Pride in and knowledge of [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]], [[Jewish principles of faith|faith]], [[Jewish culture|culture]], [[Land of Israel|land]], [[Jewish history|history]], strength, pain, and peoplehood.
* Iron: The need to both move to help Jews everywhere and to change the Jewish image through sacrifice and all necessary means—even strength, force and violence.
* Discipline and Unity: The knowledge that he (or she) can and will do whatever must be done, and the unity and strength of willpower to bring this into reality.
* Faith in the Indestructibility of the Jewish People: Faith in the greatness and indestructibility of the Jewish people, our [[religion]], and our Land of Israel.

The JDL favored [[civil rights]] for [[black people|blacks]] but opposed black anti-Semites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought, Volume 1|last=Kahane|first=Libby|publisher=Urim Publications|year=2008|isbn=978-965-524-008-5|pages=106|quote=The JDL favored civil rights for blacks, and opposed only black anti-Semites.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pK4RAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and racism of any form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought, Volume 1|last=Kahane|first=Libby|publisher=Urim Publications|year=2008|isbn=978-965-524-008-5|location=|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pK4RAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the JDL formed an alliance with a black rights group in what Kahane termed "a turning point in Black-Jewish relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/1971/05/19/archive/black-group-jdl-pledge-common-action-for-soviet-jews-black-jewish-relations|title=Black Group, Jdl Pledge Common Action for Soviet Jews, Black-jewish Relations|date=May 19, 1971|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|quote=The leader of a black self help group and the national chairman of the Jewish Defense League met today and pledged "brotherhood".

But as we pushed back, the mob broke up and the rally continued. It was a small victory, perhaps, but the four Christian students who came up after the rally and said 'You guys have guts, that was the first rally of this kind we’ve seen here. Can we join the JDL?' understood perfectly what had happened. They did join, and at one point some 4 percent of our membership was non-Jewish.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zkaAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Anti-Defamation League]] claimed that Kahane "preached a radical form of Jewish [[nationalism]] which reflected [[racism]], violence and political extremism"&lt;ref name="backgrounder" /&gt; that was replicated by [[Irv Rubin]], the JDL's successor to Kahane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/presrele/extremism_72/4016_72.asp |title=ADL Commends FBI for Thwarting Alleged Bombing Plot By Jewish Extremists |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926205341/http://www.adl.org/presrele/extremism_72/4016_72.asp |archivedate=September 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terrorism and convictions ==
A number of the JDL's members and leaders, including Kahane, were convicted of acts related to [[domestic terrorism in the United States|domestic terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0799/9907081.html |title=Middle East History: Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America |publisher=Wrmea.com |date= |accessdate=November 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050423165647/http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0799/9907081.html |archivedate=April 23, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Kahane was sentenced to a suspended five-year prison sentence for conspiring to manufacture explosives.&lt;ref name="NYT19710714"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = New York Times | title = Kahane Gets 5-Year Suspended Sentence in Bomb Plot | author = Morris Kaplan | date = July 24, 1971 | page = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Kahane was arrested for leading the attack on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[United Nations]] mission and injuring two officers, but he was released after being given summonses for [[disorderly conduct]]. Later the same year, Kahane was accused of conspiring to kidnap a Soviet diplomat, bomb the [[Iraq]]i embassy in Washington, and ship arms abroad from Israel. He was convicted of violating his [[probation]] for the 1971 bombing conviction and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = New York Times | title = Kahane gets year in '71 conviction | date = February 22, 1975 | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he served most of it in a hotel, with frequent unsupervised absences, because of a concession over the provision of [[kosher]] food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = New York Times | title = Kahane enjoys freedom as an Inmate | date = November 15, 1975 | page = 56 | author = Deirdre Carmody}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1984 interview with ''[[Washington Post]]'' correspondent Carla Hall, Kahane admitted that the JDL "bombed the Russian [Soviet] mission in New York, the Russian cultural mission here [Washington] in 1971, the Soviet trade offices".&lt;ref name=kushner&gt;{{cite book |first=Harvey W. |last=Kushner |url={{Google books |id=ZOfkAoDb_2IC |plainurl=yes }} |title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |pages=192–193 |isbn=978-0-7619-2408-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/159817982.html?dids=159817982&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Sep+11%2C+1984&amp;author=By+Carla+Hall&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C1&amp;desc=The+Message+of+Meir+Kahane

==Immigration to Israel==
{{Main|Kach and Kahane Chai}}

In 1971, Kahane [[aliyah|emigrated to Israel]]. At the time, he declared that he would focus on [[Jewish education]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehud Sprinzak (1999). ''Brother against Brother''. The Free Press. p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He later began gathering lists of Arab residents who were willing to emigrate for compensation, and eventually, he initiated protests that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Occupied Territories. In 1972, Jewish Defense League leaflets were distributed in [[Hebron]], calling for the mayor to stand trial for the [[1929 Hebron massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;The Kach Movement – Background. [http://www.mfa.gov.il Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4x36zY?url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/ |date=January 17, 2010}}: March 3, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Kahane was arrested dozens of times.&lt;ref&gt;[[60 Minutes]] – Meir Kahane&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he founded [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], a political party that ran for the [[Knesset]], the Israeli Parliament, during the [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|1973 general elections]] under the name "The League List". It won 12,811 votes (0.82%), just 2,857 (0.18%) short of the [[electoral threshold]] at the time (1%) for winning a Knesset seat. The party was even less successful in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]], winning only 4,836 votes.

In 1980, Kahane was arrested for the 62nd time since his emigration, and he was jailed for six months after a detention order that was based on allegations of him planning armed attacks against [[Palestinians]] in response to the killings of Jewish settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KnwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=baQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3057,1747482&amp;dq=kahane+arrested&amp;hl=en Israelis arrest rabbi on terrorism charges], The Montreal Gazette May 15, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Kahane was held in prison in [[Ramla]], where he wrote the book ''They Must Go''.

In 1981, Kahane's party again ran for the Knesset during the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]], but it did not win a seat and received only 5,128 votes. In 1984, the [[Israeli Central Elections Committee]] banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Court Drops Ban on 2 Political Parties, New York Times, June 29, 1984, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court suggested for the Knesset to pass a law that would authorize the exclusion of racist parties from future elections, and the Anti-Racist Law of 1988 was passed.

=== Election to Knesset ===
In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 legislative elections]], Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, enough to give the party one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard [[oath of office]] and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from [[Psalms]] to indicate that national laws were overruled by the [[Torah]] if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the [[Land of Israel]], revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. It was based on the Code of Jewish Law compiled by [[Maimonides]] in the [[Mishneh Torah]].

As his political career progressed and his popularity in the streets began growing, Kahane became increasingly isolated in the Knesset. His speeches, boycotted by nearly all Knesset members, were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected by fellow Knesset members. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members "[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] ("HaRaayon HaYehudi") with funding from US supporters to teach "the Authentic Jewish Idea". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].&lt;ref name="cut down"&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G. Freedman&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Knesset passed an amendment to the [[Basic Law of Israel]], barring "racist" candidates from election. The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M. Dershowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chutzpah|year=1992|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0-671-76089-2|author=Alan M.

==Assassination==
{{Main|Assassination of Meir Kahane}}

In November 1990, Kahane gave a speech to an audience of mostly Orthodox Jews from [[Brooklyn]],&lt;ref name="specter" /&gt; where he warned [[American Jews]] to [[aliyah|immigrate to Israel]] before it was "too late".&lt;ref name="specter"&gt;{{cite news |title= Jewish Leader Kahane Slain in New York |last=Specter |first= Michael |date=November 6, 1990 |work= The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-06/news/mn-3996_1_jewish-defense-league |title=Militant Rabbi Kahane Slain by N.Y.

Prosecutors were able to try Nosair again for the murder because the federal indictment included the killing as part of the alleged terrorist conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/US/9510/terror_trial/update/ CNN] Jenkins, Brian.

Some researchers, such as [[Peter Lance]], consider Kahane one of the first, if not the very first, American victims of the new group [[Al Qaeda]], since his killer is believed to have links to [[Osama bin Laden]]'s network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane- The First victim of Al Quaeda in America|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kpCJjhvbOE&amp;list=WL5ABC371F9A2AC9F7|website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell that Kahane's assassin belonged to had been training in the New York Metro system since mid-1989.&lt;ref name="peterlance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peterlance.com/wordpress/?p=106|title=First Blood: Was Meir Kahane's murder al Qaeda's earliest attack on U.S. soil? &amp;#124; Peter Lance|publisher=peterlance.com|accessdate=June 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahane was buried on [[Har HaMenuchot]], in Jerusalem. His funeral was one of the largest in Israel's history, and approximately 150,000 participated. He was eulogized by a number of prominent supporters in both the U.S. and in Israel, including Rabbi [[Moshe Tendler]] and the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, [[Mordechai Eliyahu]], who spoke of how little the people understood of Kahane's "true value".&lt;ref&gt;"Gentlemen, not everyone knows Rabbi Meir! They do not know his true value! His fear of heaven! His learning! His kindness! The help he gave in secret! How many families receive food products from him on the eve of Passover, the eve of Sukkoth, the eve of Rosh HaShana; how many poor people got money from him – and all this, giving in secret! I can tell you that just recently, before Rosh HaShana, Rabbi Meir handed out some 34,000 dollars. There was a family that needed money, so he took money from his private funds and gave them! This is kindness! This is fear of heaven! This is charity! This is giving in secret! His inner qualities, the delicacy of his soul, his inner fear of heaven! This, people do not know, with this they are not familiar. Gentlemen! As if we know how carefully he used to fix times for Torah study! Who was the first to speak of Russian Jewry? Who awakened the Israeli people and the entire world from their slumbers, with regard to Russian Jewry? Who was it who predicted that Russian Jews would yet come out of their exile? It was Rabbi Meir Kahane – may God avenge his blood! I can mention now the number of agunoth I asked him to act on behalf of – thanks to his efforts we succeeded in saving a goodly number of agunoth. He saved many Jewish women from non-Jewish hands! Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Meir! I ask of you to rise up to heaven and to awaken all those who were put to death by the authorities, so that they can act in heaven for the benefit of all of Israel, so that we need not mourn any more, and so that your own sacrifice will be the last one, so that crying and screaming shall no longer be heard in our day, and so that we be found worthy of the final redemption, speedily and in our day. Amen."{{Citation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG7KBuzLqfE |title=Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu's Eulogy of Rabbi Meir Kahane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
{{Main|Kahanism}}

Kahane argued that there was a glory in Jewish destiny, which came through the observance of the [[Torah]]. He also noted, "[[Democracy]] and [[Judaism]] are not the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;"One absolutely cannot confuse them. The objective of a democratic state is to allow a person to do exactly as he wishes. The objective of Judaism is to serve God and to make people better. These are two totally opposite conceptions of life."{{cite web|url=http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |title=God's Law: an Interview with Rabbi Meir Kahane |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219141224/http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: "The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?"&lt;ref name="kahane.org"&gt;Kahane.org&lt;/ref&gt; "Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins."

Kahane proposed an "[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: "A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago." Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who "don't want to leave".&lt;ref name="kahane.org"/&gt; He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: "I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus."&lt;ref name="kahane.org"/&gt;

In some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&amp;a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel. The Arabs who call themselves 'Palestinians' had the opportunity to create a 'Palestine' in a far larger part of the Land of Israel but refused to do so. They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview, he defined Israel's "minimal borders" as follows: "the southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai]], including [[Yamit]]. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the [[River Jordan|Jordan River]], hence part of what is now Jordan. [[Land of Israel|Eretz Yisrael]] also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the [[Euphrates River]].&lt;ref name="kahane.org"/&gt; When critics suggested that following Kahane's plans would mean a perpetual war between Jews and Arabs, Kahane responded, "There will be a perpetual war. With or without Kahane."

==Support==
* [[Irving M. Bunim]], who was the major lay leader of [[Orthodox Jewry]] and the trusted assistant of Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]], was a strong supporter and admirer of Kahane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=As Long as the Candle Burns|year=2015|publisher=Mazo Publishers|isbn=978-1936778423|author=Chana Bunim Rubin Ausubel|page=188|quote=As an activist he was an admirer and supporter of Rav Meir Kahane, when very few people were.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KReRrgEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Shlomo Carlebach]] was known for declaring that the Jewish people owed a great debt to Kahane. Together, Carlebach and Kahane organized one of the first [[Noahidism|Noahide]] conferences in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halevi|first=Ezra|title=Sanhedrin Recognizes Council to Teach Humanity ´Laws of Noah´|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/96347#.Vb_xDfm6evs|newspaper=Arutz 7 News|date=January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bob Dylan]] made positive comments about Kahane. In a 1971 interview for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Dylan said, "He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Time | url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,944419,00.html | contribution = Bob Dylan interview | date=May 31, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kahane, Dylan attended several meetings of the Jewish Defense League in order to find out "what we're all about"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=734 | title = The Wandering Kind | first = Douglas | last = Wolk | publisher = Next Book | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128023757/http://www.nextbook.org/cultural/feature.html?id=734 | archivedate = November 28, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he started to have talks with the rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Heylin| first = Clinton| authorlink = | title = Bob Dylan Behind the Shades.

* The former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel (1983–93), [[Mordechai Eliyahu]], was Kahane's personal mentor, and one of Kahane's staunchest supporters. Eliyahu wrote an approbation to Kahane's [[Tanakh]] commentary, "Perush Hamacabee", where he refers to Kahane as "HaRav HaGaon" ("the rabbinic genius"), a praiseworthy title attributed to the very saintly. Eliyahu wrote, "Only the Torah way interested Kahane, which he constantly toiled over and which served as his strength... When one considers the depth and clarity of [Kahane's] works, one is astonished at how he had the time to compile such. The answer is that... all his time and thoughts were invested in Torah while other matters were secondary. Fortunate is the family that publishes his works for others to learn from." At Kahane's funeral, Eliyahu stated that Kahane was a [[reincarnation]] of a fearless biblical character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG7KBuzLqfE|title = Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu's Eulogy of Rabbi Meir Kahane}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kahane was endorsed in his bid for a Knesset seat by [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]], the son of the first Chief Rabbi of Israel and the spiritual leader of the [[Gush Emunim]] movement. Kook had been a staunch supporter of the [[National Religious Party]], but he broke with them in 1974 when they entered the Rabin government despite his opposition. In his letter of support for Kahane, Kook stated: "The presence of Rabbi Meir Kahane and his uncompromising words from the Knesset platform will undoubtedly add strength and value to the obligatory struggle on behalf of the entire Land of Israel." The announcement of Kook's support of Kahane and his letter were made available to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]].
* [[Yosef Mendelevitch]] stated, "Kahane was a representative for us. His activities made us feel good. His actions showed that Jews cared. His actions may have been controversial, but his role was very important. He was a symbol for Russian Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epi7mD1HWpU|title=L'Chayim: Soviet Refusenik, Yosef Mendelevich|date=November 26, 2012|website=Youtube|publisher=Shalom TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Moshe Tendler]], son-in-law of [[Moshe Feinstein]], praised Kahana and statd, "His whole goal was always 'How do you make each Jew stand tall?'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Excerpts from the Eulogy Given at Rabbi Kahane's Funeral by Rabbi Moshe Tendler, Shlita|journal=The Idea|date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Yaakov Yosef]], the son of [[Ovadia Yosef]] who headed the Hazon Ya'akov Yeshiva and served as rabbi of the Givat Moshe neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]], described Kahane as one who "fulfilled his role faithfully" and declared, "We must learn from [Kahane's] great actions in order that we learn the way of the Torah."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-C8fITJGZw|title=Rabbi Yaakov Yosef about Rabbi Meir Kahane}}&lt;/ref&gt; While serving in the Knesset as part of the [[Shas]] party, Yosef was one of the few who remained to listen to Kahane's addresses.
*After the Kach party was outlawed, a member of the [[Sicarii (1989)|Sicarii]] terrorist group pledged allegiance to Kahane and his political party during a phone call.&lt;ref name=":Sicarii"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Underground group targets Jewish leftists|last=Roseberg|first=Carol|date=April 28, 1989|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|access-date=|page=A8|author-link=Carol Rosenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kahane's death, no leader emerged to replace him in the movement although the idea of transferring populations, which was attributed mainly to Kahane, was subsequently incorporated into the political platform of various political parties in Israel, such as [[Moledet]] (applying to Arab non-citizen residents of the West Bank) and [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] (in the form of population exchange).{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Two small Kahanist factions later emerged; one under the name ''Kach'', and the other under the name ''Kahane chai'' (Hebrew: כהנא חי, literally "Kahane lives [on]"), the second one being led by his younger son, [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]. Neither one was permitted to participate in the Knesset elections by the Central Elections Committee.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In 1994, following the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]] of Palestinian Muslim worshippers in [[Hebron]] by Kach supporter [[Baruch Goldstein]], in which 29 Muslim worshipers were killed, the Israeli government declared both parties to be [[terrorist]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.nps.navy.mil/home/tgp/kach.htm |title=Kach and Kahane Chai |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021216072525/http://library.nps.navy.mil/home/tgp/kach.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2002 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://212.150.54.123/organizations/orgdet.cfm?orgid=19 |title=Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011021859/http://212.150.54.123/organizations/orgdet.cfm?orgid=19 |archivedate=October 11, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US State Department also added Kach and Kahane Chai to its [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]].

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003 Knesset elections]], [[Herut]], which had split off from the [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] list, ran with [[Michael Kleiner]] and former Kach activist [[Baruch Marzel]] taking the top two spots on the list. The joint effort narrowly missed the 1.5% barrier. In the following [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]], the [[Jewish National Front]], led by [[Baruch Marzel]], fared better, but it also failed to pass the minimum threshold. A follower of Kahane who was involved with Kach for many years, [[Michael Ben-Ari]], was elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]] on renewed [[National Union (Israel)|National Union]] list. He stood again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2013|2013 elections]] as the second candidate on the list of [[Otzma LeYisrael]], but the party failed to pass the minimum threshold.

In 2007, the FBI released over a thousand documents relating to its daily surveillance of Kahane since the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTELWIRE.com - the documents |url=http://intelfiles.egoplex.com/1970-fbi-kahane.pdf|accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Kahane's grandson, Meir Ettinger, was detained by Israeli law enforcement. He was the alleged leader of the radical Jewish group "The Revolt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cracking down on the settlers: Binyamin Netanyahu’s double game|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21660538-binyamin-netanyahus-double-game-cracking-down-settlers |accessdate=8 August 2015|work=[[The Economist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an online "manifesto" echoing some of his grandfather's teachings, Ettinger promotes the "dispossession of gentiles" who live in Israel and the establishment of a new "kingdom of Israel", a [[theocracy]] ruled by [[Halacha]]. Ettinger's writings condemned Israel's government, mainstream rabbis, and the IDF, and also have denounced Christian churches as "idolatry".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-meir-ettinger.html Israeli Detains Meir Kahane's Grandson, a Scion of Jewish Militancy] The New York Times, 4 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kahane's widow claimed that modern Jewish extremists in Israel are not following the ideology of her late husband, Rabbi Meir Kahane. She justified that claim by arguing that unlike modern Jewish extremists, Rabbi Kahane had a more mature approach that did not encourage illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.702619|title=Kahane's Widow: Today's Jewish Extremists Have Failed to Live Up to Kahane's Way|last=Sales|first=Ben|date=February 10, 2016|work=Ha'aretz|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, the ruling was unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court. Attempts to ban the [[Yisrael Hazaka|Strong Israel]] and [[Balad (political party)|Balad]] political parties by using the Kahane precedent were also overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DAN WILNER|title=High Court Expected to Overturn Election Committee Ban on Zoabi|url=http://hamodia.com/2012/12/26/high-court-expected-to-overturn-election-committee-ban-on-zoabi/|accessdate=November 16, 2013|newspaper=Hamodia|date=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli Arab Barred From Running in Election|url=http://forward.com/articles/167974/israeli-arab-barred-from-running-in-election/|accessdate=November 16, 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12641">A '''metadata registry''' is a central location in an organization where [[metadata]] definitions are stored and maintained in a controlled method.

A [[metadata repository]] is the [[database]] where metadata is stored. The registry also adds relationships with related metadata types.

==Use of metadata registries==
Metadata registries are used whenever data must be used consistently within an organization or group of organizations.  Examples of these situations include:
* Organizations that transmit data using structures such as [[XML]], [[Web Services]] or [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]
* Organizations that need consistent definitions of data across time, between databases, between organizations or between processes, for example when an organization builds a data warehouse
* Organizations that are attempting to break down "silos" of information captured within applications or proprietary file formats
Central to the charter of any metadata management programme is the process of creating trusting relationships with stakeholders and that definitions and structures have been reviewed and approved by appropriate parties.

==Common characteristics of a metadata registry==
A metadata registry typically has the following characteristics:
* Protected environment where only authorized individuals may make changes
* Stores [[data element]]s that include both [[semantics]] and [[representation class|representations]]
* Semantic areas of a metadata registry contain the meaning of a data element with precise definitions
* Representational areas of a metadata registry define how the data is represented in a specific format, such as in a database or a structured file format (e.g., [[XML]])

==Clear separation of semantics and system-specific constraints==
Because metadata registries are used to store both semantics (the meaning of a data element) and systems-specific constraints (for example the maximum length of a string) it is important to identify what systems impose these constraints and to document them.  For example the maximum length of a string should not change the meaning of a data element.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has published standards for a metadata registry called [[ISO/IEC 11179]] and also ISO15000-3 and ISO15000-4 [http://xml.coverpages.org/ISO-ebXML.html ebXML registry and repository (regrep)] [[EbXML RegRep]]

==ISO standards==
There are two ISO standards which are commonly referred to as metadata registry standards: ISO 11179 and ISO 15000-3. There are some who believe that ISO 11179 and ISO 15000-3 are interchangeable or at least in some way similar. e.g.

"Of interest is that the ISO 11179 model was one of the inputs to the ebXML RIM (registry information model) and so has much functional equivalence to the "registry" region of the ISO 11179 conceptual model." [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.113.6331&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf]

This is however incorrect. Although the specification ebRIM v2.0 (5 december 2001) says at the beginning in its Design Objectives: "Leverage as much as possible the work done in the OASIS [OAS] and the ISO 11179 [ISO] Registry models" [http://xml.coverpages.org/OASIS-ebXML-RIM-v20.pdf]
by the time of ebRIM v3.0 (2 May 2005) all reference to ISO/IOEC 11179 is reduced to a mention under informative references on page 76 of 78. [http://docs.oasis-open.org/regrep/v3.0/specs/regrep-rim-3.0-os.pdf]
It was recognised by some team members that the [[ebXML]] RIM data model had no place to store "fine grained artifacts" [https://web.archive.org/web/20110927100155/http://www.stylusstudio.com/xmldev/200503/post70270.html] ie. the data elements which are at the heart of ISO/IEC 11179, but not until 2009 can an explicit and definitive statement from the team be found. [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4ACBC943.8090609%40wellfleetsoftware.com&amp;forum_name=ebxmlrr-tech]

===ISO/IEC 11179===
ISO/IEC 11179 says that it is concerned with "traditional" metadata: "We limit the scope of the term as it is used here in ISO/IEC 11179 to descriptions of data - the more traditional use of the term."
Originally the standard named itself a "data element" registry. It describes data elements: "data elements are the fundamental units of data" and "data elements themselves contain various kinds of data that include characters, images, sound, etc."
It also describes a registry with an analogy: "This is analogous to the registries maintained by governments to keep track of motor vehicles. A description of each motor vehicle is entered in the registry, but not the vehicle itself."

===ebXML===
The [[ebXML]] RIM says about its Repository and Registry that it is
* "... capable of storing any type of electronic content such as XML documents, text documents, images, sound and video … RepositorytItems (sic) are stored in a content repository".
It also says that it is
* "... capable of storing standardized metadata that MAY be used to further describe RepositoryItems" which metadata "… are stored in the registry".
It also describes itself with "...this familiar metaphor. An ebXML Registry is like your local library. The repository is like the bookshelves in the library. The repository items in the repository are like book (sic) on the bookshelves." It goes on to say "The registry is like the card catalog … A RegistryObject is like a card in the card catalog."

What should be immediately apparent is that something which holds catalogue cards is not "like" a catalogue, it IS a catalogue.

Unfortunately for a number of organisations that have implemented ebXML RIM to satisfy a requirement for an ISO/IEC 11179 registry, ebXML RIM
* is neither a registry
* nor does it store metadata.
It is
* a "content repository"
* and a "[[metadata|metacontent catalogue]]".

==Metadata registry roles==
A metadata registry is frequently set up and administered by an organization's [[data architect]] or data modeling team.

Data elements are frequently assigned to [[data steward]]s or data stewardship teams that are responsible for the maintenance of individual data elements through a secure system.

==Metadata element workflow==
Metadata registries frequently have a formal data element submission, approval and publishing approval process.  Each data element should be accepted by a data stewardship team and reviewed before data elements are published.  After publication change control processes should be used.

==Metadata navigation, search and publishing==
Metadata registries are frequently large and complex structures and require navigation, visualization and searching tools.  Use of hierarchical viewing tools are frequently an essential part of a metadata registry system.  [[Metadata publishing]] consists of making data element definitions and structures available to both people and other   systems.

The '''National Herbarium of the Netherlands''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nationaal Herbarium Nederland'') is one of largest [[herbarium|herbaria]] in the world with some 5.5 million specimens.
It was established in 1999 through a decentralized merger of the major university herbaria of [[Leiden University|Leiden]] (also known as the Rijksherbarium), [[University of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]].  Each of the three had its own focus.

The National Herbarium currently consists of two branches: 
*Leiden University 
*Wageningen University and Research centre. 
The Utrecht herbarium has been closed and in 2009 its stock was transferred to [[Leiden]], where it is curated by the [[Naturalis|Naturalis Biodiversity Centre]]. 
It is planned that Naturalis (the [[Netherlands]]' Natural History Museum and Centre for Biodiversity) will run the National Herbarium.&lt;ref name="Utrecht"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhn.leidenuniv.nl/index.php/nhn/institute/utrecht | title=Utrecht herbarium | accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The NHN coordinates several flora projects. "[[Flora Malesiana]]" and "Flora of the Guianas" have their seat in Leiden, while the "Flore du Benin" and "Flore du Gabon" are coordinated from Wageningen.&lt;ref name="collections"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vstbol.leidenuniv.nl/ | title=NHN | accessdate=February 16, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125042043/http://vstbol.leidenuniv.nl/ | archivedate=January 25, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Herbaria of several classic botanists are in the collections, e.g.
* [[David de Gorter]]

==Access==
The Herbarium is open to any visitor, professional or amateur, with a legitimate reason to consult the collections. 
The specimen database is available through Brahms online: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130125042043/http://vstbol.leidenuniv.nl/ Specimen database].

==Directors==
When the National Herbarium was formed in 1999 [[Pieter Baas]], former director of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rijksherbarium|nl}} of Leiden University, became the director. He was succeeded in 2005 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Erik Smets|nl}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marian Tjaden |url=http://www.bionieuws.nl/artikel.php?id=1993 |title=‘Ik had enorm de pest aan systematiek’ |language=Dutch |publisher=Bionieuws |date=20 May 2005 |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|nl|Nederlandsche vogelen}}''''' (English: ''Dutch birds'') is a five volume Dutch natural history compendium by [[Cornelius Nozeman]] and [[Christiaan Sepp]], published in Amsterdam from 1770. It was published in instalments and was finished in 1829. It was the first comprehensive [[avifauna]] of the Netherlands (which temporarily included [[Belgium]] during 1815 - 1830).

This monumental work was written by Cornelius Nozeman, and after his death by [[Martinus Houttuyn]]. The last volume was finished by Jan Sepp, with advice from [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck]]. The coloured engravings were made by [[Sepp family (publishing)|Christiaan Sepp, Jan Christiaan Sepp (his son), and Jan Sepp (his grandson)]].

Each volume contains 50 images of bird species. Apart from these images, each species is described on a few text pages.

== The makers ==
Cornelius Nozeman (1720 - 1786) was a [[Remonstrant]] vicar. He wrote the texts of ''{{lang|nl|Nederlandsche vogelen}}'' vol. 1 and a large part of vol. 2. After his death, his work was continued by Martinus Houttuyn (1720 - 1798), who was a physician and biologist. The last volume was put together by the publisher with the help of [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck]] (1778 - 1858).

The engravings were made by and under supervision of Christiaan Sepp (c. 1700 - 1775), and later by his son Jan Christiaan Sepp (1739 - 1811) and his grandson Jan Sepp (1778 - 1853).

The works were published by Jan Christiaan Sepp and son. The plates are not signed. It is not always clear who has drawn them.&lt;ref name=drawings&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nederlandschevogelen.nl/leesmeer.html|title=Nederlandsche vogelen|work=nederlandschevogelen.nl|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and CEO of Ngalla Maya is Mervyn Eades, recognised in consecutive years at the [[National Indigenous Human Rights Awards]], for his transformative work in prison to community and employment - recipient of the 2016 [[Eddie Mabo]] Social Justice Award and the 2017 Dr Yunupingu Human Rights Award.

Prominent suicide prevention researcher and prison to work reformer, [[Gerry Georgatos]] has been a supporter of Ngalla Maya, writing in national media, "There are only a few organisations and programs authentically transforming the lives of inmates and former inmates. One of the most successful programs is Ngalla Maya, a prison to wellbeing, to training and education, to employment effort founded by a former inmate, Noongar man Mervyn Eades."

Georgatos also stated in 2017, "In the past year, Ngalla Maya inspired more than 140 inmates to participate in training and educational programs. They are now employed. No other program has achieved these results. Despite receiving support from the Federal Government, the Western Australian government has not given it a single penny."&lt;ref name="SBS News-2017-03-10"&gt;{{cite web|last=Georgatos |first=Gerry | title= New leadership needed to reduce incarceration |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/nitv-news/article/2017/03/10/new-leadership-needed-wa-reduce-incarceration-build-schools-prisons-and-transform/|website = SBS|date=10 March 2017|publisher=[[SBS Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgatos identified, "In Western Australia, more than 90 per cent of inmates have not completed a Year 12 education; more than 60 per cent have not completed Year 10; and more than 40 per cent have not completed Year 9. One in six of the state’s Aboriginal people have been to prison."

"In Western Australia, the rate of imprisonment of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children is 50 per cent higher than the imprisonment rate of black children in the US. Australia incarcerates Aboriginal juveniles at 37 per 10,000, whereas the United States is at 52 per 10,000, according to the US Justice Department. However, Western Australia incarcerates Aboriginal children at 78 per 10,000."

The '''Old Acropolis Museum''' ({{lang-el|(Παλαιό) Μουσείο Ακρόπολης}} ''(Palaio) Mouseio Akropolis'') was an archaeological museum located in [[Athens]], [[Greece]] on the archeological site of [[Acropolis]].  It is built in a niche at the eastern edge of the rock and most of it lies beneath the level of the hilltop, making it largely invisible.  It was considered one of the major archaeological museums in Athens. Due to its limited size, the [[Politics of Greece|Greek government]] decided in the late 1980s to build a new museum. The [[New Acropolis Museum]] is now built at the foot of the [[Acropolis]]. In June 2007 the old museum closed its doors so that its antiquities could be moved to their new home, which opened on 20 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacropolismuseum.gr/eng/ New Acropolis Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The museum was home to many of the Greek world's ancient relics found in and around the [[Acropolis of Athens]] since excavations started.
It was designed by architect [[Panagis Kalkos]] and was constructed between 1865 and 1874. It was expanded in the 1950s to a modern design executed by [[Patroklos Karantinos]], a Greek modernist architect.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Acropolis Museum''': A Descriptive Catalogue Brouskari M.S.(1974) Commercial Bank of Greece&lt;/ref&gt;

The Acropolis Museum housed stone [[sculptures]] and [[bronze]] remains&lt;ref&gt;The Bronze Fragments of the Acropolis 
Bather A.G. The Journal of Hellenic Studies (13), 1892 - 1893, pp. 124-130&lt;/ref&gt; from the monuments of the Acropolis and some artifacts that are excavated on the site. The building is located in the south-east corner of the Acropolis. In 1974 prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] proposed the construction of a new museum.  Initial plans were made under [[Melina Mercouri]] and the ground of the Makrygianni former military hospital and [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] barracks was chosen. The first competition was criticized and a new competition proclaimed some years later. In 2007 the old building was closed to prepare the move to the new building.

===The new building===
{{main|New Acropolis Museum}}

A [[New Acropolis Museum|new building]] was designed by [[Bernard Tschumi]] and Michali Fotiades, and constructed from 2002-2007 on Areopagitou Street. It was inaugurated on Saturday, June 20, 2009, and the entrance fee was 1 euro for the first year, and 5 euros thereafter.

===Damage to the Acropolis===

Drainage pipes from the Old Acropolis Museum have been attributed for causing much of the decay of the Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/story/1346289/greek-tragedy-acropolis-is-decaying Greek Tragedy: Acropolis Is 'Decaying']&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum housed artifacts that were found on the site of the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. They derive mainly from the [[Parthenon]], the [[Propylaea]], the [[Erechtheum]], the [[Temple of Athena Nike]],  the [[Eleusinion]], the [[Brauroneion|Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia]], the [[Chalkotheke]], the [[Pandroseion]], the [[Old Temple of Athena]], the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]], the sanctuary of [[Asclepius]] or [[Asclepieion]], the Temple and [[Theatre of Dionysus]] Eleutheureus, and the [[Odeon of Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 Hellenic Ministry of Culture | Acropolis of Athens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">A '''Publicly Available Specification''' or '''PAS''' is a standardization document that closely resembles a formal standard in structure and format but which has a different development model.&lt;ref name="Principles of PAS Standardization"&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of PAS Standardization|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/standards/bs0-pas0/BSI-PAS0-Principles-of-PAS-UK-EN.pdf|website=www.bsigroup.com|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of a Publicly Available Specification is to speed up standardization. PASs are often produced in response to an urgent market need.&lt;ref name=IEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Publicly Available Specifications|url=http://www.iec.ch/standardsdev/publications/pas.htm|website=www.iec.ch|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[BSI Group]] develops PASs in the UK,&lt;ref name="Principles of PAS Standardization" /&gt; while the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] develops international PASs in the arena of electrical, electronic and related technologies,&lt;ref name=IEC /&gt; and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] develops international ISO PASs.&lt;ref name="ISO Deliverables"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO Deliverables|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/deliverables-all.htm?type=pas|website=www.iso.org|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
BSI Group pioneered the PAS format. Under the BSI model, any organization, association or group who wish to document standardized best practice on a specific subject, can commission a PAS, subject to the [[BSI Group|BSI]] acceptance process.A [[British Standard]] and a PAS must reach full consensus between all stakeholders on technical content. The timescale for the development of a PAS can be shorter, typically around 8 months, and is why it is sometimes referred to as a 'fast-track standard'.&lt;ref name="Develop your own fast-track standard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Develop your own fast-track standard|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/our-services/developing-new-standards/developing-a-pas/|website=www.bsigroup.com|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a PAS cannot conflict with, or contradict, existing or draft work within the formal standards arena and must complement, not conflict with, any legislation in the subject area.  It is also written in accordance with BS drafting rules, which means that the content must be technically robust and cannot be technically constrained (i.e. it cannot include patented or proprietary methods or products).  It is written unambiguously and with objectively verifiable requirements or recommendations.&lt;ref name="Principles of PAS Standardization" /&gt;

==Origin of term "PAS"==

[[File:PAS 003 Photo of Forward.jpg|100px|thumbnail|left]]
According to a BSI document [http://www.bsigroup.com/Documents/standards/bs0-pas0/BSI-PAS0-Principles-of-PAS-UK-EN.pdf "Principles of PAS standardization"] 
''"The term PAS was originally an acronym derived from "publicly available specification".  However, not all PAS documents are structured as specifications and the term is now sufficiently well established not to require any further amplification."''  
However, early examples of PAS were actually titled "Product Approval Specification" as illustrated in the accompanying photograph showing part of PAS 003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99207">The '''replacing of loanwords in Turkish''' is part of a policy of [[Turkification]] dating back to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Contemporary [[Turkish language|Turkish]] includes [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] [[loanword]]s—mostly of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[French language|French]], but also [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Italian language|Italian]] origin—which were officially replaced with their [[Turkish language|Turkish]] counterparts suggested by the [[Turkish Language Association]] ({{lang-tr|Türk Dil Kurumu}}, TDK) as a part of the cultural reforms—in the broader framework of [[Atatürk's Reforms]]—following the foundation of [[Republic of Turkey]].

The TDK, established by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] in 1932 in order to conduct research on the Turkish language, also undertook the initiative to replace only Arabic loanwords with their Turkish counterparts. The Association succeeded in removing several hundred Arabic words from the language. While most of the words introduced into the language in this process were newly derived from existing Turkish verbal roots, TDK also suggested using old Turkish words which had not been used in the language for centuries; like ''yanıt'', ''birey'', ''gözgü''. Some words were used before language reform too but they were used much less than the Persian ones. Some words were taken from rural areas but most of them had different meanings, like ''ürün''. Mongolian also played an important role too, because Mongolian preserved the old Turkic borrowings, such as ''ulus'' and ''çağ''. 

There are generational differences in vocabulary preference.   While those born before the 1940s tend to use the old Arabic-origin words (even the obsolete ones), younger generations commonly use the newer expressions. Some new words have not been widely adopted, in part because they failed to convey the intrinsic meanings of their old equivalents. Many new words have taken up somewhat different meanings, and cannot necessarily be used interchangeably with their old counterpart.
[[File:TurkishVocabulary.png|thumb|right|200px|Origin of the words in Turkish vocabulary, which contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin]]

Many of the loanwords (especially the Arabic, Persian and French ones) are still widely used today, though decreasing in tendency.

==Connotations and implications of word choice==

Historically, Arabic was the language of the mosque and Persian was the language of education. Its deliberate usage (eschewing the usage of a "western" word) often implies romanticism or a religious subtext, respectively. Similarly, the use of European words may be favored to impart a perceived "modern" character. The use of "pure Turkic" words may be employed as an expression of nationalism or as a linguistic "simplification".

==Origin of the words in Turkish vocabulary==
The 2005 edition of ''{{lang|tr|Güncel Türkçe Sözlük}}'', the official dictionary of the Turkish language published by [[Turkish Language Association]], contains 104,481 words, of which about 86% are Turkish and 14% are of foreign origin.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFB40CE59E171C629F |title=Güncel Türkçe Sözlük |accessdate=2007-03-21 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]] |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321023726/http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EFB40CE59E171C629F |archivedate=2007-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most significant foreign contributors to Turkish vocabulary are [[Persian language|Persian]], [[French language|French]],
[[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref name="Loanwords"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF1A46C5FBFA979D0C |title=Türkçe Sözlük (2005)’teki Sözlerin Kökenlerine Ait Sayısal Döküm |trans-title=Numerical list on the origin of words in ''Türkçe Sözlük (2005)'' |accessdate=2007-03-21 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Turkish Language Association]] |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301064559/http://www.tdk.gov.tr/TR/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFAAF6AA849816B2EF1A46C5FBFA979D0C |archivedate=2007-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word derivations==
Most of the new Turkish words are derived from other words with thematic suffixes. For example:

''{{lang|tr|bat-}}'' is the root of the verb ''{{lang|tr|batmak}}'', which means "to sink" or "to set". The derived word ''{{lang|tr|batı}}'' means "west" or the cardinal direction in which the sun "sinks". Another example would be ''{{lang|tr|aylık}}'', which means "salary" as well as ''{{lang|tr|monthly}}''. This is derived from the word ''{{lang|tr|ay}}'', which means "moon, month".

===Loanwords of French origin===
The French words started to infiltrate the Turkish language in the 1800s, when the administrative reforms (''[[Tanzimat]]'') started taking place in the Ottoman Empire. The extent of French influence was so much that the number of French loanwords was close to 5,000.

Most of the French loanwords are still widely used in today's Turkish.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Words that are still used in modern Turkish together with their new Turkish counterparts.

===Loanwords of Persian origin===
The list gives the Ottoman Turkish word, the modern spelling of the word in Turkish (as suggested by TDK), the modern Turkish equivalent, and its meaning in English.

Most of the original Persian words are still widely used in modern Turkish. In fact, there are over 1,500 Persian words in Turkish. However, for many of the Persian words (unlike Arabic words{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}), there is no TDK-prescribed equivalent. TDK did not put as much effort into replacing Persian words as it did for Arabic words{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, largely because the Persian words were better assimilated into the language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Arabic language and culture is general perceived by Turks to be more "foreign" than Persian language and culture, which had a native presence in [[Anatolia]] since the time of the [[Achaemenids]], and was patronised for millennia afterwards by other dynasties with a presence in Anatolia such as the [[Sasanians]], [[Seleucids]], [[Seljuks]], [[Sultanate of Rum]], and lastly, the Ottomans, amongst others.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; New words that are not as frequently used as the old words.

'''SWORD''' (Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) is an [[interoperability]] standard that allows [[Repository (publishing)|digital repositories]] to accept the deposit of content from multiple sources in different formats (such as [[XML document]]s) via a [[Technical standard|standardized]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]].  In the same way that the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP protocol]] allows any [[web browser]] to talk to any [[web server]], so SWORD allows [[Client (computing)|clients]] to talk to repository [[Server (computing)|servers]].  SWORD is a profile (specialism) of the [[Atom Publishing Protocol]], but restricts itself solely to the scope of depositing resources into scholarly systems.

== History ==
The first version of the SWORD [[Communications protocol|protocol]] was created in 2007 by a consortium of UK [[institutional repository]] experts.  The project to develop SWORD was funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee|JISC]] and managed by [[UKOLN]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/SWORD_Project&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of the initial development of SWORD is given in "SWORD: Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit."&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation
  |author1=Julie Allinson |author2=Sebastien François |author3=Stuart Lewis | title = SWORD: Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit
  | publisher = Ariadne
  | date =  2008-01-30
  | url = http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue54/allinson-et-al/
  | accessdate = 2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard grew out of a need for an [[interoperability|interoperable]] method by which resources could be deposited into repositories.  Interoperable standards existed to allow the harvesting of content (e.g. [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]]) or for searching (e.g. [[OpenSearch]]) but not for deposit.

Between the original release in 2007, two subsequent projects were undertaken until 2009 to further refine the version 1.0 specification and perform advocacy work.  The resulting release was numbered 1.3.&lt;ref&gt;http://swordapp.org/docs/sword-profile-1.3.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Further descriptions of the work is available in Lewis et al., "If SWORD is the answer, what is the question? Use of the Simple Web service Offering Repository Deposit protocol."&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation
  |author1=Stuart Lewis |author2=Leonie Hayes |author3=Vanessa Newton-Wade |author4=Antony Corfield |author5=Richard Davis |author6=Tim Donohue |author7=Scott Wilson | title = If SWORD is the answer, what is the question? Use of the Simple Web service Offering Repository Deposit protocol
  | publisher = 'Program' Emerald
  | year =  2009
  | hdl = 2292/5315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a new project began to extend the "fire and forget" approach of the SWORD 1.x specification into a full [[CRUD]] (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) interface, and the result was a new version (designated 2.0).&lt;ref&gt;https://swordapp.github.com/SWORDv2-Profile/SWORDProfile.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed by extensive development work on client environments in several programming languages, and incorporation into the development of several [[Joint Information Systems Committee|Jisc]]-funded efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://swordapp.org/2012/08/extending-dmponline-with-swordv2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dataflow.ox.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use cases ==
Many different use cases exist&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation
  |author1=Stuart Lewis |author2=Pablo de Castro |author3=Richard jones | title = SWORD: Facilitating Deposit Scenarios

  | year =  2012
  | doi=10.1045/january2012-lewis | volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it may be desirable to remotely deposit resources into scholarly systems.  These include:

* Deposit to multiple repositories at once.
* Deposit from a desktop client (rather from within the repository system itself)
* Deposit by third party systems (for example by [[Laboratory automation|automated laboratory equipment]])
* Repository to repository deposit

== Implementations ==
Three categories of implementation exist: repository implementations for existing repository [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Client (computing)|client]] implementations that can be used to perform SWORD deposits, and code libraries to assist in the creation of new SWORD clients or servers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1834">The term '''Safe Work Procedure''' (SWP) originated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], and is predominantly used as a [[risk management]] tool by industries throughout Australia, particularly in the [[mining]] sector. SWPs are also referred to using other terms, such as [[Standard Operating Procedure]] (SOPre) (SOP). A Safe Work Procedure is a step by step description of a process when deviation may cause a loss. This risk control document created by teams within the company describes the safest and most efficient way to perform a task. This document stays in the Health &amp; Safety system for regular use as a template or guide when completing that particular task on site.

==Requirements of Safe Work ==

The document generally lists the associated hazards involved in performing a task, what risk score is associated with the hazards (using a [[risk matrix]]), what personal protective equipment is required, and the steps involved to complete the activity without incident.

The document is split up to meet the above requirements as follows;
*[[Procedure (term)|Step]]
*[[Hazard]]s
*[[Inherent risk]]
*[[Control measure]]s
*[[Residual risk]]

Each person involved in that task on site must ensure all sections of the SWP are followed.

Safe Work Procedures are also required for machinery and equipment that is used to perform commercial activities. The procedures are required to be enforced within the workplace and improved as conditions or equipment changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6431">{{about||the [[Jew]]ish wife of the Khazar ruler [[Bulan (Khazar)|Sabriel]]|Serach (Khazar)|the type of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[cartouche]]|Serekh|other meanings|Serach (disambiguation)}}
{{Religious text primary|date=August 2011}}
'''Serach bat Asher''' was, in the [[Tanakh]], a daughter of [[Asher]], the son of [[Jacob]]. She is one of the seventy members of the patriarch's family who emigrated from Canaan to Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] xlvi. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and her name occurs in connection with the census taken by Moses in the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] xxvi. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She is mentioned also among the descendants of Asher in [[I Chronicles]] vii. 30. The fact of her being the only one of her sex to be mentioned in the genealogical lists seemed to the [[Rabbi]]s to indicate that there was something extraordinary in connection with her history; and she became the heroine of several legends.

==In the Torah==

There are two mentions of '''Serah''' in the [[Torah]].  The first is in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], 46:17, in a passage that begins “These are the names of the Israelites, [[Jacob]] and his descendants, who came to [[Egypt]],” and continues to mention all of Jacob’s sons, his daughter [[Dinah]], his grandsons, and one granddaughter—Serach.  The passage reads “The sons of [[Asher]]: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beri’ah, with Serach their sister.”  This sentence is repeated later in the Hebrew Bible in [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], 1 Chronicles 7:30.  One would suppose that, since the Torah mentions 53 grandsons and only one granddaughter, she was a person of significance.

The second time Serach is mentioned is in the [[Book of Numbers]], 26:46, in the listing of Israelites who escaped from  Egypt, where it simply says “And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serach.”  Since Serach is mentioned both as Jacob’s granddaughter and also as one of the people who escaped from Egypt 210 years later, Serach is often referred to as the oldest woman in the Torah.

==In Sefer HaYashar==
According to The Book of Jasher, Asher married Adon bat Aflal ben Hadad ben Ishmael.  She died before bearing children.  

Asher then married Hadurah bat Abimael ben Heber ben Shem, the widow of Malkiel ben Elam ben Shem.  Hadurah bore one daughter to Malkiel, whom he named Serach.  After Malkiel died, mother and daughter returned to the house of Abimael.  Upon Asher's marriage to Hadurah, he adopted Serach and brought them to Canaan to live in the house of Jacob.  This text praises Serach for her beauty and intellect, and notes she was raised as an Israelite.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer HaYashar Chapter 45, verses 12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==In tradition==

A number of [[midrashim]] have been written about Serach.
According to one midrash, Serach was not Asher's daughter, but his stepdaughter. She was three years old when Asher married her mother, and she was brought up in the house of Jacob, whose affection she won by her remarkable piety and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;''Midrash Abot,'' p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known of the midrashim about her tells of how she was the first to inform Jacob that his son Joseph was still alive. Fearing that the news would be too much of a shock for the old man, however, she informs Jacob while he is praying, and sings in rhyme that Joseph is “alive and living in Egypt, and has two sons, Menassah and Ephraim.” (Egypt in Hebrew is Mitzrayim, which rhymes with Ephraim.) In return, Jacob blesses her, saying “May you live forever and never die.” According to this midrash, Serach was eventually permitted to [[Entering Heaven alive|enter Heaven alive]], something achieved only by [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and [[Elijah]] and a [[entering Heaven alive|scant few others]].&lt;ref&gt;ib.&lt;/ref&gt; When Moses appeared to the Elders of Israel, they went to Serach to confirm that he was truly the redeemer. She recognized him by the code phrase "God has surely remembered" (Exodus 3:16 and 4:31) that had been passed down, according to the Midrash, from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob and to his sons. These are the same words that Joseph speaks on his deathbed  (Genesis 50:24)

Joseph makes his brothers swear that they will bring his bones from Egypt to be buried in the land of Canaan (Genesis 50:25). The Midrash relates that Moses addressed himself to Serach when he wished to learn where the remains of Joseph were to be buried. Without Joseph's bones, the Israelites could not leave Egypt, so the Pharaoh had Egyptians put him in a lead coffin and throw it into the Nile. Only Serach remembered where to find Joseph's bones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sotah]] 13a; [[Deuteronomy Rabba]] xi.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Midrash,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ecclesiastes Rabba]] vii. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Serach was "[[Wise woman of Abel|the wise woman]]" who caused the death of [[Sheba son of Bichri|Sheba ben Bichri]].&lt;ref&gt;[[II Samuel]] xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another story in the Talmud relates that Rabbi Yochanan was discussing the parting of the Red Sea and wondered what the walls of water looked like. At that moment, Serach bat Asher peered into the window of the study hall and attested, "I was there. They were like lighted windows." According to another legend, Serah lived until the tribe of Asher was exiled by [[Shalmaneser V]], went with them into exile, and died there, nearly 1,000 years old. According to the legend, her grave is located in [[Pir Bakran]], a small town about 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Isfahan]]. The site consists of a small synagogue and a huge cemetery which is probably 2,000 years old.

Some consider her the guardian of Israel’s communal memory.

==Cultural associations==
* Edward Einhorn's absurdist comedy ''The Living Methuselah'', appearing in his book of plays entitled ''[http://www.untitledtheater.com/GMS.htm The Golem, Methuselah, and Shylock]'', gives another perspective on both Serach and [[Methuselah]].  In it, Methuselah and Serach have lived to modern day, through all the major disasters of human history.

"The workmen....looked as though they hated us."&lt;ref&gt;The words of the Tsar's sister [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia]], who was present at the opening of the 1st State Duma in 1906.

[[Image:StG'sLocationplan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Location of st George's Hall and the Apollo Room within the palace.]]
'''St George's Hall''' (also referred to as the Great Throne Room) is one of the largest state rooms in the [[Winter Palace]], [[St Petersburg]]. It is located on the eastern side of the palace, and connected to [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]] by the smaller '''Apollo Room'''.

The colourful, [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] interior design of this great hall, executed by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]] between 1787 and 1795, was lost in the fire of 1837 which gutted much of the palace's interior. Following the fire, Russian architect [[Vasily Stasov]] was commissioned to oversee the restoration and rebuilding of the palace. While he retained the architectural features dictated by the exterior of the palace, he completely redesigned the interior in a more simple classical style. He replaced the columns of [[polychrome]] marble with those of white cararra marble. The original painted ceilings, depicting allegorical scenes, had been entirely lost in the fire, allowing Stasov to introduce a plain ceiling with gilded embellishments.

St George's Hall,  which served as the palace's principal [[throne room]], was the scene of many of the most formal ceremonies of the Imperial court. Most historically, it was the setting of the opening of the First [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|State Duma]] by [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], in 1906. The Tsar was forced to agree to the establishment of a [[Duma]] as a concession to his people in an attempt to avert revolution. However, the Imperial family saw it as "the end of Russian autocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first time that ordinary Russians had been admitted to the palace in any number—a [[Surrealism|surreal]] experience for both the peasants and the Imperial family. The Tsar's sister, who stood with the Imperial family on the steps of the throne, recalled of the masses of ordinary Russians who packed the hall: "I went with [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|my mother]] to the first Duma. I remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people. The peasants looked sullen. But the workmen were worse: they looked as though they hated us. I remember the distress in [[Alix of Hesse|Alicky's]] eyes."&lt;ref&gt;Vorres, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; Minister of the Court Count [[Vladimir Frederiks]] commented, "The Deputies, they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats.  I will never again set foot among those people."&lt;ref name="massie242"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; The Dowager Empress noticed "incomprehensible hatred."&lt;ref name=massie242/&gt;

Located behind the throne is the small Apollo Room. This anteroom is in fact the upper floor of a bridge linking the palace to the Hermitage.  This room has a [[Caisson (western architecture)|caisson]] ceiling adorned with stucco work.

Today, as part of the [[State Hermitage Museum]], this room retains the decorative scheme created by Stasov.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25304">[[Image:Starkad.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Starkad as illustrated on [[Carta Marina]] (1539) by [[Olaus Magnus]].]]
'''''Starkad''''' ([[Old Norse]]: '''''Starkaðr''''' or '''''Störkuðr''''';&lt;ref name=nordisk&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfcf/0547.html The article ''Starkad'' in ''Nordisk familjebok'' (1909).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]]: '''''Starcaterus'''''; in the [[Late Middle Ages]] also '''''Starkodder'''''; [[Danish language|modern Danish]]: '''''Stærkodder''''')&lt;ref name=national&gt;The article ''Starkad'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a legendary hero in [[Norse mythology]].

Starkad appears in numerous accounts, and the stories of his adventures relate to different Scandinavian traditions.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt; He is most fully treated in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' but he also appears in [[Iceland]]ic sources.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt; He is portrayed as a great warrior who performed many heroic deeds but also many crimes.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;

A cognate of the Starkad legends can be found in the [[Anglo-Saxon literature|Anglo-Saxon poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]''.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skånes"&gt;Andersson, Ingvar. (1947). ''Skånes historia: till Saxo och Skånelagen''. Norstedts, Stockholm. p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Beowulf''==
In ''[[Beowulf]]'', the feud between the [[Daner|Danes]] and the [[Heaðobard]]s was to be ended with the marriage of [[Ingeld]], the son of the fallen Heaðobard king [[Froda]], and [[Freawaru]], the daughter of the Danish king [[Hroðgar]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt; During the wedding an unnamed old warrior reminded the Heaðobards of their defeat and encouraged them to revenge.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skånes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lines 2042-2067.&lt;/ref&gt; That is the origin of Starkad's admonishing speech to the Danish king Ingellus, son of [[Frotho IV|Frotho]]&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skånes"/&gt; (see the account given in ''Gesta Danorum'' below). [[Sophus Bugge]] derived the name ''Starkaðr'' from originally meaning "the strong Heaðobard".&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt; Modern research is more reluctant, however, as the Gothic root ''stark-'' ('strong') might be connected with several possible suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicoletta Francovic Onesti, [https://books.google.nl/books?id=C-kSKn9XWjQC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Starkaðr 'Interaction of Germanic Personal Names with Latin Onomastics in the Late-Roman West'], in: Michael Borgolte et al. (eds.), ''Europa im Geflecht der Welt: Mittelalterliche Migrationen in globalen Bezügen'', p. 55-73, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hervarar saga''==
A version of the legend of Starkad can be found in the prologue of the U-version of ''[[Hervarar saga]]'', and in a shortened form in the H-version of the [[Hauksbók]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/oldheathen/029.php See Tunstall's comments on his translation of the ''Hervarar saga'' at Northvegr.].&lt;/ref&gt;

In this version a Starkad Ala-Warrior lived in northern Norway at the waterfalls of Alufoss. He descended from the giants known as the ''þursar'' ([[Jötunn|jotuns]]), and his father's name was Storkvid. Starkad was very much a jotun himself and had eight arms, but he was betrothed to a girl named Ogn Elf-burst. One day, when Starkad had gone north across the [[Élivágar]], another giant named Hergrim kidnapped Ogn. Starkad challenged Hergrim to a [[holmgang]], a duel. Starkad used four swords at the same time and slew Hergrim. Ogn did not wish to be Starkad's wife and committed suicide by stabbing herself with a sword. Starkad contented himself by taking everything Hergrim owned, including his son Grimr.

Álfhildr was the daughter of king [[Álfr]] of [[Álfheim]] (modern [[Bohuslän]]) and like the people of Álfheim, she was very beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;The beauty of her people is explained in ''[[Þorsteins saga Víkingssonar]]'' as due to the fact that her people were related to the [[Elf|elves]].&lt;/ref&gt; One autumn, king Álfr performed the [[Dísablót]], a sacrifice to the goddesses, and Álfhildr took part in it. As she was reddening the [[horgr]] (altar) with blood, Starkad kidnapped her. King Álfr called on the god [[Thor]] to help him rescue his daughter. Thor granted his wish by killing Starkad and rescuing the girl.

== ''Gautreks saga'' ==
[[Image:Virtues of the Hero Starkater - Olaus Magnus 1555.jpg|thumb|right|The hero Starkad, from Olaus Magnus' ''[[Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus]]'' (1555).]]
''[[Gautreks saga]]'' continues the account found in ''Hervarar saga''.  It is tells among other things the adventures of Starkad, the son of Stórvirkr who was the son of Starkad Ala-warrior, whom [[Thor]] had killed. 

It tells that young Starkad was raised at the court of Harald, the king of [[Agder]], together with Harald's son [[Vikar]]. One day, Herþjófr,&lt;ref&gt;Herþjófr was the son of Hunþjófr, the son of Friðþjófr the Bold, the protagonist of ''[[Fridthjófs saga ins frækna]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the king of [[Hordaland]], made a raid and killed king Harald. He also took Vikar hostage to ensure the loyalty of the people of Agder.  When Vikar had grown up, he assembled a warband, including Starkad and avenged his father by killing Herþjófr with thirty of his warriors. Vikar was then king of Agder, [[Hordaland]], and [[Hardanger]].

Starkad took part in Víkar's many battles for the hegemony of the petty kingdoms of southern Norway, one of the battles where [[Battle at Lake Vænir]] and he was Víkar's greatest warrior.

After all these victories, when sailing north from Agdir to Hördaland with a large army, Víkar was becalmed. Divination showed [[Odin]] required a sacrifice of one person chosen by lot and Víkar's lot came up each time. The decision was put off till the next day. Then Grani Horsehair, Starkad's foster father, took Starkad to a secret council of the gods and revealed himself to be [[Odin]]. Odin bestowed on Starkad the blessings of living three lifetimes, of possessing the most excellent of weapons, an abundance of riches, victory in battle, the gift of poetry and always to be held in the highest esteem among the rich and powerful. [[Thor]], however, who hated Starkad because of his jotun origin, denied Starkad the blessing of having children and cursed him to commit a crime every lifetime he lived and never to possess real estate. Thor further cursed Starkad never to feel that he had enough property, always to receive dangerous wounds in battle, never to remember his [[skaldic poetry|skaldic poems]] and ever to be hated by commoners.  After blessings and curses laid on Starkad alternately by Odin and Thor, Odin asked Starkad to send him King Víkar in payment for Odin's blessings. Starkad agreed and Odin gave Starkad a spear which Odin promised would appear to be only a reed-stalk. So Vikar met his death.

After Vikar's death, Starkad fled to Sweden and the kings [[Alrek and Eirík]] at [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]]. Starkad served them first as a companion on their [[viking]] expeditions and then, after Alrek and Eirík had settled down, he went on further Viking expeditions alone.

==Skaldic poetry==
Starkad is said to have composed poems himself which appear in ''Gautrek's saga''. Thor's hate of Starkad because of his jotun origins is mentioned in ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'', where there is a ''[[lausavísa]]'' by [[Vetrliði Sumarliðason]] praising [[Thor]] for having killed [[Jötunn|giants]] and giantesses, and for having defeated Starkad:
{|

|
:Thou didst break the leg of [[Leikn]],

|
|}
However, it could also be a reference to Starkad's grandfather, Starkad Ala-Warrior, whom Thor killed for having kidnapped Álfhildr, the princess of Alfheim.

==''Ynglinga saga''==
In the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', [[Snorri Sturluson]] tells what happened a few generations after the deaths of Alrek and Eirík.

The Swedish king [[Aun]] was not a warlike king and had been chased away from his kingdom by [[Halfdan]]. When Halfdan had died, Aun returned to [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] to rule his old kingdom. After having sacrificed one of his sons to Odin, the god let him live for another sixty years. However, when twenty-five years had passed, a Danish prince named [[Áli the Bold]] appeared and chased Aun to exile in [[Götaland]]. Áli ruled for twenty-five years until Starkad appeared and killed him. Then Aun could return to his kingdom and ruled it for another period of twenty-five years.

==''Sögubrot''==
[[Image:War Between Swedes and Danes - Olaus Magnus 1555.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Starkad leads [[Geats]] (the banner with a lion) and [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] (the banner with three crowns) in battle against the Danes, from Olaus Magnus' ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (1555).]]
The ''[[Sögubrot]]'' deals with events taking place in the 8th century, a long time after Starkad killed [[Áli the Bold]]. 

When the Swedish king [[Sigurd Hring]] prepared for the [[Battle of the Brávellir]] against the Danish [[Harald Wartooth]], a much later king Áli the Bold appeared with seven other kings to help him in the battle. These kings were accompanied by a great many champions, and among them Starkad the Old, the son of Stórverkr. Starkad would later compose a poem about this battle that would serve as a source for the sagas.

When the battle had begun, a formidable champion named [[Ubbi of Friesland]] charged against Ragnvald the Good Councilor the foremost champion in the wedge formation of king Sigurd. After a fierce fight, Ragnvald died and Ubbi pushed on killing champion after champion.

When king Sigurd Hring saw this he encouraged his warriors and said that it was not possible that no one could defeat Ubbi. He then asked "where is Starkad?". The old warrior answered "it is difficult to win sire. However, I will do my best and do what I can, but Ubbi is a tough fighter". Starkad engaged with Ubbi and a fight began that was long and the most fierce of the entire battle. Eventually, Starkad gave Ubbi a single wound, but Starkad had received six big ones, and thought that no one had been closer to kill him before. The two champions were separated by the pushing throng of warriors, and Ubbi finally fell riddled with arrows from the archers of [[Telemark]].

The [[shieldmaiden]] Vebiorg took on the Swedish army. First she killed the champion Söti, but then Starkad attacked her. After giving Vebiorg a number of slashes, she cut his mouth so that his chin fell. Starkad had to bite his beard to keep his chin in place. She was killed by Thorkil the Bold.

Biting his beard and ignoring his wounds, Starkad charged the Danish army, killing man after man, until he met the shieldmaiden Ursina who carried the banner of king Harald Wartooth. She told him that he had met his last opponent, but he cut off the hand that held the banner and killed her. Starkad continued killing warrior after warrior, until he finally was so severely wounded that he had a large gash on his neck and a large gash on his chest that made his two lungs hang out. On his right hand, he had lost a finger.

The battle ended with Swedish victory.

==''Norna-Gests þáttr''==
In ''[[Norna-Gests þáttr]]'', the account of Starkad takes place not long after the victory at the [[Battle of the Brávellir]]. The account deals with a meeting between Starkad and the hero [[Sigurd]] Dragonslayer. The old Norna-Gest told that during the time when he was with Sigurd Dragonslayer, the Swedish king [[Sigurd Hring]] demanded tribute from Sigurd and his people. When Sigurd refused, the king of Sweden sent an army to subdue him, led by the sons of Gandalf.

In the Swedish army, there was a man who was even bigger and stronger than the sons of Gandalf. The giant man killed both men and horses and nothing could defeat him. Sigurd and Gest approached the huge warrior and asked who he was. He answered that he was Starkad the son of Stórvirkr.

When Starkad learnt that Sigurd was the same Sigurd who had killed the dragon [[Fafnir]], he tried to escape. However, Sigurd went after him and dealt a blow with his sword Gramr that ripped two teeth off Starkad's mouth. Sigurd then asked Starkad to go home. When Starkad had left the battle, the sons of Gandalf retired as well, and so Sigurd had won the battle against the Swedes.

==''Gesta Danorum''==
[[Image:Achievement of Starkater - Olaus Magnus 1555.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Starkad in battle, from Olaus Magnus' ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (1555).]]
It is in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' that the most comprehensive treatment of Starkad is found. The Danish chronicler [[Saxo Grammaticus]] wrote that Starkad was the son of Stórvirkr (Storwerk/Storuerkus) and saved himself from a [[shipwreck]]. He entered the service of the Danish king [[Frotho IV|Frotho]] and was given a ship so that he could patrol the shores. 

No man was Starkad's equal as he was endowed with a superhuman size and a noble disposition. Saxo Grammaticus gives two accounts of Starkad's origin. According to one, he was born in the land of [[Estonians]] east of the [[Baltic sea]]. According to the second, which the chronicler considers fantastic and unlikely, Starkad was born of jotuns, and he had formerly many arms until [[Thor]] cut off all arms but two. [[Odin]] had bestowed on Starkad the curse and the blessing that he would live the lives of three men, and commit three evil deeds.

His first evil deed was the murder of the Norwegian petty king [[Vikar]] (Wicarus). Starkad had joined a [[Viking]] expedition with Vikar, but they found themselves stopped by a strong wind. They then had the idea that they could appease the gods by performing a [[blót]] with human blood, and decided to cast lots as to whom was to be sacrificed. Starkad made a noose of [[willow]] and put it around the king's neck in the pretense that it was only for show and not for killing. However, the knot was so strong that the king was dying, and Starkad gave him the coup de grace with his sword. Others say that the noose of willow suddenly became so strong that the king was strangled.

Starkad joined the Danish Viking Bemon (Bemonus) and they had a tough discipline on their crew, forbidding them alcoholic beverages. During an attack in [[Russia]], they discovered that the Russians had riddled the terrain with [[caltrop]]s to stop the Vikings. However, Starkad and his men donned [[Clog (shoe)|clog]]s and so won the battle. When Bemon was dead, Starkad entered the service of the [[Bjarmians]] and did many heroic deeds among them. 

Later, Starkad stayed for seven years in [[Sweden]] at [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]], with the [[Yngling|sons of Frey]]. However the effeminate jingle of bells, the dancing and the mimes at the sacrifices (see the [[Temple at Uppsala]]) nauseated Starkad.

He then enlisted with the Danish king [[Haki]] (Haco), and fought for him during the attack on king [[Hugleik]] (Hugletus) of [[Ireland]]. Hugleik wasted his riches on actors and jugglers, but was defended by [[Svipdag]] (Suibdagus) and [[Geigad]] (Gegathus), who gave Starkad the most vicious wound he had ever received. After winning the battle, Starkad had all the mimes and jugglers flogged, and all the riches looted.

Starkad was then sent with the Slavic prince Win (Winus) to quell a rebellion in the East. He fought against [[Curonians]], [[Sambians]], [[Semigallians]], until all the Easterlings had been defeated. By covering his sword with a hide, he also defeated a warlord named Wisin (Wisinnus), who lived at Anafial in Russia, and who could make a weapon blunt only by looking at it. He continued his victories by killing the jotun Tanna in [[Byzantium]] and the Polish champion Wasce/Wilzce. 

When the [[Saxons]] rebelled against Frotho, and challenged him to a duel against Hama, Starkad unexpectedly returned and took Frotho's place in the duel. Hama contemptuously brought Starkad to his knees with a blow by his fist, but Starkad rose up and cut Hama to death.
[[Image:Martial Exercises of Starkater - Olaus Magnus 1555.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Starkad meets Ingellus with a mistress, from Olaus Magnus' ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (1555).]]
After a while Frotho was killed through treachery by a Saxon named [[Swerting]] (Swertingus). Frotho's son [[Ingellus|Ingild]] (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting's daughters. This angered Starkad so much that he enlisted at the Swedish king [[Halfdan]]'s (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild's sister, was about to marry a lowly [[goldsmith]], Starkad appeared in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a slap on her face and lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan.

Ingild gave Helga to a Norwegian named Helgi (Helgo), on the condition that he fight nine brothers from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] who courted her, and among whom the eldest was named Angantyr (Angaterus). Helgi went to Sweden's most famous city [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] and asked Starkad to help him in the fight. Starkad agreed, but left Helgi with his bride in order to fight with the nine brothers himself at the moor of Roliung.  
[[Image:Defence of the oppressed - Olaus Magnus 1555.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Starkad leads those oppressed by the nine brothers, from Olaus Magnus' ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (1555).]]
Starkad killed the nine brothers but had received seventeen wounds himself, and was so seriously wounded that his guts hung out. He refused the care of three lowly passers-by, but accepted the treatment of a peasant's son, and could return to Sweden.

As Ingild continued his sinful life and did not do his duty to avenge his father, Starkad appeared during a banquet that Ingild had with the sons of Swerting, his father's slayer. Starkad strongly admonished Ingild and humiliated his queen who tried to calm Starkad with kindness and her costly ribbon. Starkad succeeded in exciting Ingild to kill Swerting's sons and to divorce his Saxon bride. 

During the [[Battle of the Brávellir]] between the Swedish king [[Sigurd Hring]] and [[Harald Wartooth]] (Haraldus Hyldetan), Starkad fought on the Swedish side. He received such a severe wound that his lung hung out, his skull was cleft and a finger was cut off. He had to leave the battle to tend to his wounds.

Starkad was accepted with honour in the warband of the Norwegian hero [[Ale the Strong|Olo]]. However, when Olo had succeeded in conquering [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], Starkad was convinced to join Lennius/Lenus/Lennus scheme to attack and kill Olo. However, Olo was hard to kill as his gaze scared everyone. It was not until Starkad managed to cover Olo's face that he could kill him. Starkad was rewarded with 120 pounds in gold, but regretted his crime, and avenged Olo's death by killing Lennius.
[[Image:Death of Starkater - Olaus Magnus 1555.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Starkad arranges his own demise, from Olaus Magnus' ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (1555).]]
When Starkad was so old that he wished to die and his eyesight was bad, he hung his gold around his neck and went out to wander. He killed a man who wanted one of his swords and some riders who were contracted to kill Starkad by Hather (Hatherus), Lennius' son.

In front of Hather, Starkad sung about his accomplishments, and as Hather's response showed Starkad that Hather was of noble birth, Starkad asked him to be his slayer. Starkad promised Hather all his gold and imperviousness, should Hather cut off his head and run between the head and the body as he fell. Hather cut off Starkad's head but avoided running, as he feared being crushed by Starkad's huge body. When the head had hit the ground, it bit a tussock of grass which showed how ferocious Starkad was.

Hather did not want the old warrior to lie unburied, but showed him respect by making a [[Tumulus|barrow]] for him on the heath of Roljung, at the same spot where Starkad's heavy body long ago had made an imprint on a stone.

==Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus==

Olaus Magnus' cites the story of Starkad from [[Gesta Danorum]]. He disputes Saxo about origin of the hero and informs that Starkad was from the nation of [[Tavastians]], 'Starchaterum Thauestum'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o9b5aGZH2noC&amp;pg=PT124&amp;lpg=PT124&amp;dq=Thauestum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l6HDaEwK5Q&amp;sig=E9Q_2-3DdfOjwY90YWshavrtkBA&amp;hl=fi&amp;ei=DGTFTqJcg9XhBL3s1JMN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Thauestum&amp;f=false#Olaus Magni Gothus, Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus. Epitome libri V. gap. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later traditions==
Later medieval traditions locate Starkad's death and the heath of Roljung to [[Skåne]]. According to the ''[[Annales Ryenses]]'' (late 13th century), it was still possible to see Starkad's sword in the water beneath the bridge of ''Boilyngh'' when the water was low.&lt;ref name="skånes historia"&gt;Andersson, Ingvar. (1947). ''Skånes historia: till Saxo och Skånelagen''. Norstedts, Stockholm. p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that ''Boilyngh'' is a misspelling of ''Roljung''.&lt;ref name="skånes historia"/&gt; Later this spot was located to [[Rönne river]], and in the 16th century, people talked of the ''Stones of Starkkarl'' at [[Vegeholm]].&lt;ref name="skånes historia"/&gt; The Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] and [[Arthur Stille]] recorded many recent traditions about Starkad in north-western Skåne.&lt;ref name="skånes historia"/&gt;

==Modern references==
The plot of the Science Fiction novel "Ensign Flandry" by the Danish American writer [[Poul Anderson]] takes place on a planet named "Starkad".

The [[Danish language|modern Danish]] name, ''Stærkodder'' has been used for a [[war ship]] in the [[Royal Danish Navy]].

Starkad (or "Starkadder") is the central figure in a trilogy of fantasy novels by the author Bernard King, which draw heavily from traditional Starkad stories and from other aspects of Norse myth and legend.  The trilogy comprises the novels "Starkadder" (1985), "Vargr-Moon" (1986), and "Death-Blinder" (1988).

Starkad, as Starkaðr the Mighty, is mentioned in the 2018 videogame ''[[God of War (2018 video game)|God of War]]'', as a late [[Jotunn]] enshrined by the [[Jotunn|Jotnar]] people, killed by [[Thor]].

[[File:Elizabeth of Romania pic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A royal portrait employing strong mythic overtones: [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth of Romania]], born a German princess, adopts the national costume of Romania, with distaff and spindle.]]
The theme of '''textiles in mythology and folklore''' is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art.  In traditional societies today, westward of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, [[weaving]] is a mystery within woman's sphere.  Where men have become the primary weavers in this part of the world, it is possible that they have usurped the archaic role:&lt;ref&gt;Kathy M'Closky, "Trading is a whiter man's game: the appropriation of women's weaving," in Sally Cole and Lynne Phillips, eds., ''Ethnographic Feminisms: Essays in Anthropology'' (Ottawa: Carleton University Press) 1996:97–118&lt;/ref&gt; among the gods, only goddesses are weavers. [[Herodotus]] noted, however, the cultural difference between gender identities and weaving among Hellenes and Egyptians: among Egyptians it was the men who wove.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 2.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaving begins with [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].  Until the [[spinning wheel]] was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with [[distaff]] and [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. In English the "distaff side"  indicates relatives through one's mother, and thereby denotes a woman's role in the household economy.  In Scandinavia, the stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion's belt]] are known as ''Friggjar rockr'', "Frigg’s distaff".

Textiles have also been associated in several cultures with [[Cultural depictions of spiders|spiders in mythology]].

The spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler's eighth-century BCE inscription at [[Karatepe]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the adjacent region of North [[Syria]], historian [[Robin Lane Fox]] remarks [[funerary]] [[stelae]] showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and noted in Fox, Robin Lane (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZFM-TUwFxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer]''. Vintage Books. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0-679-76386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
In pre-Dynastic Egypt, ''nt'' ([[Neith]]) was already the goddess of weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She protected the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she was known as the most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. Nit is identifiable by her emblems: most often it is the loom's shuttle, with its two recognizable hooks at each end, upon her head.  According to E. A. Wallis Budge (''The Gods of the Egyptians'') the root of the word for ''weaving'' and also for ''being'' are the same: ''nnt''.

==Greece==
In Greece the [[Moirai]] (the "Fates") are the three [[crone]]s who control [[destiny]], and the matter of it is the art of spinning the thread of life on the distaff.  [[Ariadne]], the wife of the god [[Dionysus]] in Minoan Crete,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} possessed the spun thread that led [[Theseus]] to the center of the [[labyrinth]] and safely out again.

Among the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]]s, the weaver goddess is [[Athena]], who, despite her role, was bested by her acolyte [[Arachne]], who was turned later into a weaving spider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Athena-Greek-mythology|title=Athena {{!}} Greek mythology|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daughters of Minyas, [[Alcithoe]], [[Leuconoe]] and their sister, defied [[Dionysus]] and honored Athena in their weaving instead of joining his festival. A woven [[peplos|peplum]], laid upon the knees of the goddess's iconic image, was central to festivals honoring both Athena at Athens, and [[Hera]].

In Homer's legend of the [[Odyssey]], [[Penelope]] the faithful wife of [[Odysseus]] was a weaver, weaving her design for a shroud by day, but unravelling it again at night, to keep her suitors from claiming her during the long years while Odysseus was away; Penelope's weaving is sometimes compared to that of the two weaving enchantresses in the ''Odyssey'', [[Circe]] and [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] is at her loom in the ''[[Iliad]]'' to illustrate her discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail.

[[Homer]] dwells upon the supernatural quality of the weaving in the robes of goddesses.

In Roman literature, [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (VI, 575–587) recounts the terrible tale of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]], who was raped and her tongue cut out so that she could not tell about her violation, her loom becomes her voice, and the story is told in the design, so that her sister [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Procne]] may understand and the women may take their revenge.  The understanding in the Philomela myth that pattern and design convey myth and ritual has been of great use to modern mythographers: [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] led the way, interpreting the more permanent patterns of vase-painting, since the patterned textiles had not survived.

==Germanic==
For the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] peoples, [[Frigg]] is a goddess associated with weaving. The Scandinavian "[[Darraðarljoð|Song of the Spear]]", quoted in "[[Njals Saga]]", gives a detailed description of [[Valkyrie]]s as women weaving on a loom, with severed heads for weights, arrows for shuttles, and human gut for the warp, singing an exultant song of carnage. Ritually deposited spindles and loom parts were deposited with the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] ritual wagon at Dejbjerg, Jutland,&lt;ref&gt;Found in the 1880s; noted by Grigsby, John (2005). ''Beowulf and Grendel: the Truth behind England's Oldest Myth''. Watkins. p. 57, 113f. {{ISBN|1-84293-153-9}}. See discussion of the ritual wagons in Danish bogs in Glob, Peter Vilhelm &amp; [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford|Bruce-Mitford, Rupert]] (transl.) (1988). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5e0tkA6gGT8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved]''. New York Review. pp. 166-71. {{ISBN|1-59017-090-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and are to be associated with the wagon-goddess.

In Germanic mythology, [[Holda]] (Frau Holle) and [[Perchta]] (Frau Perchta, Berchta, Bertha) were both known as goddesses who oversaw spinning and weaving. They had many names.

[[Holda]], whose patronage extends outward to control of the weather, and source of women's fertility, and the protector of unborn children, is the patron of spinners, rewarding the industrious and punishing the idle. Holda taught the secret of making [[linen]] from [[flax]]. An account of Holda was collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], as the [[fairy tale]] "[[Holda|Frau Holda]]". Another of the Grimm tales, "[[Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle]]", which embeds social conditioning in fairy tale with mythic resonances, rewards the industrious spinner with the fulfillment of her mantra:
:''"Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,''
:''and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray."''

::''"Spindel, Spindel, geh' du aus,''
::''bring den Freier in mein Haus.''"

This tale recounts how the magic spindle, flying out of the girl's hand, flew away, unravelling behind it a thread, which the prince followed, as [[Theseus]] followed the thread of [[Ariadne]], to find what he was seeking: a bride "who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest". He arrives to find her simple village cottage magnificently caparisoned by the magically-aided products of spindle, shuttle and needle.

[[Jacob Grimm]] reported the superstition "if, while riding a horse overland, a man should come upon a woman spinning, then that is a very bad sign; he should turn around and take another way." (''Deutsche Mythologie'' 1835, v3.135)

Also the [[Norns]], female giantesses, weavers of fate, belong in this folklore of weaving.

==Celts==

The goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]], due to her identification with the Roman [[Minerva]], may have also been considered, along with her other traits, to be a weaving deity.

==French==
Weavers had a repertory of tales: in the 15th century [[Jean d'Arras]], a Northern French storyteller (''[[trouvere]]''), assembled a collection of stories entitled ''Les Évangiles des Quenouilles'' ("Spinners' Tales"). Its [[frame story]] is that these are narrated among a group of ladies at their spinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDX2_0Qb03EC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=jean+d%2527arras+Les+%25C3%2589vangiles+des+Quenouilles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n65ZEKV55V&amp;sig=qhPVWJ1PRk29zltb8KGoqh7jdmY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_0vLPj7XPAhUGOj4KHRxSDDoQ6AEIXTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=jean%2520d'arras%2520Les%2520%25C3%2589vangiles%2520des%2520Quenouilles&amp;f=false|title=The Distaff Gospels: A First Modern English Edition of Les Évangiles des Quenouilles|last=Jeay|first=Madeleine|last2=Garay|first2=Kathleen|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551115603|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baltic==
In Baltic myth, [[Saulė|Saule]] is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous presence is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic connection between the sun and spinning is as old as spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.

==Finnish==
The Finnish epic, the ''[[Kalevala]]'', has many references to spinning and weaving goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kalevala|title=Kalevala {{!}} Finnish literature|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Eve spinning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eve spinning, from the [[Hunterian Psalter]], English, ca 1170]]

==Later European folklore==
"When Adam delved and Eve span..." runs the rhyme; though the tradition that [[Eve]] [[spinning (textiles)|span]] is unattested in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], it was deeply engrained in the medieval Christian vision of Eve. In an [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] from the 13th-century [[Hunterian Psalter]] (''illustration. left'') Eve is shown with distaff and spindle.

In later European folklore, weaving retained its connection with magic.  [[Mother Goose]], traditional teller of [[fairy tale]]s, is often associated with spinning.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, Maria (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTtMH_ezI4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales]''. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was known as "Goose-Footed Bertha" or ''Reine Pédauque'' ("Goose-footed Queen") in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.

The daughter who, her father claimed, could spin straw into gold and was forced to demonstrate her talent, aided by the dangerous earth-daemon [[Rumpelstiltskin]] was an old tale when the [[Brothers Grimm]] collected it.  Similarly, the unwilling spinner of the tale ''[[The Three Spinners]]'' is aided by three mysterious old women.  In ''[[The Six Swans]]'', the heroine spins and weaves [[starwort]] in order to free her brothers from a shapeshifting curse.  ''[[Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle]]'' are enchanted and bring the prince to marry the poor heroine.

[[File:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Lady of Shallott'' by [[William Holman Hunt]], painted from 1888 to 1902]]
In [[Alfred Tennyson]]'s poem "[[The Lady of Shalott]]", her woven representations of the world have protected and entrapped [[Elaine of Astolat]], whose first encounter with reality outside proves mortal. [[William Holman Hunt]]'s painting from the poem (''illustration, right'') contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth ("[[Hesperides]]") and Religion ("Prayer") echo the mirror's open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings "'Tirra lirra' by the river" as in Tennyson's poem.

A high-born woman sent as a hostage-wife to a foreign king was repeatedly given the epithet "weaver of peace", linking the woman's art and the familiar role of a woman as a dynastic pawn. A familiar occurrence of the phrase is in the early English poem ''[[Widsith]]'', who "had in the first instance gone with Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Anglen to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker..."

==Inca==
In [[Inca mythology]], [[Mama Ocllo]] first taught women the art of spinning thread.

==China==
{{See also|The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl}}

*In [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], the goddess weaver floated down on a shaft of moonlight with her two attendants.  She showed the upright court official ''Guo Han'' in his garden that a goddess's robe is seamless, for it is woven without the use of needle and thread, entirely on the loom. The phrase "a goddess's robe is seamless" passed into an idiom to express perfect workmanship.  This idiom is also used to mean a perfect, comprehensive plan.
*The Goddess Weaver, daughter of the [[Queen Mother of the West|Celestial Queen Mother]] and [[Jade Emperor]], wove the [[stars]] and their light, known as "[[the Silver River]]" (what Westerners call "[[Milky Way|The Milky Way]] Galaxy"), for heaven and earth.  She was identified with the [[star]] Westerners know as [[Vega]].  In a 4,000-year-old legend, she came down from the Celestial Court and fell in love with the mortal Buffalo Boy (or Cowherd), (associated with the star [[Altair]]).  The Celestial Queen Mother was jealous and separated the lovers, but the Goddess Weaver stopped weaving the Silver River, which threatened heaven and earth with darkness.  The lovers were separated, but are able to meet once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh moon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=unM5hd_V13MC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=Chinese+Goddess-Weaver&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qnzhq4U4Pp&amp;sig=f6LtsUkqci3qb-sBMyEqmA2CKcU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lAPvSu2sJomoMa7BsIQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20Goddess-Weaver&amp;f=false Jung Chang, ''Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China''], New York: Touchstone, 2003, reprint, GlobalFlair, 1991, p. 429, accessed 2 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
* The Japanese folktale ''[[Tsuru no Ongaeshi]]'' features a weaving theme.  A crane, rescued by a childless elderly couple, appears to them in the guise of a girl who cares for them out of gratitude for their kindness and is adopted as their daughter.  She secretly begins weaving stunningly beautiful cloth for the couple to sell under the condition that they may not see her weave.  Though the couple initially comply, they are overcome with curiosity and find the girl is the crane who has been weaving the cloth from her own feathers, leaving her in a pitiful state.  With her identity discovered, she must leave the remorseful couple.  A variation of the story replaces the elderly couple with a man, who marries the crane when she takes on the form of a young woman.

In the [[music industry]], the '''top 40''' is the current, 40 most-popular songs in a particular genre. It is the best-selling or most frequently broadcast [[popular music]]. [[Record chart]]s have traditionally consisted of a total of 40 songs. "Top 40" or "[[contemporary hit radio]]" is also a [[radio format]]. Frequent variants of the Top 40 are the Top 10, Top 20, Top 30, Top 50, Top 75, Top 100 and Top 200.

== History==
According to producer Richard Fatherley, [[Todd Storz]] was the inventor of the format, at his radio station [[KCRO|KOWH]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fong-Torres|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Fong-Torres|coauthors=|title=Dick Fatherly Knows Best (from The Hits Just Keep Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio)|work=|publisher=Miller Freeman Books|year=1998|url=http://www.reelradio.com/storz/index.html|doi=|isbn=0-87930-547-9|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storz invented the format in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POPBOPROCKTILUDROP|url=https://kimsloans.wordpress.com/tag/todd-storz-and-top-40-radio/|website=kimsloans.wordpress.com|access-date=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storz used what he saw from the repetition of plays on the jukebox to develop his platform. The format was commercially successful, and Storz and his father Robert, under the name of the Storz Broadcasting Company, subsequently acquired other stations to use the new Top 40 format. In 1989 Todd Storz was inducted into the Nebraska Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fisher|first=Marc|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Something In The Air: Radio, Rock &amp; The Revolution|work=|publisher=Random House Books|year=2007|url= http://www.marcfisher.com/excerpt2.php|format=|isbn=978-0-375-50907-0|accessdate=20 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617145325/http://www.marcfisher.com/excerpt2.php|archivedate=17 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

The term "Top 40" for a radio format appeared in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;"Timeline/Fun Facts," ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', Nov. 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Top 40, whether surveyed by a radio station or a publication, was a list of songs that shared only the common characteristic of being newly released. Its introduction coincided with a transition from the old ten-inch 78 rpm record format for single "pop" recordings to the seven-inch vinyl 45 rpm format, introduced in 1949, which was outselling it by 1954 and soon replaced it completely in 1958. The Top 40 thereafter became a survey of the popularity of 45 rpm singles and their airplay on the radio.  Some nationally syndicated radio shows, such as ''[[American Top 40]]'', featured a countdown of the 40 highest ranked songs on a particular music or entertainment publication.  Although such publications often listed more than 40 charted hits, such as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], time constraints allowed for the airing of only 40 songs; hence, the term "top 40" gradually became part of the vernacular associated with popular music.

From the 1980s onwards, different recording formats have competed with the 45 rpm vinyl record such as [[cassette single]]s, [[CD single]]s, digital downloads and streaming. Many music charts changed their eligibility rules to incorporate some or all of these.

Some [[disc jockey]]s of Top 40 and similar format programs have been implicated in various [[payola]] scandals.

== Music charts  ==
{{Main|Record chart#Music charts and programs}}
Music charts and various radio programs adopt different chart formats including Top 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100 and 200 although radio formats usually restrict to the Top 40 wherever the chart contains more than 40 songs.

== Radio format==
{{Main|Contemporary hit radio}}
Top 40 is also adopted to a radio format called Top 40 format, spinning mainly hits appearing in the official Top 40 charts of the country in addition to some upcoming hits that are greatly expected to get into the Top 40 very imminently. The format is variously known also as '''CHR''' (contemporary hit radio), contemporary hits, hit list, current hits, hit music, top 40, or pop radio.

The '''libraries of the [[University of Southern California]]''' are among the oldest private academic research libraries in [[California]]. For more than a century USC has been building collections in support of the university's teaching and research interests. Especially noteworthy collections include [[American literature]], Cinema-Television including the [[Warner Bros.]] studio archives, [[Europe]]an [[philosophy]], [[gerontology]], [[Germans|German]] exile literature, [[international relations]], [[Korean studies]], studies of [[Latin America]], [[natural history]], [[Southern California]] history, and the University Archives.

The Warner Bros. Archives is the largest single studio collection in the world. Donated in 1977 to the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts, by Warner Communications, the WBA houses departmental records that detail Warner Bros. activities from the studio’s first major feature, ''My Four Years in Germany'' (1918), to its sale to Seven Arts in 1968.

Announced in June 2006, the testimonies of 52,000 survivors, rescuers and others involved in the [[Holocaust]] will now be housed in the USC College of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences as a part of the newly formed [[USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2005/10/21/News/Shoah.Hosts.Holocaust.History.At.Usc-1029410.shtml] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Shoah Foundation, the USC Libraries [http://digarc.usc.edu/ digital collection] highlights include the California Historical Society, Korean American Archives and the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California.  The digital archive holds 193,252 records and 223,487 content files of varying formats.

In 2010 [[ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives]], the largest collection of [[LGBT]] materials in the world, became a part of USC Libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives Research Collection Finds Permanent Home at the University of Southern California Libraries|url=http://www.onearchives.org/images/one-usc_pressrelease.pdf|work=Pres Release|publisher=ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives|accessdate=8 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803195237/http://www.onearchives.org/images/one-usc_pressrelease.pdf|archive-date=3 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ONE Archives is located near the [[University Park, Los Angeles|University Park Campus]] at 909 West Adams Boulevard.

[[Image:Oldcollege1920.jpg|right|thumb|The first true library was housed in the College of Liberal Arts Building ("Old College"), which was built in 1884, and designed to hold the entire USC student body—55 students.

Bovard Hall can be seen to the south in the back left of the picture.]][[Image:USCLeavey2007.jpg|right|thumb|USC's newest library: Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Library]]

USC’s 22 libraries and other archives currently hold over 5.8 million printed volumes, 1.3 million ebooks, 3 million [[photographs]], and subscribe to more than 30,000 current serial titles, nearly 44,000 linear feet of manuscripts and archives, and subscribe to over 120 electronic databases and more than 14,000 journals in print and electronic formats.  Annually, reference transactions number close to 50,000 and approximately 1,100 instructional presentations are made to over 26,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USC Libraries Facts and Figures|url = https://libraries.usc.edu/about/facts-and-figures|website = USC - Libraries|accessdate = 2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Southern California Library system is among the top 35 largest university library systems in the United States.[http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0106201.html]

The '''yellowfin tuna''' (''Thunnus albacares'') is a species of [[tuna]] found in [[pelagic]] waters of [[tropical]] and subtropical [[ocean]]s worldwide.

Yellowfin is often marketed as '''ahi''', from the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] ''{{okina}}ahi'', a name also used there for the closely related [[bigeye tuna]].&lt;ref name="hsbg"/&gt; The species name, ''albacares'' ("white meat") can also lead to confusion: in English, the [[albacore]] tuna (''Thunnus alalunga'') is a different species, while yellowfin is officially designated ''albacore'' in [[French language|French]] and referred to as ''albacora'' by Portuguese fishermen.

==Description==
The yellowfin tuna is among the larger tuna species, reaching weights over {{convert|180|kg|abbr=on}}, but is significantly smaller than the [[Atlantic bluefin tuna|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific bluefin tuna|Pacific bluefin]] tunas, which can reach over {{convert|450|kg|abbr=on}}, and slightly smaller than the bigeye tuna and the [[southern bluefin tuna]].

The second [[dorsal fin]] and the [[anal fin]], as well as the finlets between those fins and the tail, are bright yellow, giving this fish its common name. The second dorsal and anal fins can be very long in mature specimens, reaching almost as far back as the tail and giving the appearance of [[sickle]]s or [[scimitars]]. The [[pectoral fin]]s are also longer than the related [[bluefin tuna]], but not as long as those of the albacore. The main body is a very dark metallic blue, changing to silver on the belly, which has about 20 vertical lines.

Reported sizes in the literature have ranged as high as {{convert|2.4|m|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. The [[International Game Fish Association]] (IGFA) record for this species stands at {{convert|176|kg|abbr=on}}for a fish caught in 1977 near [[San Benedicto Island]] in the Pacific waters of Mexico. In 2010, a 184-kg yellowfin was caught off the tip of Mexico's [[Baja Peninsula]], {{convert|2.2|m|in|adj=on}} long with a girth of {{convert|1.5|m|in|abbr=on}}. The catch is still pending verification by the IGFA.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In 2012, a fisherman in Baja California caught a 193-kg yellowfin. If the catch is confirmed by the IGFA, the fisherman will receive a prize of $1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-million-dollar-tuna,0,5811199.story Record Tuna Catch Could Fetch $1 Million]" KTLA, 9 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
Yellowfin tuna are [[epipelagic]] fish that inhabit the mixed surface layer of the ocean above the [[thermocline]]. Sonic tracking has found that although yellowfin tuna, unlike the related bigeye tuna, mostly range in the top {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the water column and penetrate the thermocline relatively infrequently, they are capable of diving to considerable depths. An individual tagged in the Indian Ocean with an archival tag spent 85% of its time in depths shallower than {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but was recorded as having made three dives to 578, 982, and {{convert|1160|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

==Behavior==
Although mainly found in deep offshore waters, yellowfin tuna may approach shore when suitable conditions exist. Mid-ocean islands such as the Hawaiian archipelago, other island groups in the Western Pacific, [[Caribbean]], and Maldives islands [[Indian Ocean]], as well as the [[volcano|volcanic islands]] of the Atlantic such as [[Ascension Island]] and [[Saint Helena]], often harbor yellowfin feeding on the [[baitfish]] these spots concentrate close to the shoreline.  Yellowfin may venture well inshore of the [[continental shelf]] when water temperature and clarity are suitable and food is abundant.

Yellowfin tuna often travel in schools with similarly sized companions. They sometimes school with other tuna species and mixed schools of small yellowfin, and [[skipjack tuna]], in particular, are commonplace. They are often associated with various species of [[dolphin]]s or [[porpoise]]s, as well as with larger marine creatures such as [[whale]]s and [[whale shark]]s. They also associate with drifting flotsam such as logs and pallets, and sonic tagging indicates some follow moving vessels. Hawaiian yellowfins associate with anchored [[fish aggregation device]]s and with certain sections of the 50-fathom curve.

==Diet and predation==
Yellowfin tuna prey include other fish, pelagic [[crustacean]]s, and [[squid]]. Like all tunas, their body shape is particularly adapted for speed, enabling them to pursue and capture fast-moving baitfish such as [[flying fish]], [[sauries]], and [[mackerel]]. Schooling species such as [[myctophid]]s or [[lanternfish]] and similar pelagic driftfish, [[anchovy|anchovies]], and [[sardine]]s are frequently taken. Large yellowfins prey on smaller members of the tuna family such as [[frigate mackerel]] and skipjack tuna.

In turn, yellowfin are preyed upon when young by other pelagic hunters, including larger tuna, seabirds, and predatory fishes such as [[wahoo]], shark, and [[billfish]]. Adults are threatened only by the largest and fastest hunters, such as [[toothed whale]]s, particularly the [[false killer whale]], pelagic sharks such as the [[Isurus|mako]] and [[great white shark|great white]], large [[Atlantic blue marlin]] and [[Indo-Pacific blue marlin|Pacific blue marlin]], and [[black marlin]]. The main source of mortality, however, is industrial tuna fisheries.

Yellowfins are able to escape most predators, because unlike most fish, tuna are [[warm-blooded]], and their warm muscles make them extremely strong swimmers, with yellowfin tuna reaching "speeds of up to 50 miles per hour". (They can navigate enormous distances, sometimes crossing entire oceans.)&lt;ref name=shannon&gt;{{cite news|last=Service|first=Shannon|title=The Saudi Arabia of Sashimi|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/04/tuna_protection_and_piracy_pna_changed_the_rules_of_the_high_seas.single.html|newspaper=Slate|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial fishery==
[[File:Thunn albac 100708-5564 plrtu.JPG|thumb|Yellowfin tuna loaded onto a truck for transportation in [[Pelabuhan Ratu|Palabuhanratu]], [[West Java]]]]
Modern commercial fisheries catch yellowfin tuna with [[encircling net]]s (purse seines), and by industrial [[Longline fishing|longlines]]. In 2010, 558,761 metric tons of yellowfin tuna were caught in the western and central Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=shannon /&gt;

===Pole and line===
Formerly, much of the commercial catch was made by [[pole and line|pole-and-line]] fishing, using live bait such as anchovy to attract schools of tuna close to the fishing vessel that were then taken with baited jigs on sturdy [[bamboo]] or [[fiberglass]] poles or on handlines. This fishery, which targeted skipjack and occasionally albacore, as well as yellowfin, for canning, reached its heyday between World War&amp;nbsp;I and the 1950s before declining. The most well-known fleet of pole-and-line boats sailed from [[San Diego]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/91summer/tuna.htm |title=Pole Fishing for Tuna, 1937–1941 &amp;#124; San Diego History Center |publisher=Sandiegohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[California]] and exploited abundant stocks in Mexican waters, as well as further south to [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], and the [[Galapagos Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt467n99z2&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=d0e273&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=calisphere |title=The High Seas Tuna Fishery of California1 |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pole-and-line fishing is still carried out today in the [[Maldives]], [[Ghana]], the [[Canary Islands]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Azores]]. Few pole-and-line boats now specifically target yellowfin, an incidental take compared to the total commercial catch. In the Maldives, the catch is a mix of skipjack tuna and small yellowfins that often associate with them.

===Purse seining===
[[File:GP04BT6.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Juvenile yellowfin caught with purse seine near the Philippines]]
[[Purse seine|Purse seining]] largely took over commercial tuna fisheries in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, purse seines account for more of the commercial catch than any other method. The purse-seine fishery primarily operates in the Pacific Ocean, in the historic tuna grounds of the San Diego tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific, and in the islands of the western Pacific, where many U.S. tuna canneries relocated in the 1980s, but significant purse-seine catches are also made in the Indian Ocean and in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] by French and Spanish vessels.

Purse-seine vessels locate tuna using onboard lookouts, as was done in the pole-and-line fishery, but they also employ sophisticated onboard electronics, sea-surface temperature and other satellite data, and helicopters overhead. Once a school is located, the net is set around it. A single set may yield {{convert|100|t|abbr=on}}. Modern tuna seiners have a capacity up to {{convert|2000|MT}}, reach speeds of over {{convert|17|knot}}, and carry multiple spotting helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsb.com.tw/h025e.html |title=2200T Super Tuna Purse Seiners |publisher=Cfsb.com.tw |date= |accessdate=2012-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purse seining for yellowfin tuna became highly controversial in the late 1970s when it became apparent that the eastern Pacific fishery was killing many [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[pantropical spotted dolphin]]s, and other [[cetacea]]ns (often called "[[porpoise]]s" by the tuna fleet) that accompany the fish. This association has been long-recognized by commercial tuna fishermen.

====Dolphin-friendly labeling====
Since the introduction of "[[dolphin-friendly]]" labeling, an increasing number of purse seine sets are now made on "free schools" unassociated with dolphins, as well as schools that associate with floating objects—another long-understood association that has grown in importance in tuna fisheries. The latter practice in particular has a major ecological impact because of the high proportion of [[bycatch]], including [[manta rays]], [[sea turtles]], pelagic [[sharks]], [[billfish]], and other threatened marine species taken by setting nets around logs and other floating objects. Such tuna are often significantly smaller than the larger adult tuna associated with dolphins. The removal of huge numbers of juvenile yellowfin and bigeye tuna that have yet to reach breeding age has major potential consequences for tuna stocks worldwide.

===Longline===
Most of the commercial catch is canned, but the ''[[sashimi]]'' marketplace adds significant demand for high-quality fish. This market is primarily supplied by industrial tuna longline vessels.

Industrial longlining was primarily perfected by Japanese fishermen who expanded into new grounds in the Western Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Longlining has since been adopted by other fishermen, most notably [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and the [[United States]].

Tuna longlining targets larger ''sashimi''-grade fish around {{convert|25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and up that swim deeper in the water column. In tropical and warm temperate areas, the more valuable bigeyes are often the main target, but significant effort is also directed towards larger yellowfins. Longlining seeks areas of higher ocean productivity indicated by temperature and [[chlorophyll]] fronts formed by upwellings, ocean current eddies, and major [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] features. [[Satellite imaging]] technology is the primary tool for locating these dynamic and constantly changing ocean areas.

Bycatch is a major environmental issue in the longline fishery, especially impacting billfish, sea turtles, pelagic sharks, and [[seabird]]s.

===Artisanal fisheries===
Besides the large-scale industrial purse seine and longline fisheries, yellowfin tuna also support smaller-scale artisanal fisheries that have often supplied local domestic markets for generations.  Artisanal fisheries now also often fish for the lucrative ''sashimi'' market in many locations where international air shipment is possible.

Artisanal fishermen tend to employ assorted hook-and-line gear such as trolling lines, surface and deep handlines, and longlines.

By far, the largest fishery using artisanal methods exists in Philippine and Indonesian waters where thousands of fishermen target yellowfin tuna around [[fish aggregation device]]s or ''payaos'', although this fishery far exceeds the artisanal scale in terms of tonnage caught and the numbers of participants involved, and should more properly be considered a commercial handline fishery. [[General Santos City]] is the most important Philippine port for the landing and transhipment of catches. Catches that qualify as ''sashimi''-grade are mostly shipped to the Japanese market; those that do not meet the grade are sold locally or canned. Elsewhere in the Pacific, small-boat fishers in [[Hawaii]], [[Tahiti]], and other Pacific islands supply local and in some cases foreign markets with fresh yellowfins.

Handline-caught yellowfin tuna is one of the few exports of the economy of [[St.&amp;nbsp;Helena]].

==Sport fishing==
[[File:Yellow Fin Tuna.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A sport fisherman displays his 50-lb yellowfin tuna|alt=Photo of 6 men, four of whom are holding up tuna]]

Yellowfin tuna probably first came to the attention of sports fishermen when they appeared on the tuna grounds of [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]], California, only a few years after pioneering fishermen invented the sport, targeting the [[Pacific bluefin tuna]]. These tuna were of the same species caught by commercial fishermen in Japan and the western Pacific, but the reason for their appearance was not known at the time. Later, warmer water species such as yellowfin tuna, [[mahi-mahi|dorado]] and [[striped marlin]] were found to enter southern California waters in seasons having favorable ocean conditions, particularly during the [[El Niño]] phenomenon, which brings warmer water up North America's western coast.

Yellowfin tuna were subsequently discovered by sport fishermen in Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hawaii, and many other parts of their range. Larger adult fish which had developed distinctively long sickle fins were initially thought to be a different species and were known as Allison tuna (a name first given by the then curator of the Bermuda Aquarium, Louis Mowbray, in 1920). Such destinations as Hawaii and Bermuda became famed for their catches of these beautiful fish. In Hawaii, various styles of feather lures served as bait, but in Bermuda, [[chumming]] techniques from boats anchored on productive banks were evolved to target not only Allison tuna, but also wahoo and the smaller [[blackfin tuna]]. Bermudian experts developed techniques to take all these fish on light [[Fishing tackle|tackle]], and for many years the International Game Fish Association records for yellowfin tuna were dominated by entries from Bermuda in the lighter line classes, with fish in the {{convert|200|lb|kg|adj=on|abbr=on}} and larger class from Hawaii taking most of the heavier line-class records.

Today, yellowfin tuna are a major sport fish pursued by sport fishermen in many parts of the world. Thousands of anglers fish for yellowfin tuna along the eastern seaboard of the United States, particularly in [[North Carolina]] and [[New England]]. Yellowfin are also a popular gamefish among anglers fishing from US Gulf Coast ports, San Diego, and other ports of southern California. Larger "long-range" boats in the San Diego fleet also fish in Mexican waters, searching for yellowfin tuna in many of the grounds that the San Diego pole-and-line tuna clippers used to fish. The yellowfin tuna is also a highly prized catch in the offshore sport fisheries of [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Sport fishing for yellowfin tuna exists on a smaller scale in many other parts of the world.

==Cuisine==
According to the Hawaii Seafood Buyers Guide, yellowfin tuna is widely used in raw fish dishes, especially ''[[sashimi]]''. This fish is also excellent for grilling.&lt;ref name=hsbg&gt;[http://www.hawaii-seafood.org/yellowfin.html?ref=Hawaii ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331171539/http://www.hawaii-seafood.org/yellowfin.html?ref=Hawaii |date=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellowfin is often served seared rare.

Yellowfin buyers recognize two grades, "''sashimi'' grade" and "other", although variation in the quality of "other" grades occurs.

Different [[Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification#Guides and advisory lists|seafood sustainability guides]] come to different conclusions about whether yellowfin fishing is sustainable. The Audubon's ''Seafood Guide'' (a guide for what types of marine food products are not ecofriendly) lists [[Trolling (fishing)|troll-caught]] tuna as "OK", but labels long-line caught as "Be Careful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/Coastfish/Asides/papers/Audubon.htm |title=The Audubon Guide to Seafood |publisher=Spc.int |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-03-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319200251/http://www.spc.int/coastfish/Asides/papers/Audubon.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellowfin is becoming a popular replacement for the severely depleted supplies of [[southern bluefin tuna]].

In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] added the yellowfin tuna to its seafood red list. The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a "list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/oceans/seafood/red-list-of-species/#a3 |title=Greenpeace International Seafood Red list &amp;#124; Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date=2008-08-15 |accessdate=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
