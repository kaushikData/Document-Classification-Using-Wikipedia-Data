Some Koreans think of it as the earliest Korean state and of Dangun as the ancestor of [[Koreans]]. From 1948 until December 1961, the [[Republic of Korea]] officially&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ko|年號에關한法律}}, 1948-09-25&lt;/ref&gt; reckoned years by adding 2333 to the [[Common Era]] year. The year 2333 BC and the related myth are sometimes presented matter-of-factly as ''history'' rather than ''mythology'' in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://stdweb2.korean.go.kr/search/View.jsp?idx=394611 “고조선”], an entry in ''[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ground Wave Emergency Network''' ('''GWEN''') was a [[command and control (military)|command and control]] communications system intended for use by the United States government to facilitate [[military communications]] before, during and after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Specifically, the GWEN network was intended to survive the effects of an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] from a [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] and ensure that the United States President or his survivors could issue a launch order to [[Strategic Air Command]] bombers by radio.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2046&amp;page=13 Commission on Life Science: "Assessment of the Possible Health Effects of Ground Wave Emergency Network: Description of GWEN System", 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/12/us/us-to-complete-emergency-radio-network.html Associated Press: "U.S. to Complete Emergency Radio Network"], The New York Times, 12 September 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf Defense Technical Information Center: Joint Publication 1-02. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

AN/URC-117 was the system's [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System]] identifier, which signified various radio components installed in different locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/electronics.html#_JETDS_AN_Listings Designations Of U.S. Military Electronic And Communications Equipment] Designation-Systems.Net&lt;/ref&gt; Each GWEN Relay Node site featured a [[longwave]] transmitting tower, generally between {{convert|290|and|299|ft|m}} tall, and emitting an [[Radio frequency|RF]] output of between 2,000 and 3,000 [[watt]]s. Of 240 planned GWEN towers, only 58 were built. In 1994, a defense appropriations bill banned the funding of new GWEN tower construction, and a few months later, the GWEN program was cancelled by the [[US Air Force]].&lt;ref name="Bulletin" /&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard]] later outfitted a number of former GWEN sites to house the National [[Differential GPS]] system.&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USDOT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=James A.|title=New Life for Old Transmitters: Converting GWEN to NDGPS|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/publicroads/01septoct/gwen.cfm|website=Federal Highway Administration|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GWEN was part of the Strategic Modernization Program designed to upgrade the nation's strategic communication system, thereby strengthening the value of nuclear [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]]. The GWEN communication system, established in the late 1980s, was designed to transmit critical [[Emergency Action Message]]s (EAM) to United States nuclear forces. [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] can produce a sudden [[Voltage spike|power surge]] over a widespread area that could overload unprotected electronic equipment and render it inoperable. In addition, EMP could interfere with radio transmissions that use the ionosphere for [[Radio propagation|propagation]]. It was thought that GWEN would use a ground-hugging wave for propagation and so be unaffected by the EMP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt; The network was conceived as an array of approximately 240 [[radio]] [[transceivers]] distributed across the [[CONUS|continental USA]] which operated in the [[Low frequency]] (LF) [[radio band]].

Analysis showed that low-frequency (150-190 kilohertz) radio transmissions were largely unaffected by high-altitude EMP, and the Air Force Weapons Laboratory ([[Kirtland Air Force Base]]) tested a small scale 'groundwave' transmission system in 1978-1982. Based on the groundwave concept's promise, USAF Headquarters issued a draft Program Management Directive (PMD) for a "Proliferated Groundwave Communications System (PGCS)" on 25 August 1981. The name of this proposed network system was changed from PGCS to Groundwave Emergency Network in February 1982&lt;ref name="autogenerated"&gt;"History of the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Volume I.", 1984. Held at Air Force Historical Research Agency, IRIS 01085265&lt;/ref&gt; The Air Force placed a tentative initial operating capability for GWEN by January 1992.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;

When doubts arose regarding the threat of electromagnetic pulse to permanently shut down communications, only 58 of the originally planned 240 GWEN towers were built. In 1994 a defense appropriations bill banned new towers from being built, and shortly after, the GWEN program was cancelled by the Air Force.&lt;ref name="Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stover|first1=Dawn|title=The tower in the woods: preparing for nuclear war|url=http://thebulletin.org/tower-woods-preparing-nuclear-war9488|website=thebulletin.org|publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Command and control messages originating at various military installations were transmitted on the 225 to 400 [[MHz]] band and received by a network of unmanned relay stations, called "Relay Nodes", dispersed throughout the contiguous 48 states. The Relay Nodes would re-transmit these command and control messages to each other, and to Strategic Air Command operating locations and launch control centers using [[low frequency|low frequencies]] in the 150-175 [[kHz]] range in order to take advantage of ground-hugging [[radio propagation]] similar to commercial [[AM radio]] stations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt;

Distance between the Relay Nodes were approximately 150–200 miles, determined by the ground wave transmission range.&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt; During initial operations, the Relay Nodes would receive and relay brief test messages every 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt; The system had built-in redundancy, using [[packet switching]] techniques for reconstruction of connectivity if system damage occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA248364&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Naval Postgraduate School Thesis: "FEASIBILITY OF METEOR BURST BUOY RELAY AS A COMMAND AND CONTROL ASSET", March 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems===
Early in its lifetime, electrical interference problems caused by GWEN system operation began to surface. Since the stations were using LF, the chosen frequency was within 1&amp;nbsp;kHz of the operating frequency of nearby electrical [[Power line communication|carrier current]] systems. With GWEN handling constant voice, teletype and other data traffic, it caused interference to the power companies diagnostic two kilohertz side carrier tone. When the side carrier tone disappeared due to interference from GWEN, the power grid would interpret that as a system fault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethw.org/Oral-History:Chester_Smith "Chester Smith Oral History", Engineering and Technology History, 1 Dec 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site layout==
The overall area of a GWEN Relay Node was approximately {{convert|11|acre}}, approximately {{convert|700|ft}} × 700 feet. It was surrounded on the perimeter by locked, {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} chain-link fences topped with barbed wire. Typical site features included:&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt;

*A main [[Longwave]] transmitting tower (generally between {{convert|290|and|299|ft|m}} tall
*A radial network of underground wires forming a large [[ground plane]] to serve as a reflecting surface for [[radio waves]]
*Three electronic equipment shelters; two located near the perimeter of the site, and one at the base of the tower containing an [[antenna tuner|antenna-tuning unit]] (ATU)
*UHF and LF receive antennas mounted on either a 10&amp;nbsp;ft. mast, 30&amp;nbsp;ft. light pole, or 60–150&amp;nbsp;ft. tower.
*A diesel backup generator, with a two-chambered fuel tank having a capacity of {{convert|1020|USgal|l}}

The main GWEN antenna operated intermittently in the LF band at 150 to 175 kilohertz (kHz) (below the bottom of the [[Medium wave|AM broadcast band]] at 530&amp;nbsp;kHz). The peak broadcasting power was from 2,000 to 3,000 watts. The UHF antenna operated at 20 watts, between 225 and 400 megahertz (MHz).&lt;ref name="autogenerated13"/&gt;

==GWEN site locations==
A 1998 [[Department of Transportation]] environmental impact survey that proposed repurposing a number of existing GWEN sites for use by the [[Differential GPS|Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System]] listed the locations of 29 GWEN sites:&lt;ref name="USCG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programmatic Environmental Assessment: Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/doc/ndgps/PEA%20Text.doc|website=US Coast Guard|publisher=US Dept. of Transportation|accessdate=24 January 2017|quote=Ground Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) property and list of GWEN relay nodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination==
Some of the initial towers had prompted groups of citizens in [[Massachusetts]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[California]] to organize to fight construction of GWEN towers in their areas. The groups believed that the presence of a GWEN node would increase the community's "strategic worth" in the eyes of the Soviet Union and thus invite attack. Responding to these groups, the Air Force repeatedly downplayed the importance of the towers, stating they were not worth that kind of attention by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1988"/&gt;

Amid controversy and world geopolitical changes, GWEN's value diminished greatly in the post-[[Cold War]] environment, in addition to its existence being rendered moot by the sustained effectiveness of predecessor and follow-on systems ([[SLFCS|Survivable Low Frequency Communication System]] and [[MEECN|Minimum Essential Emergency Communication Network]] respectively).  As early as 1990, legislative measures were enacted to terminate the program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/2257 U.S. House of Representatives: S.2257, A bill to terminate the Ground-Wave Emergency Network (GWEN) program], 8 March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, new construction of GWEN towers were banned after a defense appropriations bill eliminated any funding for the towers for one year. A few months later, the [[United States Air Force]] announced that they would terminate the construction contract to build the remaining 25 towers, except for monies used to dismantle the system.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;Norris, Robert S.; Arkin, William M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7870">The '''AVM Runestone''', also known as the '''Berg-AVM Runestone''', is a hoax created in 1985 by students carving runes into a boulder near Kensington, Minnesota, not far from where the [[Kensington Runestone]] was found in 1898. In 2001, a carving expert and her geologist father found the AVM Runestone, told the press that it was proof of early Viking or Norse settlement in Minnesota,&lt;ref name="MPR"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200108/13_postt_stone-m/|title=MPR: Proof or Hoax?|last=Tom Post|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began an investigation to prove its authenticity. The creators came forward with their story that it was purely a hoax and not an artifact of Viking explorers.

==Discovery and investigation==
In the spring of 2001, stone carving expert Janey Westin, of Minneapolis, and her father, Robert G. Johnson, an adjunct professor in the geology department of the [[University of Minnesota]], were making a systematic survey of stones in the vicinity of the Kensington Runestone Park, for the Research Team set up to further understanding of the Kensington Runestone. Investigating a small island in a lake on the farm of Arlen and Ruby Sabolik, about 400 metres (1/4 mile) from the 1898 find site, on May 13, Westin found the carved letters "AVM" on a lichen-covered, pinkish-brown granite gneiss boulder&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Henrik Williams [http://www.khm.uio.no/forskning/publikasjoner/runenews/nor_2002/usak01hw.htm The "AVM" Stone from Minnesota (Kensington II)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604175936/http://www.khm.uio.no/forskning/publikasjoner/runenews/nor_2002/usak01hw.htm |date=June 4, 2011 }} in ''Nytt om runer'' 17 (2002, publ. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; (about  110&amp;nbsp;cm or 43&amp;nbsp;inches long, weighing perhaps a tonne&lt;ref name=ampet&gt;"Second runestone examined" in [http://www.ampetrographic.com/news/newsletters/01_fall.pdf ''The American Edge'' (Fall 2001)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529154050/http://www.ampetrographic.com/news/newsletters/01_fall.pdf |date=May 29, 2006 }}, American Petrographic Services&lt;/ref&gt;) which they had inspected previously in different light conditions. They took photographs and reported their find. Two weeks later, they returned to the site with Minneapolis geologist Scott Wolter and removed lichen to reveal more inscribed characters: the date 1363 in the same pentadic numerals as seen on the Kensington Runestone and a second line of three runes, possibly "ASU", "XSU" or "XSV". Although the symbols of the top line were similar to those on the stone found in 1898, those in the second line were not.

In June, the Runestone Museum in [[Alexandria, MN|Alexandria]] established a Special Committee to investigate the discovery and contacted archaeologists. On June 9, the site was carefully mapped and documented; on July 11, the stone was removed. Three archaeologists from Minnesota institutions conducted a preliminary dig of nine test-holes at and around the site, on July 25, finding no evidence of Norse presence. They found a few Native American artifacts, including two quartz flakes, probably waste from arrowhead production.

The discovery was announced in the Minneapolis ''Star Tribune'' on August 11, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Peg Meier, "Second mystery stone unearthed in Kensington", in the Minneapolis ''Star Tribune'' (Aug 11, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; with Westin pre-empting accusations by making it very clear that she had not carved the stone. The team suggested that the stone might have been made as a grave marker for some of the Norse explorers.&lt;ref name=ampet/&gt; After a public display and press conference at Kensington, the stone was taken to Wolter's [[St. Paul, MN|St. Paul]] laboratory for detailed photography and analysis of the weathering of stone and carving. The state archaeologist, Mark Dudzik, was skeptical, maintaining the position that it was "just not logical" to believe that Scandinavian explorers — who, he argued, specialized in exploiting resources along coastlines — had penetrated to Minnesota in the 1360s. Russell Fridley, a former director of the Minnesota Historical Society, expressed a similar view with the observation that "It's a great testimony to Scandinavian humor on the frontier."

Immediately after the announcement, local Norse enthusiast Bob Berg came forward to report that he had found the stone while undertaking a similar survey in late 1994&lt;ref name="post"&gt;Tim Post, "[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200108/13_postt_stone-m/ Proof or Hoax?]" Minnesota Public Radio (Aug 14, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and reported on it in April 1995 to the Viking research group of which he was a member. Their firm conclusion had been that it was a hoax, not worth further effort.

==Confession and explanation==
On September 5, 2001, [[Kari Ellen Gade]], then chair of the Department of Germanic Studies at [[Indiana University]], and [[Jana K. Schulman]], associate professor in English at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]], wrote a letter to the Minnesota Historical Society. They explained that in June 1985, while students at the University of Minnesota, they and three friends (who chose to remain anonymous) had carved the AVM stone with a hammer and chisel&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; as a test of willingness to believe in mystery artifacts (and "for fun").&lt;ref name=powell&gt;Eric A. Powell, "[http://www.archaeology.org/0201/newsbriefs/runestone.html Runestone Fakery]," ''Archaeology'', vol. 55 no. 1 (Jan/Feb 2002) Archaeological Institute of America. Illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; They also revealed that the odd runes on the second line were supposed to read "[[Alu (runic)|ALU]]" (a pagan magical invocation) in an older style of runes, but the chisel had slipped.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;

Breaking the news on November 5 on behalf of the Special Committee, Scott Wolter — who had found "specific points that bothered me" during his scientific investigation — accepted the confession, saying "I give them credit for coming forward and admitting it." Westin was less forgiving: She had paid for transportation of the stone to its initial safe storage and had devoted time and energy that could have gone "into my work, where it belonged." Gade stated that the confession was made specifically because "We saw that people were being asked to make financial contributions to have the rock tested ... we didn't feel it would be right to carry this further." She also said "I'm sorry that people spent their time and money on the stone, but it was clearly a fake."&lt;ref name=powell/&gt;

Local researcher Barry Hanson, in a book he was then writing about the original Kensington Runestone, explained the main concerns that had emerged before the confession. The scientific testing had quickly shown that the carved surfaces had too much iron [[pyrite]], which ought long ago to have oxidized to [[ferrous sulfate]] if the carving was genuinely ancient. Also, the site, though an island in 2001, ought to have been underwater in 1363.&lt;ref&gt;Quotations from Barry Hanson writings in Jim Richardson and Allen Richardson, [http://www.paranormalnews.com/article.asp?articleid=468 ''Gonzo Science: Skeptics of the Kensington Runestone: The “Berg-AVM Runestone” Fiasco''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129173045/http://paranormalnews.com/article.asp?articleID=468 |date=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Andoain''' ([[Basque language|Basque]]: '''''Andoaingo Gudua''''') was a battle fought on 14 September 1837, during the [[First Carlist War]] in northern Spain. The action took place in [[Andoain]],  south of the main Liberal stronghold of [[San Sebastián]]. Liberal troops, led by the Spanish General [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan|Leopoldo O'Donnell]], had captured Andoain on 9 September, driving the Carlist garrison to the western bank of the river Oria. Then followed a three-day period of breastwork building by both sides and sporadic fighting.  After two days of [[trench warfare]], the Carlist poured heavy artillery fire on the Liberals lines and launched an all-out offensive by midday supported by reinforcements brought in from [[Navarre|Navarra]] by General José Ignacio de Uranga. The Liberals were flanked on their left wing, and their lines crumbled. Only two [[Auxiliary Legion|British Auxiliary Legion]] Regiments and a number of their Basque local guides, the  [[Chapelgorris]], were left to resist the Carlist advance, but were eventually outnumbered and overran. Most of the British who surrendered to the Carlists were executed, accused of the burning of several local farms in the previous days. The battle was the end of the British Auxiliary Legion as an effective fighting force, with two-thirds of their members killed, wounded or executed by the Carlists and local civilian residents. General O´Donnell and the remnants of his forces withdrew to [[Hernani, Gipuzkoa|Hernani]].

==Background==
After the [[battle of Oriamendi]] in March 1837, with the morale of the Carlist army on the rise, royal pretender [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos María Isidro de Borbón]] conceived a thrust of his army through [[Aragon]], [[Catalonia]] and [[Valencia]] to take supplies and reinforcements from their allies in the region, and later carry out an all-out offensive on Madrid. The main reason behind the operation was to lift the Liberal blockade of the Basque provinces, which was taking effect on the economy of these Carlist-held areas. The plan is referred to by historians as the "Royal Expedition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Memoria militar y política sobre la guerra de Navarra.|last=de Arízaga|first=José Manuel|publisher=Vicente de Lalama|year=1840|isbn=|location=Madrid|pages=86|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Auxiliary Legion, which had been badly beaten at Oriamendi and was based at San Sebastián, took advantage of the circumstances to lead a Liberal offensive along the Cantabrian coast, only defended by isolated garrisons. The Liberals only found some resistance at Irun, which was taken by assault and plundered on 17 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges|last=Jaques|first=Tony|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=0313335389|location=|pages=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1976|title=The British Auxiliary Legion (1835-1837)|url=|journal=History Today|volume= 26| issue = 1-6|pages=187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Carlist troops were approaching Madrid, Spanish Liberal General O'Donnell left the besieged San Sebastián to launch a successful offensive to the south, on Hernani and [[Urnieta]]. The Carlists retreated to the other side of the rivers Oria and [[Leitzaran]], near Andoain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jordibrufotografo.com/portfolio/carlismo/batalla-de-andoain-14091837/|title=Batalla de Andoain, 14/09/1837 - Jordi Bru Fotógrafo|work=Jordi Bru Fotógrafo|access-date=2017-08-06|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildup==
On 8 September 1837, O'Donnell massed a 7,000-men strong force to  advance on the Carlist lines between the villages of Hernani and Urnieta.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Liberals pushed their enemies towards the natural barrier formed by the rivers Oria and Leizaran, where the two armies stood facing each other at a distance of a mere 200 yards.  O´Donnell established his headquarters at Andoain, which lays on the main road between San Sebastián and the Carlist stronghold of [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]]. The Carlist forces, composed of five [[Guipuzcoa]]n battalions and an improvised militia of local residents, controlled the western bank of the river Oria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The opposing forces started to fortified their positions and entrenchments, O´Donnell men by rebuilding the town's fortress, destroyed by the retreating rebels, and the Carlist faction by setting up a six-feet high barricade with a number of embrasures that enabled them to keep the town under fire. The wall had the shape of a horseshoe, following the course of the stream, with the convex side aimed to Andoain. The extreme left ended up in a bunker, where the Carlists mounted a permanent watch. The narrowness of the stream and the main bridge made any force attempting to cross the river an easy target for the rebels. The accurate fire from the parapets indeed hampered the Liberals building of their own breastworks. The Carlist bunker was connected with their rearguard by a ravine which edges were protected by rocky crags, while the gaps were closed with casket filled with clay and stones. This means that any reinforcement or movement out or into the bunker and eventually to the barricade became unnoticed to the Liberals.  On the right side of the trenches, the terrain allowed O'Donnell to command the enemies' positions, which were occasionally checked by  the British artillery, which provoked a number of casualties among the Carlists when their rounds struck home. The British battery was made of two nine pounders and one twelve-pound howitzer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the course of these skirmishes, two British officers were wounded by snipers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Spanish Liberal troops were stationed to the left and to the right of the fortifications, while two companies of British Rifles were deployed in several outposts along the river.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to reprieve Carlist sympathizers of supplies, British troops set 126 barns on fire. This action enraged the local residents, who sought revenge by moving en masse to the Carlist zone and joining the rebel ranks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A British regular force of [[Royal Marines]] and [[Royal Artillery]] deployed in Hernani, but did not intervene in the following actions.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==The battle==
[[File:British Legion at Vitoria (1837).jpg|thumb|British troops from the Auxiliary Legion at [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]] (1837)|200x200px]]
During the buildup process, Navarrese troops lead by General José Ignacio de Uranga, departing from [[Arróniz]] in Navarre,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=tJ-iy0VfLkUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA138&amp;dq=Uranga+Arroniz+Andoain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOtYWXx8PVAhWCipAKHdfJCgcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Uranga%20Arroniz%20Andoain&amp;f=false|title=Galería militar contemporánea, colección de biogr. y retr. de los generales que más celebridad han conseguido en los ejércitos liberal y carlista,durante la última guerra civil|last=|first=|publisher=Sociedad tipográfica de Hortelano y Cia.|year=1846|isbn=|location=|pages=138–39|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; sneaked through the valley between Tolosa and Andoain. These reinforcements increased the strength of the rebel army to some 3,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.andoain.eus/es/batalla-andoain|title=La Batalla de Andoain - Andoain|website=www.andoain.eus|language=es|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the morning of 14 September, the loyalists found that two artillery emplacement had been mounted on the palisade. Five rebel cannons began to poured heavy fire on the Liberal forces at Andoain itself. The British battery returned fire, and claimed to have silenced one of the pieces. The exchange lasted until 11 o'clock, when the rebel infantry emerged from their entrenchements and supported by intense musketry fire, advanced on the left and right flanks of the Liberal army.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Uranga's plan was to lure the main body of the Liberal army to their right, north of Andoain, and then launch a two-pronged attack on the weakened center and left.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The British Rifles and Scottish regiments were in the center, watching the main bridge on the river Oria, along with the Basque militia loyal to the Spanish government, known as the Chapelgorris.  The Chapelgorris were forced to abandon their posts at the bridge after fierce fighting, as the right wing of the Carlist attack made gains on the eastern bank of the river.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1840|title=Sketches of Spanish Generals|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=oEIFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=andoain+cristinos+killed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ElKlA3D_Jq&amp;sig=Rd7-eq-yUkN5qBMEGVfqN9azyHA&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqm-nmhIrUAhXLhZAKHYgdA2MQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=andoain%20cristinos%20killed&amp;f=false|journal=The Monthly chronicle; a national journal|volume=|pages=75–78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to British sources, it was at this stage of the battle that Colonel F. R. Clarke, in charge of a Scottish regiment, mustered a column of near 300 troops in the town's main square and launched a bayonet attack in the direction of the bridge, which eventually drove the Carlists back to the river's edge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Earlier in the battle, however, O'Donnell had moved the ''Gerona'' battalion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=ps07E0cuSZ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Andoain&amp;f=false|title=El Pabellon Espanol|last=Calonge y Pérez|first=Ignacio|publisher=Alejandro Gómez Fuenteenebro|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; made up of veteran  Spaniard soldiers who had kept at bay the Carlist forces on the left flank over the past days, to meet what he perceived as the main Carlist effort on his right,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; replacing them by the unexperienced troops of the ''Infanta Isabel'' battalion. These young recruits fled in panic when rebel forces reached the eastern bank of the river Oria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The British Auxiliary Legion in the First Carlist War in Spain, 1835-1838: A Forgotten Army|last=Brett|first=Edward W.|publisher=Four Courts|year=2005|isbn=1851829156|location=|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their retreat allowed the Carlist army to flank the British from their left. The artillery wagon of the Legion, whose cannons had been emplaced on the right side of the fortifications,  was forced to withdraw, defended by the British Lancers and returning fire whenever possible.  Two British gunners were killed by counter-battery fire. At this point, Colonel Clarke's troops became trapped between the bridge and downtown Andoain, now occupied by the Carlists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Clarke was last seen at the head of the bridge, where he received a sabre wound from a Carlist officer on one of his legs and fell from his horse. Clarke, with his left arm still in a sling from a wound received at Oriamendi, became prisoner and was executed the following day at Tolosa. One of Clarke's subordinates, Captain Larkham, was shot and killed by a sharpshooter while involved in a sword duel with a Carlist officer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After the action on the bridge, the Scotchs and two Rifles companies were cut off from the village's center. One of the Rifles companies keeping watch on the Carlist main breastwork, commanded by Captain Courtenay and two subalterns, was almost whipped out by the Spanish rebels, with only five survivors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The British stragglers fled in disarray, only to be killed by the rebels or died from exhaustion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The remains of Clarke's column, meanwhile,  sought shelter in the local church. The thick walls of the building provided a good protection against gunfire, and in its stores were plenty of food and supplies, but the 25 soldiers eventually surrendered to the Carlists on 16 September, on the promise of mercy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

During the withdrawal from Andoain, Spanish General O'Donnell had a narrow escape when his horse was killed by a Carlist bullet. Overpowered by the tumultuous retreat of his troops, O´Donnell fell into a ditch. He was rescued by Colonel James Arbuthnot, a Scottish officer who has been in the Spanish service for 35 years. It was at this stage of the battle that a company of Lancers carried out a rearguard action, in an attempt to relief the Scotchs and Rifles surrounded in the village and recover a cart of [[Congreve rocket|rockets]] overturned in the retreat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cavalry charge into Andoain was eventually beaten off by the Carlists. The action resulted in the death of the company commander and [[aide-de-camp]] of Brigadier O'Connell,  Mayor McKellar, and two ranks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A total of 13 British officers lost their lives at Andoain, some of them executed or lynched after surrender. The action lasted barely half-an-hour.
Overstretched by their own progress, the Carlists were forced to leave Urnieta, which was briefly retaken by the Lancers and other loyalist troops. The position, however, was deemed untenable by O'Donnell, who ordered his men to fall back to Hernani at dusk. The victorious Carlist troops rounded up 100,000 rounds of ball cartridges, 1,500 firearms, 199 rockets, 150 British tents, 3,000 pairs of shoes and three-day provisions for 10,000 men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=M5vd06ou2awC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Clarke+Andoain&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KJ8-k0xYgx&amp;sig=ZkG0Xta7ubIKbb3LdpxNvAxMn3Q&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFpdiQoIvUAhUGf5AKHaUHAkEQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Clarke%20Andoain&amp;f=false|title=Sketches of Scenery in the Basque Provinces of Spain, with a selection of national music; arranged for piano-forte and guitar: illustrated by notes and reminiscences connected with the war in Biscay and Castile|last=Wilkinson|first=Henry|publisher=|year=1838|isbn=|location=|pages=37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Massacre of British prisoners ===
Although the [[Lord Eliot Convention]] put an end, or at least restrained the indiscriminate execution of prisoners, the Carlist usually did not abide to the agreement if they captured foreign combatants,&lt;ref&gt;Charles William Thompson, ''Twelve months in the British legion, by an officer of the Ninth regiment'' (Oxford University, 1836), 129.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly after Carlos of Bourbon promulgated the "Durango decree" stating that all foreign "adventurers" fighting with the Liberal forces should be shot immediately after surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British auxiliary legion: Aportación británica a la Primera Guerra Carlista|last=Santamaría|first=José Miguel|publisher=Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes|year=2011|isbn=|location=Alicante|pages=49|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the Legion's troops who laid down their weapons in Andoain were in fact summarly tried for arson and executed in sight, or lynched by local residents, men and women,  whose barns and properties had been burned to the ground by the British troops the previous days.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The burning of civilian residences and farms had been already denounced at the Carlist [[Provincial deputation (Spain)|Deputation at War]] on the session of 10 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.andoain.eus/documents/131314/520345/1alfredomoraza.pdf|title=Las Fortificaciones de Época Carlista en Andoain|last=Moraza Barea|first=Alfredo|last2=Buces Cabello|first2=Javier|last3=García Dalmau|first3=Miren|publisher=Sociedad de Ciencias Aranzadi-Aranzadi Zientzi Elkartea|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The crowd cried out in [[Basque language|Euskara]] ''ez da&amp;nbsp;cuartelic suematen duenentzat!''

Spanish Liberal troops losses amounted to 320 killed and wounded&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and 114 prisoners.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historia de la Guerra Civil, y de los Partidos Liberal y Carlista:|last=Pirala|first=Antonio|publisher=Dionisio Chaulié|year=1869|isbn=|location=|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the officers were slain by Spanish and British Lancers while deserting their troops.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The northern front stabilised between Andoain and Urnieta for the rest of the war. Before marching back to Navarra, Uranga built a defensive line, manned by four battalions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The new fortifications were initially designed by [[Prussia]]n engineer Hugo Strauss, later replaced by the Spanish Policarpo Fuentes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andoain.eus/documents/131314/520345/1alfredomoraza.pdf Moraza Barea, Buces Cabello and García Dalmau (2012). p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; and built in a mere twelve days by 800 workers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 
The Liberal army launched four limited offensives on the sector from October 1837 to June 1838, making modest gains, like the occupation of [[Lasarte-Oria|Lasarte]] and Urnieta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andoain.eus/documents/131314/520345/1alfredomoraza.pdf Moraza Barea, Buces Cabello and García Dalmau (2012). p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, the Royal Expedition eventually petered out outside Madrid, and the main Carlist army withdrew beyond the [[Ebro]] by October 1837, after being defeated at the [[Battle of Aranzueque]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://balagan.info/timeline-of-the-first-carlist-war|title=Timeline of the First Carlist War|date=2001-02-21|work=Steven's Balagan|access-date=2017-08-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaldean Catholic Diocese of [[Zakho]]''' is a [[diocese]] of the [[Chaldean Church]] in the second half of the 19th century and for most of the 20th century.  The diocese of Zakho was merged with the Chaldean diocese of [[Amadiya (Chaldean Diocese)|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, ''POCN'', 144; Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 108–9&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001, a new bishop was consecrated. In July 2013, Zakho was suppressed to the Diocese of Amadiyah.

== Background ==
The diocese of [[Zakho]] was founded in 1851.  The diocese included some villages in the western [[Khabur (Tigris)|Khabur]] valley and the mountains to the northeast of Zakho previously in the diocese of [[Gazarta]], and several villages in the [[Duhok, Iraq|Dohuk]] district previously in the diocese of [[Amadiya (Chaldean Diocese)|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 108&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Chaldean bishops of Zakho ==
The first Chaldean bishop of Zakho was Emmanuel Asmar (1859–75).

He was succeeded by Quriaqos Giwargis Goga, a monk of the monastery of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery|Rabban Hormizd]], who was born in [[Tel Keppe|Telkepe]] on 15 January 1820 and ordained a [[priest (Catholic)|priest]] in 1855.  According to Tfinkdji he was consecrated for Zakho on 25 July 1875 by the patriarch [[Joseph Audo|Joseph VI Audo]], but a manuscript note gives the date of his consecration as 1 August 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Note in MS Dawra Syr 61&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1876 Quriaqos Giwargis Goga rebelled against the patriarch and installed himself in the village of Telkepe in the patriarchal diocese of [[Mosul]], where he was supported by most of the village's priests.  Following an appeal to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] by Joseph Audo, the two rebels eventually submitted, and Goga was transferred to the diocese of [[Amadiya (Chaldean Diocese)|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]] in 1879.

Quriaqos Goga was succeeded by Mattai Paul Shamina (1879–85) and Stephen Yohannan Qaynaya (1886–9).

Jeremy Timothy Maqdassi, who was born in [[Alqosh]] in 1847 and became a priest in 1879, was consecrated bishop of Zakho either in 1890 (De Clerq) or 1892 (Fiey), and remained its bishop until his death in 1929. He was succeeded by Peter Raffo {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aziz (1929–37), Yohannan Nisan (1937–57), Thomas Rayyis (1957–66) and Gabriel Qoda (27 November 1965– 7 March 1968).

Gabriel Qoda, who died in March 1993, was succeeded as bishop of Zakho on 7 March 1968 by Joseph Babana. Joseph Babana died on 9 September 1973 at the age of 57, and was succeeded on 13 October 1973 by Yohannan Paulus Marcus.

The elderly Yohannan Paulus Marcus, who died on 13 July 1985 at the age of 75, was succeeded as bishop of Zakho by Stephen Kajo on 29 November 1983.

Following the death of Stephen Kajo on 8 November 1987, the diocese of Zakho remained vacant for fourteen years. During this period the few remaining Chaldeans in the Zakho district remained under the care of Yohannan Qello, the bishop of [[Amadiya (Chaldean Diocese)|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amadiya]].

In December 2001 [[Petros Hanna Issa Al-Harboli]] was consecrated bishop of Zakho. After brief illness he died on November 3, 2010.

In July 2013, the Chaldean diocese of Amadiya was united with Zakho under Rabban al-Qas.

== Population statistics ==
In 1867 the diocese of Zakho had a population of 3,000 Chaldeans and contained 15 villages (Martin).

In 1896 the diocese had a population of 3,500 Chaldeans, and contained 15 parishes and 20 churches (Chabot).  The largest villages in the diocese were [[Zakho]], [[Dohuk, Iraq|Dohuk]], [[Sharanesh]], [[Yarda]], [[Beidar]], [[Bir Sivi]], Mar Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob and Esnakh, and the bishop resided either at Zakho or Dohuk.  The diocese then had ten indigenous priests and 5 priests who had been trained at the monastery of [[Rabban Hormizd Monastery|Rabban Hormizd]].

In 1913 the diocese contained 15 villages and 17 churches and had a population of 4,880 Chaldeans, served by 13 priests (Tfinkdji).

A large number of Assyrian refugees settled in the Zakho district after the [[First World War]], and their presence is reflected in later statistics for the diocese.  In 1928, according to an official statistic prepared by the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]], the diocese of Zakho included 16 villages and contained 8,000 Chaldeans and 18 churches.  In 1937 the diocese included 23 villages, and contained 10,852 Chaldeans, 18 priests, and 16 churches (Kajo).

[[File:Claude-François Ménestrier.jpg|thumb|Claude-François Ménestrier]]
'''Claude-François Ménestrier''' (9 March 1631 &amp;ndash; 21 January 1705) was a French [[Heraldry|heraldist]], a member of the [[Society of Jesus]] [Jesuit], and attendant of the royal court.

Ménestrier was born in Lyon.  He composed numerous books on heraldry, in which he was one of the greatest authorities of his age, the professor of the colleges in [[Chambéry]], [[Vienne]], [[Grenoble]], and [[Lyon]]. During 1669-70 he traveled to Germany and Italy, but reached Paris and lived there to his death. He was the most widely known heraldist of his time, and was from 1622 in close correspondence with [[Philipp Jakob Spener]], the founder of the German scientific [[heraldry]] who refused the merely symbolic interpretation of arms. Ménestrier maintained that we can know the essence of [[heraldry]] only from the [[Source text|sources]] from the age of living heraldry but he was also influenced by the heraldic view of his age. Thus, his researches were abortive.

Ménestrier's essays "On Ancient and Modern Musical Productions" (''Des Représentations en musique anciennes et modernes'', 1681) and "On Ancient and Modern Ballets, After The Rules of Theatre" (''Des Ballets anciens et modernes selon les règles du théâtre'', 1682) were influential in the development of [[ballet]] as a dramatic [[concert dance]] style capable of expressing a wide range of emotion and narrating a complex story, drawing upon accounts of ancient Roman [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;Alessandra Zanobi, ''Ancient Pantomime and its Reception'', Oxford University Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama [http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/learning/short-guides/ancient-pantomime-and-its-reception]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ménestrier was also a numismatist and antiquary.  In 1689 he published his ''Histoire du Roy Louis le Grand par les médailles. emblêmes, devises, jettons, inscriptions, armoiries, et autres monumens publics''.  The book was the first antiquarian history of a modern individual, and largely used medals drawn from the collection of Père [[François de la Chaise]].  It also covered jettons and heraldic devices.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wellington - ''Antiquarianism and the Visual Histories of Louis XIV Artifacts for a Future Past'' (Routledge, 2015) pp. 128-134&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately for Ménestrier a pirated 1691 Dutch edition included five pages of anti-Louis medals, harming Ménestrier's position at court.

A '''console''' in [[heraldry]] is a decorative frame or support surrounding a heraldic [[shield]] or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]. 

The term derives from the compound [[Latin]] verb ''consolor'' "to alleviate, lighten", from the verb ''solor'', "to assuage, soothe, relieve, mitigate", plus the preposition ''con/com/cum'', "with".&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, &amp; Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928&lt;/ref&gt;  It thus serves to add interest to and mitigate the harshness of the stark outline of the shield, were used primarily for decorative purposes, rather than for its original purpose of identifying a [[knight]] in battle. The term "console" in [[architecture]] is generally used for elements which provide support, such as [[corbel]]s on a [[console table]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2019">The '''Council of Tarragona''' was two distinct [[Synod|Council]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] held in the city of [[Tarragona]], in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

==First Council at Tarragon== 
The '''Council of Tarragona''' was held by [[Archdiocese of Tarragona#Archbishops of Tarragona (6th century - ca. 712)|Archbishop John]] of [[Archdiocese of Tarragona|Tarragona]], on 6 November 516. This council assembled all the bishops of his province, thus becoming the first provincial council of Tarragona.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], 1912: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14459a.htm Tarragona].&lt;/ref&gt; There were ten bishops were present. In 517 he assembled another provincial council in [[Girona]].

==Second Church Council at Tarragon==
[[File:Bisbats.png|thumb|right|Eclesiàstical Provínce of Tarragona(1400).]]A second [[Synod|council]] was held at [[Tarragona]] in 1234 to regulate the procedure of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14459a.htm  ARCHDIOCESE OF TARRAGONA (TARRACONENSIS)] at newadvent.org.&lt;/ref&gt; which had begun in 1233.&lt;ref&gt;Angus MacKay, David Ditchburn, Atlas of Medieval Europe, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm D. Lambert, The [[Cathar]]s(Wiley, 1998) p25.&lt;/ref&gt; and to also ratify the findings of the Toulouse Council.

Canon two of this second '''Council of  Tarragona''' also restated the cannon of the [[Council of Toulouse]] held two years before. ''“No one may possess the books of the Old and [[New Testament]]s, and if anyone possesses them he must turn them over to the local [[bishop]] within eight days, so that they may be burned…”''&lt;ref&gt;The Church Council of Tarragona (1234 AD), 2nd Cannon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Lortsch, Historie de la Bible en France, 1910, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13469">'''Ernst Hartwig Kantorowicz''' (May 3, 1895 – September 9, 1963) was a German-American historian of medieval political and intellectual history and art, known for his 1927 book ''Kaiser Friedrich der Zweite'' on [[Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II]], and ''The King's Two Bodies'' (1957) on medieval and early modern ideologies of monarchy and the state.&lt;ref&gt;Norman F. Cantor, ''Inventing the Middle Ages,'' (1991) pp 79-117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Kantorowicz was born in [[Poznań|Posen]] (then part of [[Prussia]]) to a wealthy, assimilated German-Jewish family and as a young man was groomed to take over his family's prosperous liquor distillery business. He served as an officer in the [[German Imperial Army|German Army]] for four years in [[World War I]]. After the war, he matriculated at the [[University of Berlin]] to study economics, at one point also joining a [[Freikorps|right-wing militia]] that fought against Polish forces in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)]] and helped put down the [[Spartacist uprising]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XQzAoMArwFIC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Ernst++Kantorowicz+posen&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 Saul Friedländer, ''Den Holocaust beschreiben'' (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he transferred briefly to the [[University of Munich]], where once again he was involved in armed clashes between leftists and pro-government militias, but soon thereafter settled on the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he continued to enroll in economics courses while developing a broader interest in Arabic, Islamic Studies, history, and geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|title=Kantorowicz|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Heidelberg, Kantorowicz became involved with the so-called [[Georgekreis]], a group of artists and intellectuals devoted to the German symbolist poet and aesthete [[Stefan George]], believing that George's poetry and philosophy would become the foundation of a great revival of the nationalist spirit in post-war Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Ulrich|title=Stefan George|date=1970|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Kantorowicz was awarded a doctorate supervised by [[Eberhard Gothein]] based on a slim dissertation on "artisan associations" in the Muslim world.

Although his degree was in Islamic economic history, Kantorowicz's interests soon turned to the European Middle Ages and to ideas about kingship in particular. His association with the elitist and culturally conservative Georgekreis inspired Kantorowicz to undertake writing a sweeping and highly unorthodox biography of the great Holy Roman emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], published in German in 1927 and English in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz, Ernst. [https://archive.org/stream/fredericktheseco000027mbp#page/n7/mode/2up ''Frederick the Second, 1194–1250,''] Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of offering a more typical survey of laws, institutions, and important political and military achievements of Frederick's reign, the book struck a distinctly panegyrical tone, portraying Frederick as a tragic hero and the idealized embodiment of the German nation. It included no footnotes and seemed to elide historical events with more fanciful legends and propagandistic literary depictions. The work elicited a combination of bewilderment and criticism from the mainstream historical academy. Reviewers complained that it was literary myth-making and not a work of serious historical scholarship. As a result, Kantorowicz published a hefty companion volume (''Ergänzungsband'') in 1931 which contained detailed historical documentation for the biography.

Despite the furor over the Frederick book, and not having written a formal ''Habilitationsschrift'' (second thesis to qualify for a professorial appointment), Kantorowicz received an (honorary) professorship at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] in 1930. By 1933, however, Kantorowicz had to cease giving lectures due to increasing pressure on Jewish academics under the new Nazi regime. After taking several leaves of absence, he was finally granted an early retirement with a pension in 1935. He remained in Germany until 1938, when after the [[Kristallnacht]] riots it became clear that the situation for even assimilated Jews such as himself was no longer tenable. He accepted a teaching position for a short time at Oxford before taking up a lectureship at the [[University of California - Berkeley]] in 1939. After several years, Kantorowicz was able to secure a permanent professorship, but in 1950, he famously resigned in protest when the UC Regents demanded that all continuing faculty sign a [[loyalty oath]] disavowing affiliation with any politically subversive movements. Kantorowicz insisted he was no leftist and pointed to his role in an anti-communist militia as a young university student, but nonetheless objected on principle to an instrument which he viewed as a blatant infringement on academic freedom and freedom of conscience more generally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/kantorowicz.html&lt;/ref&gt; During the controversy in Berkeley, two eminent German émigré medievalists working in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], Theodore Mommsen (grandson of the great classical historian) and the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], persuaded [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], director of the prestigious [[Institute for Advanced Study]], to appoint Kantorowicz to the Institute's faculty of Historical Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|title=Kantorowicz|pages=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz accepted and moved to Princeton, where he remained for the rest of his career.

In 1957, Kantorowicz published his masterpiece, ''The King's Two Bodies'', which explored, in the words of the volume's subtitle, "medieval political theology." The book traced the ways in which theologians, historians, and canon lawyers in the Middle Ages and early modern period understood "the king" as both a mortal individual and an institution which transcends time. Drawing on a diverse array of textual and visual sources, including [[Shakespeare]] and [[Dante]], ''The King's Two Bodies'' made a major contribution to the way historians and political scientists came to understand the evolution of ideas about authority and charisma vested in a single individual versus transpersonal conceptions of the realm or the state in pre-modern Europe. The book remains a classic in the field.

Kantorowicz died in his home in Princeton of an [[aortic aneurysm]] at age 68.  
 
Kantorowicz was the subject of a controversial biographical sketch in the book ''Inventing the Middle Ages'' (1991) by the medievalist [[Norman F. Cantor]]. Cantor suggested that, but for his Jewish heritage, the young Kantorowicz could be considered a Nazi in terms of his intellectual temperament and cultural values. Cantor compared Kantorowicz with another contemporary German medievalist, [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], who worked on similar topics and later joined the Nazi Party and served as the staff diarist for the German High Command during the war.

The '''Fritz Reuter Literary [[Archive]]''' (FRLA - Fritz Reuter Literaturarchiv) in Berlin, Germany collects [[autographs]] and [[manuscripts]] by 19th century authors from [[Mecklenburg]], as well as editions of their works. The collections primarily include [[Fritz Reuter]] (1810–1874), who wrote mostly in [[Low German]], and [[Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn|Ida Gräfin Hahn-Hahn]] (1805–1880), who wrote primarily in [[High German]]. During the 19th century these two novelists, with Mecklenburgian roots, were counted among the most widely read authors by the German, as well as the reading public in other countries.

==Founding==

The Fritz Reuter Literary Archive came into being during the early 1970s, based on private initiative, and literary interest in Fritz Reuter. Its founder is [[Hans-Joachim Griephan]], journalist and former editor, who originally hails from Mecklenburg. The archive tries to be a gathering and documenting site for Fritz Reuter, his time and his contemporaries. Included as well are authors who influenced Reuter literarily, who see themselves in the tradition of Fritz Reuter, have done research on Fritz Reuter and his time, or have written about Fritz Reuter and his works.
&lt;!-- With its holdings and information on literature, the FRLA wants to promote Fritz Reuter studies, investigations into his life and his literary influence, and, especially, support scholarly research. The FRLA sees itself as a supplement to other institutions of Reuter reception: Fritz Reuter Gesellschaft e.V. ([[Fritz Reuter Society]]) in [[Neubrandenburg]]/Mecklenburg, Fritz Reuter-Literaturmuseum ([[Fritz Reuter Literary Museum]]) in [[Stavenhagen]]/Mecklenburg, and [[Reuter-Wagner-Museum]] in [[Eisenach]]/[[Thuringia]]. --&gt;

==Holdings==
The holdings of the FRLA also include other significant autographs and manuscripts, especially those with ties to Mecklenburg. Beyond those holdings, FRLA includes material by Fritz Reuter and Ida Hahn-Hahn (whole editions of their works, partial editions, translations into foreign languages, essays on their lives, influences, pictures and views pertaining to them, literature of their times, collections of as well as articles from newspapers and magazines). &lt;!-- Some important holdings can only be used after inquiring 24 to 48 hours ahead, because they are not kept in the main archive. --&gt;The autographs and manuscripts of the FRLA include whole albums, pages from albums, dedications, drawings (by Fritz Reuter), letters, postcards, manuscripts as well as documents and files.

Separate holdings contain, among other items, examples of texts and other papers by the preacher and poet [[Ernst Theodor Johann Brückner]] and the Neubrandenburg Brückner Family, of Reuter’s publisher [[Dethloff Carl Hinstorff]] and the Hinstorff Court Publishing House in [[Wismar]]/Mecklenburg, as well as those of Ida Countess Hahn-Hahn and [[Friedrich Griese]].

The FRLA collections contain (in selections) material by and on:
* [[John Brinckman]] (1814–1870)
* [[Ernst Theodor Johann Brückner]] (1746–1805)
* [[Friedrich Griese]] (1890–1975)
* [[Klaus Groth]] (1819–1899)
* [[Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn|Ida Gräfin Hahn-Hahn]] (1805–1880)
* [[Dethloff Carl Hinstorff]] (1811–1882)
* [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben]] (1798–1874)
* [[August Junkermann]] (1832–1915)
* [[Ludwig Pietsch]] (1824–1911)
* [[Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau|Hermann Fürst von Pückler-Muskau]] (1785–1871)
* [[Fritz Reuter]] (1810–1874)
* [[Luise Reuter]] (1817–1894)
* [[Theodor Schloepke]] (1812–1878)
* [[Otto Speckter]] (1807–1871)
* [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] (1751–1826)

'''George Ranald Macdonald''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MC|size=85%}} (4 October 1891 &amp;ndash; 13 December 1967) was a New Zealand farmer and historian. He compiled the ''MacDonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies'', a collection of 12,000 biographies held by the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]].

Macdonald was born in the [[Christchurch]] suburb of [[St Albans, New Zealand|St Albans]] in 1891. His parents were Gertrude Gould and Ranald Macintosh Macdonald, and [[George Gould (businessman)|George Gould]] was his uncle. He attended school at [[French Farm, New Zealand|French Farm]] on [[Banks Peninsula]], and [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College]] in [[Christchurch]]. He was then sent to study history at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in England, from where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1912, and a [[Master of Arts]] in 1919. He was a qualified lawyer but rarely practised in that profession.&lt;ref name="DNZB Macdonald"&gt;{{DNZB|||4m5|George Ranald Macdonald|23 April 2017|||Miller, Graham M. and Greenaway, Richard L. N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His education was interrupted by World War I, where he saw active service for the British Army after having been rejected by New Zealand forces due to his poor eyesight. After various assignments, he was with the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Corps]], was wounded on three occasions, and received the [[Military Cross]] in January 1919.&lt;ref name="DNZB Macdonald" /&gt; His citation reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=13385 |date=13 January 1919 |supp=y |page=277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer, though wounded shortly after zero hours, continued to supervise the carrying-up of supplies to the battalion with which he was working, in one case reconnoitring a village which was still occupied by the enemy. He refused to be medically treated until his section was withdrawn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When back in New Zealand, he married Beatrice Mary (Wina) Clifford of [[Cheviot, New Zealand#Stonyhurst Station|Stonyhurst Station]] at [[Waipara]] on 14 February 1922; they were to have four sons.&lt;ref name="DNZB Macdonald" /&gt; She was the granddaughter of [[Sir Charles Clifford, 1st Baronet]], one of the station's founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lundy |first1=Darryl |title=Beatrice Mary Clifford |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p22768.htm#i227673 |publisher=The Peerage |accessdate=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first farming venture failed. When his father died in 1928, he inherited Lowry Hills near [[Cheviot, New Zealand|Cheviot]]. Disillusioned with farming, he sold his farm, bought another, and then retired to [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Macdonald" /&gt;

In his retirement, Macdonald compiled the ''MacDonald dictionary of Canterbury biographies'', a collection of 12,000 biographies held by the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Macdonald" /&gt;

== University Life and Life as Professor ==
Helena Concannon was an excellent student being educated by the Loreto nuns in Coleraine. In 1897, Helena Concannon studied modern languages at the Royal University of Ireland on a three-year scholarship. She studied abroad during these years as in 1899, she travelled to Germany and studied German in Berlin University accompanied by her friend, Mary Macken. Concannon then travelled to France to study French in Sorbonne. In 1900, Concannon graduated Bachelor of Arts with first class honours and went on to study Master of Arts in 1902 at the Royal University of Ireland. Concannon was fortunate to being one of the first generation of educated women.&lt;ref name="Paseta, S.P. (2005), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Available at: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50993"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50993|title=Helena Concannon|website=''oxforddnb.com''|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, Concannon married Thomas Concannon who she met in 1900, when he arrived home from America. They settled down in Co.Galway where they shared the same love for the Irish Language and wrote many Irish texts. In Galway, Concannon was a professor at the University of Galway where she taught history, which mainly involved the history of Irish Women. In 1909, Concannon was offered a lectureship at University of College Dublin, in Italian, but the offer was then drawn before she could accept, so she decided to pursue the writing career.&lt;ref name="Paseta, S.P. (2005), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Available at: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50993" /&gt;

==Writing career==
In 1909 she was offered a lecturer position at [[University College Dublin]] and after the offer was withdrawn she began her writing career.&lt;ref name="Paseta, S.P. (2005), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Available at: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50993"/&gt; She produced over twenty books and published a number of works on religion, [[history of Ireland]] and Irish women's history. Her works were highly impacted by her political and nationalist views. Helena's 'analyses of Irish history was based on Catholicism and patriotism'.&lt;ref name="Paseta, S.P.

(2005), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Available at: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50993"/&gt;

Her first writings were love poems to her husband [[Thomas Concannon.]] These poems were 'simple, sensuous and passionate'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macken|first=Mary M.|year=1953|title=Musings and Memories: Helena Concannon, M.A., D.Litt.

She also produced a number of imaginative historical text for children. She used her married name for her publications and her first book was published in 1914 titled as A Garden of girls, or the famous schoolgirls of former days, it was about 'school life and education of real little girls'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=V01-76iQ48gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing|last=Bourke|first=Angela|date=2002|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814799062|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next well known piece was the Life of st.

Her most common publication the Women of Ninety Eight was dedicated to all the dead women and all the living ones who have given their loved ones. This book emerged on the ideologies of [[Catholicism]] and patriotism "praising the devotion of Irish nationalist women while emphasising the centrality of women's spiritual and domestic role in the home to the well-being of the nation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com.ucd.idm.oclc.org/view/article/50993|title=Helena Concannon|website=oxforddnb.com.ucd.idm.oclc.org|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this work was written during the time of [[War of Independence]], Helena Concannon stressed the importance of women help during the rebellion as "they acted as messengers and intelligence officers", and in some cases, they fought as any men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10974/1/425459.pdf|title=What can women give but tears': Gender, politics and Irish national Identity in 1790s|last=Kennedy|first=Catriona A.|year=2004|website=|archive-url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/10974/1/425459.pdf|archive-date=22 November 2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the Dáil ==
Helena Concannon started her political career in [[Dáil Éireann|the Dáil]], she was in the Dáil from 8 February 1933, after the 1933 general election, until 14 June 1937. She was as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the National University of Ireland constituency. She was a part of the 8th Dáil, in which Fianna Fail leader [[Éamon de Valera|Eamonn DeValera]] took the presidency of the executive council from W.T Cosgrave, making him the second President of the Executive Council of Ireland. Her constituency 'National University of Ireland' also had two other TDs representing in the same Dáil, Mr Conor Alexander Maguire, a fellow Fianna Fail member and Mr. Patrick McGilligan who was part of the Fine Gael party. Her session of the Dáil had 153 seats.

Concannon, in 1933, voted 'Yes' along with 81 others for Eamonn De Valera to the President of the Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1933020800003?opendocument]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/yearlist?readform&amp;chamber=dail|title=Dáil Debates|last=Cocannon|first=Helena|date=22 November 2017|website=House of Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, she voted for 'The Control of Imports Orders' Quota 2 and Quota 3 along with 65 other TDs in the first and 60 others in the latter. She voted yes with the majority on every issue posed on 13 February 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1935021300028?opendocument|title=Parliamentary Debates|last=Team|first=Fujitsu/Oireachtas Lotus Notes/Domino Development|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She voted 'No' to for the Dáil  to condemn the Executive Council for 'its neglect to secure a quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain adequate to the needs of our agricultural industry.'—(Patrick Hogan, Richard Curran.)on the issue of Exporting cattle to England, with the majority.&lt;ref name="dail1935021300030"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1935021300030?opendocument|title=Parliamentary Debates|last=Team|first=Fujitsu/Oireachtas Lotus Notes/Domino Development|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She voted 'No' to for the Dáil  to condemn the Executive Council for 'its neglect to secure a quota for the export of cattle to Great Britain adequate to the needs of our agricultural industry.'—(Patrick Hogan, Richard Curran.)on the issue of Exporting cattle to England, with the majority.&lt;ref name="dail1935021300030"/&gt;

Concerning the 'Land Purchase (Guarantee Fund) Bill, 1935' which according to Mr. Bennet would have negatively impacted the rural middle class of which he was a representative, Bennet accuses Concannon and her fellow Dublin men of not caring about the people  of the country  "If Deputy Kelly, Deputy Donnelly or Deputy Mrs. Concannon were asked to apply a retrospective liability of this character to the citizens of Dublin, would they comply with the request? They know they would not. Because this Bill affects, in the main, the hardworking agriculturists, Deputy Kelly, Deputy Mrs. Concannon and other City Deputies can view it with equanimity."-Bennet Concannon went on to vote that the Dail should disagree with the Seanad propose bill with 71 others&lt;ref name="dail1936011500003"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1936011500003?opendocument|title=Parliamentary Debates|last=Team|first=Fujitsu/Oireachtas Lotus Notes/Domino Development|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, she was a TD in the Dail as a University representative, she voted to annexe University representation in the Dail, in following with her parties views. Leading to one TD saying " I am very much surprised to see such a distinguished scholar and such a great contributor to Irish literature as Deputy Mrs. Concannon voting for the disfranchisement of the University that she has so well and so ably represented. "-Mr. J.M. Burke&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/yearlist?readform&amp;chamber=dail|title=Dáil Debates|last=Burke|first=J.M.|date=22 November 2017|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concannon stays silent through the duration of this debate causing one TD to voice how he has yet to hear her speak "About Deputy Mrs. Concannon I can say less, because I have not had the pleasure of hearing her speak." He then goes on to accuse her of party politics" I have noticed, however, that she votes with commendable—I do not know whether I should say commendable—but at any rate with complete regularity in the Lobby of her particular Party, and that she never strays into the other Lobby by chance or accident. It seems to me that even if a University representative is a member of a Party he should have that extra little amount of detachment that would guide him sometimes into the opposite Lobby from his Party, because no Party can be always right."''' '''Mr. MacDermot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1936020500043?opendocument|title=Parliamentary Debates|last=Team|first=Fujitsu/Oireachtas Lotus Notes/Domino Development|website=oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She did not respond that day, but the next day when discussions on the subject began again, she opened the talks. Sticking with her party's view that University constituents shouldn't be separated from other constituents giving the figure that out of 2000 student voters who voted for her only one wrote in to say university representation should continue and that she read that to her party but as it was only one who wanted this, she was representing her university constituents by voting the university TDs should be abolished. She voted this way and won. Although the Chair of the Dail said after the vote had been won by Concannon's side "I am certifying the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill, 1934, under Article 38A of the Constitution, as containing only such modification as is necessary owing to the time which has elapsed since that Bill was first sent by the Dáil to the Seanad."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/yearlist?readform&amp;chamber=dail|title=Dáil Debates|last=Concannon|first=Helena|date=22 November|website=House of the Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on when the amendment seemed not to be taking place Concannon placed a question asking about whether moves have been made to begin the process to which W.T. Cosgrave responded that Concannon had been forced to ask the question "The Minister wants to introduce legislation to deal with this, but he has not got the legislation yet. He hopes that, by the time the legislation is introduced, this thing will be all right. The Minister knows well that this is a nice mess that he has got us into. He had to get Deputy Mrs. Concannon, a University representative, to ask a question about it so as to try and make the case that he knows something about it. Is not that the whole sum and substance of it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/yearlist?readform&amp;chamber=dail|title=Dáil Debates|last=Cosgrave|first=W.T.|date=22 November 2017|website=House of the Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concannon spoke on behalf of Irish women in the Dáil in 1936. She spoke on how Irish women a fundamental role in Ireland's agricultural economy and so more money should be put towards educating these women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/datelist?readform&amp;chamber=dail&amp;year=1936|title=Parliamentary Debates|last=Team|first=Fujitsu/Oireachtas Lotus Notes/Domino Development|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concannon didn't object to Bunreacht na hEireann the constitution put forward by her party man De Valera, although many women at the time did.

She did not contest the Dáil election of 1937

== Life in the Seanad ==
Helena Concannon was elected in the 1938 general election to the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad Eireann]] for the [[National University of Ireland]] constituency. She was a popular figure and was re-elected by voters each election in the Seanad until she died in 1952. Concannon was one of the minority voices against the part appointed to women [[Éamon de Valera|De Valera]]'s constitution. Helena was a member of the Seaned for 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/printPerson/283|title=Helena Concannon|last=Newman|first=Kate|date=22 November 2017|website=Dictionary of Ulster Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Musings and Memories: Helena Concannon|last=Macken|first=Mary|publisher=Irish Province of the Society of Jesus|year=1953|isbn=|location=Ireland|pages=90–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helena's very first year in the Seanad was in 1938. She was a member for a year and then was re-elected by popular vote in the next general election. She spent the next five years of her life (1938-1943) in the 3rd Seanad with the party [[Fianna Fáil]]. In 1944 she was voted back in again until 1948, and so on until her death in February 1952.

Helena Cocannon was not the only senator elected for the [[National University of Ireland (constituency)|National University of Ireland]]. She was elected alongside Dr. Henry Leo Barniville and Professor Micheal Tierney. Helena wanted Senator [[Seán Goulding|Sean Goulding]] to by the cathaoirlech of the Seanad. She was the first person to talk about nominating Senator Sean Goulding and after she did he won a place in the Seanad. She mentions that he was patient and helpful with everyone, and they all had to step in and help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=2&amp;ConstID=203&amp;disp=mem|title=Seanad Members' Directory|last=Concannon|first=Helena|date=22 November 2017|website=House of Oireachtas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theres a woman for you!

The '''High Middle Ages''', or '''High Medieval Period''', was the [[periodization|period]] of [[European history]] that commenced around 1000 and lasted until around 1250. The High [[Middle Ages]] were preceded by the [[Early Middle Ages]] and were followed by the [[Late Middle Ages]], which by convention, ended around 1500.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150-1309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Key historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the [[medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], including the first developments of [[rural exodus]] and of [[urbanization]]. By 1250, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|series of calamities]], most notably the [[Black Death]], but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation.

From around 780{{cn|date=May 2018}}, Europe saw the last of the [[barbarian invasions]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fafich.ufmg.br/hist_discip_grad/barbarians_inavsions_halsall.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2017}} and became more socially and politically organized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173036/?site_locale=en_GB&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carolingian Renaissance]] led to scientific and philosophical activity in Northern Europe. The [[Medieval universities|first universities]] started operating in Bologna, Paris, Oxford and Modena. The [[Viking]]s settled in the British Isles, France and elsewhere, and Norse Christian kingdoms started developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Magyars]] ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, a Christian [[Kingdom of Hungary]] had become a recognized state in [[Central Europe]] that was forming alliances with regional powers. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century, major nomadic incursions ceased. The powerful [[Byzantine Empire]] of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian]] and the [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenos]] dynasties gradually gave way to the resurrected [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbia]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and to a successor [[Latin Empire|crusader state]] (1204 to 1261), which countered the continuous threat of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]].

In the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began a more intensive settlement, targeting "new" lands, some of which areas had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the "great clearances",&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans cleared and cultivated some of the vast forests and marshes that lay across of the continent. At the same time, some settlers moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers beyond the [[Elbe River]], which tripled the size of Germany in the process. The [[Catholic Church]], which reached the peak of its political power around then, called armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the Seljuk Turks. The crusaders occupied the [[Holy Land]] and founded the [[Crusader States]] in the [[Levant]]. Other wars led to the [[Northern Crusades]]. The Christian kingdoms [[Reconquista|took much of the Iberian Peninsula]] from [[Muslim]] control, and the [[Normans]] conquered southern Italy, all part of the major population increases and the resettlement patterns of the era.

The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The age also saw the rise of [[ethnocentrism]], which evolved later into modern [[civic nationalism]]s in most of Europe, the ascent of the great Italian [[city-state]]s and the rise and fall of the Muslim civilization of [[Al-Andalus]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]] led [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers of the period to expand [[Scholasticism]], a combination of Catholicism and ancient philosophy. For much of this period, [[Constantinople]] remained Europe's most populous city, and Byzantine art reached a [[Byzantine civilization in the twelfth century|peak in the 12th century]]. In architecture, many of the most notable [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]] were built or completed around this period.

The [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]] began at the start of the 14th century and marked the end of the period.

[[File:Aleanor of Aqutaine and Henri II.jpg|thumb|The painted effigies of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry II of England]] from the [[Fontevraud Abbey]] in [[Anjou]], France, which no longer houses their remains]]
In England, the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 resulted in a kingdom ruled by a [[French language|Francophone]] nobility. The [[Normans]] invaded Ireland by force in 1169 and soon established themselves throughout most of the country, although their stronghold was the southeast. Likewise, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were subdued to vassalage at about the same time, though Scotland later asserted its independence and Wales remained largely under the rule of independent native princes until the death of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd|Llywelyn ap Gruffydd]] in 1282.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Rees (2001-05-01). "Wales: A Culture Preserved". bbc.co.uk/history. p. 3. Retrieved 2008-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Exchequer]] was founded in the 12th century under [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], and the first [[Parliament of England|parliaments]] were convened. In 1215, after the loss of [[Normandy]], [[John of England|King John]] signed the [[Magna Carta]] into law, which limited the power of [[List of monarchs of England|English monarchs]].

===Spain and Italy===
{{main|Spain in the Middle Ages|Italy in the Middle Ages}}

Much of the [[Iberian peninsula]] had been occupied by the [[Moors]] after 711, although the northernmost portion was divided between several Christian states. In the 11th century, and again in the thirteenth, the Christian kingdoms of the north gradually drove the Muslims from central and most of southern Iberia.

In Italy, independent city states grew affluent on eastern maritime trade. These were in particular the [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] of [[Pisa]], [[Amalfi]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].

===Scandinavia===
{{main|History of Denmark#Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark|History of Norway#The Viking kings|Early Swedish history}}

From the mid-tenth to the mid-11th centuries, the Scandinavian kingdoms were unified and Christianized, resulting in an end of [[Viking]] raids, and greater involvement in European politics. King [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] of Denmark ruled over both England and Norway. After Cnut's death in 1035, England and Norway were lost, and with the defeat of [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] in 1227, Danish predominance in the region came to an end. Meanwhile, Norway extended its Atlantic possessions, ranging from [[Greenland]] to the [[Isle of Man]], while Sweden, under [[Birger Jarl]], built up a power-base in the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, the Norwegian influence started to decline already in the same period, marked by the [[Treaty of Perth]] of 1266. Also, [[Civil war era in Norway|civil wars raged in Norway]] between 1130 and 1240.

===France and Germany===
{{main|France in the Middle Ages|Germany in the Middle Ages}}

By the time of the High Middle Ages, the [[Carolingian Empire]] had been divided and replaced by separate successor kingdoms called France and Germany, although not with their modern boundaries. Germany was under the banner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which reached its high-water mark of unity and political power.

===Georgia===
{{Main article|Georgian Golden Age}}
During the successful reign of King [[David IV of Georgia]] (1089–1125), [[Kingdom of Georgia]] grew in strength and expelled the [[Seljuk Empire]] from its lands. David's decisive victory in the [[Battle of Didgori]] (1121) against the Seljuk Turks, as a result of which Georgia recaptured its lost capital [[Tbilisi]], marked the beginning of the [[Georgian Golden Age]]. David's granddaughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] continued the upward rise, successfully neutralizing internal opposition and embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by further decline of the hostile [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. Relying on a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated vast lands spanning from present-day southern [[Russian Federation|Russia]] on the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. Georgia remained a leading regional power until its collapse under the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.

===Hungary===
{{main|Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:SztIstvan 5.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|King Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]].]]
In the High Middle Ages, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (founded in 1000), became one of the most powerful medieval states in central Europe and Western Europe. King Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]] introduced Christianity to the region; he was remembered by the contemporary chroniclers as a very religious monarch, with wide knowledge in Latin grammar, strict with his own people but kind to the foreigners. He eradicated the remnants of the tribal organisation in the Kingdom and forced the people to sedentarize and adopt the [[Christian]] religion, ethics, way of life and founded the Hungarian medieval state, organising it politically in counties using the Germanic system as a model.

The following monarchs usually kept a close relationship with Rome like Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], and a tolerant attitude with the [[paganism|pagans]] that escaped to the Kingdom searching for sanctuary (for example [[Cumans]] in the 13th century), which eventually created certain discomfort for some [[Pope]]s. With entering in [[Personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)#Controversies|Kingdom of Croatia]] and annexation of other small states, Hungary became a small empire that extended its control over the [[Balkans]] and all the [[Carpathian]] region. The [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] royal house was the one that gave the most saints to the Catholic Church during medieval times.

===Poland and Lithuania===
{{main|History of Poland in the Middle Ages|Grand Duchy of Lithuania}}
During the High Middle Ages [[History of Poland (966-1385)|Poland emerged as a kingdom]]. It decided to bond itself with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], confirmed by the [[Union of Krewo]] and later treaties, leading to a personal union in 1569.

===Southeastern Europe===
:''Main articles: [[Komnenian restoration|Byzantine Empire]], [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Serbian Grand Principality]], [[Principality of Arbanon]], [[Banate of Bosnia]], and [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]]''

The High Middle Ages saw the height and decline of the Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] and emergence of [[Cumania]]. Later, the [[Mongol invasions|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century had great impact on the east of [[Europe]], as many countries of the region were invaded, pillaged, conquered and/or vassalized.

During the first half of this period ({{circa|lk=no|1025}}{{mdash}}1185) the [[Byzantine Empire]] dominated the [[Balkans]], and under the [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenian]] emperors there was a revival of prosperity and urbanization; however, their domination of [[Southeastern Europe]] came to an end with a successful [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|Vlach-Bulgarian rebellion in 1185]], and henceforth the region was divided between the Byzantines in Greece, some parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Thrace]], the Bulgarians in [[Moesia]] and most of Thrace and Macedonia, and the [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbs]] to the northwest. Eastern and Western churches had formally split in the 11th century, and despite occasional periods of co-operation during the 12th century, in 1204 the [[Fourth Crusade]] treacherously captured [[Constantinople]]. This severely damaged the Byzantines, and their power was ultimately weakened by the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuks]] and the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 14-15th century. The power of the [[Latin Empire]], however, was short lived after the Crusader army was routed by [[list of Bulgarian monarchs|Bulgarian Emperor]] [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]] in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)]].

===Climate and agriculture===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Highmiddleagesplow.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A farmer using [[ox]]en to plow a field]] --&gt;

The [[Medieval Warm Period]], the period from 10th century to about the 14th century in Europe, was a relatively warm and gentle interval ended by the generally colder [[Little Ice Age]]. Farmers grew [[wheat]] well north into Scandinavia, and [[wine]] grapes in northern England, although the maximum expansion of vineyards appears to occur within the Little Ice Age period. During this time, a high demand for wine and steady volume of alcohol consumption inspired a viticulture revolution of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Jellinek, E. M. 1976. "Drinkers and Alcoholics in Ancient Rome." Edited by Carole D. Yawney andRobert E. Popham. Journal of Studies on Alcohol 37 (11): 1718-1740.&lt;/ref&gt; This protection from [[famine]] allowed Europe's population to increase, despite the famine in 1315 that killed 1.5 million people. This increased population contributed to the founding of new towns and an increase in industrial and economic activity during the period.  They also established trade and a comprehensive production of alcohol. Food production also increased during this time as new ways of farming were introduced, including the use of a heavier plow, horses instead of oxen, and a three-field system that allowed the cultivation of a greater variety of crops than the earlier two-field system—notably [[legume]]s, the growth of which prevented the depletion of important nitrogen from the soil.

===The rise of chivalry===
Household heavy cavalry ([[knight]]s) became common in the 11th century across Europe, and [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] were invented. Although the heavy capital investment in horse and armor was a barrier to entry, knighthood became known as a way for serfs to earn their freedom.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the 12th century, the [[Cluny]] monks promoted ethical warfare and inspired the formation of [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]], such as the [[Knights Templar|Templar Knights]]. Inherited titles of nobility were established during this period. In 13th-century Germany, knighthood became another [[inheritance|inheritable]] title, although one of the less prestigious, and the trend spread to other countries.

==Religion==
[[File:Limestone sculpture of Aaron.jpg|thumb|A limestone statue depicting [[Aaron]], brother of Moses in the Old Testament, from the Cathedral of [[Noyon]], {{circa|lk=no|1170}}]]
===Christian Church===
The [[East–West Schism]] of 1054 formally separated the Christian church into two parts: [[Roman Catholicism|Western Catholicism]] in Western Europe and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] in the east. It occurred when [[Pope Leo IX]] and [[Michael Cerularius|Patriarch Michael I]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] each other, mainly over disputes as to the existence of papal authority over the four Eastern [[patriarch]]s, as well as disagreement over the [[filioque]].

===Crusades===
{{Main
|Crusades}}
The Crusades occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries. They were conducted under papal authority with the intent of reestablishing Christian rule in ''The Holy Land'' by taking the area from the Muslim [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The Fatimids had captured Palestine in AD 970, lost it to the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073 and recaptured it in 1098, just before they lost it again in 1099 as a result of the [[First Crusade]].

====Military orders====
In the context of the crusades, monastic [[Military order (society)|military orders]] were founded that would become the template for the late medieval [[chivalric order]]s.

The [[Knights Templar]] were a Christian military order founded after the [[First Crusade]] to help protect Christian pilgrims from hostile locals and highway bandits. The order was deeply involved in banking, and in 1307 [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] (Philippine le Bel) had the entire order arrested in France and dismantled on charges of heresy.

The [[Knights Hospitaller]] were originally a [[Christian]] organization founded in [[Jerusalem]] in 1080 to provide care for poor, sick, or injured [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to the Holy Land. After Jerusalem was taken in the First Crusade, it became a [[religious order|religious]]/[[Military order (society)|military order]] that was charged with the care and defence of the Holy Lands. After the Holy Lands were eventually taken by Muslim forces, it moved its operations to [[Rhodes]], and later [[Malta]].

The [[Teutonic Knights]] were a German religious order formed in 1190, in the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], to both aid Christian pilgims on their way to the Holy Lands and to operate hospitals for the sick and injured in [[Extremer]]. After Muslim forces captured the Holy Lands, the order moved to [[Transylvania]] in 1211 and later, after being expelled, invaded pagan [[Prussic]] with the intention of Christianizing the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region. Yet, before and after the Order's main pagan opponent, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted]] to Christianity, the Order had already attacked other Christian nations such as [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]]. The Teutonic Knights' power hold, which became considerable, was broken in 1410, at the [[Battle of Grunwald]], where the Order suffered a devastating defeat against a joint Polish-Lithuanian army. After Grunwald, the Order declined in power until 1809 when it was officially dissolved.  There were ten crusades in total.

===Scholasticism===
{{main|Scholasticism}}

The new [[Christian]] method of learning was influenced by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033–1109) from the rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]], at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and Muslim Philosophy ([[Maimonides]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]) and then through [[Aristotle]]'s own works brought back from [[Byzantine]] and Muslim libraries; and those whom he influenced, most notably [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Bonaventure]] and [[Peter Abelard|Abélard]]. Many scholastics believed in [[empiricism]] and supporting Roman Catholic doctrines through secular study, reason, and logic. They opposed [[Christian mysticism]], and the Platonist-Augustinian belief that the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind]] is an immaterial substance. The most famous of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] was [[Thomas Aquinas]] (later declared a "[[Doctor of the Church]]"), who led the move away from the [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] and towards Aristotelianism. Aquinas developed a [[philosophy of mind]] by writing that the [[mind]] was at birth a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate") that was given the ability to think and recognize forms or ideas through a divine spark. Other notable scholastics included [[Roscellinus|Roscelin]], Abélard, [[Peter Lombard]], and [[Francisco Suárez]]. One of the main questions during this time was the [[problem of universals]]. Prominent opponents of various aspects of the scholastic mainstream included [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Peter Damian]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], and the [[Victorines]]. {{Ref|Scholasticism}}

===Golden age of monasticism===
* The late 11th century/early-mid 12th century was the height of the golden age of [[Christian monasticism]] (8th-12th centuries).
** [[Benedictine Order]] - black-robed monks
** [[Cistercian Order]] - white-robed monks
*** [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]

===Mendicant orders===
* The 13th century saw the rise of the [[Mendicant order]]s such as the:
** [[Franciscan]]s (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209
** [[Carmelite]]s (Hermits of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206–1214
** [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215
** [[Augustinians]] (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1256

===Heretical movements===
Christian  [[Heresy|heresies]] existed in Europe before the 11th century but only in small numbers and of local character: in most cases, a rogue priest, or a village returning to pagan traditions. Beginning in the 11th century, however mass-movement heresies appeared. The roots of this can be partially sought in the rise of urban cities, free merchants, and a new money-based economy. The rural values of monasticism held little appeal to urban people who began to form sects more in tune with urban culture. The first large-scale heretical movements in Western Europe originated in the newly urbanized areas such as southern France and northern Italy and were probably influenced by the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] and other [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist movements]]. These heresies were on a scale the Catholic Church had never seen before; the response was one of elimination for some (such as the [[Cathars]]), and acceptance and integration of others (such as the veneration of [[Francis of Assisi]], the son of an urban merchant who renounced money).

====Cathars====
[[File:cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209]]

{{main|Catharism}}

'''Catharism''' was a movement with [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] elements that originated around the middle of the 10th century, branded by the contemporary [[Roman Catholic Church]] as [[heresy|heretical]]. It existed throughout much of [[Western Europe]], but its origination was in [[Languedoc]] and surrounding areas in southern France.

The name ''Cathar'' stems from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''katharos'', "pure". One of the first recorded uses is [[Eckebert|Eckbert von Schönau]] who wrote on heretics from Cologne in 1181: "Hos nostra Germania catharos appellat."

The Cathars are also called '''Albigensians'''. This name originates from the end of the 12th century, and was used by the chronicler [[Geoffroy du Breuil]] of Vigeois in 1181. The name refers to the southern town of [[Albi]] (the ancient Albiga). The designation is hardly exact, for the centre was at [[Toulouse]] and in the neighbouring districts.

The [[Catharism|Albigensians]] were strong in southern France, northern Italy, and the southwestern [[Holy Roman Empire]].

The [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] were strong in the [[Balkans]], and became the [[Bosnian Church|official religion supported by the Bosnian kings]].
* [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualists]] believed that historical events were the result of struggle between a good force and an evil force and that evil ruled the world, though it could be controlled or defeated through [[asceticism]] and good works.
* [[Albigensian Crusade]], [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], [[Montségur]], [[Château de Quéribus]]

====Waldensians====
[[Peter Waldo]] of [[Lyon]] was a wealthy merchant who gave up his riches around 1175 after a religious experience and became a preacher. He founded the [[Waldensians]] which became a Christian sect believing that all religious practices should have scriptural basis. Waldo was denied the right to preach his sermons by the Third Lateran Council in 1179, which he did not obey and continued to speak freely until he was excommunicated in 1184. Waldo was critical of the Christian clergy saying they did not live according to the word. He rejected the practice of selling indulgences, as well as the common saint cult practices of the day.

Waldensians are considered a forerunner to the [[Protestant Reformation]], and they melted into [[Protestantism]] with the outbreak of the Reformation and became a part of the wider [[Reformed tradition]] after the views of [[John Calvin]] and his theological successors in [[Geneva]] proved very similar to their own theological thought. Waldensian churches still exist, located on several continents.

==Trade and commerce==
In Northern Europe, the [[Hanseatic League]], a federation of free cities to advance trade by sea, was founded in the 12th century, with the foundation of the city of [[Lübeck]], which would later dominate the League, in 1158{{mdash}}1159. Many northern cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] became hanseatic cities, including [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], [[Bremen]], [[Hanover]] and Berlin. Hanseatic cities outside the Holy Roman Empire were, for instance, [[Bruges]] and the Polish city of [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig), as well as Königsberg, capital of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights.  In [[Bergen]], Norway and [[Veliky Novgorod]], Russia the league had factories and middlemen. In this period the Germans started colonising Europe beyond the Empire, into [[Prussia]] and [[Silesia]].

In the late 13th century, a [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer named [[Marco Polo]] became one of the first Europeans to travel the [[Silk Road]] to China. Westerners became more aware of the Far East when Polo documented his travels in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]''. He was followed by numerous Christian missionaries to the East, such as [[William of Rubruck]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], [[André de Longjumeau]], [[Odoric of Pordenone]], [[Giovanni de' Marignolli]], [[John of Montecorvino|Giovanni di Monte Corvino]], and other travellers such as [[Niccolò de' Conti]].

==Science==
{{main|Science in the Middle Ages|Medieval medicine}}
{{further information|List of medieval European scientists}}
Philosophical and scientific teaching of the [[Early Middle Ages]] was based upon few copies and commentaries of ancient Greek texts that remained in Western Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Most of them were studied only in Latin as knowledge of Greek was very limited.

This scenario changed during the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. The intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]]. The increased contact with the Islamic world in [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Sicily]] during the [[Reconquista]], and the Byzantine world and Muslim [[Levant]] during the [[Crusades]], allowed Europeans access to scientific Arabic and Greek texts, including the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], and [[Averroes]]. The European universities aided materially in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation and propagation of these texts]] and started a new infrastructure which was needed for [[science|scientific]] communities.

At the beginning of the 13th century there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J., [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/renaissance.html "The Renaissance myth"], Quadrant 26 (11) (Nov, 1982), 51-60. (Retrieved on-line at 06-07-2007)&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural science contained in these texts began to be extended by notable [[scholastics]] such as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Precursors of the modern [[scientific method]] can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his ''[[Opus Majus]]''.

===Technology===
{{main|Medieval technology|Artes Mechanicae}}

During the 12th and 13th century in Europe there was a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. In less than a century there were more inventions developed and applied usefully than in the previous thousand years of human history all over the globe. The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption or invention of [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s, [[printing]] (though not yet with movable type), [[gunpowder]], the [[astrolabe]], [[glasses]], [[scissors]] of the modern shape, a better [[clock]], and greatly improved ships. The latter two advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Discovery]]. These inventions were influenced by foreign culture and society.

[[Alfred W. Crosby]] described some of this technological revolution in ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.

* The earliest written record of a [[windmill]] is from [[Yorkshire]], England, dated 1185.
* [[Paper]] manufacture began in Italy around 1270.
* The [[spinning wheel]] was brought to Europe (probably from India) in the 13th century.
* The [[magnetic compass]] aided navigation, first reaching Europe some time in the late 12th century.
* Eye [[glasses]] were invented in Italy in the late 1280s.
* The [[astrolabe]] returned to Europe via Islamic Spain.
* [[Fibonacci]] introduces [[Arabic numerals]] to Europe with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202.
* The West's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted [[rudder]] can be found on church carvings dating to around 1180.

{{main|Medieval art}}

Art in the High Middle Ages includes these important movements:
* [[Anglo-Saxon art]] was influential on the British Isles until the Norman Invasion of 1066
* [[Romanesque art]] continued traditions from the Classical world (not to be confused with [[Romanesque architecture]])
* [[Gothic art]] developed a distinct Germanic flavor (not to be confused with [[Gothic architecture]]).
* [[Byzantine art]] continued earlier Byzantine traditions, influencing much of Eastern Europe.
* [[Illuminated manuscripts]] gained prominence both in the Catholic and Orthodox churches

===Architecture===
[[File:Paris_Notre-Dame_cathedral_interior_nave_east_01b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Interior of [[Nôtre Dame de Paris]]]]

{{main|Gothic architecture}}

Gothic architecture superseded the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by combining [[flying buttress]]es, gothic (or pointed) [[arch]]es and [[ribbed vault]]s. It was influenced by the spiritual background of the time, being religious in essence: thin horizontal lines and grates made the building strive towards the sky. Architecture was made to appear light and weightless, as opposed to the dark and bulky forms of the previous [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] taught that light was an expression of God. Architectural techniques were adapted and developed to build churches that reflected this teaching. Colorful [[glass window]]s enhanced the spirit of lightness. As color was much rarer at medieval times than today, it can be assumed that these virtuoso works of art had an awe-inspiring impact on the common man from the street. High-rising intricate ribbed, and later [[fan vault]]ings demonstrated movement toward heaven. Veneration of God was also expressed by the relatively large size of these buildings. A gothic cathedral therefore not only invited the visitors to elevate themselves spiritually, it was also meant to demonstrate the greatness of God. The [[floor plan]] of a gothic cathedral corresponded to the rules of scholasticism: According to Erwin Panofsky's ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'', the plan was divided into sections and uniform subsections. These characteristics are exhibited by the most famous sacral building of the time: [[Notre Dame de Paris]].

===Literature===
{{main|Medieval literature}}
[[File:Apostle John and Marcion of Sinope, from JPM LIbrary MS 748, 11th c.jpg|thumb|[[John the Apostle]] and [[Marcion of Sinope]] in an Italian [[illuminated manuscript]], painting on [[vellum]], 11th century]]
A variety of cultures influenced the literature of the High Middle Ages, one of the strongest among them being Christianity. The connection to Christianity was greatest in [[Latin literature]], which influenced the [[vernacular]] languages in the [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]] of the [[Matter of Rome]]. Other [[literary]] cycles, or interrelated groups of stories, included the [[Matter of France]] (stories about [[Charlemagne]] and his court), the [[Acritic songs]] dealing with the chivalry of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium's]] frontiersmen, and perhaps the best known cycle, the [[Matter of Britain]], which featured tales about [[King Arthur]], his court, and related stories from [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and Ireland. An anonymous German poet tried to bring the Germanic myths from the [[Migration Period]] to the level of the French and British epics, producing the [[Nibelungenlied]]. There was also a quantity of poetry and historical writings which were written during this period, such as ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].

Despite political decline during the late 12th and much of the 13th centuries, the Byzantine scholarly tradition remained particularly fruitful over the time period. One of the most prominent philosophers of the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]], reinvigorated [[Neoplatonism]] on Christian foundations and bolstered the study of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient philosophical texts]], along with contributing to history, grammar, and rhetorics. His pupil and successor at the head of Philosophy at the [[University of Constantinople]] [[John Italus|Ioannes Italos]] continued the Platonic line in Byzantine thought and was criticized by the Church for holding opinions it considered heretical, such as the doctrine of [[Reincarnation|transmigration]]. Two Orthodox theologians important in the dialogue between the eastern and western churches were [[Nikephoros Blemmydes]] and [[Maximus Planudes]]. Byzantine historical tradition also flourished with the works of the brothers [[Niketas Choniates|Niketas]] and [[Michael Choniates]] in the beginning of the 13th century and [[George Akropolites]] a generation later. Dating from 12th century Byzantine Empire is also [[Timarion]], an Orthodox Christian anticipation of [[Divine Comedy]]. Around the same time the so-called [[Byzantine novel]] rose in popularity with its synthesis of ancient pagan and contemporaneous Christian themes.

At the same time southern France gave birth to [[Occitan literature]], which is best known for [[troubadour]]s who sang of [[courtly love]]. It included elements from Latin literature and Arab-influenced Spain and North Africa. Later its influence spread to several cultures in Western Europe, notably in Portugal and the Minnesänger in Germany. Provençal literature also reached Sicily and Northern Italy laying the foundation of the [[Dolce Stil Nuovo|"sweet new style"]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and later [[Petrarch|Petrarca]]. Indeed, the most important poem of the [[Late Middle Ages]], the allegorical ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' is to a large degree a product of both the [[Summa Theologica|theology of Thomas Aquinas]] and the largely secular Occitan literature.

===Music===
{{main|Medieval music}}
[[File:Vihuela de arco y vihuela de péñola en las Cantigas.jpg|thumb|Musicians playing the Spanish ''[[vihuela]]'', one with a bow, the other plucked by hand, in the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'' of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], 13th century]]
[[File:Organistrum Orense 200708.jpg|thumb|Men playing the [[organistrum]], from the [[Ourense Cathedral]], Spain, 12th century]]
The surviving music of the High Middle Ages is primarily religious in nature, since [[music notation]] developed in religious institutions, and the application of notation to secular music was a later development. Early in the period, [[Gregorian chant]] was the dominant form of church music; other forms, beginning with [[organum]], and later including [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]], and the [[motet]], developed using the chant as source material.

During the 11th century, [[Guido of Arezzo]] was one of the first to develop musical notation, which made it easier for singers to remember Gregorian chants.

It was during the 12th and 13th centuries that Gregorian plainchant gave birth to polyphony, which appeared in the works of French [[Notre Dame School]] ([[Léonin]] and [[Pérotin]]). Later it evolved into the ''[[ars nova]]'' ([[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]]) and the musical genres of late Middle Ages. An important composer during the 12th century was the [[nun]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]].

The most significant secular movement was that of the [[troubadour]]s, who arose in [[Occitania]] (Southern France) in the late 11th century. The troubadours were often [[itinerant entertainer|itinerant]], came from all classes of society, and wrote songs on a variety of topics, though with a particular focus on [[courtly love]]. Their style went on to influence the [[trouvère]]s of northern France, the [[minnesinger]]s of Germany, and the composers of secular [[music of the Trecento]] in northern Italy.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Medieval theatre
}}
Economic and political changes in the High Middle Ages led to the formation of  [[guilds]] and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker's guild would perform a reenactment of the [[Last Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of English literature for Students, by Robert Huntington Fletcher, 1916: pp. 85-88&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages. Many of these plays contained [[comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from France and Germany and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing sex and bodily excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 96)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="91645">The '''history of scientific method''' considers changes in the methodology of scientific inquiry, as distinct from the [[history of science]] itself. The development of rules for [[scientific reasoning]] has not been straightforward; scientific  method has been the subject of intense and recurring debate throughout the history of science, and eminent natural philosophers and scientists have argued for the primacy of one or another approach to establishing scientific knowledge. Despite the disagreements about approaches, scientific method has advanced in definite steps. Rationalist explanations of nature, including [[atomism]], appeared both in ancient Greece in the thought of [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and in ancient India, in the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]] and Buddhist schools, while [[Charvaka]] materialism rejected inference as a source of knowledge in favour of an empiricism that was always subject to doubt. Aristotle pioneered scientific method in ancient Greece alongside his empirical biology and his work on logic, rejecting a purely deductive framework in favour of generalisations made from observations of nature.

Some of the most important debates in the history of scientific method center on: [[rationalism]], especially as advocated by [[René Descartes]]&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[inductivism]], which rose to particular prominence with [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers; and [[hypothetico-deductivism]], which came to the fore in the early 19th century.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a debate over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] vs. [[antirealism]] was central to discussions of scientific method as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable, while in the mid-20th century some prominent philosophers argued against any universal rules of [[science]] at all.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Achinstein, "General Introduction" (pp. 1–5) to ''Science Rules: A Historical Introduction to Scientific Methods''.  Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004.  {{ISBN|0-8018-7943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early methodology==
[[File:Edwin Smith Papyrus v2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]], an ancient Egyptian medical textbook of c. 1600 BCE, set out an  [[empirical method]].]]

There are few explicit discussions of scientific methodologies in surviving records from early cultures.  The most that can be inferred about the approaches to undertaking science in this period stems from descriptions of early investigations into nature, in the surviving records.  An [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egyptian medical]] textbook, the [[Edwin Smith papyrus]], (c. 1600 BCE), applies the following components: examination, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, to the treatment of disease,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9032043&amp;query=Edwin%20Smith%20papyrus&amp;ct=&lt;/ref&gt;  which display strong parallels to the basic [[empirical method]] of science and according to [[G. E. R. Lloyd]]&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G. E. R.  "The development of empirical research", in his ''Magic, Reason and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Development of Greek Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE) also contains evidence of traditional [[empiricism]].

By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Babylonian astronomy]] had evolved into the earliest example of a scientific astronomy, as it was "the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena." According to the historian [[Asger Aaboe]], "all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the [[Hellenistic astronomy|Hellenistic world]], [[Indian astronomy|in India]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|in the Islamic world]], and in [[Science in Medieval Western Europe|the West]] – if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the [[exact science]]s – depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."&lt;ref name=Aaboe&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity |author=A. Aaboe |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |volume=276 |issue=1257 |date=2 May 1974 |pages=21–42 |jstor=74272 |doi=10.1098/rsta.1974.0007 |bibcode=1974RSPTA.276...21A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] developed much technical knowledge, crafts, and mathematics&lt;ref name="Egypt,CradleOfMathematics"&gt;"The cradle of mathematics is in Egypt." – Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', as cited on page 1 of Olaf Pedersen (1993) ''Early physics and astronomy: a historical introduction'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, revised edition&lt;/ref&gt; used in practical tasks of divination, as well as a knowledge of medicine,&lt;ref&gt;"There each man is a leech skilled beyond all human kind; yea, for they are of the race of [[Paeon (god)|Paeeon]]." – Homer, ''Odyssey''  book IV, acknowledges the skill of the ancient Egyptians in medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; and made lists of various kinds. While the Babylonians in particular had engaged in the earliest forms of an [[empirical]] mathematical science, with their early attempts at mathematically describing natural phenomena, they generally lacked underlying rational theories of nature.&lt;ref name=Aaboe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pingree&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hellenophilia versus the History of Science|author=Pingree, David |authorlink=David Pingree |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=83|issue=4 |date=December 1992|pages=554–563 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|jstor=234257 |doi=10.1086/356288|bibcode=1992Isis...83..554P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Empiricism in Babylonian Omen Texts and the Classification of Mesopotamian Divination as Science |author=Rochberg, Francesca |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |volume=119|issue=4 |date=October–December 1999 |pages=559–569 |publisher=[[American Oriental Society]]|jstor=604834|doi=10.2307/604834}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the ancient Greeks who engaged in the earliest forms of what is today recognized as a rational theoretical science,&lt;ref name=Pingree/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves Gingras, Peter Keating, and Camille Limoges, ''Du scribe au savant: Les porteurs du savoir de l'antiquité à la révolution industrielle,'' Presses universitaires de France, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; with the move towards a more rational understanding of nature which began at least since the Archaic Period (650 – 480 BCE) with the Presocratic school. [[Thales]] was the first to use natural explanations, proclaiming that every event had a natural cause, even though he is known for saying "all things are full of gods" and sacrificed an ox when he discovered his theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226184487|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leucippus]], went on to develop the theory of [[atomism]] – the idea that everything is composed entirely of various imperishable, indivisible elements called [[atom]]s. This was elaborated in great detail by [[Democritus]].

Similar atomist ideas emerged independently among ancient [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]] of the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]] and [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman, ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, 1999 , page 269.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, like the Nyaya, Vaisesika, and Buddhist schools, the [[Cārvāka]] epistemology was materialist, and skeptical enough to admit perception as the basis for unconditionally true knowledge, while cautioning that if one could only infer a truth, then one must also harbor a doubt about that truth; an inferred truth could not be unconditional.&lt;ref&gt;Kamal, M.M. (1998), "The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy", ''Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies'', '''46'''(2): pp.13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the middle of the 5th century BCE, some of the components of a scientific tradition were already heavily established, even before Plato, who was an important contributor to this emerging tradition, thanks to the development of deductive reasoning, as propounded by his student, [[Aristotle]].  In ''Protagoras'' (318d-f), [[Plato]] mentioned the teaching of arithmetic, astronomy and geometry in schools. The philosophical ideas of this time were mostly freed from the constraints of everyday phenomena and [[common sense]]. This denial of reality as we experience it reached an extreme in [[Parmenides]] who argued that the world is one and that change and subdivision do not exist.

In the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE, the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physicians [[Herophilos]] (335–280 BCE) and [[Erasistratus of Chios]] employed experiments to further their medical research; Erasistratus at one time repeatedly weighing a caged bird, and noting its weight loss between feeding times.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, ''Hellenistic Philosophy and Science'', pp. 383–384&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|[[Aristotle]]'s philosophy involved both inductive and deductive reasoning.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle's inductive-deductive method used inductions from observations to infer general principles, deductions from those principles to check against further observations, and more cycles of induction and deduction to continue the advance of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gauch |first= Hugh G.|title= Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |accessdate= 10 February 2015 |year= 2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-01708-4 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Organon]]'' (Greek: Ὄργανον, meaning "instrument, tool, organ") is the standard collection of [[Aristotle]]'s six works on [[logic]]. The name ''Organon'' was given by Aristotle's followers, the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s.
The order of the works is not chronological (the chronology is now difficult to determine) but was deliberately chosen by [[Theophrastus]] to constitute a well-structured system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Indeed, parts of them seem to be a scheme of a lecture on logic.  The arrangement of the works was made by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] around 40 BCE.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Hammond, p.&amp;nbsp;64,  "Andronicus Rhodus"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Organon'' comprises the following six works:
# The ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Κατηγορίαι}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Categoriae}}'') introduces Aristotle's 10-fold classification of that which exists: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, situation, condition, action, and passion.
# ''[[De Interpretatione|On Interpretation]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|De Interpretatione}}'') introduces Aristotle's conception of [[proposition]] and [[judgment]], and the various relations between affirmative, negative, universal, and particular propositions. Aristotle discusses the [[square of opposition]] or square of [[Apuleius]] in Chapter 7 and its appendix Chapter 8. Chapter 9 deals with the [[problem of future contingents]].
# The ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Ἀναλυτικὰ Πρότερα}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Analytica Priora}}'') introduces Aristotle's [[syllogism|syllogistic]] method (see [[term logic]]), argues for its correctness, and discusses inductive inference.
# The ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Ἀναλυτικὰ Ὕστερα}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Analytica Posteriora}}'') deals with [[Demonstration (teaching)|demonstration]], [[definition]], and [[scientific knowledge]].
# The ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|Τοπικά}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|Topica}}'') treats of issues in constructing valid arguments, and of inference that is probable, rather than certain.  It is in this treatise that Aristotle mentions the [[predicables]], later discussed by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and by the scholastic logicians.
# The [[On Sophistical Refutations|''Sophistical Refutations'']] (Greek: {{lang|grc|Περὶ Σοφιστικῶν Ἐλέγχων}}, Latin: ''{{lang|la|De Sophisticis Elenchis}}'') gives a treatment of logical fallacies, and provides a key link to Aristotle's work on rhetoric.

Aristotle's [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']] has some points of overlap with the works making up the ''Organon'' but is not traditionally considered part of it; additionally there are works on logic attributed, with varying degrees of plausibility, to Aristotle that were not known to the Peripatetics.

[[Aristotle]] introduced what may be called a scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;"In the days when the Arabs inherited the culture of ancient Greece, Greek thought was chiefly interested in science, Athens was replaced by Alexandria, and Hellenism had an entirely "modem "outlook. This was an attitude with which Alexandria and its scholars were directly connected, but it was by no means confined to Alexandria. It was a logical outcome of the influence of Aristotle who before all else was a patient observer of nature, and was, in fact, the founder of modern science." Ch.1, Introduction —[[De Lacy O'Leary]] (1949), ''How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs'', London:  Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7100-1903-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His demonstration method is found in ''[[Posterior Analytics]]''. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: [[empiricism]]. For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that Aristotelian science is empirical in form.  Indeed, Aristotle did not accept that knowledge acquired by induction could rightly be counted as scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, induction was for him a necessary preliminary to the main business of scientific enquiry, providing the primary premises required for scientific demonstrations.

Aristotle largely ignored inductive reasoning in his treatment of scientific enquiry. To make it clear why this is so, consider this statement in the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other than it is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was therefore the work of the philosopher to demonstrate universal truths and to discover their causes.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nominalism#The problem of universals]] for several approaches to this goal.&lt;/ref&gt; While induction was sufficient for discovering universals by generalization, it did not succeed in identifying causes. For this task Aristotle used the tool of [[deductive reasoning]] in the form of [[syllogism]]s. Using the syllogism, scientists could infer new universal truths from those already established.

Aristotle developed a complete normative approach to scientific inquiry involving the syllogism, which he discusses at length in his ''Posterior Analytics''. A difficulty with this scheme lay in showing that derived truths have solid primary premises.  Aristotle would not allow that demonstrations could be circular (supporting the conclusion by the premises, and the premises by the conclusion). Nor would he allow an infinite number of middle terms between the primary premises and the conclusion. This leads to the question of how the primary premises are found or developed, and as mentioned above, Aristotle allowed that induction would be required for this task.

Towards the end of the ''Posterior Analytics'', Aristotle discusses knowledge imparted by induction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus it is clear that we must get to know the primary premises by induction; for the method by which even sense-perception implants the universal is inductive. [...] it follows that there will be no scientific knowledge of the primary premises, and since except intuition nothing can be truer than scientific knowledge, it will be intuition that apprehends the primary premises. [...] If, therefore, it is the only other kind of true thinking except scientific knowing, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] will be the originative source of scientific knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The account leaves room for doubt regarding the nature and extent of Aristotle's empiricism. In particular, it seems that Aristotle considers sense-perception only as a vehicle for knowledge through intuition. He restricted his investigations in natural history to their natural settings,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] (fl. 4th c. BCE, d. 322 BCE), ''[[History of Animals]]'', including [[vivisection]] of the tortoise and chameleon. His theory of [[spontaneous generation]] was not experimentally disproved until [[Francesco Redi]] (1668).&lt;/ref&gt; such as at the Pyrrha lagoon,&lt;ref&gt;Armand Leroi, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QesWw3Zz0Ms Aristotle's Lagoon - Lesvos island - Greece] name of Pyrrha lagoon, now called Kalloni, minute 5:06/57:55. His spontaneous generation disproved, minute 50:00/57:55. His lack of experiment, minute 51:00/57:55&lt;/ref&gt; now called [[Kalloni]], at [[Lesbos]]. Aristotle and Theophrastus together formulated the new science of biology,&lt;ref&gt;Armand Leroi, following in Aristotle's footsteps, projects that Aristotle interviewed the fishermen of Lesbos to learn empirical details about the animals. (Leroi, ''Aristotle's Lagoon'')&lt;/ref&gt; inductively, case by case, for two years before Aristotle was called to tutor [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. Aristotle performed no modern-style experiments in the form in which they appear in today's physics and chemistry laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;
See: [[Ancient Greek medicine#Aristotle]], which cites Annas, Julia ''Classical Greek Philosophy''. In Boardman, John; Griffin, Jasper; Murray, Oswyn (ed.) ''The Oxford History of the Classical World''. Oxford University Press: New York, 1986. {{ISBN|0-19-872112-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Induction is not afforded the status of scientific reasoning, and so it is left to intuition to provide a solid foundation for Aristotle's science. With that said, Aristotle brings us somewhat closer an empirical science than his predecessors.

===Epicurus===
In his  work Kαvώv ('canon', a straight edge or ruler, thus any type of measure or standard, referred to as 'canonic'), [[Epicurus]] laid out his first rule for inquiry in physics: 'that the ''first concepts be seen'',&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Asmis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.20}} and that they ''not require demonstration'' '.&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.35–47}}

His second rule for inquiry was that prior to an investigation, ''we are to have self-evident concepts'',&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.61–80}} so that we might infer [ἔχωμεν οἷς σημειωσόμεθα] both what is expected [τò προσμένον], and also what is non-apparent [τò ἄδηλον].&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.83–103}}

Epicurus applies his method of inference (the use of observations as signs, Asmis' summary, p.&amp;nbsp;333: ''the method of using the phenomena as signs (σημεῖα) of what is unobserved'')&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp|pp.175–196}} immediately to the [[atomic theory]] of [[Democritus]].  In Aristotle's ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle himself employs the use of signs.&lt;ref name="Asmis1984"/&gt;{{rp| pp.212–224}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/185720?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Madden, Edward H.

==Emergence of inductive experimental method==
During the [[Middle Ages]] issues of what is now termed science began to be addressed. There was greater emphasis on combining theory with practice in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] than there had been in Classical times, and it was common for those studying the sciences to be artisans as well, something that had been "considered an aberration in the ancient world." Islamic experts in the sciences were often expert instrument makers who enhanced their powers of observation and calculation with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Science in the Middle Ages|author=[[David C. Lindberg]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1980|isbn=0-226-48233-2|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science in medieval Islam|Muslim scientists]] used [[experiment]] and [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] to distinguish between competing scientific theories, set within a generically [[empirical]] orientation, as can be seen in the works of [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721–815)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Clarendon Press | last = Holmyard | first = E. J. | title = Makers of Chemistry | location = Oxford | year = 1931 | url = https://archive.org/details/makersofchemistr029725mbp | page = 56 | authorlink = Eric John Holmyard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]] (801–873)&lt;ref name=Plinio-17&gt;Plinio Prioreschi, "Al-Kindi, A Precursor Of The Scientific Revolution", ''Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine'', 2002 (2): 17–19 [17].&lt;/ref&gt; as early examples. Several scientific methods thus emerged from the medieval [[Muslim world]] by the early 11th century, all of which emphasized experimentation as well as quantification to varying degrees.

===Ibn al-Haytham===
[[File:Thesaurus_opticus_Titelblatt.jpg|thumb|left|"How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''."&lt;ref name=Sambursky /&gt; —[[Alhazen]] ]]
The [[Islamic physics|Arab physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). He combined [[observation]]s, [[experiment]]s and [[Rationality|rational]] arguments to support his intromission theory of [[visual perception|vision]], in which [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Ptolemy]] and [[Euclid]] (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient [[intromission theory]] supported by [[Aristotle]] (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 60–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental evidence supported most of the propositions in his ''Book of Optics'' and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics.  His legacy was elaborated through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (d. c. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen’s Optics," ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'', Vol. 15, Issue 2 (2005), pp. 189–218 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Ibn al-Haytham," in ''Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia'', eds. Thomas F. Glick, Steven J. Livesey, and Faith Wallis (New York – London: Routledge, 2005), pp. 237–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen viewed his scientific studies as a search for [[truth]]: "Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. ...&lt;ref&gt;Alhazen (Ibn Al-Haytham) ''Critique of Ptolemy'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as referenced on p.139 of Shmuel Sambursky (ed. 1974) ''Physical Thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen's work included the conjecture that "Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only", which he was able to corroborate only after years of effort. He stated, "[This] is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes. ... the entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air."&lt;ref name=Sambursky&gt;Alhazen, translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from "Abhandlung über das Licht" (Treatise on Light — رسالة في الضوء), J. Baarmann (ed. 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as referenced on p.136 by Shmuel Sambursky (1974) ''Physical thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated the conjecture by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam.&lt;ref&gt;p.136, as quoted by Shmuel Sambursky (1974) ''Physical thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists'' {{ISBN|0-87663-712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn al-Haytham also employed [[scientific skepticism]] and emphasized the role of [[empiricism]]. He also explained the role of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] in [[syllogism]], and criticized [[Aristotle]] for his lack of contribution to the method of induction, which Ibn al-Haytham regarded as superior to syllogism, and he considered induction to be the basic requirement for true scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Plott |first=C. |year=2000 |title=Global History of Philosophy: The Period of Scholasticism |isbn=81-208-0551-8 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |page=462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something like [[Occam's razor]] is also present in the ''Book of Optics''. For example, after demonstrating that light is generated by luminous objects and emitted or reflected into the eyes, he states that therefore "the [[Emission theory (vision)|extramission]] of [visual] rays is superfluous and useless."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary of the First Three Books of Alhacen's De Aspectibus, the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn al-Haytham's Kitab al-Manazir|last1=[[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]|first2=A. Mark|last2=Smith|year=2001|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=0-87169-914-1|pages=372 &amp; 408}}&lt;/ref&gt; He may also have been the first scientist to adopt a form of [[positivism]] in his approach. He wrote that "we do not go beyond experience, and we cannot be content to use pure concepts in investigating natural phenomena", and that the understanding of these cannot be acquired without mathematics. After assuming that light is a material substance, he does not further discuss its nature but confines his investigations to the diffusion and propagation of light. The only properties of light he takes into account are those treatable by geometry and verifiable by experiment.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{Citation |last=Rashed |first=Roshdi |year=2007 |title=The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham |journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy |volume=17 |pages=7–55 [19] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |doi=10.1017/S0957423907000355 }}: {{quote|"In reforming optics he, as it were, adopted ‘‘positivism’’ (before the term was invented): we do not go beyond experience, and we cannot be content to use pure concepts in investigating natural phenomena.

Thus, once he has assumed light is a material substance, Ibn al-Haytham does not discuss its nature further, but confines himself to considering its propagation and diffusion. In his optics ‘‘the smallest parts of light’’, as he calls them, retain only properties that can be treated by geometry and verified by experiment; they lack all sensible qualities except energy."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Biruni===
The [[Persian people|Persian]] scientist [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] introduced early scientific methods for several different fields of [[inquiry]] during the 1020s and 1030s. For example, in his treatise on [[mineralogy]], ''Kitab al-Jawahir'' (''Book of Precious Stones''), al-Biruni is "the most [[Exact science|exact]] of [[experiment]]al scientists", while in the introduction to his [[Indology|study of India]], he declares that "to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method" and thus became one of the pioneers of  [[comparative sociology]] in insisting on field experience and information.&lt;ref name=Sardar&gt;{{citation|first=Ziauddin|last=Sardar|author-link=Ziauddin Sardar|year=1998|contribution=Science in Islamic philosophy|title=Islamic Philosophy|publisher=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H016.htm|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed an early experimental method for [[mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Rozhanskaya-642&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S. Levinova (1996), "Statics", p. 642, in {{Harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996|pp=614–642}}: {{quote|"Using a whole body of mathematical methods (not only those inherited from the antique theory of ratios and infinitesimal techniques, but also the methods of the contemporary algebra and fine calculation techniques), Arabic scientists raised statics to a new, higher level. The classical results of Archimedes in the theory of the centre of gravity were generalized and applied to three-dimensional bodies, the theory of ponderable lever was founded and the 'science of gravity' was created and later further developed in medieval Europe. The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends – statics and dynamics – turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics. [...] Numerous fine experimental methods were developed for determining the specific weight, which were based, in particular, on the theory of balances and weighing. The classical works of al-Biruni and al-Khazini can by right be considered as the beginning of the application of experimental methods in [[medieval science]]."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Biruni's methods resembled the modern scientific method,  particularly in his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both [[systematic error]]s and observational biases, such as "errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers." He argued that if instruments produce errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, [[Qualitative research|analyzed qualitatively]], and on this basis, arrive at a "common-sense single value for the constant sought", whether an [[arithmetic mean]] or a "reliable [[Approximation|estimate]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Glick |first1=Thomas F. |last2=Livesey |first2=Steven John |last3=Wallis |first3=Faith |year=2005 |title=Medieval Science, Technology, and Medicine: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-96930-1 |pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his scientific method, "universals came out of practical, [[experiment]]al work" and "theories are formulated after discoveries", as with [[inductivism]].&lt;ref name=Sardar/&gt;

===Ibn Sina (Avicenna)===
In the ''On Demonstration'' section of ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1027), the [[Avicennism|Persian philosopher]] and scientist [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) discussed [[philosophy of science]] and described an early scientific method of inquiry. He discussed [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper procedure for scientific inquiry and the question of "How does one acquire the first principles of a science?" He asked how a scientist might find "the initial [[axiom]]s or [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?" He explained that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a "relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty." Avicenna added two further methods for finding a [[first principle]]: the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] method of induction (''istiqra''), and the more recent method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide." In its place, he advocated "a method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|volume=41|issue=3|date=July 2003|pages=307–327|doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (1025), Avicenna was also the first to describe what is essentially [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation]] which are critical to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]] and the scientific method.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodman-1992&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 33, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;James Franklin (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'', pp. 177–8, Johns Hopkins University Press, {{ISBN|0-8018-6569-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike his contemporary al-Biruni's scientific method, in which "universals came out of practical, experimental work" and "theories are formulated after discoveries", Avicenna developed a scientific procedure in which "general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work."&lt;ref name="Sardar"/&gt; Due to the differences between their methods, al-Biruni referred to himself as a mathematical [[scientist]] and to Avicenna as a [[philosopher]], during a debate between the two scholars.&lt;ref name=Dallal&gt;{{citation|first=Ahmad|last=Dallal|year=2001–2002|title=The Interplay of Science and Theology in the Fourteenth-century Kalam|publisher=From Medieval to Modern in the Islamic World, Sawyer Seminar at the [[University of Chicago]] |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/institute/sawyer/archive/islam/dallal.html |accessdate=2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert Grosseteste===
During the European [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], ideas on scientific methodology, including Aristotle's [[empiricism]] and the [[experiment]]al approaches of Alhazen and Avicenna, were introduced to medieval Europe via [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]] of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts and commentaries. [[Robert Grosseteste]]'s commentary on the ''Posterior Analytics'' places Grosseteste among the first [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers in Europe to understand [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] vision of the dual nature of scientific reasoning. Concluding from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again, from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". Further, Grosseteste said that both paths should be verified through experimentation to verify the principles.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Crombie, ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science, 1100–1700'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), pp. 52–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Bacon===
[[Roger Bacon]] was inspired by the writings of Grosseteste. In his account of a method, Bacon described a repeating cycle of ''[[observation]]'', ''[[hypothesis]]'', ''[[experiment]]ation'', and the need for independent ''verification''.{{cn|date=June 2018}} He recorded the way he had conducted his experiments in precise detail, perhaps with the idea that others could reproduce and independently test his results.

About 1256 he joined the [[Franciscan Order]] and became subject to the Franciscan statute forbidding [[Friar]]s from publishing books or pamphlets without specific approval.  After the accession of Pope [[Clement IV]] in 1265, the Pope granted Bacon a special commission to write to him on scientific matters.  In eighteen months he completed three large treatises, the ''Opus Majus'', ''Opus Minus'', and ''Opus Tertium'' which he sent to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, "Roger Bacon: His Life, Career, and Works," in Hackett, ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences,'' pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Whewell]] has called ''Opus Majus'' at once the Encyclopaedia and Organon of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Roger Bacon", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
*Part I (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–22) treats of the four causes of error: authority, custom, the opinion of the unskilled many, and the concealment of real ignorance by a pretense of knowledge.
*Part VI (pp.&amp;nbsp;445–477) treats of experimental science, ''domina omnium scientiarum''. There are two methods of knowledge: the one by argument, the other by experience. Mere argument is never sufficient; it may decide a question, but gives no satisfaction or certainty to the mind, which can only be convinced by immediate inspection or intuition, which is what experience gives.
*Experimental science, which in the ''Opus Tertium'' (p.&amp;nbsp;46) is distinguished from the speculative sciences and the operative arts, is said to have three great prerogatives over all sciences:
*#It verifies their conclusions by direct experiment;
*#It discovers truths which they could never reach;
*#It investigates the secrets of nature, and opens to us a knowledge of past and future.
*Roger Bacon illustrated his method by an investigation into the nature and cause of the [[rainbow]], as a specimen of inductive research.&lt;ref name=EBbacon&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bacon, Roger |volume=3 |page=155 |first=Robert |last=Adamson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance humanism and medicine===
Aristotle’s ideas became a framework for critical debate beginning with absorption of the Aristotelian texts into the university curriculum in the first half of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Instead of reading Aristotle directly from Greek texts, students of these texts would rely on summaries and translations of Aristotle's work, coupled with commentary by the translators, according to Elaine Limbrick, who cites Michel Reulos,  "L'Enseignement d'Aristote dans les collèges au XVIe siècle" in ''Platon et Aristote à la Renaissance'' ed. J.-C. Margolin (Paris: Vrin, 1976) pp147-154:{{harvnb| Sanches| Limbrick| Thomson| 1988|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contributing to this was the success of medieval theologians in reconciling Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. Within the sciences, medieval philosophers were not afraid of disagreeing with Aristotle on many specific issues, although their disagreements were stated within the language of Aristotelian philosophy. All medieval natural philosophers were Aristotelians, but "Aristotelianism" had become a somewhat broad and flexible concept.  With the end of Middle Ages, the [[Renaissance]] rejection of medieval traditions coupled with an extreme reverence for classical sources led to a recovery of other ancient philosophical traditions, especially the teachings of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1996,  pp. 164–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 17th century, those who clung dogmatically to Aristotle's teachings were faced with several competing approaches to nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Even Aristotle would have laughed at the stupidity of his commentators." — {{harvnb|Vives|1531}} attacks obscurity in Aristotle's works, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|pp=28–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the Americas at the close of the 15th century showed the scholars of Europe that new discoveries could be found outside of the authoritative works of Aristotle, Pliny, Galen, and other ancient writers.

[[Galen of Pergamon]] (129 – c. 200 AD) had studied with four schools in antiquity — [[Platonist]]s, [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]s, [[Stoicism|Stoic]]s, and [[Epicurean]]s, and at Alexandria, the center of medicine at the time. In his ''Methodus Medendi'', Galen had synthesized the empirical and dogmatic schools of medicine into his own method, which was preserved by Arab scholars. After the translations from Arabic were critically scrutinized, a backlash occurred and demand arose in Europe for translations of Galen's medical text from the original Greek. Galen's method became very popular in Europe. [[Thomas Linacre]], the teacher of Erasmus, thereupon translated ''Methodus Medendi'' from Greek into Latin for a larger audience in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;Galenus, Claudius (1519) ''Galenus methodus medendi, vel de morbis curandis, T. Linacro ... interprete, libri quatuordecim'' Lutetiae. as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbrick 1988 notes that 630 editions, translations, and commentaries on Galen were produced in Europe in the 16th century, eventually eclipsing Arabic medicine there, and peaking in 1560, at the time of the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Durling (1961) "A Chronological Census of Renaissance Editions and Translations of Galen", in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtald Institutes'' '''24''' pp.242-3 as cited on p. 300 of {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 15th century, the physician-scholar [[Niccolò Leoniceno]] was finding errors in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. As a physician, Leoniceno was concerned about these botanical errors propagating to the [[materia medica]] on which medicines were based.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niccolò Leoniceno]] (1509), ''De Plinii et aliorum erroribus liber'' apud Ferrara, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this, a botanical garden was established at [[Orto botanico di Padova]], University of Padua (in use for teaching by 1546), in order that medical students might have empirical access to the plants of a pharmacopia. Other Renaissance teaching gardens were established, notably by the physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]], one of the founders of [[botany]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs's book on the methods of Galen and Hippocrates became a standard medical text of 809 pages: Leonhart Fuchs (1560) ''Institutionum medicinae, sive methodi ad Hippocratis, Galeni, aliorumque veterum scripta recte intelligenda mire utiles libri quinque ...'' Editio secunda. Lugduni. As cited in {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson| 1988| pp= 61 and 301}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published work devoted to the concept of method is Jodocus Willichius, ''De methodo omnium artium et disciplinarum informanda opusculum'' (1550).{{citation needed|reason=First? Aristotle, Grosseteste...|date=February 2014}}

===Skepticism as a basis for understanding===
In 1562 "Outlines of Pyrrhonism" by [[Sextus Empiricus]] (c. 160-210 AD) appeared in print and in Latin, quickly placing the arguments of classical skepticism in the European mainstream. Skepticism either denies or strongly doubts (depending on the school) the possibility of certain knowledge. [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' famous "[[Cogito ergo sum|Cogito]]" argument is an attempt to overcome skepticism and reestablish a foundation for certainty but other thinkers responded by revising what the search for knowledge, particularly physical knowledge, might be.

The first of these, philosopher and physician [[Francisco Sanches]], was led by his medical training at Rome, 1571–73, to search for a true method of knowing (''modus sciendi''), as nothing clear can be known by the methods of Aristotle and his followers&lt;ref&gt;'I have sometimes seen a verbose quibbler attempting to persuade some ignorant person that white was black; to which the latter replied, "I do not understand your reasoning, since I have not studied as much as you have; yet I honestly believe that white differs from black. But pray go on refuting me for just as long as you like." '— {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; — for example, 1) syllogism fails upon circular reasoning; 2) Aristotle's [[modal logic]] was not stated clearly enough for use in medieval times, and remains a research problem to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#ModLog Susanne Bobzien, "Aristotle's modal logic" ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the physician Galen's ''method of medicine'', Sanches lists the methods of judgement and experience, which are faulty in the wrong hands,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=278}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and we are left with the bleak statement ''That Nothing is Known'' (1581, in Latin ''Quod Nihil Scitur''). This challenge was taken up by René Descartes in the next generation (1637), but at the least, Sanches warns us that we ought to refrain from the methods, summaries, and commentaries on Aristotle, if we seek scientific knowledge. In this, he is echoed by Francis Bacon who was influenced by another prominent exponent of skepticism, [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]; Sanches cites the humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] who sought a better educational system, as well as a statement of human rights as a pathway for improvement of the lot of the poor.

"Sanches develops his scepticism by means of an intellectual critique of Aristotelianism, rather than by an appeal to the history of human stupidity and the variety and contrariety of previous theories." —{{harvnb|Popkin|1979|p=37}}, as cited by {{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|pp=24–5}}

In the meantime, as I prepare to examine ''Things'', I shall raise the question anything is ''known'', and if so, how, in the introductory passages of another book,&lt;ref&gt;"Since, as he had shown, nothing can be known, Sanches put forward a procedure, not to gain knowledge but to deal constructively with human experience. This procedure, for which he introduced the term (for the first time) scientific method, “Metodo universal de las ciencias,” consists in patient, careful empirical research and cautious judgment and evaluation of the data we observe. This would not lead, as his contemporary Francis Bacon thought, to a key to knowledge of the world. But it would allow us to obtain the best information available. ...In advancing this limited or constructive view of science, Sanches was the first Renaissance sceptic to conceive of science in its modern form, as the fruitful activity about the study of nature that remained after one had given up the search for absolutely certain knowledge of the nature of things. {{harvnb|Popkin|2003|p=41}}"&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which I will expound, as far as human frailty allows,&lt;ref name="modoSciendi"&gt;{{harvnb|Sanches|Limbrick|Thomson|1988|p=292}} lists ''De modo sciendi'' under the Unpublished, Lost, or Projected Works [of Francisco Sanches].

===Francis Bacon's eliminative induction===
{{main|Baconian method}}

{{quote|"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."&amp;nbsp;—[[Francis Bacon]] (1605) ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]'', Book 1, v, 8}}

[[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in April 1573, where he applied himself diligently to the several sciences as then taught, and came to the conclusion that the methods employed and the results attained were alike erroneous; he learned to despise the current Aristotelian philosophy. He believed philosophy must be taught its true purpose, and for this purpose a new method must be devised. With this conception in his mind, Bacon left the university.&lt;ref name=EBbacon /&gt;

Bacon attempted to describe a rational procedure for establishing causation between phenomena based on induction. Bacon's induction was, however, radically different than that employed by the Aristotelians. As Bacon put it,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]nother form of induction must be devised than has hitherto been employed, and it must be used for proving and discovering not first principles (as they are called) only, but also the lesser axioms, and the middle, and indeed all. For the induction which proceeds by simple enumeration is childish.  —''[[Novum Organum]]'' section CV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Baconian method|Bacon's method]] relied on experimental ''histories'' to eliminate alternative theories.&lt;ref&gt;In this sense, it has been seen as a precursor to [[Falsifiability#Falsificationism|falsificationism]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Karl Popper]]. However, Bacon believed his method would produce certain knowledge, similar to Peirce's view of scientific methods as ultimately approaching the truth; with the goal of attaining knowledge of the truth, Bacon's philosophy is less sceptical than Popper's philosophy.
*Bacon precedes Peirce in another sense – his reliance on doubt: "If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties." – [[Francis Bacon]], ''The Advancement of Learning'' (1605), Book I, v, 8.
&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon explains how his method is applied in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'' (published 1620). In an example he gives on the examination of the nature of heat, Bacon creates two tables, the first of which he names "Table of Essence and Presence", enumerating the many various circumstances under which we find heat. In the other table, labelled "Table of Deviation, or of Absence in Proximity", he lists circumstances which bear resemblance to those of the first table except for the absence of heat. From an analysis of what he calls the ''natures'' (light emitting, heavy, colored, etc.) of the items in these lists we are brought to conclusions about the ''form nature'', or cause, of heat. Those natures which are always present in the first table, but never in the second are deemed to be the cause of heat.

The role experimentation played in this process was twofold. The most laborious job of the scientist would be to gather the facts, or 'histories', required to create the tables of presence and absence. Such histories would document a mixture of common knowledge and experimental results. Secondly, ''experiments of light'', or, as we might say, [[crucial experiment]]s would be needed to resolve any remaining ambiguities over causes.

Bacon showed an uncompromising commitment to [[experiment]]ation. Despite this, he did not make any great scientific discoveries during his lifetime. This may be because he was not the most able experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;B. Gower, ''Scientific Method, An Historical and Philosophical Introduction'', (Routledge, 1997), pp. 48–2.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be because [[hypothesis]]ing plays only a small role in Bacon's method compared to modern science.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', (Routledge, 2000), pp. 529–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses, in Bacon's method, are supposed to emerge during the process of investigation, with the help of mathematics and logic. &lt;!-- with little room left for guess work and creativity. --&gt; Bacon gave a substantial but secondary role to mathematics &lt;!-- Neither did he attribute much importance to mathematical speculation --&gt; ''"which ought only to give definiteness to natural philosophy, not to generate or give it birth"'' (''Novum Organum XCVI''). An over-emphasis on axiomatic reasoning had rendered previous non-empirical philosophy impotent, in Bacon's view, which was expressed in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
XIX. There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from these principles, the truth of which it takes for settled and immoveable, proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars, rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent, so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way, but as yet untried.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Bacon's [[utopia|utopian novel]], ''The [[New Atlantis]]'', the ultimate role is given for inductive reasoning:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lastly, we have three that raise the former discoveries by experiments into greater observations, axioms, and aphorisms. These we call interpreters of nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Descartes===
{{main|Cartesianism}}

In 1619, [[René Descartes]] began writing his first major treatise on proper scientific and philosophical thinking, the unfinished ''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]''.  His aim was to create a complete science that he hoped would overthrow the Aristotelian system and establish himself as the sole architect&lt;ref&gt;Descartes compares his work to that of an architect: "there is less perfection in works composed of several separate pieces and by difference masters, than those in which only one person has worked.", ''Discourse on Method and The Meditations'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 35.  (see too his letter to Mersenne (28. January 1641 [AT III, 297–8]).&lt;/ref&gt; of a new system of guiding principles for scientific research.

This work was continued and clarified in his 1637 treatise, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', and in his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]]''. Descartes describes the intriguing and disciplined thought experiments he used to arrive at the idea we instantly associate with him: ''[[cogito ergo sum|I think therefore I am]]''.

From this foundational thought, Descartes finds proof of the existence of a God who, possessing all possible perfections, will not deceive him provided he resolves "[...] never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of methodic doubt."&lt;ref&gt;This is the first of four rules Descartes resolved "never once to fail to observe", ''Discourse on Method and The Meditations'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule allowed Descartes to progress beyond his own thoughts and judge that there exist extended bodies outside of his own thoughts. Descartes published seven sets of objections to the ''Meditations'' from various sources&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''Meditations on First Philosophy: With Selections from the Objections and Replies'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 2nd ed., 1996), pp. 63–107.&lt;/ref&gt; along with his replies to them. Despite his apparent departure from the Aristotelian system, a number of his critics felt that Descartes had done little more than replace the primary premises of Aristotle with those of his own. Descartes says as much himself in a letter written in 1647 to the translator of [[Principles of Philosophy]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;a perfect knowledge [...] must necessarily be deduced from first causes [...] we must try to deduce from these principles knowledge of the things which depend on them, that there be nothing in the whole chain of deductions deriving from them that is not perfectly manifest.&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''The Philosophical Writings of Descartes: Principles of Philosophy, Preface to French Edition, translated by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff, D. Murdoch'' (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1985), vol. 1, pp. 179–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And again, some years earlier, speaking of Galileo's physics in a letter to his friend and critic [[Marin Mersenne|Mersenne]] from 1638,

&lt;blockquote&gt;without having considered the first causes of nature, [Galileo] has merely looked for the explanations of a few particular effects, and he has thereby built without foundations.&lt;ref&gt;René Descartes, ''Oeuvres De Descartes'', edited by Charles Adam and [[Paul Tannery]] (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1983), vol. 2, pp. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Aristotle purported to arrive at his first principles by induction, Descartes believed he could obtain them using reason only. In this sense, he was a Platonist, as he believed in the innate ideas, as opposed to Aristotle's [[tabula rasa|blank slate]] (''tabula rasa''), and stated that the seeds of science are inside us.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandre Koyré|Koyré, Alexandre]]: Introduction a la Lecture de Platon, suivi de Entretiens sur Descartes, Gallimard, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Bacon, Descartes successfully applied his own ideas in practice. He made significant contributions to science, in particular in aberration-corrected optics. His work in [[analytic geometry]] was a necessary precedent to [[differential calculus]] and instrumental in bringing mathematical analysis to bear on scientific matters.

===Galileo Galilei===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]], 1564–1642, a father of scientific method]]

During the period of religious conservatism brought about by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], [[Galileo Galilei]] unveiled his new science of motion. Neither the contents of Galileo’s science, nor the methods of study he selected were in keeping with Aristotelian teachings.  Whereas Aristotle thought that a science should be demonstrated from first principles, Galileo had used experiments as a research tool. Galileo nevertheless presented his treatise in the form of mathematical demonstrations without reference to experimental results. It is important to understand that this in itself was a bold and innovative step in terms of scientific method. The usefulness of mathematics in obtaining scientific results was far from obvious.&lt;ref&gt;For more about the role of mathematics in science around the time of Galileo see R. Feldhay, ''The Cambridge Companion to Galileo: The use and abuse of mathematical entities'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1998), pp. 80–133.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because mathematics did not lend itself to the primary pursuit of Aristotelian science: the discovery of causes.

Whether it is because Galileo was realistic about the acceptability of presenting experimental results as evidence or because he himself had doubts about the [[epistemology|epistemological]] status of experimental findings is not known. Nevertheless, it is not in his [[Latin]] treatise on motion that we find reference to experiments, but in his supplementary dialogues written in the Italian vernacular. In these dialogues experimental results are given, although Galileo may have found them inadequate for persuading his audience. [[Thought experiment]]s showing logical contradictions in Aristotelian thinking, presented in the skilled rhetoric of Galileo's dialogue were further enticements for the reader.

[[File:GalileosInclinedPlane.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Modern replica of Galileo's inclined plane experiment: The distance covered by a uniformly accelerated body is proportional to the square of the time elapsed.]] As an example, in the dramatic dialogue titled ''Third Day'' from his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', Galileo has the characters of the dialogue discuss an experiment involving two free falling objects of differing weight. An outline of the Aristotelian view is offered by the character Simplicio. For this experiment he expects that "a body which is ten times as heavy as another will move ten times as rapidly as the other". The character Salviati, representing Galileo's persona in the dialogue, replies by voicing his doubt that Aristotle ever attempted the experiment. Salviati then asks the two other characters of the dialogue to consider a thought experiment whereby two stones of differing weights are tied together before being released. Following Aristotle, Salviati reasons that "the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter". But this leads to a contradiction, since the two stones together make a heavier object than either stone apart, the heavier object should in fact fall with a speed greater than that of either stone. From this contradiction, Salviati concludes that Aristotle must, in fact, be wrong and the objects will fall at the same speed regardless of their weight, a conclusion that is borne out by experiment.

In his 1991 survey of developments in the modern accumulation of knowledge such as this Charles Van Doren&lt;ref&gt;Van Doren, Charles. A History of Knowledge. (New York, Ballantine, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; considers that the Copernican Revolution really is the Galilean Cartesian (René Descartes) or simply the Galilean revolution on account of the courage and depth of change brought about by the work of Galileo.

===Isaac Newton===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sir Isaac Newton]], the discoverer of [[universal gravitation]] and one of the most influential scientists in history]]
{{main| Newton's Rules for Science}}

Both Bacon and Descartes wanted to provide a firm foundation for scientific thought that avoided the deceptions of the mind and senses. Bacon envisaged that foundation as essentially empirical, whereas Descartes provides a metaphysical foundation for knowledge.  If there were any doubts about the direction in which scientific method would develop, they were set to rest by the success of [[Isaac Newton]]. Implicitly rejecting Descartes' emphasis on [[rationalism]] in favor of Bacon's empirical approach, he outlines his four "rules of reasoning" in the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.
#Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible, assign the same causes.
#The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intension nor remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of all bodies whatsoever.
#In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions collected by general induction from phænomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, until such time as other phænomena occur, by which they may either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Rule IV, [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica#Rules of Reasoning in Philosophy]]:
*Newton states "This rule we must follow that the argument of induction may not be evaded by hypotheses", in the Motte translation (p. 400 in the Cajori revision, volume 2)
*Newton's comment is also rendered as "This rule should be followed so that arguments based on induction may not be nullified by hypotheses" on p. 796 of {{Citation|last=Newton|first=Isaac|year=1999|author-link=Isaac Newton|title=[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|publisher=University of California Press| isbn= 0-520-08817-4}}, Third edition: 1687, 1713, 1726. From [[I. Bernard Cohen]] and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, 974 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Newton also left an admonition about a [[theory of everything]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty, and leave the rest for others that come after you, than to explain all things.&lt;ref&gt;
Statement from unpublished notes for the Preface to ''Opticks'' (1704) quoted in ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'' (1983) by Richard S. Westfall, p.&amp;nbsp;643
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newton's work became a model that other sciences sought to emulate, and his inductive approach formed the basis for much of natural philosophy through the 18th and early 19th centuries.  Some methods of reasoning were later systematized by [[Mill's Methods]] (or Mill's canon), which are five explicit statements of what can be discarded and what can be kept while building a hypothesis. [[George Boole]] and [[William Stanley Jevons]] also wrote on the principles of reasoning.

==Integrating deductive and inductive method==
Attempts to systematize a scientific method were confronted in the mid-18th century by the [[problem of induction]], a [[logical positivist|positivist]] logic formulation which, in short, asserts that nothing can be known with certainty except what is actually observed.  [[David Hume]] took empiricism to the skeptical extreme; among his positions was that there is no logical necessity that the future should resemble the past, thus we are unable to justify inductive reasoning itself by appealing to its past success. Hume's arguments, of course, came on the heels of many, many centuries of excessive speculation upon excessive speculation not grounded in empirical observation and testing.  Many of Hume's radically skeptical arguments were argued against, but not resolutely refuted, by  [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "Hume awakened Kant from his dogmatic slumbers"]&lt;/ref&gt; Hume's arguments continue to hold a strong lingering influence and certainly on the consciousness of the educated classes for the better part of the 19th century when the argument at the time became the focus on whether or not the inductive method was valid.

[[Hans Christian Ørsted]], (Ørsted is the [[Danish language|Danish]] spelling; ''Oersted'' in other languages) (1777–1851) was heavily influenced by Kant, in particular, Kant's ''[[Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaft]]'' (''Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science'').&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections on Ørsted encapsulate our current, common view of [[scientific method]]. His work appeared in Danish, most accessibly in public lectures, which he translated into German, French, English, and occasionally Latin. But some of his views go beyond Kant:
&lt;!--image about to be deleted File:Compass in a wooden frame.jpg--&gt;[[File:MagCompas3.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Ørsted observed the deflection of a compass from a voltaic circuit in 1820]]
:"In order to achieve completeness in our knowledge of nature, we must start from two extremes, from experience and from the intellect itself. ... The former method must conclude with natural laws, which it has abstracted from experience, while the latter must begin with principles, and gradually, as it develops more and more, it becomes ever more detailed. Of course, I speak here about the method as manifested in the process of the human intellect itself, not as found in textbooks, where the laws of nature which have been abstracted from the consequent experiences are placed first because they are required to explain the experiences. When the empiricist in his regression towards general laws of nature meets the metaphysician in his progression, science will reach its perfection."&lt;ref&gt;

Ørsted's "First Introduction to General Physics" (1811) exemplified the steps of [[observation]],&lt;ref&gt;

Collecting information about these is ''observation''." – [[Hans Christian Ørsted]]("First Introduction to General Physics" ¶13, part of a series of public lectures at the University of Copenhagen.

"When it is not clear under which law of nature an effect or class of effect belongs, we try to fill this gap by means of a guess.

&lt;/ref&gt; and experiment.  In 1805, based on his researches on [[electromagnetism]] Ørsted came to believe that electricity is propagated by undulatory action (i.e., fluctuation). By 1820, he felt confident enough in his beliefs that he resolved to demonstrate them in a public lecture, and in fact observed a small magnetic effect from a galvanic circuit (i.e., voltaic circuit), ''without rehearsal'';&lt;ref&gt;

In 1831 [[John Herschel]] (1792–1871) published ''A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy'', setting out the principles of science. Measuring and comparing observations was to be used to find generalisations in "empirical laws", which described regularities in phenomena, then natural philosophers were to work towards the higher aim of finding a universal "law of nature" which explained the causes and effects producing such regularities. An explanatory hypothesis was to be found by evaluating true causes (Newton's "vera causae") derived from experience, for example evidence of past climate change could be due to changes in the shape of continents, or to changes in Earth's orbit. Possible causes could be inferred by analogy to known causes of similar phenomena.&lt;ref name="Young 07"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Young | first1 = David | title = The discovery of evolution | year = 2007 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge ; New York | isbn = 0-521-68746-2 | pages = 105–106, 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Herschel | first = John Frederick William | title = A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy | url = http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;itemID=A276&amp;viewtype=text | series = [[Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia]]

[[William Whewell]] (1794–1866) regarded his ''History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time'' (1837) to be an introduction to the ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' (1840) which analyzes the method exemplified in the formation of ideas. Whewell attempts to follow Bacon's plan for discovery of an effectual art of discovery. He named the [[hypothetico-deductive method]] (which ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' credits to Newton&lt;ref&gt;
"Science, Philosophy of", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Fifteenth Ed. (1979) {{ISBN|0-85229-297-X}} pp. 378–9
&lt;/ref&gt;); Whewell also coined the term ''scientist''. Whewell examines ideas and attempts to construct science by uniting ideas to facts. He analyses induction into three steps:
#the selection of the fundamental idea, such as [[space]], [[number]], [[cause]], or likeness
#a more special modification of those ideas, such as a [[circle]], a uniform [[force]], etc.
#the determination of magnitudes
Upon these follow special techniques applicable for quantity, such as the [[method of least squares]], [[curve]]s, [[mean]]s, and special methods depending on resemblance (such as [[pattern matching]], the method of gradation, and the method of natural classification (such as [[cladistics]]).
But no art of discovery, such as Bacon anticipated, follows, for "[[invention]], [[wikt:sagacity|sagacity]], [[genius]]" are needed at every step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Whewell, William |volume=28 |page=587}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Whewell's sophisticated concept of science had similarities to that shown by Herschel, and he considered that a good hypothesis should connect fields that had previously been thought unrelated, a process he called [[consilience]]. However, where Herschel held that the [[evolution|origin of new biological species]] would be found in a natural rather than a miraculous process, Whewell opposed this and considered that no natural cause had been shown for [[adaptation]] so an unknown [[teleological argument|divine cause]] was appropriate.&lt;ref name="Young 07" /&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873) was stimulated to publish ''A System of Logic'' (1843) upon reading Whewell's ''History of the Inductive Sciences''. Mill may be regarded as the final exponent of the empirical school of philosophy begun by [[John Locke]], whose fundamental characteristic is the duty incumbent upon all thinkers to investigate for themselves rather than to accept the authority of others. Knowledge must be based on experience.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Mill, John Stuart |volume=18 |page=458}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-19th century [[Claude Bernard]] was also influential, especially in bringing the scientific method to medicine. In his discourse on scientific method, ''An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine'' (1865), he described what makes a scientific theory good and what makes a scientist a true discoverer. Unlike many scientific writers of his time, Bernard wrote about his own experiments and thoughts, and used the first person.&lt;ref&gt;All page references refer to the Dover edition of 1957.

The Dover Edition of 1957 is a reprint of the original translation with a new Foreword by I. Bernard Cohen of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Stanley Jevons]]' ''The Principles of Science: a treatise on logic and scientific method'' (1873, 1877) Chapter XII "The Inductive or Inverse Method", Summary of the Theory of Inductive Inference, states "Thus there are but three steps in the process of induction :-
#Framing some hypothesis as to the character of the general law.
#Deducing some consequences of that law.
#Observing whether the consequences agree with the particular tasks under consideration."
Jevons then frames those steps in terms of probability, which he then applied to economic laws. [[Ernest Nagel]] notes that Jevons and Whewell were not the first writers to argue for the centrality of the [[hypothetico-deductive method]] in the logic of science.&lt;ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}

In the late 19th century, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] proposed a schema that would turn out to have considerable influence in the further development of scientific method generally.  Peirce's work quickly accelerated the progress on several fronts. Firstly, speaking in broader context in "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" (1878),&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Peirce [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/ideas/id-frame.htm How to Make Our Ideas Clear], Popular Science Monthly 12 (January 1878), pp. 286–302&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce outlined an objectively verifiable method to test the truth of putative knowledge on a way that goes beyond mere foundational alternatives, focusing upon both [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] and [[Induction (philosophy)|Induction]].  He thus placed induction and deduction in a complementary rather than competitive context (the latter of which had been the primary trend at least since [[David Hume]] a century before).  Secondly, and of more direct importance to scientific method, Peirce put forth the basic schema for hypothesis-testing that continues to prevail today.  Extracting the theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic, he refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address the then-current problems in scientific reasoning. Peirce examined and articulated the three fundamental modes of reasoning that play a role in scientific inquiry today, the processes that are currently known as [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] inference.  Thirdly, he played a major role in the progress of symbolic logic itself – indeed this was his primary specialty.

Charles S. Peirce was also a pioneer in [[statistics]]. Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that chance, a veering from law, is very real. He assigned probability to an argument’s conclusion rather than to a proposition, event, etc., as such. Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce condemned the use of "certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]" even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his [[possible world semantics]] introduced the "[[propensity]]" theory of probability. Peirce (sometimes with [[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]]) investigated the [[Bayesian probability|probability judgments]] of experimental subjects, pioneering [[decision analysis]].

Peirce was one of the [[founders of statistics]]. He formulated modern statistics in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877–1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883). With a [[repeated measures design]], he introduced [[blinding (medicine)|blinded]], [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled randomized experiments]] (before [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). He invented an [[optimal design]] for experiments on gravity, in which he "[[analysis of variance|corrected the means]]". He used [[logistic regression]], [[correlation]], and [[smoothing]], and improved the treatment of [[Peirce's criterion|outliers]]. He introduced terms "[[Confidence interval|confidence]]" and "[[Likelihood function|likelihood]]" (before [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). (See the historical books of [[Stephen Stigler]].) Many of Peirce's ideas were later popularized and developed by [[Ronald A. Fisher]], [[Jerzy Neyman]], [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], and [[Karl Popper]].

===Popper and Kuhn===
[[Karl Popper]] (1902–1994) is generally credited with providing major improvements in the understanding of the scientific method in the mid-to-late 20th century. In 1934 Popper published ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', which repudiated the by then traditional observationalist-inductivist account of the scientific method. He advocated empirical [[falsifiability]] as the criterion for distinguishing scientific work from [[non-science]]. According to Popper, scientific theory should make predictions (preferably predictions not made by a competing theory) which can be tested and the theory rejected if these predictions are shown not to be correct. Following Peirce and others, he argued that science would best progress using deductive reasoning as its primary emphasis, known as [[critical rationalism]].  His astute formulations of logical procedure helped to rein in the excessive use of inductive speculation upon inductive speculation, and also helped to strengthen the conceptual foundations for today's [[peer review]] procedures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Critics of Popper, chiefly [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Paul Feyerabend]] and [[Imre Lakatos]], rejected the idea that there exists a ''single'' method that applies to all science and could account for its progress. In 1962 Kuhn published the influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' which suggested that scientists worked within a series of paradigms, and argued there was little evidence of scientists actually following a falsificationist methodology. Kuhn quoted [[Max Planck]] who had said in his autobiography, "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck]] (1949) ''Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers'', pp. 33–34 {{ISBN|0-8371-0194-8}}, as cited by {{Citation|first=Thomas|last=Kuhn|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|page=151|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1997|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates clearly show that there is no universal agreement as to what constitutes ''the'' "scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Wellington, ''Secondary Science: Contemporary Issues and Practical Approaches'' (Routlege, 1994, p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt;  There remain, nonetheless, certain [[scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|core principles]] that are the foundation of scientific inquiry today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gauch |first1= Hugh G. |title=Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |edition=Reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |page=3 |isbn=9780521017084 |quote=The scientific method 'is often misrepresented as a fixed sequence of steps,' rather than being seen for what it truly is, 'a highly variable and creative process' (AAAS 2000:18). The claim here is that science has general principles that must be mastered to increase productivity and enhance perspective, not that these principles provide a simple and automated sequence of steps to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mention of the topic==
In ''Quod Nihil Scitur'' (1581), [[Francisco Sanches]] refers to another book title, ''De modo sciendi'' (on the method of knowing). This work appeared in Spanish as ''Método universal de las ciencias''.&lt;ref name="modoSciendi"/&gt;

In 1833 [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert]] and [[William Chambers (publisher)|William Chambers]] published their 'Chambers's information for the people'. Under the rubric 'Logic' we find a description of investigation that is familiar as scientific method,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Investigation, or the art of inquiring into the nature of causes and their operation, is a leading characteristic of reason [...] Investigation implies three things – Observation, Hypothesis, and Experiment [...] The first step in the process, it will be perceived, is to observe...&lt;ref&gt;William Chambers, Robert Chambers, ''Chambers's information for the people: a popular encyclopaedia'', Volume 1, pp. 363–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1885, the words "Scientific method" appear together with a description of the method in [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]]'s 'Scientific Theism',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now all the established truths which are formulated in the multifarious propositions of science have been won by the use of Scientific Method. This method consists in essentially three distinct steps (1) observation and experiment, (2) hypothesis, (3) verification by fresh observation and experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ellingwood Abbot, ''Scientific Theism'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Eleventh Edition of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' did not include an article on scientific method; the Thirteenth Edition listed scientific management, but not method. By the Fifteenth Edition, a 1-inch article in the ''Micropædia'' of Britannica was part of the 1975 printing, while a fuller treatment (extending across multiple articles, and accessible mostly via the index volumes of Britannica) was available in later printings.&lt;ref&gt;
''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Fifteenth Edition {{ISBN|0-85229-493-X}} Index L-Z "scientific method" pp. 588–9
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==
In the past few centuries, [[decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|some statistical methods]] have been developed, for reasoning in the face of uncertainty, as an outgrowth of methods for eliminating error. This was an echo of the program of Francis Bacon's ''[[Novum Organum]]'' of 1620. [[Bayesian inference]] acknowledges one's ability to alter one's beliefs in the face of evidence. This has been called [[belief revision]], or [[defeasible reasoning]]: the models in play during the phases of scientific method can be reviewed, revisited and revised, in the light of further evidence. This arose from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;A review and defense of [[Frank P.Ramsey]]'s formulation can be found in [http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/people-defaults/alanh/papers/scotching.pdf Alan Hájek, "Scotching Dutch Books?" ''Philosophical Perspectives'' '''19''']&lt;/ref&gt;
(1903–1930), of [[John Maynard Keynes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[John Maynard Keynes]](1921) ''Treatise on Probability''&lt;/ref&gt;
(1883–1946), and earlier, of [[William Stanley Jevons]]&lt;ref&gt;
[[William Stanley Jevons]](1888) ''The Theory of Political Economy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Stanley Jevons]](1874), ''The Principles of Science'', p. 267, reprinted by Dover in 1958
&lt;/ref&gt; (1835–1882) in economics.

==Science and pseudoscience==
The question of how [[science]] operates and therefore how to [[Demarcation problem|distinguish]] genuine science from [[pseudoscience]] has importance well beyond scientific circles or the academic community. In the [[judicial system]] and in [[public policy]] controversies, for example, a study's deviation from ''accepted scientific practice'' is grounds for rejecting it as [[junk science]] or pseudoscience. However, the high public perception of science means that pseudoscience is widespread. An advertisement in which an actor wears a white coat and product ingredients are given Greek or Latin sounding names is intended to give the impression of scientific endorsement. [[Richard Feynman]] has likened pseudoscience to [[cargo cult]]s in which many of the external forms are followed, but the underlying basis is missing: that is, fringe or alternative theories often present themselves with a pseudoscientific appearance to gain acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm R.P. Feynman (1974) "Cargo cult science"]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2350">'''Badr al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Ḥātim al-Hamdānī''', commonly known simply as '''Ibn Hatim''', was a 13th-century official and historian in [[Yemen]], under the [[Rasulid dynasty]].

Very little is known about Ibn Hatim's life, all of which is gleaned from his chief historical work, ''Kitāb al-Simṭ al-ghālī al-thaman fī akhbār al-mulūk min al-Ghuzz bi ’l-Yaman''. His date of birth is unknown, but he was a member of the [[Banu Hatim]] clan of the [[Banu Yam]], who were dominant in the region of the provincial capital, [[Sana'a]]. Although an [[Isma'ili]], he managed to have a successful career under the [[Sunni]] Rasulids, rising under Sultan [[al-Muzaffar Yusuf I]] (r. 1249–1295) to become one of only a handful of officials "employed by the sultan in the capacity of roving ambassador, personally representing him wherever in the country he was needed, now negotiating with recalcitrant tribes, now conveying a personal message from the sultan, at times even participating in military operations" (G. R. Smith). The date of his death is likewise unknown.{{sfn|Smith|2004|pp=387–388}}

Ibn Hatim wrote two historical works, the first being ''Kitāb al-ʿIqd al-thamīn fī akhbār mulūk al-Yaman al-mutaʾakhkhirīn'', a general history of [[Yemen]], which has not survived. He is therefore known from his other work, the ''Kitāb al-Simṭ'', a history of Yemen under the [[Ayyubid]]s and the first two Rasulid sultans. G. R. Smith writes that despite a slight bias towards his own clan, Ibn Hatim's account is "a refreshingly impartial one", and contains much unique information about the country during the period it covers.{{sfn|Smith|2004|pp=387–388}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5666">'''John Clarke Stobart''' (5 March 1878 – 11 May 1933), commonly known as '''J. C. Stobart''', wrote two famous and influential books, '''''The Glory that was Greece''''' and '''''The Grandeur that was Rome'''''. He was also a classical scholar, a [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer, an HM Inspector of Schools and the [[BBC]]'s first Director of Education.

==Early life==
Known as 'Jack' to his relations and friends, Stobart was born in [[Swyre]] Rectory, [[Dorset]], England, on 5 March 1878.  His father, William Stobart, was the Rector, his mother was Susan Elizabeth (née Morris), the daughter of a farmer in Rutland, and he had two elder sisters.  Soon after his birth his father was appointed Rector of [[Bermondsey]] in London and the family moved to London.  He was educated at [[Rugby School]] and as a Bell Scholar at [[Trinity College Cambridge]], obtaining his BA in 1901 (MA in 1904).&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=STBT897JC|name=Stobart, John Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied briefly at [[Greifswald University]] in Germany and in Edinburgh, before becoming a teacher at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylor's School]] in London.

In 1904, he married Mary Currey Gibson, daughter of the Reverend Thomas Gibson, Vicar of St Sepulchre's in London.  They had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, both born in Cambridge, where in 1907 Stobart became a lecturer at Trinity College.  Two years later he was appointed one of His Majesty's Inspectors of Schools and during the First World War worked for the [[Ministry of Munitions]] before acting as Assistant Secretary to the British [[War Cabinet]] of 1917–18.

==BBC==
After the war, he helped organise the 1924 [[British Empire Exhibition]] at Wembley and in 1925 joined the [[BBC]] as its first Director of Education.  He was responsible for two long-lasting programmes, ''[[Children's Hour]]'' and ''The Epilogue'' and according to one source suggested the BBC's motto, 'Nation Shall Speak Peace Unto Nation]'.&lt;ref name=motto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roger.beckwith.btinternet.co.uk/bh/odds/crest.htm |title=Nation Shall Speak Peace Unto Nation |accessdate=September 26, 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926190653/http://www.roger.beckwith.btinternet.co.uk/bh/odds/crest.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also proposed creating a new cultural network, to be named the ''Minerva'' programme, after the Roman goddess of wisdom, but this idea was turned down and was not realised until the creation of '[[The Third Programme]]' at the end of the Second World War.

His mild but incisive manner, his humour and his attractive voice earned him the title of the 'BBC's charmer' and he became well-known all over the world for his regular New Year’s Eve broadcast, 'The Grand Good-night'.  He was already dying of diabetes when he broadcast his last Grand Good-night on December 31, 1932, from his bedroom in Kensington.

==Books==
Much of the humour, charm and enthusiastic optimism mentioned in his many obituaries still comes across from the friendly, lucid style of his two most famous books, whose 'point of view', according to his Preface to ''The Grandeur that was Rome'', 'is that of humanity and the progress of civilisation'.  The books were ground-breaking and successful partly because of their popular as well as scholarly approach  and partly because they included what were then newly sumptuous photographic illustrations.

Stobart writes in his Preface: 'The pictures are an integral part of my scheme.  It is not possible with Rome, as it was with Greece, to let pictures and statues take the place of wars and treaties.  Wars and treaties are an essential part of the Grandeur of Rome...the pictures are chosen so that the reader's eye may be able to gather its own impression of the Roman genius.'

He disagrees with [[Edward Gibbon]]'s pessimistic view of the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', pointing out that 'The mere notion of empire continuing to decline and fall for five centuries is ridiculous' and remarking that 'this is one of the cases which prove that History is made not so much by heroes or natural forces as by historians', since 'if all the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historians had perished and only the inscriptions remained we should have a very different picture of the Roman Empire, a picture much brighter and, I think, much more faithful to truth.'  He admires the Romans for their law, discipline, engineering and especially their sanitation, but it is clear that he prefers the Greeks for their art, philosophy, mathematics and  literature.

==Death==
Stobart wrote and edited several other books on English and Classical literature.  Two books, ''The Divine Spark'' and ''The Gospel of Happiness'' were published posthumously.  He died on 11 May 1933, at his country cottage next to West Byfleet golf-course in [[Surrey]] and was buried at Old Byfleet, where his grave can still be seen.  The offer of a knighthood was in the post when he died.

'''James Dugold Somerville''' (1868 &amp;ndash; March 1960), born in [[Glasgow]], was a South Australian historian with a special interest in [[Eyre Peninsula|Eyre's Peninsula]], especially [[Port Lincoln, South Australia|Port Lincoln]].

==Background==
Somerville was the third son of Peter Somerville (25 April 1834 &amp;ndash; 8 January 1929)  of Glasgow, floriculturist, and his wife Christina née Leitch (ca.1840 &amp;ndash; 17 June 1923) whom he married in 1860 and with five children arrived in South Australia in the ''Saxon'' in May 1871, and settled at [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]], then Knoxville (modern day [[Glenside, South Australia|Glenside]] or [[Glenunga, South Australia|Glenunga]]).

On 20 October 1896 he married Edith Tapley (1869 &amp;ndash; 1971), a daughter of J. M. Tapley of [[Tapleys Hill, South Australia]]. They had one daughter, Mabel.

==Career==
From June 1909 to September 1911 he was Superintendent and Resident Railway Engineer of the Darwin and Pine Creek railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5217486 |title=Personal |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=3 December 1910 |accessdate=14 September 2013 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was Resident Railway Engineer for the [[South Australian Railways]] at Port Lincoln, and on his retirement in 1933 began the work for which he is known; beginning with the compilation of a large album of newspaper cuttings, extracts from books and other material. Then from October 1934&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96618614 |title=Port Lincoln Special Survey |newspaper=[[Port Lincoln Times]] |location=SA |date=12 October 1934 |accessdate=14 September 2013 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; he contributed several hundreds of articles on historical themes to the ''Port Lincoln Times''. He was able to enlist the assistance of a large number of private correspondents and public bodies, notably the Port Lincoln Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article96745109 |title=Port Lincoln Town Council |newspaper=[[Port Lincoln Times]] |location=SA |date=6 November 1941 |accessdate=14 September 2013 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the South Australian Archives.

He was secretary of the Historical Memorials committee of the [[Royal Geographical Society of South Australia]].

==Donations==
*He contributed a large number of historical books to the Port Lincoln Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article97182965 |title=Book on S.A. History Presented to Institute |newspaper=[[Port Lincoln Times]] |location=SA |date=10 December 1953 |accessdate=14 September 2013 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some 120 items to the State Library of South Australia.
*In 1981 the '''Somerville Bequest''' of $250,000 was made to the Libraries Board of South Australia by his daughter Mabel in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.slsa.sa.gov.au/content.php?pid=259020&amp;sid=2137319 State Library of SA: Benefactors and donated collections; Somerville family]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Jacob Grasser''' (24 February 1579 &amp;ndash; 20 March 1627) was a scholar and [[polyhistor]] of [[Basel]].
He studied theology and was active as a poet, in the sciences and in geography. He was ''Magister Artium'' and ''[[poet laureate|Poeta laureatus]]'' in Basel in 1601. He travelled across Switzerland and in Europe during 1603 to 1608. When he was in [[Nîmes]], he wrote a treatise on the Roman antiquities there which was reprinted several times. In 1607, he was given the title of [[Count Palatine (Imperial)|Count Palatine]]&lt;ref&gt;in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the time an honorary rank sometimes bestowed on poets and scholars&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Imperial Commissioner]] in [[Padua]], from which time he styled himself as ''Ioannes Iacobus Grasserus, Civis Romanus, Comes Palatinus''.

He was pastor in [[Bennwil]] and [[Hölstein]] during 1610 to 1612, and sacristan at [[Theodorskirche (Basel)|St. Theodore church]] in Basel during 1612 to 1627.
He published various editions and translations, besides his own works of moderate Calvinist theology, historiography and travel literature.
His 1624 [[historiography of Switzerland|Swiss]] ''Heldenbuch'' is without historiographical value but noted for its social criticism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''''Jure matris''''' ('''''iure matris''''') is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning "by right of his mother" or "in right of his mother".

It is commonly encountered in the law of [[inheritance]] when a noble title or other right passes from mother to son. It is also used in the context of monarchy in cases where a woman holds a title in her own right but grants exercise of the power to her son. In many cultures it was common for the husband of a titled woman to [[Jure uxoris|exercise power on her behalf]], and sometimes after his death she allowed their son and heir the same privilege during her lifetime.

==Notable ''jure matris'' rulers==
* [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] was ''jure matris'' [[List of Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]] from 1143 to 1153 through his mother [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |chapter=Women in the Crusader States: The Queens of Jerusalem |title=Medieval Women |last=Hamilton |first=Bernard |authorlink= |editor=Baker, Derek |year=1978 |publisher=Ecclesiastical History Society |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-19260-3 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and his brother [[John, King of England|John]] were ''jure matris'' [[Duke of Aquitaine|Dukes of Aquitaine]] from 1189 to 1199 and 1199 to 1204 respectively through their mother [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eleanor]], who was Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right.
* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], was [[List of Castilian monarchs|King of Castile]] through his mother [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] from 1516 to 1555.
* [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], was [[Archduke of Austria]] from 1765 to 1780 through his mother [[Maria Theresa]].

{{nihongo|'''Jōō'''|貞応|}}, also romanized as '''Jō-ō,''' was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) after ''[[Jokyu|Jōkyū]]'' and before ''[[Gennin]].''

==Change of era==
* '''1222''' {{nihongo|''Jōō gannen''|貞応元年}}:  The era name was changed to ''Jōō'' (meaning "Righteous Answer") to mark an event or a number of events. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Jōkyū'', on the 13th day of the 4th month of 1222.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the ''Jōō'' era==

* '''July 19, 1223''' (''Jōō 2, 20th day of the 6th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc  貞応二年六月二十日 --&gt;:  The buildings of the [[Asama Shrine]] at the base of [[Mount Fuji]] in [[Suruga province]]  were re-built by [[Hōjō Tokimasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

==Studies and career==
Lisa Sousa was born 1962 in [[Sebastopol, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n98-53975|text=Birthplace}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) as an undergraduate, completing a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Latin American studies]] in 1990. Her postgraduate studies in Latin American history were also undertaken at UCLA, where her research focused on the history and experience of women and indigenous cultures in colonial-era [[Mexico]].

Sousa first completed her [[Master of Arts|Master's degree]] in 1992 before entering the doctorate studies program, and was awarded her [[PhD]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae |url=http://departments.oxy.edu/history/profs/sousa/cv.htm |publisher=Occidental College |accessdate=2009-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116122352/http://departments.oxy.edu/history/profs/sousa/cv.htm |archivedate=2010-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral [[dissertation]], "Women in Native Societies and Cultures of Colonial Mexico", won UCLA's Mary Wollstonecraft Dissertation Award for the best thesis in [[Women's studies]].&lt;ref name="Lisa Sousa profile"/&gt;

As her PhD was being completed, Sousa obtained a position as adjunct professor at Occidental College in the 1997–98 academic year. After a brief term as a [[visiting lecturer]] at UCLA, Sousa took up an [[assistant professor]]ship at Occidental, from 1998 onwards. In addition to her continuing research and publications in the field, Sousa teaches a number of related courses in [[History of Latin America|Latin American history]], [[Mesoamerican literature]] and [[gender studies]], and also provides instruction in learning Nahuatl.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/&gt;

==Research==
During the course of her studies at UCLA Sousa obtained a proficiency in [[Classical Nahuatl]], an indigenous language of the [[Mexican Plateau|central Mexican altiplano]] and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century.

While studying at UCLA in the 1990s Sousa researched and published papers on a themes relating to women and gender among indigenous cultures in Mexico. Themes analysed by Sousa include rationalisation of and attitudes to [[violence against women]], the representation and participation of women in crime and colonial-era rebellion, and [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slavery of indigenous groups in the New World]]. Her publications and seminars also explore the nature of [[gender roles in Mesoamerica|gender roles in Mesoamerican cultures]], particularly among [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], [[Mixtec peoples|Mixtec]] and [[Zapotec peoples]] of the pre- and post-conquest eras.&lt;ref name="Curriculum Vitae"/&gt;

In 1998 as her PhD was being completed, Sousa co-edited and translated an English-language edition of the ''[[Huei tlamahuiçoltica]]'', a 17th-century Nahuatl-language manuscript that is central to the claims of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Guadalupan apparition]] to [[Juan Diego]]. The book, ''The Story of Guadalupe: Luis Laso de la Vega's Huei tlamahuiçoltica of 1649'', jointly published by [[Stanford University Press]] and UCLA's Latin American Center, also contains analysis of and translated excerpts from the 1648 document, ''Imagen de la Virgen María, Madre de Dios de Guadalupe'' by [[Miguel Sánchez]]. Together with her collaborators [[Stafford Poole]] and [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], Sousa affirms that [[Luis Laso de la Vega]] was indeed the principal author of the ''Huei tlamahuiçoltica'',&lt;ref&gt;Sousa ''et al.'' 1998, pp.43–47&lt;/ref&gt; and that portions of the work bear affinities with Sánchez's document.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised in Sousa ''et al.'' 1998, pp.5–17&lt;/ref&gt; They regard Sánchez's ''Imagen de la Virgen María'' as the earliest known written account of the Guadalupan apparition,&lt;ref&gt;Sousa ''et al.'' 1998, pp.1–2&lt;/ref&gt; and that consequently these two mid-17th-century texts are the principal origins of the apparition story, and not any earlier source or tradition contemporaneous with the events purported to have taken place more than a century before those documents were written.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa ''et al.'' 1998, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

IN 2004, Sousa and UCLA professor [[Kevin Terraciano]] were presented with the Robert F. Heizer Article Award by the [[American Society for Ethnohistory]], for their co-authored paper "The 'Original Conquest' of Oaxaca: Nahua and Mixtec Accounts of the Spanish Conquest", published the preceding year in the journal ''[[Ethnohistory (journal)|Ethnohistory]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert F. Heizer Article Award |url=http://www.ethnohistory.org/sections/awards_prizes/robert_f_heizer.html |work=Awards and Prizes |publisher=[[American Society for Ethnohistory]] |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Sousa co-edited and with [[Matthew Restall]] and Terraciano a volume of translated colonial-era Nahuatl-, [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]- and [[Mixtec language|Mixtec-language]] primary source texts, under the title ''Mesoamerican Voices: Native-Language Writings from Colonial Mexico and Guatemala''.&lt;ref&gt;Restall ''et al.'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation of the '''oldest mosque in the world''' requires careful use of definitions, and must be divided into two parts, the oldest in the sense of oldest surviving '''building''', and the oldest in the sense of oldest mosque '''congregation'''. Even here, there is the distinction between old [[mosque]] buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques, and those that have been converted to other purposes; and between buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques and those that were shuttered for many decades. In terms of congregations, they are distinguished between early established congregations that have been in continuous existence, and early congregations that ceased to exist.

To be listed here a site must:
*be the oldest mosque in a country, large city (top 50), or oldest of its type (denomination, architectural, etc.);
*be the oldest congregation of its type (denomination).

Before the Ottomans, the space was usually called ''al-masjid al-aqsa'' (the Farthest Mosque), a term now reserved to the covered congregational space on the Haram, or ''masjid bayt al-maqdis'' (Mosque of the Holy City) or, even, like Mecca's sanctuary, ''al-masjid al-ḥarâm'',"&lt;ref&gt;Grabar 2000, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} today however specifically the silver-domed congregational mosque/prayer hall facing Mecca [otherwise known as [[Al-Qibli Chapel|Al-Qibli Mosque]] (see below)] located on the southern side of the compound.

The funerary monument differs from a tomb or cemetery in that while it may or may not contain the body of the deceased, its primary purpose is not simply to house the remains, but to serve as a visible reminder of the dead for the living. It often features inscriptions ([[epitaph]]s) or [[funerary art]].

'''Mairbek Vatchagaev''' (born 1965) is a [[Chechnya|Chechen]] [[historian]] and [[political analyst]] on the [[North Caucasus]]. Mairbek Vatchagaev was a senior ranking official in the Chechen government of [[Aslan Maskhadov]].

==Career==
Vatchagaev was born in [[Chechnya]]. He studied history at the [[State University of Chechnya]], the [[Research Institute of Chechnya]], and the [[Institute of the Russian History]]. He defended his doctoral thesis in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Moscow]] in 1995.

After receiving his doctoral degree, Vatchagaev returned to Chechnya and was placed in charge of the information department of the armed forces of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Ichkeria]]. He worked closely with [[Aslan Maskhadov]], and actively campaigned for him in 1996 before the elections. Together with [[Turpal Ali Atgeriev]], Vatchagaev significantly assisted Maskhadov’s advance to power.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

During the period 1988&amp;ndash;99, Vatchagaev was a press secretary and first adviser to President Maskhadov. At the same time, he was in charge of leading the investigation center functioning under the presidential administration of Ichkeria. In the summer of 1999, Vatchagaev was appointed as the general representative of the Republic of Ichkeria in the [[Russian Federation]]. On October 21, 1999, the Russian police detained him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.ru/news/crime/117266|title=В Москве задержан полномочный представитель президента Чеченской республики в Москве Майрбек Вачагаев|date=21 October 1999|work=1tv.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatchagaev spent 9 months in the Butyrsk prison in Moscow. [[Amnesty International]] declared him to be a political prisoner. He was released in the summer of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memo.ru/hr/discrim/Wachag.htm|title=Сообшение о процессе Вачагаева|work=memo.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vatchagaev continued to function as a press secretary of President Maskhadov until 2002.

==Scholarly work==

'''Manuel Antonio Caballero Agüero''' (5 December 1931 – 12 December 2010) was a notable Venezuelan [[historian]], journalist, best-selling author and professor of contemporary Venezuelan History at the [[Central University of Venezuela]].

Caballero was born in [[Barquisimeto]], studied History at the [[Central University of Venezuela]] and obtained a PhD at [[University College London]]. With the publication of his PhD dissertation he became the first Venezuelan author to be published by [[Cambridge University Press]]. In 1989 he was invited to teach at [[Università Federico II|Universitá degli Studi di Napoli]] in Italy. He received the National Award on Journalism (Premio Nacional de Periodismo) and the National History Award (Premio Nacional de Historia, 1994) and in 2005 he was elected as a member of the ''Academia Nacional de la Historia'' (or National Academy of History of Venezuela). He wrote regularly for Venezuelan newspapers ''[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]], El Diario de Caracas'' and most recently ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]].'' Despite his past as a left-wing thinker and political activist, in particular against president [[Rómulo Betancourt]], in his latter years he became one of the most vocal and vehement critics of president [[Hugo Chávez]] and his administration. He revised his perspective on President Betancourt in a biography written in 2004.

On 2010, he underwent a prostate surgery that triggered a series of infections unresponsive to antibiotics, further complicated by diabetes. He died on 12 December 2010.

This article describes those aspects of the [[phonological history of the English language]] which concern [[consonant]]s.

==Consonant clusters==
{{Main article|Phonological history of English consonant clusters}}

===H-cluster reductions===
* [[English wh|Reduction of /hw/]] – to /h/ in a few words (such as ''who''), but usually to {{IPA|/w/}}, for the great majority of English speakers (so that ''whine'' comes to be pronounced the same as ''wine'').
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#HL|Reduction of /hl/, /hr/ and /hn/]], with the loss of the initial {{IPA|/h/}} in Middle English.
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Reduction of /hj/|Reduction of /hj/]] to /j/ in a few American and Irish dialects (so that ''hew'' is pronounced like ''yew'').

===Y-cluster reductions===
* [[Yod-dropping]] – the [[elision]] of {{IPA|/j/}} in certain clusters, depending on dialect (for example, [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] has /j/ in ''new'', while [[General American]] and [[Cockney]] do not).
* [[Yod-coalescence]], whereby the clusters {{IPA|/dj/}}, {{IPA|/tj/}}, {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}} become {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} respectively (for example, ''education'' is often pronounced as if it began "edge").

===Other initial cluster reductions===
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#wr|Reduction of /wr/]] to /r/, in words like ''wrap'', around the 17th century (there was also a reduction of /wl/ to /l/ in Middle English).
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Reduction of /kn/|Reduction of /kn/]] and [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Reduction of /ɡn/|/ɡn/]] to /n/, in words like ''knot'' and ''gnome'', around the 17th century.
* [[S-cluster reduction]], in some types of [[Caribbean English]], where for example ''spit'' is pronounced ''pit''.

===Final cluster reductions===
* [[NG-coalescence]] – reduction of the final cluster {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} to {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, in words like ''hang'', which has occurred in all but a few English dialects.
* [[G-dropping]] – reduction of the final cluster {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} to {{IPA|[n]}} in weak syllables, principally in the verb ending ''[[-ing]]'', which has occurred in many English dialects, although not in the modern standard varieties. 
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#mb|Reduction of /mb/ and /mn/]] to {{IPA|/m/}}, in later Middle English, affecting words like ''lamb'' and ''column''.
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Generalized final cluster reduction|Generalized final cluster reduction]] in [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) and [[Caribbean English]], where for example ''desk'' and ''hand'' may be pronounced "dess" and "han".

===Other changes involving clusters===
* [[C#Later use|Reduction of /ts/ to /s/]] – a Middle English reduction that produced the modern sound of [[soft C|soft {{vr|c}}]].
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Medial cluster reductions|Medial cluster reduction]] – elision of certain stops in medial clusters, such as the /t/ in ''postman''.
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Consonant insertions|Insertion (epenthesis) of stops]] after nasals in certain clusters, for example making ''prince'' sound like ''prints'', and ''dreamt'' rhyme with ''attempt''.
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Assimilation|Assimilation]] of certain consonants in clusters, especially nasals.
* [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Glottalization|Glottalization and pre-glottalization]] (insertion of a [[glottal stop]] in place of or before a /t/ or other stop) in certain environments, depending on dialect.
* Certain other changes occurring in AAVE, including [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#S-cluster metathesis|S-cluster metathesis]] (as with the use of "aks" for ''ask'' – an alternation which also has a long history in general forms of English), the [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Merger of /str/ and /skr/|merger of /str/ and /skr/]], and [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-rhotacization|yod-rhotacization]] (where ''beautiful'' is pronounced "brootiful").

==Stops==

===Aspiration===
The [[voiceless stop]]s /p/, /t/, /k/ are typically [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] when they begin a stressed syllable, becoming {{IPA|[pʰ], [tʰ], [kʰ]}}, as described under [[English phonology#Obstruents|English phonology (obstruents)]]. There is some regional variation in the degree of aspiration, and in some Scottish and northern English accents aspiration does not occur at all.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain accents, such as [[Geordie]] (among younger women)&lt;ref name="wa268"/&gt; and in some speakers of [[Hiberno-English|Dublin English]],&lt;ref name="unidue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=https://www.uni-due.de/vcde/VCDE_Glossary.htm#GlossE|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; /p/, /t/ and /k/ can be [[preaspiration|preaspirated]] when they come at the end of a word or utterance, becoming {{IPA|[ʰp], [ʰt], [ʰk]}}.

===Flapping===
{{Main article|Flapping}}
[[Flapping]], or tapping, is a process whereby /t/ or /d/ is pronounced as the [[alveolar flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} in certain positions, especially between vowels (but also sometimes after other sonorants). It may be perceived as, for example, the pronunciation of ''butter'' as "budder". It occurs especially in [[North American English]] (to varying extents) and in [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]].

===Voicing===
Apart from the T-voicing that results from flapping (described above), some dialects feature other instances of [[voiced consonant|voicing]] or [[lenis consonant|lenition]] of the stops /p/, /t/ and /k/. In [[Geordie]], these stops may be fully voiced ([b], [d], [ɡ]) in intervocalic position.&lt;ref name="wa268"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Watt|Allen|2003|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Devon]], stops and other [[obstruent]]s may be voiced (or at least lenited) between vowels and when final after a weak vowel, so for example the /k/ and /t/ in ''jacket'' may approach the realizations [ɡ] and [d], making the word sound similar or identical to ''jagged''.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 343–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glottalization===
Stops, chiefly the voiceless stops, and especially /t/, are frequently [[glottalized]] or pre-glottalized in certain positions; that is, a stop may be replaced with the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, or else a glottal stop may be inserted before it. These phenomena are strongly dependent on the phonetic environment and on dialect. For details, see [[T-glottalization]], as well as [[English phonology#Obstruents|English phonology (obstruents)]] and [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Glottalization|glottalization in consonant clusters]].

If all final voiceless stops are glottalized, as may occur in some London speech, then sets of words such as ''lick'', ''lit'' and ''lip'' may become homophones, pronounced {{IPA|[lɪʔ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fricatives and affricates==

===H-dropping and H-insertion===
{{main article|H-dropping}}
[[H-dropping]]{{Anchor|H dropping}}{{Anchor|H-dropping}} is the omission of initial {{IPA|/h/}} in words like ''house'', ''heat'' and ''hangover''. It is common in many dialects, especially in England, Wales, Australia and Jamaica, but is generally [[social stigma|stigmatized]], and is not a feature of the standard accents. The /h/ is nonetheless frequently dropped in all forms of English in the [[weak and strong forms in English|weak form]]s of [[function word]]s like ''he'', ''him'', ''her'', ''his'', ''had'' and ''have''. The opposite of H-dropping, called H-insertion or H-adding, may arise as a [[hypercorrection]] by typically H-dropping speakers, or as a [[spelling pronunciation]].

===Loss of velar and palatal fricatives===
The voiceless velar and palatal fricative sounds [x] and [ç], considered to be [[allophone]]s of /h/, and reflected by the {{angbr|gh}} in the spelling of words such as ''night'', ''taught'' and ''weight'', were lost in later Middle English or in Early Modern English. Their loss was accompanied by certain changes in the previous vowels. In some cases [x] became /f/, as in ''laugh''.

A /x/ is still heard in words of the above type in certain Scots and northern English traditional dialect speech. A /x/ is more commonly heard – especially in the [[Celtic nations|Celtic countries]], but also for many speakers elsewhere – in the word ''loch'' and in certain proper names such as ''[[Buchan]]''.

For details of the above phenomena, see [[Middle English phonology#H-loss|H-loss (Middle English)]]. See also the [[Middle English phonology#gu|vocalization of the voiced velar fricative {{IPA|[ɣ]}}]].

===Voiced/voiceless splits===
The Old English fricatives {{IPA|/f, θ, s/}} had voiceless and voiced allophones, the voiced forms occurring in certain environments, such as between vowels. In Early Middle English, partly due to borrowings from French, these split into separate phonemes: {{IPA|/f, v, θ, ð, s, z/}}. See [[Middle English phonology#Voiced fricatives|Middle English phonology – Voiced fricatives]].

Also in the Middle English period, the voiced affricate {{IPA|/dʒ/}} took on phonemic status (in Old English it is considered to have been an allophone of /j/). It occurred in Middle English not only in words like ''brigge'' ("bridge"), in which it had been present in Old English, but also in French loans such as ''juge'' ("judge") and ''general''.

After the Middle English period, a fourth voiced fricative, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, developed as a phoneme (alongside the voiceless {{IPA|/ʃ/}}). This arose from [[yod-coalescence]] ({{IPA|/zj/→/ʒ/}}) in words like ''measure'', and from late French loans such as ''rouge'' and ''beige''.&lt;ref&gt;Prins, A.A., ''A History of English Phonemes'', Leiden University Press 1972, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dental fricatives===
{{main article|Pronunciation of English ⟨th⟩}}
As noted above, the Old English phoneme {{IPA|/θ/}} split into two phonemes in early Middle English: a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/θ/}} and a [[voiced dental fricative]]{{IPA|/ð/}}. Both continued to be spelt {{angbr|th}}.

Certain English accents feature variant pronunciations of these sounds. These include [[Th-fronting|fronting]], where they merge with /f/ and /v/ (found in [[Cockney]] and some other dialects); [[Th-stopping|stopping]], where they approach /t/ and /d/ (as in some Irish speech); [[Th-alveolarization|alveolarization]], where they become {{IPA|/s/ and /z/}} (in some African varieties); and [[Th-debuccalization|debuccalization]], where {{IPA|/θ/}} becomes {{IPA|[h]}} before a vowel (found in some [[Scottish English]]).

===Initial fricative voicing===
[[File:Initial fricative voicing.svg|thumb|The initial consonant in the word ''finger'' in traditional dialects of England.]]
Initial fricative voicing is a process that occurs in some traditional accents of the English [[West Country]], where the fricatives {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} are voiced to {{IPA|[v]}}, {{IPA|[ð]}}, {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} when they occur at the beginning of a word. (Words beginning {{IPA|/θr/}}, like ''three'', develop /dr/ instead.) In these accents, ''sing'' and ''farm'' are pronounced {{IPA|[zɪŋ]}} and {{IPA|[vɑːɻm]}}. The phenomenon is well known as a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] feature, but is now rare in actual speech.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Some such pronunciations have spread from these dialects to become standard usage: the words ''vane'', ''vat'' and ''vixen'' all had initial /f/ in Old English (''fana'', ''fæt'', ''fyxen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar phenomenon occurred in both [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

===Other changes===
* In [[Glasgow]] and some other urban Scottish accents, /s/ is given an [[apico-alveolar]] articulation, which auditorily gives an impression of a [[retraction (phonetics)|retracted]] pronunciation similar to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J., Hualde, J.I., ''Laboratory Phonology 9'', Walter de Gruyter 2007, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Replacement of /s/ with {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is found in some Asian accents, as depicted by ''[[South Park]]'' character [[Tuong Lu Kim]]'s pronunciation of ''city'' as "shitty". Confusion between {{IPA|/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} (or {{IPA|/tʃ/}}) also occurs in some African varieties of English, so ''ship'' may be pronounced like ''sip'' (or ''chip'').&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zulu English]], it is reported that {{IPA|/tʃ/}} is sometimes replaced by {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, R., [https://web.archive.org/web/20080517054614/http://www.und.ac.za/und/ling/archive/wade_ch4.html ''The structural characteristics of Zulu English''], 4.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[labiodental]] fricative /v/ is sometimes merged with the corresponding [[bilabial]] stop /b/. Some speakers of [[Caribbean English]]&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mexican American English]] merge {{IPA|/v/}} with {{IPA|/b/}}, making ''ban'' and ''van'' homophones (pronounced as {{IPA|[ban]}}, or as {{IPA|[βan]}} with a [[Voiced bilabial fricative|bilabial fricative]]). The distinction of /v/ from /b/ is one of the last phonological distinctions commonly learnt by English-speaking children generally, and pairs like ''dribble/drivel'' may be pronounced similarly even by adults.
*In [[Indian English]], /v/ is often pronounced like /w/, sounded as [w] or as a labiodental approximant {{IPA|[ʋ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Indian speakers make various changes in the pronunciation of other fricatives: {{IPA|/z/}} may become {{IPA|[dʒ]}} or {{IPA|[dz]}}; {{IPA|/ʃ/}} may become {{IPA|[s]}} or {{IPA|[sj]}}; {{IPA|/ʒ/}} may become {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, {{IPA|[z]}} or {{IPA|[dʒ]}},  {{IPA|/dʒ/}} may become {{IPA|[z]}} or {{IPA|[dz]}}; {{IPA|/tʃ/}} may become {{IPA|[ts]}}; {{IPA|/f/}} may become a [[voiceless bilabial fricative|bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} or an aspirated stop {{IPA|[p&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 628–629.&lt;/ref&gt; For {{IPA|/θ/ and /ð/}}, see [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]].
*For some speakers of [[Mexican American English]], initial {{IPA|/dʒ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} may be used in place of each other, so ''jet'' may be pronounced as ''yet'' or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uni-due.de/SVE/VARS_Chicano.htm "Chicano English"], Universität Duisburg-Essen. Retrieved 2015-10-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[South African English|Indian South African English]], the typical realization of the labiodental fricatives {{IPA|/f, v/}} are the approximants {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʋ̥}}, {{IPA link|ʋ}}]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mesthrie|first=Rajend|editor-last=Schneider|editor-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Burridge|editor2-first=Kate|editor3-last=Kortmann|editor3-first=Bernd|editor4-last=Mesthrie|editor4-first=Rajend|editor5-last=Upton|editor5-first=Clive|year=2004|title=A handbook of varieties of English|chapter=Indian South African English: phonology|volume=1: Phonology|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|page=960|isbn=3-11-017532-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximants==

===Insertion and deletion of /j/ and /w/ &lt;span id="Y"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
In parts of the west and southwest of England, initial /w/ may be dropped in words like ''wool'' and ''woman''; occasionally, though, a /w/ may be inserted before certain vowels, as in "wold" for ''old'' and "bwoiling" for ''boiling''. Similarly, initial /j/ may be lost in words like ''yeast'' and ''yes'' (this has also been reported in parts of eastern England), and may be added in words like ''earth'' (making "yearth").&lt;ref&gt;Wakelin, M.F., ''Discovering English Dialects'', Osprey Publishing 1994, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the much more widespread deletion of /j/ in consonant clusters, see [[yod-dropping]]  (and compare also [[yod-coalescence]] and [[yod-rhotacization]]). For the historical loss of /w/ in such words as ''who'' and ''write'', see [[English wh|pronunciation of ''wh'']] and [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#wr|reduction of /wr/]].

===Realizations of /r/===
Old and Middle English /r/ was historically pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]], [r]. At some time between later Middle English and Early Modern English, it changed to an [[alveolar approximant]], {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, in the standard accents. Some Scottish speakers, however, retain the original trilled ("rolled") /r/.&lt;ref name="pf"&gt;Pfenninger, S.E. et al., ''Contact, Variation, and Change in the History of English'', John Benjamins 2014, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible realization of /r/ is the [[alveolar tap]], {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. This is common (alongside {{IPA|[ɹ]}}) in Scotland, and is also found in certain other accents, chiefly in positions between vowels or between a consonant and a vowel – this occurs, for example, in some [[Liverpool English]] and in some upper-class [[Received Pronunciation|RP]]&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 282, 372, 411.&lt;/ref&gt; (this should not be confused with the [[Flapping|tap pronunciation of /t/ and /d/]], found especially in North America).

In most [[General American]], /r/ is {{IPA|[ɹ]}} before a vowel, but when not followed by a vowel is generally realized as an [[r-colored vowel]], [ɚ], or as r-coloring on the preceding vowel. In many accents of English, including RP, /r/ is lost altogether when not followed by a vowel – for this, see [[rhoticity in English]] (and for related phenomena, [[linking and intrusive R]]). For vowel changes before /r/, see [[English-language vowel changes before historic /r/]].

A uvular realization of /r/, the "[[Northumbrian burr]]", is used by some speakers in the far north of England.
 
A relatively recent innovation in the southeast of England, possibly originating from [[Cockney]], is the use of a [[labiodental approximant]], {{IPA|[ʋ]}}, for /r/.&lt;ref name="pf" /&gt; To some listeners this can sound like a {{IPA|/w/}}.

===Developments involving /l/ &lt;span id="L"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;===
{{see also|English-language vowel changes before historic /l/}}
[[Velarization]] of /l/ in positions where there is no vowel following, producing a [[dark l|"dark L"]], is a phenomenon that goes back to Old English times.&lt;ref&gt;Theyskens, L., Taeldeman, J., ''Recent Advances in Phonological Theory'', Communication &amp; Cognition 1979, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there is much variation between dialects as regards the degree and distribution of this velarization; see [[English phonology#Sonorants|English phonology (sonorants)]].

In [[Early Modern English]], in many words in which a dark /l/ followed the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/o/}}, the /l/ either disappeared or underwent [[L-vocalization|vocalization]], usually with some kind of [[diphthong]]ization or [[compensatory lengthening]] of the preceding vowel. This affected:
* Words with final /al/ and /ol/, which underwent partial L-vocalization, with the insertion of {{IPA|[ʊ]}} between the vowel and the /l/. The resulting diphthongs developed respectively into modern {{IPA|/ɔː/}} in words like ''all'', ''ball'', ''call'', and into the {{sc2|GOAT}} vowel in words like ''poll'', ''scroll'' and ''control''. Some words of more recent origin did not undergo these changes, such as ''pal'', ''doll'' and ''alcohol''; the word ''shall'' is also unaffected.
* Words with /al/ and /ol/ followed by a [[coronal consonant]], which followed the same pattern as those above, although here in modern RP the {{IPA|/ɔː/}} of the first set is mostly replaced by a short {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, as in words like ''salt'', ''halt'', ''falter'', ''bald'', ''false'', ''Walsh''. Words in the second set, having the {{sc2|GOAT}} vowel, include ''old'', ''cold'' and ''bolt'' (though some RP speakers also have {{IPA|/ɒ/}} in words like ''bolt''). The word ''solder'' has a variety of pronunciations; in North America the /l/ is often dropped.
* Words with /alk/ and /olk/, which again followed the same pattern, but also dropped the /l/, so that words like ''chalk'', ''talk'' and ''walk'' now have {{IPA|/ɔːk/}}, while ''folk'' and ''yolk'' rhyme with ''smoke''.
* Words with /alf/ or /alv/ (''calf'', ''half'', ''halve''), which simply lost the /l/ (the vowel of these is now {{IPA|/æ/}}  in General American and {{IPA|/ɑː/}} in RP, by {{sc2|BATH}}-broadening). The word ''salve'' is often pronounced with the /l/; the name ''[[Ralph (name)|Ralph]]'' may be {{IPA|/rælf/}}, {{IPA|/rɑːlf/}}, {{IPA|/rɑːf/}} or {{IPA|/reɪf/}}. Words like ''solve'' were not affected, although ''golf'' dropped the {{IPA|/l/}} in some British accents.
* Words with /alm/ and /olm/, which lost the /l/ and lengthened the vowel (the lengthened {{IPA|[oː]}} later becoming diphthongized in  the [[toe–tow merger]]). Words like ''alms'', ''balm'', ''calm'', ''Chalmers'', ''qualm'', ''palm'' and ''psalm'' now generally have {{IPA|/ɑː/}} in the standard accents, while ''holm'' and ''Holmes'' are [[homophone]]s of ''home(s)''. Some accents (including many of [[American English]]) have reintroduced the {{IPA|/l/}} in these words as a [[spelling pronunciation]]. The word ''salmon'' generally retains a short vowel despite the loss of /l/.
* A few words with /alb/ or /olb/, such as ''[[Alban (disambiguation)|Alban]]'' and ''[[Albany (disambiguation)|Albany]]'', which have developed to {{IPA|/ɔːl/}} (though ''[[Albania]]'' usually has {{IPA|/æl/}}), and ''[[Holborn]]'', which has the {{sc2|GOAT}} vowel and no /l/. Words like ''scalp'' and ''[[Alps]]'' are unaffected.

As noted under some of the points above, /l/ may be reintroduced in some of the words from which it has been lost, as a spelling pronunciation. This happens sometimes in [[Irish English]], where for example ''[[Dundalk]]'' may be pronounced {{IPA|/dʌndɔːlk/}} (in standard English the {{angbr|l}} is silent).

The /l/ has also been lost in the words [[English modal verbs#Etymology|''would'' and ''should'']]. The word ''could'' was never pronounced with /l/; its spelling results from analogy with the former words.

Modern [[L-vocalization]] (the replacement of "dark" /l/ with a non-syllabic vowel sound, usually similar to [ʊ] or [o]) is a feature of certain accents, particularly in [[Cockney|London English]] and in near-RP speech that has been influenced by it ("[[Estuary English]]"), in some [[New York English|New York speech]], in the [[Southern American English|American South]] and [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE), and according to some reports in [[New Zealand English]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 295, 313–317, 517, 551, 557, 609.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in [[AAVE]] and some southern American accents, L-dropping may occur when the {{IPA|/l/}} sound comes after a vowel and before a [[labial consonant]] in the same syllable, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|/hɛp/}} for ''help'' and {{IPA|/sɛf/}} for ''self''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.rehabmed.ualberta.ca/spa/phonology/features.htm Phonological Features of African American Vernacular English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some accents around [[Bristol]], "intrusive L" is found, where an /l/ is inserted at the end of words ending in [[schwa]], like ''comma'' and ''idea''. This is now somewhat [[social stigma|stigmatized]], but far from rare. The name ''Bristol'' itself was formerly ''Bristow''.&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 344–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some modern English accents, significant ''pre-L breaking'' occurs when /l/ follows certain vowels ({{IPA|/iː/}}, {{IPA|/uː/}}, and diphthongs ending {{IPA|[ɪ]}} or {{IPA|[ʊ]}}). Here the vowel develops a centering offglide (an additional [[schwa]]) before the /l/. This may cause ''reel'' to be pronounced like ''real'', and ''tile'', ''boil'' and ''fowl'' to rhyme with ''dial'', ''royal'' and ''vowel''. [[John C. Wells|Wells]] considers this breaking to be a feature of [[midwest]]ern General American, as well as [[New York English]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells (1982), pp. 487, 505.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar pre-L schwa-insertion may also occur after {{IPA|/r/}} (in [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] accents), leading to pronunciations like {{IPA|[ˈwɜɹəld]}} for ''world''.

==Sound changes involving final consonants==

===Final obstruent devoicing===
Final obstruent devoicing is the full devoicing of final obstruents that occurs for some [[AAVE]] speakers in Detroit where obstruents are devoiced at the end of a word. The preceding length of the vowel is maintained when the final obstruents are devoiced in AAVE, hence the pronunciations {{IPA|[bɪːk]}} and {{IPA|[bæːt]}} for "big" and "bad".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Most varieties of [[English language|English]] don't have full devoicing of final voiced obstruents. Nevertheless, voiced obstruents are partially devoiced in final position in English, especially when phrase-final or when followed by a voiceless consonant (for example, ''bad cat'' {{IPA|[bæd̥ kʰæt]}}). The most salient distinction between ''bad'' and ''bat'' is not the voicing of the final consonant but rather the duration of the vowel and possible [[glottalization]] of final {{IPA|[t]}}: ''bad'' is pronounced {{IPA|[bæːd̥]}} while ''bat'' is {{IPA|[bæ(ʔ)t]}}.

===Final consonant deletion===
Final consonant deletion is the nonstandard deletion of single consonants in syllable-final position occurring for some [[AAVE]] speakers&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; resulting in pronunciations like:

* bad - {{IPA|[bæː]}}
* con - {{IPA|[kɑ̃]}}
* foot - {{IPA|[fʊ]}}
* five - {{IPA|[faɪ]}}
* good - {{IPA|[ɡʊː]}}

When final [[nasal consonants]] are deleted, nasality is maintained on the preceding vowel. When voiced [[stop consonant|stop]]s are deleted, length of the preceding vowel is maintained. Consonants remaining from [[English consonant-cluster reductions#Final consonant-cluster reduction|reduced final clusters]] may be eligible for deletion. The deletion occurs especially if the final consonant is a nasal or a stop. Final-consonant deletion is much less frequent than the more common [[English consonant-cluster reductions#Final consonant-cluster reduction|final-cluster reduction]].

Consonants can also be deleted at the end of a morpheme boundary, leading to pronunciations like {{IPA|[kɪːz]}} for ''kids''.

==Other changes==

==={{IPA|/t–r/}} merger===
In [[Cardiff English]], the {{IPA|/t–r/}} contrast may be reduced before {{IPA|/ə/}} and unstressed {{IPA|/ɪ/}}. Phonetically, the merged sound is either an alveolar tap, or a postalveolar approximant. This merger makes e.g. ''starting'' {{IPA|/ˈstaːtɪŋ/}} and ''starring'' {{IPA|/ˈstaːrɪŋ/}} homophonous as {{IPA|[ˈstaːɾɪn]}} or {{IPA|[ˈstaːɹɪn]}}, but it can also apply across word boundaries, so that both ''but a'' {{IPA|/bət ə/}} and ''butter'' {{IPA|/ˈbətə/}} can be homophonous with ''borough'' {{IPA|/ˈbərə/}} as either {{IPA|[ˈbəɾə]}} or {{IPA|[ˈbəɹə]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|1990|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pieter Jacobus Oud''' (5 December 1886 – 12 August 1968) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) who held numerous political offices, including member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], [[Minister of Finance]] and [[Burgermeester|Mayor]] of [[Rotterdam]]. He was a founding member of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] (PvdA) and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD) which when on to become some of the most influential political parties in [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch politics]]. Before [[World War II]], he was member of the [[Social liberalism|left-liberal]] [[Free-thinking Democratic League]] (VDB).

==Life==
===Life before politics===
Oud came from a middle-class family, his father traded in tobacco, wine and, later, stocks and served as [[Wethouder|alderman]] in Purmerend. Oud attended [[Education in the Netherlands#History of education|HBS]] in [[Amsterdam]] graduating in 1904. He continued to study to become [[Civil law notary|notary]] between 1904 and 1907. During this time he had become member of the board of the League of Freethinking Propaganda Associations, the freethinking liberal youth organisation. He took a private courses in registration in [[Gorinchem]] between 1907 and 1909. Between 1909 and 1911 he was civil servant within the ministry of Finance responsible for registration and government possessions. In 1911 he became a tax collector on [[Texel]]. In 1912 he took his [[matriculation]] in order to study [[law]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. He combined his work as tax collector with his study of law. In the same year he married Johanna Cornelia Fischer, from this marriage they got one son. In 1914 he became tax collector in [[Ommen]]. Meanwhile, he was mobilised as Sergeant of the seventh regiment infantry, which was stationed near Amsterdam between 1914 and 1916. Between 1915 and 1919 he was member of the national board of the VDB. He graduated in 1917 on basis of a [[disputation]].

===Political life===

====For the VDB====
Oud was elected in [[Dutch general election, 1917|1917 elections]] for the VDB, the last election with [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], in the second round he beat the Staalman of the left-wing [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Party]] for the district of [[Den Helder]]. He retained his legal position as tax collector, but was given a leave for undetermined time. he was even promoted to inspector of finances in 1921, while on leave. In [[Dutch general election, 1918|1918]] Oud stood for elections again and was elected with 5,000 [[Voorkeurstem|preference votes]], mainly from the district of Den Helder. While MP, Oud also served as secretary of the VDB national board and editor of the ''De Vrijzinnige Democraat'', the party's magazine. In parliament Oud took a particular interest in military matters and education, and served as the party's finance spokesperson. As MP he served as member of the Committee on the Navy between 1923 and 1933 and the Committee on the Army since 1925. He was chairman of the Association for the promotion of Public Education "People's Education" for many years.

In [[Dutch general election, 1933|1933]] Oud became Minister of Finance in the second cabinet led by [[Hendrik Colijn|Colijn]]. As minister he was responsible for a large scale operation of budget cuts, during a time of economic crisis. In 1935 he proposed the ''Bezuigingswet 1935'' (the Budget Cut law 1935) which involved many budget cuts and financial reorganisations: salaries of civil servants were cut, the old age pensions were financed in a different way and for budgetary reasons, soldiers were to become civil servants after a certain period. Although his proposals lead to a political crisis, they were nonetheless carried by parliament. In the same year, after [[Henri Marchant|Marchant]] left the VDB after a scandal, Oud succeeded him as political leader of the VDB. Oud [[Lijsttrekker|led]] the VDB in the [[Dutch general election, 1937|1937 elections]]  and returned to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] as [[Fractievoorzitter|chair of the parliamentary party]]. He also served as chair for the Committee on government expenditure.

====In Rotterdam====
He left the House of Representatives in 1938 to become [[List of mayors of Rotterdam|mayor]] of [[Rotterdam]]. As mayor he also served in the College of Curators of the University of Rotterdam and as chair of the Association of Dutch Municipalities. After he stepped down in 1952 he became honorary chairman of that association. In 1939 he was elected into the [[States-Provincial]] of [[South Holland]]. In August 1939 he was offered the position of Minister of Finance in the cabinet of [[Dirk Jan de Geer|De Geer]], but declined.

Controversially, Oud did not resign after the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion]] of 1940, although he was not a member of the [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands]] (NSB). During his period as mayor, he was involved in the reconstruction of the centre of Rotterdam which was destroyed by the German bombings. He was heavily criticised by Dutch politicians for cooperating too much with the NSB, while the NSB criticised him for being uncooperative. In the spring of 1941 he was harassed brutally by members of the NSB, twelve party-members invaded the City Hall, gagged Oud, adorned him with [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]-like symbols and made pictures of him. In the autumn of 1941 he resigned as mayor and he stood down as member of the States Provincial. He was succeeded by [[Frederik Ernst Müller]]. In the summer of 1942 he was briefly held in [[Sint-Michielsgestel]], where many prominent Dutch politicians were held captive. During the war Oud kept far from the [[Dutch resistance|resistance movement]] and instead committed himself to writing several books on parliamentary history. Meanwhile, he kept close contact with important people from the business and the political world of Rotterdam.

In 1945, after the [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation of the Netherlands]], he returned to Rotterdam as mayor, although he was also asked to become [[List of mayors of Amsterdam|mayor]] of [[Amsterdam]], and he was officially re-appointed in 1946. In the same year the VDB merged with the social democratic [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|SDAP]] and the left-wing Christian [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|CDU]] to form the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]. Oud was one of the co-founders of this party and served on the party's board between 1946 and 1947. Meanwhile, he served on many government, business, international and civil society committees, he chaired the government committee for municipal finances between 1946 and 1954, he was member of the [[board of trustees]] of the banker Staal, he was member of the pension council of the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]] Church since 1946 and he served as chair of the [[International Union of Municipalities and Local Governments]] between 1948 and 1954.

====For the VVD====
On 3 October 1947 Oud sent a letter to the board of the PvdA with which he resigned as a member. The reason he gave for the split was that the PvdA was moving too much into socialist waters, instead of being committed to progressive politics. The fact that he was refused a position on the party list for the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Senate]] is generally seen as the political reason for Oud's split. Oud never felt at home in the new social-democratic party.

He immediately founded the Committee of Preparation of the Foundation of a Democratic People's Party, which prepared the foundation of the VVD. He negotiated the merger of the remnants of the old VDB with the newly founded [[Freedom Party (Netherlands)|Freedom Party]]. On 24 January 1948 he became one of the founding members of the liberal VVD, together with Stikker and Korthals and served in its first national board as vice-chair. In [[Dutch general election, 1948|1948]] he was elected to the House of Representatives for the VVD, and became chair of the VVD parliamentary party, he combined this position with the position of chair of the party's organisation.

In parliament he mainly spoke on issues of administrative and constitutional law. He was a very influential member of parliament. When the law concerning the decolonisation of [[Indonesia]], a very controversial issue, was voted on, the two-thirds majority was only reached because of amendment proposed by Oud ensured the support of the VVD. In 1950-51 Oud came into conflict with the VVD's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stikker, over the policy concerning [[New Guinea]]. Between 1950 and 1953 he was a member of the Government Committee Van Schaik, which prepared a constitutional change. In 1952 he did not seek to be reappointed as Rotterdam's mayor, and instead became extraordinary professor of [[Constitutional law|Constitutional]] [[Administrative law]] at the [[Erasmus University|University of Rotterdam]], which he remained until 1957. Between 1953 and 1963 he was chair of the Justice Committee of the House of Representatives. As such he was heavily involved in the preparation of many laws, and served as chair on the committees preparing the laws on the provinces, the police, archives, patents and many more. In 1959 he came into conflict with Van Riel, the chair of the VVD's parliamentary party in the Senate, because Van Riel wanted to become minister, but Oud denied him this.

In the last years of his period in the House of Representatives, Oud was the eldest member of the House and on many times functioned as President, when a new president was elected for instance. Before the [[Dutch general election, 1963|1963 elections]] Oud announced that he would not continue as MP, he was succeeded by the Minister of Home Affairs [[Edzo Toxopeus]]. In the same year he was appointed as [[Minister of State#Other use|Minister of State]], an honorary title.

===Life after politics===
After 1963, Oud retired from Dutch political life. He was only asked upon at times of great crisis. In 1966 he was member of the committee, which advised government on the ministerial responsibility towards members of the [[Dutch royal house|royal house]], together with [[Willem Drees]]. In the same year, he co-authored a book on a new constitution.

When Oud died in 1968, his family wanted to announce his death after the burial. His [[General Practitioner|GP]] did not know this, and told a patient that evening that Oud had died that afternoon. The father of this patient happened to be a journalist for the socialist paper [[Het Vrije Volk]], which published a large ''In Memoriam'' the next morning.

A '''pop icon''' is a [[celebrity]], character or object whose exposure in [[popular culture]] is widely regarded as constituting a defining characteristic of a given society or era. The categorization is usually associated with elements such as longevity, [[Omnipresence|ubiquity]] and distinction. Moreover, "pop icon" status is distinguishable from other kinds of notoriety outside pop culture, such as with historic figures. Some historic figures are recognized as having reached "pop icon" status during their era, and such status may continue into the present. Pop icons of previous eras include [[Benjamin Franklin]]&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book

== Longevity ==
Usually, the pop icon status of a celebrity is contingent upon longevity of notoriety.&lt;ref name="dearborn000"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[cult following|cult icons]], whose notoriety or recognition may be limited to a specific [[subculture]]. Some pop icons have left a lasting and indelible mark in the area of their career, and then went on to attain a lasting place of recognition in society at large.&lt;ref name="Ratcliff"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ubiquity ==
A common element of pop icon status is the ubiquity of imagery and allusions to the iconic figure.{{#tag:ref|Kaku,&lt;ref name="Kaku" /&gt; p. 11 |group="note"}} It is common for the figure to be recognized and even celebrated in areas outside the original source of celebrity status.{{#tag:ref|See e.g., Kaku,&lt;ref name="Kaku" /&gt; Chaplin,&lt;ref name="Franklin" /&gt; ''et al.'' |group="note"}} An example of this is [[Albert Einstein]], a [[physicist]] whose image and legacy have been represented in comic strips, T-shirts, greeting cards and many other contexts.&lt;ref name="Kaku"&gt;{{cite book

== Distinction ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Often pop icon status implies distinguished association with a societal ideal or [[archetype]]. It is not uncommon for iconic figures to have a [[nickname]] or [[sobriquet]] that is used to emphasize this association. Sometimes the very name of such individuals is even used as a synonym for common words or ideas.

Some pop icons, such as [[Mickey Mouse]],&lt;ref name="Variety100"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=variety100&amp;content=jump2&amp;jump=iconIndex|title=Icons of the century|date=|work=Variety100.com|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|accessdate=February 8, 2010|first=Dave|last=McNary}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Bugs Bunny]],&lt;ref name="Variety100"/&gt; [[Superman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Batman]], [[Darth Vader]], [[The X-Men]], [[Harry Potter]],&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluecorncomics.com/popicons.htm|title=The 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons|last=Schmidt|first=Robert|date=February 24, 2004|work=Blue Corn Comics website|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Simpsons]],&lt;ref name="Variety100"/&gt; and even [[Sherlock Holmes]] are [[fictional character]]s.

{{History of East Timor}}
'''[[Timor]]''' is an island in [[South East Asia]]. Geologically considered a [[continental crustal fragment]], it lies alongside the [[Sunda shelf]], and is the largest in a cluster of islands between [[Java]] and [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk, |first=K.A. |author2=Fretes, Y. |author3=Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G.  |title=The Ecology of Nusa Tenggara and Maluku |publisher=Periplus Editions Ltd. |year=1996 |pages=41–43|location=Hong Kong |isbn=962-593-076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European colonialism]] has shaped Timorese history since 1515 a period when it was divided between the Dutch in the west of the island (now [[Indonesia]]n [[West Timor]]), and the Portuguese in the east (now the independent state of [[East Timor]]).

==Early history==
The island of [[Timor]] was populated as part of the human migrations that have shaped Australasia more generally. It is believed that survivors from three waves of migration still live in the country. The first is described by anthropologists as [[Vedda people]] who arrived from the north and west at least 42,000 years ago.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In 2011 evidence was uncovered, at the [[Jerimalai]] cave site, showing that these early settlers had high-level maritime skills at this time, and by implication the technology needed to make ocean crossings to reach Australia and other islands, as they were catching and consuming large numbers of big deep sea fish such as tuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2011/evidence-of-42000-year-old-deep-sea-fishing-revealed |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515133750/http://www.pasthorizonspr.com/index.php/archives/11/2011/evidence-of-42000-year-old-deep-sea-fishing-revealed |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations also discovered one of the world’s earliest recorded fish hooks, between 16,000 and 23,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=S. |last2=Ono |first2=R. |last3=Clarkson |first3=C. |title=Pelagic Fishing at 42,000 Years Before the Present and the Maritime Skills of Modern Humans |journal=Science |date=24 November 2011 |volume=334 |issue=6059 |pages=1117–1121 |doi=10.1126/science.1207703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 3000 BC, a second migration brought [[Melanesians]]. The earlier Vedda peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior. Finally, proto-Malays arrived from south [[China]] and north [[Indochina]]. Hakka traders are among those descended from this final group.&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;[http://www.timor-leste.gov.tl/AboutTimorleste/history.htm  Timor Leste History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709173201/http://www.timor-leste.gov.tl/AboutTimorleste/history.htm |date=9 July 2007 }}, [http://timor-leste.gov.tl./  official website].&lt;/ref&gt; Timorese origin myths tell of ancestors that sailed around the eastern end of Timor arriving on land in the south. Some stories recount Timorese ancestors journeying from [[Malay Peninsula]] or the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] Highlands of [[Sumatra]].&lt;ref name="Taylor 2003 page 378"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |pages=378|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Timorese in their region==
The later Timorese were not seafarers, rather they were land focused peoples who did not make contact with other islands and peoples by sea. Timor was part of a region of small islands with small populations of similarly land-focused peoples that now make up eastern Indonesia. Contact with the outside world was via networks of foreign seafaring traders from as far as China and India that served the archipelago. Outside products brought to the region included metal goods, rice, fine textiles, and coins exchanged for local spices, [[sandalwood]], deer horn, bees' wax, and slaves.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2003 page 378"/&gt;

Timor is mentioned in the 13th-century Chinsee ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'', where it is called ''Ti-wu'' and is noted for its sandalwood. It is called ''Ti-men'' in the ''[[History of Song]]'' of 1345. Writing towards 1350, [[Wang Dayuan]] refers to a ''Ku-li Ti-men'', which is a corruption of ''Giri Timor'', meaning island of Timor.&lt;ref&gt;Roderich Ptak, "Some References to Timor in Old Chinese Records", ''Ming Studies'' '''1''' (1983): 37–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nagarakretagama]], the chronicles of the [[Majapahit]] empire called Timor a tributary,&lt;ref name="Taylor 2003 page 377"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Jean Gelman |title=Indonesia: Peoples and Histories |pages=377|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2003 |location= New Haven and London |isbn=0-300-10518-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Portuguese chronologist [[Tomé Pires]] wrote in the 16th century, all islands east of Java were called "Timor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.pt/timor/CURSO1A.HTM Population Settlements in East Timor and Indonesia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202035244/http://www.uc.pt/Timor/CURSO1A.HTM |date=2 February 1999 }} – University of Coimbra&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian nationalist used the Majapahit chronicles to claim East Timor as part of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascal.iseg.utl.pt/~cesa/History_of_Timor.pdf History of Timor] – Technical University Lisbon (PDF-Datei; 805 kB)&lt;/ref&gt; Early European explorers report that the island had a number of small chiefdoms or princedoms in the early 16th century. One of the most significant is the [[Wehali]] or [[Wehale kingdom]] in central Timor, to which the [[Tetum]], [[Bunak]] and [[Kemak people|Kemak]] ethnic groups were aligned.&lt;ref name = "Precolonial"&gt;[http://www.seasite.niu.edu/EastTimor/precolonial.htm  Precolonial East Timor].&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the early sixteenth century, European colonialists&amp;mdash;the Dutch in the island's west, and Portuguese in the east&amp;mdash;would divide the island, isolating the East Timorese from the histories of the surrounding archipelago.&lt;ref name="Taylor 2003 page 377"/&gt;

[[Nationalism]] is the ideological basis for the development of the modern nation-state. According to Leon Baradat, nationalism "calls on people to identify with the interests of their national group and to support the creation of a state - a nation-state - to support those interests."&lt;ref&gt;Baradat,
 Leon P. Political Ideologies: Their Origin and Impact, 10th ed. Upper Saddle, NJ: Pearson, 2009, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It  was an important factor in the development of [[Europe]]. In the 19th century, a wave of [[romantic nationalism]] swept the European continent, transforming its countries. Some newly formed countries, such as Germany and Italy were formed by uniting various regional states with a common "national identity". Others, such as Greece, Serbia, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, were formed by uprisings against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Russia]]. Nationalism was the ideological impetus that, over the century, transformed Europe.  Rule by monarchies and foreign control of territory was replaced by self-determination and newly formed national governments. &lt;ref&gt;slideshare{{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Bastille.jpg|right|350px|thumb|Storming of the Bastille, July 14th 1789.]]

The [[French Revolution]] initiated the movement toward the modern [[nation-state]] and also played a key role in the birth of nationalism across Europe where radical [[intellectuals]] were influenced by [[Napoleon]] and the [[Napoleonic Code]], an instrument for the political transformation of Europe. "Its twin ideological goals, nationalism and democracy, were given substance and form during the tumultuous events beginning at the end of the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Baradat 54-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Revolutionary armies carried the slogan of "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty, equality and brotherhood]]" and ideas of [[liberalism]] and national self-determinism. National awakening also grew out of an intellectual reaction to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that emphasized [[national identity]] and developed a romantic view of cultural self-expression through [[nationhood]]. The key exponent of the modern idea of the nation-state was the German [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. Friedrich Hegel]]. He argued that a sense of [[nationality]] was the cement that held modern [[society|societies]] together in the age when [[dynastic]] and religious allegiance was in decline. In 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], the major powers of Europe tried to restore the old [[dynastic]] system as far as possible, ignoring the principle of [[nationality]] in favour of "[[legitimism]]", the assertion of traditional claims to royal authority. With most of Europe's peoples still loyal to their local [[province]] or city, nationalism was confined to small groups of intellectuals and political radicals. Furthermore, [[political repression]], symbolized by the [[Carlsbad Decrees]] published in [[Austria]] in 1819, pushed nationalist agitation underground.

== The struggle for independence ==
 [[Image:Giuseppe Mazzini.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]], campaigner for [[Italian unification]].]]
A strong resentment of what came to be regarded as [[colonialism|foreign]] rule began to develop. In Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Poland, Hungary,and Norway local hostility to alien [[dynastic]] authority started to take the form of [[nationalism|nationalist]] agitation.{{when|date=February 2016}} The first revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] to acquire a national character was the [[Serbian Revolution]] (1804–17),&lt;ref name="Hanioğlu2010"/&gt; which was the culmination of the [[Serbian renaissance]]&lt;ref name="Singleton1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Singleton|title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&amp;pg=PA72|date=21 March 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27485-2|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had begun in Habsburg territory, in [[Sremski Karlovci]].&lt;ref name="Hanioğlu2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

The Poles attempted twice to overthrow Russian rule in 1831 and 1846. [[Revolutions of 1848|In 1848, revolutions broke out across Europe]], sparked by severe famine and economic crisis and mounting popular demand for political change. In Italy, [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] used the opportunity to encourage a war mission: "A people destined to achieve great things for the welfare of humanity must one day or other be constituted a nation".
 [[Image:Berliner kongress.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Congress of Berlin]] 1878.]]
In Hungary, [[Lajos Kossuth]] led a national revolt against [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule; in [[Transylvania]], [[Avram Iancu]] led successful revolts in 1846. The 1848 crisis had given nationalism its first full public airing, and in the thirty years that followed no fewer than seven new national states were created in Europe. This was partly the result of the recognition by conservative forces that the old order could not continue in its existing form. Conservative reformers such as [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] made common cause with liberal political modernizers to create a consensus for the creation of conservative nation-states in Italy and Germany. In the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] a compromise was reached with Hungarian nationalists in 1867 granting them virtual independence. Native history and culture were rediscovered and appropriated for the national struggle. Following a conflict between Russia and Turkey, the [[Congress of Berlin|Great Powers met at Berlin]] in 1878 and granted independence to Romania, [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and a limited autonomy to Bulgaria.

== Nationalism's growth and export ==
[[Image:Herzl.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Theodor Herzl]].]]
The invention of a symbolic [[Nation|national identity]] became the concern of racial, ethnic or linguistic groups throughout Europe as they struggled to come to terms with the rise of [[mass politics]], the decline of the [[Elitism|traditional social elites]], popular discrimination and [[xenophobia]]. Within the [[Habsburg empire]] the different peoples developed a more mass-based, violent and exclusive form of nationalism. This developed even among the Germans and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]], who actually benefited from the power-structure of the empire. On the European periphery, especially in Ireland and Norway, campaigns for national independence became more strident. In 1905, Norway won independence from Sweden, but attempts to grant Ireland the kind of autonomy enjoyed by Hungary foundered on the national divisions on the island between the [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The Polish attempts to win independence from Russia had previously proved to be unsuccessful, with [[Congress Poland|Poland]] being the only country in Europe whose autonomy was gradually limited rather than expanded throughout the 19th century, as a punishment for the failed uprisings; in 1831 Poland lost its status as a formally independent state and was merged into Russia as a [[real union]] country and in 1867 she became nothing more than just another Russian province. Faced with internal and external resistance to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], as well as increased xenophobic [[anti-Semitism]], radical demands began to develop among the stateless [[Jew]]ish population of [[Eastern Europe|eastern]] and [[central Europe]] for their own national home and refuge. In 1897, inspired by the Hungarian-born Jewish nationalist [[Theodor Herzl]], the [[First Zionist Congress]] was held in [[Basel|Basle]], and declared their national 'home' should be in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. By the end of the period, the ideals of European nationalism had been exported worldwide and were now beginning to develop, and both compete and threaten the empires ruled by colonial European nation-states.

'''Robert Wauchope''' (December 10, 1909 – January 20, 1979) was an American [[archaeologist]] and [[anthropologist]], whose academic research specialized in the prehistory and archaeology of [[Latin America]], [[Mesoamerica]], and the [[Southwestern United States]].

Wauchope was born to George Armstrong Wauchope and Elizabeth Bostedo Wauchope in [[Columbia, South Carolina]] on December 10, 1909. His  interest in archaeology developed early as an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, and upon graduating high school, he wrote [[Alfred V. Kidder]] and asked to join him on excavations at [[Pecos, New Mexico]].  Kidder accepted Robert’s request and invited him to be an assistant at the Forked Lightning Ruin site.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews and Harrison (1981, pp.113–115).&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert attended the First Pecos Conference in 1927 where he met H.S. and C.B. Cosgrove, who invited him to their 1928–1929 excavations at Stallings Island, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  After leaving Stallings Island, he attended the [[University of South Carolina]] where he received a bachelor's degree in English in 1931.

He enrolled at [[Harvard University]] in 1931 with his interests focused on archaeology.  During 1932, Wauchope accompanied [[Alfred V. Kidder]] during excavations at [[Uaxactun]], [[Guatemala]].  In 1938, he graduated from Harvard with a Ph.D. in [[anthropology]], and took a job at the [[University of Georgia]] teaching anthropology courses and Southeastern prehistory. Wauchope held his position for 18 months between 1939 and 1941. He is noted for being the first archaeology professor at the [[University of Georgia]], though his career was predominantly at Tulane University at the Middle American Research Institute.

Throughout his tenure at the [[University of Georgia]], Wauchope directed the WPA archaeological survey of Georgia. He surveyed over 200 sites north of [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], and excavated 23 sites in Macon, [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Stallings Island, and at [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]].  Wauchope developed and ran an archaeology laboratory at the University of Georgia, in addition to setting up the states first detailed archaeological site file. He played a large part in developing the ceramic sequence for north Georgia during the two years he was there.

In 1940, Wauchope was hired as associate professor of anthropology and director of the Laboratory of Anthropology and Archaeology at the [[University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill]].  In 1943 Wauchope was assigned to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] in the [[Mediterranean]] for the duration of the war.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Wauchope is noted for his extensive work on house mounds in Uaxactun, Guatemala. The study of these sites is one of the most extensive of its kind, pertaining to household archaeology of the Maya area and modern Maya house. In 1947 he continued his work on his previous research from 1935-1936 at Zacualpa, in the Guatemalan highlands. 1947-1957 Wauchope taught a multidisciplinary Middle American research program with weekly seminars, working with other Latin American scholars at [[Tulane]]. During the 1950s Wauchope was asked to be general editor of the ''Handbook of Middle American Indians.''&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook on Middle American Indians'' Robert Wauchope, general editor.  University of Texas Press 1964-1976&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Handbook'' was assembled at Tulane and consisted of 16 volumes, the last four of which were guides to sources on Middle American (more currently called [[Mesoamerican]]) [[ethnohistory]], edited by [[Howard F. Cline]]. It was published by the University of Texas press from 1964-1976 with [[Margaret Harrison]] as the editor to the handbook. Wauchope did not engage in any field work after his work in 1957 until 1974 when he returned to Guatemala to work on small sites near Asuncion Mita.

Wauchope is respected for his long and celebrated time with the Middle America Research Institute, as well as building a foundation and picking early staff for Tulane University. In 1967 Tulane had a single independent anthropology facility, no longer joint with the sociology department.

Wauchope is an uncle of underwater archaeologist [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George F. Bass]].

This is a '''timeline of [[women in aviation]]''' which describes many of the firsts and achievements of women as pilots and other roles in [[aviation]]. Women who are part of this list have piloted vehicles, including [[Hot air balloon|hot-air balloons]], [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]], [[airplane]]s, [[Airship|dirigibles]] and [[helicopter]]s. Some women have been instrumental in support roles. Others have made a name for themselves as [[Parachuting|parachutists]] and other forms of flight-related activities. This list encompasses women's achievements from around the globe.

'''Tor Egil Førland''' (born 5 May 1959) is professor of history at the [[University of Oslo]].

==Career==
Between 2003 and 2004 Førland was Subdean of education at the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Oslo, responsible for implementing the [[Quality Reform]] at the faculty. Førland was Head of education and Deputy head of Department of Archaeology, Conservation and History (IAKH) during 2009–2012. Førland has been Head of Department since 2013.

As a historian, Førland has specialized in the radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s and in contemporary international history. He has published books and articles on [[History of the European Union|the history of the EU]], [[European integration]], [[the Cold War]] and [[1968 protests|the 1968 protests]].

Førland has also contributed to the debate on objectivity and values in historiography, taking a stance against the postmodern relativization of truth. He has applied the philosopher [[Peter Railton]]’s concept of the “ideal explanatory text” to argue that the ideal of objectivity in historiography is attainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Førland|first = Tor Egil|date = 2004|title = The Ideal Explanatory Text in History: A Plea for Ecumenism|jstor = 3590646|journal = History and Theory|volume = 43|issue = 3|pages = 321–340|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hurston was born in [[Notasulga, Alabama]], and moved to [[Eatonville, Florida]], with her family in 1894.  Eatonville would become the setting for many of her stories and is now the site of the Zora! Festival, held each year in Hurston's honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zorafestival.org|title=ZORA! Festival|website=ZORA!

Her short satires, drawing from the African-American experience and racial division, were published in anthologies such as ''[[The New Negro: An Interpretation|The New Negro]]'' and ''[[Fire!!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Newly-Complicated-Zora/125753|title=The Newly Complicated Zora Neale Hurston|last=Carpio|first=Glenda R.|date=2011-01-02|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2017-06-21|last2=Sollors|first2=Werner|language=English|issn=0009-5982}}&lt;/ref&gt; After moving back to Florida, Hurston published her literary anthropology on African-American folklore in North Florida, ''[[Mules and Men]]'' (1935) and her first three novels: ''[[Jonah's Gourd Vine]]'' (1934); ''Their Eyes Were Watching God'' (1937); and ''[[Moses, Man of the Mountain]]'' (1939).  Also published during this time was ''Tell My Horse: Voodoo and Life in Haiti and Jamaica'' (1938), documenting her research on rituals in Jamaica and Haiti.

Hurston's works touched on the African-American experience and her struggles as an African-American woman. Her novels went relatively unrecognized by the literary world for decades, but interest revived after author [[Alice Walker]] published "In Search of Zora Neale Hurston" in the March 1975 issue of ''[[Ms. Magazine]]''. Hurston's manuscript ''Every Tongue Got to Confess'' (2001), a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published posthumously after being discovered in the [[Smithsonian]] archives. Her nonfiction book ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'' was published posthumously in 2018.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hurston was the sixth of eight children of John Hurston and Lucy Ann Hurston (''née'' Potts). All of her four grandparents had been born into slavery. Her father was a [[Baptist]] preacher and [[tenant farmer|sharecropper]], who later became a carpenter, and her mother was a school teacher. She was born in [[Notasulga, Alabama]], on January 7, 1891, where her father grew up and her grandfather was the preacher of a Baptist church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=Valerie |title=Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston |year=2003 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-84230-1 |pages=14–17, 439–440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurston |first=Lucy Anne |title=Speak, So You Can Speak Again: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston |year=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=978-0-385-49375-8 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she was three, her family moved to [[Eatonville, Florida]]. In 1887 it was one of the first all-[[African American|black]] towns incorporated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/us/29florida.html|title=In a Town Apart, the Pride and Trials of Black Life|date=September 28, 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times ]]|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston said that Eatonville was "home" to her as she grew up there, and sometimes claimed it as her birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Rainbows'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was elected as mayor of the town in 1897 and in 1902 became minister of its largest church, Macedonia Missionary Baptist.

As an adult, Hurston used Eatonville as a backdrop in her stories. It was a place where African Americans could live as they desired, independent of white society. In 1901, some northern schoolteachers visited Eatonville and gave Hurston a number of books that opened her mind to literature. She described it as a kind of "birth".&lt;ref&gt;Sharon L. Jones, ''A Critical Companion to Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Reference to her Life and Work'' (New York:  Facts on File,  2009), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurston spent the remainder of her childhood in Eatonville, and described the experience of growing up there in her 1928 essay, "[[How It Feels To Be Colored Me]]".

In 1904, Hurston's mother died. Her father remarried to Mattie Moge which was considered scandalous, as it was rumored that he had had relations with Moge before his first wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Rainbows'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston's father and stepmother sent her to a Baptist boarding school in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. They eventually stopped paying her tuition and she was dismissed. She later worked as a maid to the lead singer in a traveling [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] theatrical company.&lt;ref name="Zora Neale Hurston"&gt;[http://www.zoranealehurston.com/biography.html Zora Neale Hurston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416185654/http://www.zoranealehurston.com/biography.html |date=April 16, 2009 }}, Zora Neale Hurston official website, maintained by the Zora Neale Hurston Estate and Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, Hurston began attending Morgan College, the high school division of [[Morgan State University]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. At this time, apparently to qualify for a free high-school education (as well, perhaps to reflect her literary birth), the 26-year-old Hurston began claiming 1901 as her year of birth.&lt;ref name="Zora Neale Hurston" /&gt; She graduated from the high school of Morgan State University in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/hurs-zor.htm Zora Neale Hurston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193528/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/hurs-zor.htm |date=December 12, 2007 }}, Women in History.&lt;/ref&gt;

===College===
In 1918, Hurston began her studies at [[Howard University]], where she became one of the earliest initiates of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority and co-founded ''[[The Hilltop (newspaper)|The Hilltop]]'', the university's student newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Shivonne Foster, [http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/11/20/Campus/Following.Footsteps.Zora.Neale.Hurston-3112139.shtml Following Footsteps: Zora Neale Hurston] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124012428/http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2007/11/20/Campus/Following.Footsteps.Zora.Neale.Hurston-3112139.shtml |date=November 24, 2007 }}, ''[[The Hilltop (newspaper)|The Hilltop]]'', November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, she took courses in Spanish, English, Greek and public speaking and earned an associate degree in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Critical Companion'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921, she wrote a short story, "John Redding Goes to Sea", which qualified her to become a member of [[Alain Locke|Alaine Locke's]] literary club, The Stylus. Hurston left Howard in 1924 and in 1925 was offered a scholarship by Barnard trustee [[Annie Nathan Meyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Annie Nathan|title=It's Been Fun: An Autobiography|year=1951|publisher=H. Schuman|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to [[Barnard College]] of [[Columbia University]], where she was the college's sole black student.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;Cheryl A. Wall, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t52.e289 Oxfordreference.com], William L.

Oxford Reference Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston received her B.A. in [[anthropology]] in 1928, when she was 37. While she was at Barnard, she conducted [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research with noted anthropologist [[Franz Boas]] of [[Columbia University]]. She also worked with [[Ruth Benedict]] as well as fellow anthropology student [[Margaret Mead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/rothschild/cent_anth/early.html|title=A Century of Barnard Anthropology, The Early Period|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101102/http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/rothschild/cent_anth/early.html|archivedate=January 14, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Barnard, Hurston spent two years as a graduate student in anthropology at Columbia University.&lt;ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9041614 Hurston, Zora Neale], February 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Living in Harlem in the 1920s, Hurston befriended the likes of Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen, among several others. Her apartment, according to some accounts, was a popular spot for social gatherings. Around this time, Hurston experienced a few early literary successes, including placing in short-story and playwriting contests in ''Opportunity'' magazine.

===Adulthood===
In 1927, Hurston married [[Herbert Sheen]], a [[jazz]] musician and a former teacher  at Howard who later became a physician. Their marriage ended in 1931. In 1935, Hurston was involved with Percy Punter, a graduate student at [[Columbia University]], who would eventually inspire Teacake in ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

That marriage, too, lasted less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurston |first=Lucy Anne |title=Speak, So You Can Speak Again: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston |year=2004 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-49375-4 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=Valerie |title=Wrapped in Rainbows: The Life of Zora Neale Hurston |year=2003 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=0-684-84230-0 |page=373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She lived in a cottage in [[Eau Gallie, Florida]], twice: once in 1929 and again in 1951.&lt;ref name="ft110306"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Megan K. | last=Scott | title=Hurston's real home | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110309/LIFE/303090002/Zora-Neale-Hurston-s-real-home-Brevard-County| newspaper=[[Florida Today]] | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1D | date=March 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, Hurston was a resident of [[Westfield, New Jersey]], where [[Langston Hughes]] was among her neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-74410616.html "Mule Bone: Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston's Dream Deferred of an African-American Theatre of the Black Word"], ''[[African American Review]]'', 22 March 2001. Accessed 5 March 2011. "In February 1930, Hurston headed north, settling in Westfield, New Jersey. Godmother Mason (Mrs. Rufus Osgood Mason, their white protector) had selected Westfield, safely removed from the distractions of New York City, as a suitable place for both Hurston and Hughes to work."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horner, Shirley.

"Dr. Lewis said that his research 'points out that, thanks to Mrs. Mason's generosity, Hughes lived in the early 1930s in a one-family house in Westfield, where his neighbor was another of Harlem's luminaries, Zora Neale Hurston.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 she established a school of dramatic arts "based on pure Negro expression" at [[Bethune-Cookman University]] (at the time, Bethune-Cookman College), a [[historically black college]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;Porter, ''Jump at de Sun: The Story of Zora Neale Hurston'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, in addition to continuing her literary career, Hurston served on the faculty of North Carolina College for Negroes (now [[North Carolina Central University]]) in [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
In 1956 Hurston received the Bethune-Cookman College Award for Education and Human Relations in recognition of her achievements. The English Department at Bethune-Cookman College remains dedicated to preserving her cultural legacy.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoranealehurston.com/about/timeline/|title=Zora Neale Hurston|first=The Estate of Zora Neale|last=Hurston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropological and folkloric fieldwork===
Hurston traveled extensively in the Caribbean and the American South and immersed herself in local cultural practices to conduct her anthropological research. Based on her work in the South, sponsored from 1928 to 1932 by [[Charlotte Osgood Mason]],&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Rainbows'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; a wealthy philanthropist, Hurston wrote ''[[Mules and Men]]'' in 1935. She was doing research in lumber camps and commented on the practice of white men in power taking black women as sexual [[concubines]], including having them bear children. This later was referred to as "[[paramour rights]]," based in the men's power under [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial]] and related to practices during slavery times. The book also includes much folklore. She used this material as well in fictional treatment developed for her novels such as ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' (1934).&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Rainbows'', pp. 246–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 and 1937, Hurston traveled to [[Jamaica]] and [[Haiti]] for research, with support from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. She drew from this for her anthropological work, ''Tell My Horse'' (1938).

In 1938, Hurston worked for the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writer's project (FWP)]].&lt;ref name="valerie2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48951437|title=Wrapped in rainbows : the life of Zora Neale Hurston|last=Valerie.|first=Boyd,|date=2003|publisher=Scribner|isbn=0684842300|location=New York|oclc=48951437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hired for her experience as a writer and folklorist she gathered information to add to Florida's historical and cultural collection.&lt;ref name="valerie2003"/&gt;

From October 1947 to February 1948, she lived in Honduras, at the north coastal town of [[Puerto Cortés]]. She had some hopes of locating either Mayan ruins or vestiges of an as yet undiscovered civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, ''Rainbows'', pp. 375–87.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Puerto Cortés, she wrote much of ''Seraph on the Suwanee'', set in Florida. Hurston expressed interest in the polyethnic nature of the population in the region (many, such as the [[Miskito Sambu|Miskito Zambu]] and [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]], were of partial African ancestry and had developed [[Creole peoples|creole]] cultures).

During her last decade, Hurston worked as a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers. In the fall of 1952 she was contacted by [[Sam Nunn (editor)|Sam Nunn]], editor of the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]],'' to go to Florida to cover the murder trial of [[Ruby McCollum]]. McCollum was charged with murdering a white doctor and politician, who McCollum said had forced her to have sex and bear his child.&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/1/prweb4933714.htm Dr. C. Arthur Ellis, "New Florida-based Movie on Ruby McCollum Story Underscores Need for Black History Month"], PR Web, 5 January 2011, accessed 18 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston recalled what she had seen of white male sexual dominance in the lumber camps in North Florida, and discussed it with Nunn. They both thought the case might be about such "[[paramour rights]]," and wanted to "expose it to a national audience."&lt;ref name="movie"/&gt;

Upon reaching Live Oak, Hurston was surprised not only by the gag order the judge in the trial placed on the defense, but by her inability to get residents in town to talk about the case; both blacks and whites were silent. She believed that might have been related to Dr. Adams' alleged involvement as well in Sam McCollum's gambling operation. Her articles were published by the newspaper during the trial. Ruby McCollum was convicted by an all-white, all-male jury, and sentenced to death. Hurston had a special assignment to write a serialized account, ''The Life Story of Ruby McCollum'', over three months in 1953 in the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Hurston, Zora Neale. Series of articles covering the trial: ''Pittsburgh Courier'', October 1952-January 1953. Also, "The Life Story Of Ruby McCollum", ''Pittsburgh Courier'', Jan-March 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Her part was ended abruptly when she and Nunn disagreed about her pay, and she left.&lt;ref name="movie"/&gt;

Unable to pay independently to return for the appeal and second trial, she contacted journalist [[William Bradford Huie]], with whom she had worked at ''[[The American Mercury]]'', to try to interest him in the case. He covered the appeal and second trial, and also developed material from a background investigation. Hurston shared her material with him from the first trial, but he acknowledged her only briefly in his book, ''[[Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail]]'' (1956), which became a bestseller.&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;[https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=14694 Elizabeth Boyd, "Disquiet", Review of Tammy Evans, ''The Silencing of Ruby McCollum: Race, Class, and Gender in the South''], H-Net Review, July 2008, accessed 18 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston celebrated that "McCollum's testimony in her own defense marked the first time that a woman of African-American descent was allowed to testify as to the paternity of her child by a white man. Hurston firmly believed that Ruby McCollum's testimony sounded the death toll of '[[paramour rights]]' in the Segregationist South."&lt;ref name="movie"/&gt;

Among other positions, Hurston later worked at the [[Pan American World Airways]] Technical Library at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] in 1957. She was fired for being "too well-educated" for her job.&lt;ref name="ft140204"&gt;{{Cite news | first=Ben | last=Brotemarkle | title=Zora Neale Hurston fond of writing in Eau Gallie cottage | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20140204/NEWS01/302040022/Florida-Frontiers-Zora-Neale-Hurston-fond-writing-Eau-Gallie-cottage| work= | newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida| pages= 9A | date=February 4, 2014 | id= | accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She moved to [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]]. Taking jobs where she could find them, she worked occasionally as a substitute teacher. At age 60, Hurston had to fight "to make ends meet" with the help of public assistance. At one point she worked as a maid on Miami Beach's Rivo Alto Island

===Death===
During a period of financial and medical difficulties, Hurston was forced to enter St. Lucie County Welfare Home, where she suffered a stroke. She died of [[hypertensive heart disease]] on January 28, 1960, and was buried at the Garden of Heavenly Rest in Fort Pierce, Florida. Her remains were in an unmarked grave until 1973. Novelist [[Alice Walker]] and fellow Hurston scholar Charlotte D. Hunt found an unmarked grave in the general area where Hurston had been buried and decided to mark it as hers.&lt;ref&gt;"Charlotte Hunt, renewed interest in author Hurston," ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'', 25 March 25, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Walker had it marked with a gray marker stating ZORA NEALE HURSTON / ''A GENIUS OF THE SOUTH'' / NOVELIST FOLKLORIST / ANTHROPOLOGIST / 1901–1960.&lt;ref name="Plant2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah G.

After Hurston died her papers were ordered to be burned. A law officer and friend, Patrick DuVal, passing by the house where she had lived, stopped and put out the fire, thus saving an invaluable collection of literary documents for posterity. The nucleus of this collection was given to the University of Florida libraries in 1961 by Mrs. Marjorie Silver, friend and neighbor of Hurston. Other materials were donated in 1970 and 1971 by Frances Grover, daughter of E. O. Grover, a Rollins College professor and long-time friend of Hurston's. In 1979 [[Stetson Kennedy]] of Jacksonville, who knew Hurston through his work with the Federal Writers Project, added additional papers.

==Literary career==

===1920s===
When Hurston arrived in New York City in 1925, the [[Harlem Renaissance]] was at its [[zenith]], and she soon became one of the writers at its center. Shortly before she entered Barnard, Hurston's short story "Spunk" was selected for ''[[The New Negro]]'', a landmark anthology of fiction, poetry, and essays focusing on African and African-American art and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Long, "New Negro, The", in William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster, and Trudier Harris (eds), ''The Concise Oxford Companion to African American Literature''. Oxford University Press, 2001. Oxford Reference Online. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t52.e433 Oxfordreference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, a group of young black writers including Hurston, [[Langston Hughes]], and [[Wallace Thurman]], calling themselves the [[Niggerati]], produced a literary magazine called ''[[Fire!!]]'' that featured many of the young artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance.

In 1927 Hurston interviewed [[Cudjoe Lewis|Cudjoe Kazzola Lewis]], of [[Africatown|Africatown, Alabama]], who was the last known survivor of the [[Atlantic slave trade|Transatlantic slave trade]]. The next year she published the article "Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver" (1928). According to her biographer Robert E. Hemenway, this piece largely plagiarized the work of Emma Roche,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography|last=Hemenway|first=Robert E.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0252008078|location=Urbana and Chicago, IL|pages=96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Hurston added information about daily life in Lewis' home village of [[Bantè]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurston|first=Zora Neale|date=October 1927|title=Cudjoe's Own Story of the Last African Slaver|url=|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=12|pages=648–663|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Hurston returned with additional resources; she conducted more interviews, took photographs, and recorded the only known film footage of an African who had been trafficked to the United States through the slave trade. Based on this material, she wrote a manuscript, ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'', which Hemenway described as "a highly dramatic, semifictionalized narrative intended for the popular reader."&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, ''Zora Neale Hurston'', pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Diouf, Sylviane A. 2007.

In 1929, Hurston moved to [[Eau Gallie, Florida]] where she wrote ''[[Mules and Men]]'', which was published in 1935.&lt;ref name="Indian River Journal "&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian River Journal|series=Brevard Historical Commission |first=Ben |last=Brotemarkle |date= Fall–Winter 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--only first paragraph is cited--&gt;
By the mid-1930s, Hurston had published several short stories and the critically acclaimed ''Mules and Men'' (1935), a groundbreaking work of "literary anthropology" documenting African-American [[folklore]] from timber camps in North Florida. In 1930, she collaborated with [[Langston Hughes]] on ''[[Mule Bone|Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts]]'', a play that they never staged. It was published posthumously and staged on Broadway in 1991.&lt;ref name="Hurston, Zora Neale"/&gt;

Hurston translated her anthropological work into the performing arts, and her folk revue, ''The Great Day,'' which featured authentic African song and dance, premiered at the [[John Golden Theatre]] in New York in January 1932. There was only one performance of ''The Great Day'', despite the positive reviews. The Broadway debut left Hurston in $600 worth of debt. No producers wanted to move forward with a full run of the show.

During the 1930s,  Zora Neale Hurston produced two other musical revues, ''From Sun to Sun,'' which was a revised adaptation of ''The Great Day,'' and ''Singing Steel.'' Hurston had a strong belief that folk should be dramatized.

Hurston's first three novels were published in the 1930s: ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' (1934); ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'' (1937), written during her fieldwork in Haiti and considered her masterwork; and ''[[Moses, Man of the Mountain]]'' (1939).

In 1937, Hurston was awarded a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] to conduct ethnographic research in Jamaica and Haiti. ''Tell My Horse'' (1938) documents her account of her fieldwork studying spiritual and cultural rituals in Jamaica and [[Haitian Vodou|vodoun]] in Haiti.

===1940s and 1950s===
In the 1940s, Hurston's work was published in such periodicals as ''[[The American Mercury]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Her last published novel, ''[[Seraph on the Suwanee]]'', notable principally for its focus on white characters, was published in 1948. It explores images of "[[white trash]]" women. Jackson (2000) argues that Hurston's meditation on abjection, waste, and the construction of class and gender identities among poor whites reflects the [[eugenics]] discourses of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Jackson, "Waste and Whiteness: Zora Neale Hurston and the Politics of Eugenics", ''African American Review'', 2000, 34(4): 639–660.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1952, Hurston was assigned by the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'' to cover the small-town murder trial of [[Ruby McCollum]], the prosperous black wife of the local [[bolita]] racketeer, who had killed a racist white doctor. She also contributed to ''Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail'' (1956), a book by journalist and [[civil rights]] advocate [[William Bradford Huie]].

===Posthumous publications===
Hurston's manuscript ''Every Tongue Got to Confess'' (2001), a collection of folktales gathered in the 1920s, was published posthumously after being discovered in the Smithsonian archives.

In 2008, [[The Library of America]] selected excerpts from ''Ruby McCollum: Woman in the Suwannee Jail'' (1956), to which Hurston had contributed, for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime writing.

Hurston's nonfiction book ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'' was published in 2018.&lt;ref name="vulture1"/&gt; A barracoon is a type of [[barracks]] where slaves were imprisoned before being taken overseas.&lt;ref name="vulture1"/&gt;

===Public obscurity===
Hurston's work slid into obscurity for decades, for both cultural and political reasons.

Many readers objected to the representation of [[African-American English|African-American dialect]] in Hurston's novels, given the racially charged history of [[Eye dialect#Use|dialect fiction]] in American literature. Her stylistic choices in dialogue were influenced by her academic experiences. Thinking like a folklorist, Hurston strove to represent speech patterns of the period which she documented through [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duck|first1=Leigh Anne|title='Go there tuh know there': Zora Neale Hurston and the Chronotype of the Folk|journal=American Literary History|date=2001|volume=13|issue=2|pages=265–294|jstor=3054604|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a character in ''Jonah's Gourd Vine'' expresses herself like this:

{{quote|Dat's a big ole resurrection lie, Ned. Uh slew-foot, drag-leg lie at dat, and Ah dare yuh tuh hit me too. You know Ahm uh fightin' dawg and mah hide is worth money. Hit me if you dare!  Ah'll wash yo' tub uh 'gator guts and dat quick.}}

Several of Hurston's literary contemporaries criticized her use of dialect as a caricature of African-American culture rooted in a racist tradition. These writers associated with the Harlem Renaissance were critical of Hurston's later work, which in their view did not further the movement. One criticism came from [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] in his review of ''Their Eyes Were Watching God'':

{{quote|The sensory sweep of her novel carries no theme, no message, no thought. In the main, her novel is not addressed to the Negro, but to a white audience whose chauvinistic tastes she knows how to satisfy. She exploits that phase of Negro life which is "quaint," the phase which evokes a piteous smile on the lips of the "superior" race.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], "Between Laughter and Tears", ''[[The New Masses]]'', October 5, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

More recently, many critics have praised Hurston's skillful use of idiomatic speech.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

During the 1930s and 1940s when her work was published, the pre-eminent African-American author was Richard Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/features/profiles/w/richard-wright.html|title=Happy Birthday, Richard Wright, Groundbreaking Author of "Black Boy" and "Native Son"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Hurston, Wright wrote in explicitly political terms, as someone who had become disenchanted with communism, using the struggle of African Americans for respect and economic advancement as both the setting and the motivation for his work. Other popular African-American authors of the time, such as [[Ralph Ellison]], dealt with the same concerns as Wright.

Hurston, who was a conservative, was on the other side of the disputes over the promise left-wing politics held for African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Jerry Washington Ward and Robert Butler, eds. "Zora Neale Hurston." ''The Richard Wright encyclopedia.'' Greenwood Press. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, for example, Hurston argued that New Deal economic support created a harmful dependency by African Americans on the government, and that this dependency ceded too much power to politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldmag.com/articles/16346 Olasky, Marvin, "History turned right side up". ''WORLD magazine''. February 13, 2010, p. 22.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite increasing difficulties, Hurston maintained her independence and a determined optimism.  She wrote in a 1957 letter: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But … I have made phenomenal growth as a creative artist. … I am not materialistic… If I do happen to die without money, somebody will bury me, though I do not wish it to be that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/7077/zora_neale_hurstons_lost_decade|title=Zora Neale Hurston's Lost Decade|first=Eve|last=Ottenberg|date=April 8, 2011|publisher=|via=In These Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Politics==
[[John McWhorter]] has called Hurston "America's favorite [[Black conservatism|black conservative]]"&lt;ref name=McWhoter&gt;[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]], [http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_3_urb-zora-neale-hurston.html "Thus Spake Zora",] ''City Journal'', Summer 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Root&gt;[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]] (2011-01-04) [https://www.theroot.com/why-zora-neale-hurston-was-a-conservative-1790862242 Why Zora Neale Hurston Was a Conservative], ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]''&lt;/ref&gt; while [[David T. Beito]] and [[Linda Royster Beito]] have argued that she can better be characterized as a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. She was a Republican who was generally sympathetic to the foreign policy non-interventionism of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] and a fan of [[Booker T. Washington]]'s self-help politics. She disagreed with the philosophies (including Communism and the [[New Deal]]) supported by many of her colleagues in the Harlem Renaissance, such as [[Langston Hughes]], who was in the 1930s a supporter of the [[Soviet Union]] and praised it in several of his poems. Despite much common ground with the Old Right in domestic and foreign policy, Hurston was not a [[Social conservatism|social conservative]]. Her writings show an affinity for feminist individualism. In this respect, her views were similar to two [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] novelists who were her contemporaries: [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Isabel Paterson]].&lt;ref name=Beito&gt;[[David T. Beito]] and Linda Royster Beito, [http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_04_4_beito.pdf "Isabel Paterson, Rose Wilder Lane, and Zora Neale Hurston on War, Race, the State, and Liberty",] ''Independent Review'' 12, Spring 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although her personal quotes show a disbelief of religion, Hurston did  not  negate spiritual matters as evidenced from her 1942 autobiography ''[[Dust Tracks on a Road]]''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prayer seems to me a cry of weakness, and an attempt to avoid, by trickery, the rules of the game as laid down. I do not choose to admit weakness. I accept the challenge of responsibility. Life, as it is, does not frighten me, since I have made my peace with the universe as I find it, and bow to its laws. The ever-sleepless sea in its bed, crying out "how long?" to Time; million-formed and never motionless flame; the contemplation of these two aspects alone, affords me sufficient food for ten spans of my expected lifetime. It seems to me that organized creeds are collections of words around a wish. I feel no need for such. However, I would not, by word or deed, attempt to deprive another of the consolation it affords. It is simply not for me. Somebody else may have my rapturous glance at the archangels. The springing of the yellow line of morning out of the misty deep of dawn, is glory enough for me. I know that nothing is destructible; things merely change forms. When the consciousness we know as life ceases, I know that I shall still be part and parcel of the world. I was a part before the sun rolled into shape and burst forth in the glory of change. I was, when the earth was hurled out from its fiery rim. I shall return with the earth to Father Sun, and still exist in substance when the sun has lost its fire, and disintegrated into infinity to perhaps become a part of the whirling rubble of space. Why fear? The stuff of my being is matter, ever changing, ever moving, but never lost; so what need of denominations and creeds to deny myself the comfort of all my fellow men? The wide belt of the universe has no need for finger-rings. I am one with the infinite and need no other assurance.&lt;ref name=FFRF&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation [https://ffrf.org/news/day/famous-freethinkers-secular-stars/spotlight/item/14128-zora-neale-hurston "Zora Neale Hurston - Freedom From Religion Foundation"]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1952, Hurston supported the presidential campaign of Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Like Taft, Hurston was against [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s New Deal policies. She also shared his opposition to Roosevelt and [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]]'s [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]]. In the original draft of her autobiography, ''Dust Tracks on a Road'', Hurston compared the United States government to a "fence" in stolen goods and to a [[Mafia]]-like protection racket. Hurston thought it ironic that the same "people who claim that it is a noble thing to die for freedom and democracy ... wax frothy if anyone points out the inconsistency of their morals ... We, too, consider machine gun bullets good laxatives for heathens who get constipated with toxic ideas about a country of their own." She was scathing about those who sought "freedoms" for those abroad but denied it to people in their home countries:  Roosevelt "can call names across an ocean" for his [[Four Freedoms]], but he did not have "the courage to speak even softly at home."&lt;ref name=Seeing&gt;"Seeing the World As It Is," a chapter deleted at the insistence of the original publishers of Hurston's memoir ''Dust Tracks on a Road'', but later included in the Library of America edition edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; When Truman [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the atomic bombs on Japan]] she called him "the Butcher of Asia."&lt;ref name=Beito/&gt;

Hurston opposed the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case of 1954. She felt that if separate schools were truly equal (and she believed that they were rapidly becoming so), educating black students in physical proximity to white students would not result in better education. In addition, she worried about the demise of black schools and black teachers as a way to pass on cultural tradition to future generations of African Americans. She voiced this opposition in a letter, "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", that was published in the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' in August 1955. Hurston had not reversed her long-time opposition to segregation. Rather, she feared that the Court's ruling could become a precedent for an all-powerful federal government to undermine individual liberty on a broad range of issues in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Zora Neale Hurston, "Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix", ''Orlando Sentinel'', August 11, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/epstein/epstein15.html|title=Court Order Can't Make the Races Mix by Zora Neale Hurston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurston also opposed preferential treatment for African-Americans, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I say a whole system must be upset for me to win, I am saying that I cannot sit in the game, and that safer rules must be made to give me a chance. I repudiate that. If others are in there, deal me a hand and let me see what I can make of it, even though I know some in there are dealing from the bottom and cheating like hell in other ways.&lt;ref name=Root/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

Darwin Turner, an English professor and specialist in African-American literature, faulted Hurston in 1971 for opposing integration and for opposing programs to guarantee blacks the right to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Darwin T. |title=In a Minor Chord: Three Afro-American Writers and Their Search for Identity |year=1971 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale, Ill. |oclc=909407023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though criticized, Hurston appeared to oppose integration based on pride and her sense of independence. She would not "bow low before the white man," and claimed "adequate Negro schools" already existed in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, John M. [http://johneriksen.net/bc/bc_cb.htm ''Brevard County, Florida : A Short History to 1955'']. Chapter 13. "Negro Writer Opposes Court Ruling", ''Titusville Star Advocate'', September 30, 1955, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors criticized Hurston for her sensationalist representation of voodoo.&lt;ref&gt;H. I. Brock, ''New York Times Book Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Crisis]]'' magazine in 1943, [[Harold Preece]] criticized Hurston for her perpetuation of "Negro primitivism" in order to advance her own literary career.&lt;ref&gt;Preece, Harold, "The Negro Folk Cult", ''Crisis'', v. 43, no. 12, December 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' complained that her work on voodoo was an indictment of African-American ignorance and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;B. C. McNeil, ''Journal of Negro History'' 21 (1936) 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Anderson states that Hurston's research methods were questionable, and that she fabricated material for her works on voodoo. He observed that she admitted inventing dialogue for her book ''Mules and Men'' in a letter to Ruth Benedict and described fabricating the ''Mules and Men'' story of rival voodoo doctors as a child in her later autobiography. Anderson believes that many of Hurston's other claims in her voodoo writings are dubious as well.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Anderson, "Voodoo" in ''Black and White'', in Frank &amp; Killbride (eds), ''Southern Character'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have contended that Hurston engaged in significant plagiarism in at least three works, claiming that article "Cudjo's own story of the last African slaver" was only 25% original, the rest being plagiarized,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hemenway, "Zora Neale Hurston: A Literary Biography'', pp. 73–78, 96–99.&lt;/ref&gt; and that she also plagiarized much of her work on voodoo.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Morrow Long, ''Spiritual Merchants'', p. 123; see also Anderson.&lt;/ref&gt;
