'''Agile tooling''' is the design and fabrication of [[manufacturing]] related-tools such as [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s, [[Mold (casting)|molds]], [[Pattern (casting)|patterns]], [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]] in a configuration that aims to maximise the tools' performance, minimise manufacturing time and cost, and avoid delay in [[prototyping]].  A fully functional agile tooling laboratory consists of [[Numerical control#Mills|CNC milling]], [[turning]] and [[Router (woodworking)|routing]] equipment. It can also include [[additive manufacturing]] platforms (such as [[fused filament fabrication]], [[selective laser sintering]], [[Stereolithography]], and [[direct metal laser sintering]]), [[hydroforming]], [[vacuum forming]], [[die casting]], [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamping]], [[injection molding]] and [[welding]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdme.osu.edu/resources/agile-tooling|title=Agile Tooling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agile tooling is similar to [[rapid tooling]], which uses additive manufacturing to make tools or tooling quickly, either directly by making parts that serve as the actual tools or tooling components, such as mold inserts; or indirectly by producing patterns that are in turn used in a secondary process to produce the actual tools. Another similar technique is prototype tooling, where molds, dies and other devices are used to produce prototypes.  Rapid manufacturing, and specifically rapid tooling technologies, are earlier in their development than [[rapid prototyping]] (RP) technologies, and are often extensions of RP.

The aim of all toolmaking is to catch design errors early in the design process; improve product design better products, reduce product cost, and reduce [[time to market]].

Hundreds of universities and research centers{{examples|date=October 2016}} around the globe are investing in additive manufacturing equipment in order to be positioned to make prototypes and tactile representations of real parts. Few have fully committed the concept of using [[additive manufacturing]] (AM) to create manufacturing tools (fixturing, clamps, molds, dies, patterns, negatives, etc.). AM experts{{who|date=October 2016}} seem to agree that tooling is a large, namely untapped market. Deloitte University Press estimated that in 2012 alone, the AM Tooling market $1.2 Billion. At that point in the development cycle of AM Tooling, much of the work was performed under the guise of “let’s try it and see what happens”.

== Industry applications ==
{{refimprove|section|date=October 2016}}
Additive manufacturing, starting with today's infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, [[continuous improvement process|ever-improving]] users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates{{who|date=November 2016}} of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter [[globalization]], as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations.&lt;ref name="3D opp"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6dc11070-d763-11e1-a378-00144feabdc0.html#axzz24gFn5Cal |title=Exploring the 3D printing opportunity |work=[[The Financial Times]] |author=Jane Bird |date=2012-08-08 |accessdate=2012-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.&lt;ref name="Albert_2011-02_MMS_column"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albert |first=Mark|date=17 January 2011 |title=Subtractive plus additive equals more than ( – + + = &gt; )|journal=Modern Machine Shop |volume=83 |issue=9 |publisher=Gardner Publications Inc. |location=Cincinnati, Ohio, USA |page=14 |url=http://www.mmsonline.com/columns/subtractive-plus-additive-equals-more-than }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Automotive''' – approaching niche vehicle markets (making less than 100, 000 vehicles), rather than high production volume

'''Aircraft''' – the U.S. aircraft industry operates in an environment where production volumes are relatively low and resulting product costs are relatively high. Agile tooling can be applied in the early design stage of the development cycle to minimize the high cost of redesign.

'''Medical''' – cast tooling would benefit a great deal from agile tooling. However, the cost for the tooling may still be significantly greater than the cost of a casting piece, with high lead times. Since only several dozen or several hundred metal parts are needed, the challenge for mass production is still prevalent. A balance between these four areas – quantity, design, material, and speed are key to designing and producing a fully functional product.

An '''air horn''' is a pneumatic device designed to create an extremely loud moan for signaling purposes. It usually consists of a source which produces [[compressed air]], which passes into a [[horn (acoustic)|horn]] through a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or diaphragm.  The stream of air causes the reed or diaphragm to vibrate, creating sound waves, then the horn amplifies the sound making it louder. Air horns are widely employed as [[vehicle horn]]s, installed on large [[semi-trailer truck]]s, [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]], [[train]]s, and some [[ambulance]]s as a warning device, and on ships as a signaling device.

== Operation ==
[[File:Powerchamber.JPG|thumb|Diagram of a typical locomotive air horn power chamber, showing operation]]

An air horn consists of a flaring metal or plastic [[horn (acoustic)|horn]] or trumpet (called the "bell") attached to a small air chamber containing a metal [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] in the throat of the horn.  Compressed air flows from an inlet line through a narrow opening past the reed or diaphragm, causing it to vibrate, which creates [[sound wave]]s.  The flaring horn serves as an acoustic "transformer" to improve the transfer of sound energy from the diaphragm to the open air, making the sound louder.  In most horns it also determines the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the sound.  When vibrated by the diaphragm, the column of air in the horn vibrates in [[standing wave]]s.  The length of the horn determines the [[wavelength]] of the sound waves generated, and thus the [[fundamental frequency]] (pitch) of the note produced by the horn.  The longer the horn, the lower the pitch. 

Larger air horns used on ships and [[foghorn]]s function similarly to a [[whistle]]; instead of a diaphragm the air escapes from a closed cylindrical [[acoustic resonator|resonator]] chamber through a precisely shaped slit directed against a knife edge ([[fipple]]).  The air blowing past the knife edge [[oscillation|oscillates]], creating sound waves.  The oscillations excite [[standing wave]]s in the resonator chamber, so the length of the chamber determines the pitch of the note produced.

== Trucks ==

In trucks, the air horn is powered with compressed air from the vehicle's [[air brake (road vehicle)|air brake]] system.  A cord mounted on the ceiling of the operator's cab is pulled to open the valve, supplying varying amounts of air to the horn.  Thus, an outstretched hand reaching upward and pumping is a signal to the driver of an air horn equipped vehicle, requesting a toot. In modern trucks the horn is actuated by a button on the steering wheel (just like a normal car horn). Some trucks have both electric and air horn, selectable by a switch on the dashboard. This is to prevent the use of the powerful air horn in populated areas.

=== Emergency vehicles ===

Many fire trucks, ambulances, and other large emergency vehicles operate air horns as a means of warning vehicles to clear the [[right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]].

There are also electronic horns for emergency vehicles, which produce a similar easily recognizable sound. These are typically integrated into the same system as the vehicle's electronic siren, and sound through the same speakers.  In the last several decades, electronic sound systems with more widely varying frequencies have been chosen as common supplemental warning systems.

== Locomotives ==
{{Main|Train horn}}
[[Image:LeslieS5T.jpg|thumb|Leslie model S5T five-chime locomotive air horn.]]

Originally, diesel locomotives were equipped with truck horns. After an accident in which a driver mistook a train for a truck, the need for a unique-sounding train horn became clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utubc.com/meeting/meeting30.htm |title=Meeting 30 |accessdate=January 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213050152/http://utubc.com/meeting/meeting30.htm |archivedate=February 13, 2009 }} &lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, North American trains now have at least two horns with different tones forming the airhorn, that sound simultaneously,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} creating a [[interval (music)| harmonic interval]] or [[chord (music)| chord]].  Each individual horn is called a "chime". Three and five-chime configurations are the most common, but two chime horns also exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dieselairhorns.com/collection.html |publisher=Horns Inc. |title=A Collection of Airhorns |accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fifteen to twenty seconds before entering a [[level crossing]], federal law requires locomotives to sound their horns in a standard warning sequence. This succession consists of two long, one short, and one long horn sounding repeated as necessary until the locomotive clears the crossing. Exceptions to federal law occur in locations with established quiet zone ordinances that prohibit sounding locomotive horns.

In recent years, it has become a fad for car and truck enthusiasts to install large air horns on their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wesh.com/newsarchive/6845424/detail.html|title=WESH.com New Horns Make Cars Sound Like Trains|accessdate=2008-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919010610/http://www.wesh.com/newsarchive/6845424/detail.html|archive-date=2008-09-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions do not allow an airhorn to be attached, whether or not it can be activated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

== Portable or personal air horns ==
[[Image:Italian Gas Horn.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|A small portable air horn used for sporting events, boating, or safety, powered by a can of compressed air. It is operated by pressing a button on the top.]]

[[wikt:portable|Portable]] air horns are also readily available packaged with a can of compressed air as the air source. These are often sounded by fans at [[sporting event]]s such as [[American football]], [[basketball]], [[hockey]] and [[association football]], and at other events such as [[graduation]]s.

Small versions are sometimes used as [[bicycle horn]]s, since it yields a louder warning sound than traditional bicycle bells or bulb reed horns.

Another use is as a [[non-lethal weapon]] for self-defense, mainly as an [[sound|auditory]] distraction to get away from an attacker. For outdoor activities like hiking, hunting, cross-country skiing, canoeing, fishing, an air horn can be handy to frighten away unwanted or aggressive wildlife, signalling for help and to announce one's location.

At close range, they can also be used as freeze sprays (when the container is held upside-down).

Additionally, air horns (especially those that contain [[fluorocarbons]]) have the potential to be abused as a substitute for [[recreational drugs]] since many such refrigerants can be [[Inhalation|inhaled]] for a quick and dangerous [[Inhalant_abuse#Administration_and_effects|intoxication]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Catharine. "Anti-inhalant Abuse Campaign Targets Building Codes: ‘Huffing’ of Air Conditioning Refrigerant a Dangerous Risk." The Nation's Health. American Public Health Association, 2010.

=== Use in sports ===

The air horn is used for signalling in various sports:
* in ice hockey (especially in the [[NHL]])
* in the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]]
* [[Major League Baseball]] 
* [[indoor soccer]]

NHL arenas normally employ two horns&amp;nbsp;— a high pitch horn (or a siren, as with the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens' home rinks) that announces the end of the period (which is also used to indicate the start of [[instant replay]] reviews), and a much louder, lower pitch horn that is sounded when the home team scores and/or wins a game. Some MLB stadiums use horns for similar purposes, such as when a member of the home team hits a home run. In many places, air horns are used for signaling the end of the period or quarter on scoreboard systems. The entire idea of a goal horn in NHL ice hockey is said to have begun in 1974, when [[Bill Wirtz]], then-owner of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], liked the sound of the horn on his yacht so much, that he had another example of it mounted inside of the "Madhouse on Madison" to be sounded whenever the Blackhawks scored a goal in their home rink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/history-behind-goal-horn-nhl-ubiquitous-scoring-sound-article-1.2613820 |title=The history behind the NHL’s ubiquitous sound for scoring: the goal horn |last=Grossman |first=Evan |date=April 25, 2016 |website=nydailynews.com |publisher=New York Daily News |access-date=August 29, 2018 |quote=The Islanders and hockey fans everywhere can thank the Chicago Blackhawks for pioneering the now-ubiquitous trend during the 1973 Stanley Cup Final against Montreal. Hawks owner Bill Wirtz liked the sound of the horn on his yacht and had it installed at Chicago Stadium..."(He) decided it would be a great thing to have in his arena," Erick Kahlenberg, vice president of Kahlenberg Industries told the Daily News...Kahlenberg's uncle Karl sold Wirtz the yacht horn and now the company supplies more than a dozen NHL teams with their own goal horns, which are the same devices you find on boats, trains, trucks and in one case, an aircraft carrier. When the Blackhawks moved from Chicago Stadium to the United Center in 1994, they took the goal horn with them. By then, goal horns had become a staple of NHL games around the league.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[mixed martial arts]], an air horn is commonly used to signal the end of a round as opposed to the bell used in [[boxing]] and [[professional wrestling]].

=== Use in music ===

Samples of various air horns have been used by [[NHL]] teams when the home team scores a goal, often accompanied by music.

The air horn is also a popular sample in [[reggae music]]. Jamaican dancehall music was the first musical genre to use the effect, and has been using the airhorn sample for over 26 years, in live shows as well as on mixtape recordings, and in Puerto Rican [[reggaeton]], a reggae hybrid genre since the late '80s and '90s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/in-search-of-the-air-horn&lt;/ref&gt; The sound effect has recently been used in [[hip hop music]] as well.

The "Air Horn Orchestra" gathered weekly every Wednesday from April 13, 2016 until the November 2, 2016 at the [[North Carolina Executive Mansion|North Carolina Governor's Mansion]] to protest [[Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act|HB2]] and Governor Pat McCrory by making a racket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article71692747.html | title=‘Air horn orchestra’ seeks McCrory’s attention on House Bill 2 | publisher=News &amp; Observer | date=April 13, 2016 | accessdate=April 24, 2016 | author=Campbell, Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abc11.com/politics/air-horn-orchestra-blasts-hb2-disapproval-in-raleigh/1301739/ | title="Air Horn Orchestra" Blasts HB2 Disapproval in Raleigh | publisher=WTVD/ABC-11 | date=April 20, 2016 | accessdate=April 24, 2016 | author=Brown, Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abc11.com/politics/mccrory-cooper-spar-over-hb2;-noisy-protests-continue/1367620/ | title=McCrory, Cooper Spar Over HB2; Noisy Protests Continue | publisher=WTVD | date=June 1, 2016 | accessdate=June 1, 2016 | author=Brown, Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abc11.com/sports/air-horn-protesters-call-foul-on-hb2-after-accs-action/1512245/ | title='Air Horn' Protesters Call Foul on HB2 After ACC's Action | accessdate=September 15, 2016 | author=Brown, Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 30th and final performance is expected to set the [[Guinness World Record]] for the number of simultaneously sounding air horns, having had 342 participants.

'''[[Color]], [[Raw material|Material]]s, [[Surface finishing|Finish]]''' (CMF) is an area of [[industrial design]] that focuses on the chromatic, tactile and decorative identity of products and environments.

== Characteristics ==
CMF design uses [[metadesign]] logic, the simultaneous planning of the identity of  entire ranges of products for a given [[brand]]. This makes it possible, for example, to adopt a single [[color matrix]], instead of using a series of separate and different [[color card]]s for each line of products, as previously done. A contribution to the development of this approach to design was the impetus provided by the proliferation in the 1980s of complete ranges of new [[systemic products]].

Brand products are often thought up by different designers who through the use of ad-hoc CMF design manuals can work together to ensure a unique but coordinated identity for the products. This working process is advantageous in terms of the choice of color base for systemic products that are either of heterogeneous origin or are considered [[OEM]] products.  The latter, even if characterized by different forms, can be connoted with the base colors or materials that are representative of the brand due to CMF design. Since CMF design manuals and the color matrix have a prescriptive role, the designers who create them are rarely involved in the applicative distribution either of colors, materials or finishes of individual products.

O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CyberBunker has a long history of run-ins with the law. In 2002, a fire broke out in the bunker from which they operated. After the fire was put out, it was discovered that besides internet hosting services, an [[MDMA]] laboratory was in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.security.nl/artikel/3350/Uitgebrande_%27Cyberbunker%27_herbergde_XTC-lab.html Security.nl - Uitgebrande 'Cyberbunker' herbergde XTC-lab] (Dutch), article retrieved 29 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the four men charged with the operation of the lab were convicted to three-year prison sentences; the fourth was acquitted due to a lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omroepzeeland.nl/nieuws/cel-wegens-runnen-xtc-laboratorium#.UVU0wjd8MVQ OmroepZeeland.nl - Cel wegens runnen XTC-laboratorium] (Dutch), article retrieved 29 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pirate Bay===
In October 2009 [[BitTorrent tracker]] [[The Pirate Bay]], which had been subjected to legal action by various anti-[[Software piracy|piracy]] groups including Dutch copyright organisation [[Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland|BREIN]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/the-pirate-bay-back-online-with-new-web-host-in-the-netherlands The Pirate Bay Back Online With New Web Host In The Netherlands, 7 October 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; moved away from Sweden to CyberBunker. In 2010 the Hamburg district court ruled that CyberBunker, operating in Germany as ''CB3Rob Ltd &amp; Co KG'', was no longer allowed to host The Pirate Bay, being subject to a [[Euro|€]]250,000 fine or up to 2 years imprisonment for each infringement.&lt;ref name="MPAA" /&gt;

===Spamhaus===
In October 2011, [[Spamhaus]] identified CyberBunker as providing hosting for spammers and contacted their upstream provider, A2B, asking that service be cancelled. A2B initially refused, blocking only a single [[IP address]] linked to spamming. Spamhaus responded by blacklisting all of A2B address space. A2B capitulated, dropping CyberBunker, but then filed complaints with the Dutch police against Spamhaus for extortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/dutch-isp-hits-spamhaus-with-police-complaints-42302 Dutch ISP Hits Spamhaus With Police Complaints | TechWeekEurope UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/TPB-Causes-Argument-Between-Dutch-ISP-and-Anti-Spam-Organization-227559.shtml TPB Causes Argument Between Dutch ISP and Anti-Spam Organization - Softpedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, Spamhaus added CyberBunker to its blacklist. Shortly afterwards a [[distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attack of previously unreported scale (peaking at 300 Gbit/s; an average large-scale attack is often around 50 Gbit/s, while the largest known previously publicly reported attack was 100 Gbit/s)&lt;ref&gt;Rob Williams for Hot Hardware (2013), [http://hothardware.com/News/DDoS-Attack-Against-Spamhaus-Exposes-Huge-Security-Threat-On-DNS-Servers/ DDoS Attack Against Spamhaus Exposes Huge Security Threat On DNS Servers], article retrieved 28 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was launched against Spamhaus email and web servers using a [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) amplification attack;&lt;ref name=dnsamplification&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/how-spamhaus-attackers-turned-dns-into-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/ How Spamhaus’ attackers turned DNS into a weapon of mass destruction, 28 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bunkerattack&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21954636 BBC: Global internet slows after 'biggest attack in history', 27 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|3|27|lc=on}} the attack had lasted for over a week. Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, said that they had withstood the attack. Other companies, such as [[Google]], had made their resources available to help absorb the traffic.&lt;ref name=bunkerattack/&gt; The attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world.

[[Cloudflare]], an Internet security firm located in San Francisco, California assisting Spamhaus in combating the DoS attack was also targeted. On 28 March 2013, CyberBunker's website went offline for a short period of time, possibly becoming victim of a DDoS attack themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks/ddos-spam-feud-backfires-bulletproof-cyb/240151895 Informationweek Security - DDoS Spam Feud Backfires: 'Bulletproof' CyberBunker Busted], article retrieved 30 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2013, the unrelated secure data storage company BunkerInfra issued a press release stating they have been the owners of the former military bunker since 2010 and that any claims made by CyberBunker regarding their continued usage of the complex are false and that they have not been operating from the bunker since the fire in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bunkerinfra.com/press/PRESSRELEASE_Cyberbunker_not_in_bunker-Kloetinge_March29th2013.pdf BunkerInfra.com - Cyberbunker not located in a bunker in Goes, the Netherlands], article retrieved March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Businessweek'' reported them as stating that the bunker was "full of junk" when they acquired it, and quoted Guido Blaauw, their general manager, as stating that the CyberBunker publicity material was "all [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]".&lt;ref name=Businessweek20130404&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-04/cyberbunker-hacking-as-performance-art|title=CyberBunker: Hacking as Performance Art|author1=Michael Riley |author2=Carol Matlack |author3=Robert Levine |work=Businessweek|date=April 4, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DaVinci''' is a development tool used to create [[HTML5]] [[mobile app]]lications and media content. It includes a [[jQuery]] framework, which is a [[Javascript library|JavaScript library]], and can be used by developers and designers, to create web applications used on mobile devices, that have a [[user experience]] similar to native applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.nuefolio.com/2012/10/davinci-html5-development-tool-for-web-applications “Davinci – HTML5 Development Tool for Web Applications”], Nuefolio Magazine; USA, October 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Business applications, games, and [[rich media]] content, such as HTML5 multi-media magazines, advertisements, and animation, may be produced with the tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itworld.co.kr/news/77333/%EC%9D%B8%ED%81%AC%EB%A1%9C%EC%8A%A4%2C+HTML5+%EC%9B%B9+%EC%95%B1+%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C+%EC%86%94%EB%A3%A8%EC%85%98+%E2%80%98%EB%8B%A4%EB%B9%88%EC%B9%98%E2%80%99+%EC%B6%9C%EC%8B%9C “Incross releases HTML5 web app development solution ‘DaVinci’”], IT World; South Korea, August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; DaVinci is based on standard web technology, including HTML5, [[CSS3#CSS_3|CSS3]], and [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=105&amp;oid=092&amp;aid=0002011365 “B2C app saturation...the mobile B2B market opens up”], Naver News; South Korea, October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
DaVinci is composed of DaVinci Studio and DaVinci Animator, which handle application programming and [[User interface|UI]] design, respectively. The tool has a [[WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) authoring environment in which users may [[drag and drop]] components to build applications and design web content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designfloat.com/blog/2013/03/28/html5-frameworks-mobile-app-development “HTML5 and its Frameworks for Mobile App Development”], Design Float; USA, March 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Open source libraries, such as [[Knockout (web framework)|KnockOut]], jsView/jsRender, Impress.js, and turn.js are included in the tool. Other open source frameworks may also be integrated.

The Model View Controller (MVC) and Data Binding in JavaScript may be handled through DaVinci’s Data-Set Editor. Here, view components and model data may be visually bound, which allows users to create web applications with server integrated UI components without coding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davincisdk.com “DaVinci SDK”], DaVinci SDK Official Site; South Korea, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DaVinci also includes a N-Screen editor, which automatically applies designs and functions to the screen size of various devices, such as [[smartphone]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablet PCs]], and [[smartTV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etnews.com/news/contents/internet/2657259_1488.html “Jaewon Lee marches into the global market with web app authoring software”], ET News; South Korea, October 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11027">'''Deep borehole disposal''' is the concept of disposing high-level [[radioactive waste]] from [[nuclear reactors]] in extremely deep [[borehole]]s instead of in more traditional [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] that are excavated like mines.  Deep borehole disposal seeks to place the waste as much as {{convert|5|km|mi}} beneath the surface of the Earth and relies primarily on the thickness of the natural geological barrier to safely isolate the waste from the biosphere for a very long period of time so that it should not pose a threat to man and the environment. The concept was originally developed in the 1970s, but recently a proposal for a first experimental borehole has been proposed by a consortium headed by [[Sandia National Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="Tollefson2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tollefson |first= Jeff |date= 4 March 2014|title= US seeks waste-research revival|url= http://www.nature.com/news/us-seeks-waste-research-revival-1.14804 |journal= Nature |publisher= |volume=507 |issue= |pages=15–16 |doi= 10.1038/507015a |accessdate=5 June 2014 |pmid=24598616}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The waste would be put into the lower mile of such a hole, within [[Crystal#Rocks|crystalline rock]] to isolate it from the environment.&lt;ref name=Conca&gt;Conca, James.  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/01/21/doe-tries-to-change-the-rules-on-nuclear-waste-disposal/#3837f41a561e "DOE Tries To Change The Rules On Nuclear Waste Disposal"], ''[[Forbes]]'' (January 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  The upper two miles of the borehole would be filled with protective layers including asphalt, [[bentonite]], concrete and crushed rock that are expected to protect the environment during [[geologic time]], and the hole would be lined with steel casing.&lt;ref name=Conca /&gt;

A pair of proposed test boreholes in the United States were cancelled due to public opposition and lack of funding in 2016 and 2017.

==American deep borehole disposal tests==
Beginning in 2016, the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] funded an experimental borehole extending over {{convert|3|mi|km}} deep, in [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]], [[North Dakota]]. The plans for this five-year project in Rugby did not involve nuclear waste, and instead would have tested other aspects of the borehole concept.&lt;ref&gt;Nowatzki, Mike.  [http://www.inforum.com/news/3935017-officials-raise-deep-concern-proposed-drilling-project-near-rugby-could-lead-nuclear "Officials raise 'deep concern' that proposed drilling project near Rugby could lead to nuclear waste disposal in N.D."], ''INFORUM'' (January 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, following protests in North Dakota, a site was proposed in [[Spink County]], [[South Dakota]].  After protests in South Dakota prevented the project from moving forward, the Department of Energy scrapped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/protests-spur-rethink-deep-borehole-test-nuclear-waste |title=Protests spur rethink on deep borehole test for nuclear waste |last=Voosen |first=Paul |date=2016-09-27 |work=Science (AAAS) |access-date=2018-01-18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to public opposition to the first experimental borehole, in late 2016 the Department of Energy announced a second project which would have involved four sites; two in New Mexico, one in Texas and one in South Dakota.  The early stages of the project required gaining public support before the Department of Energy would have selected a final site for an experimental borehole.  On 23 May 2017, the Department of Energy announced that funding priorities had changed and that the deep borehole project was de-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://energy.gov/under-secretary-science-and-energy/articles/studying-feasibility-deep-boreholes |title=Studying the Feasibility of Deep Boreholes |last=Orr |first=Franklin (Lynn) |date=23 May 2017 |access-date=2018-01-18 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The concept involves drilling a borehole about {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} down into the Earth's crust. [[High level waste]], like [[spent nuclear fuel]], would be sealed in strong [[steel]] containers and lowered down the borehole,  filling the bottom one or two kilometers of the hole. Current technology limits the diameter of the borehole to less than 50 centimeters. This means that some waste currently stored in large containers would need to be repackaged in smaller containers.&lt;ref name="Tollefson2014" /&gt; The rest of the borehole is then sealed with appropriate materials, including clay, cement, crushed rock backfill, and asphalt, to ensure a low-permeability barrier between the waste and the land surface.  In some concepts, waste may be surrounded by [[cement]]itious grout or a highly compacted [[bentonite]] buffer matrix to provide improved containment and to reduce the effect of rock movement on the canisters' integrity. A high-temperature scenario involves very young hot waste in the containers which releases enough heat to create a melt zone around the borehole. As the waste decays and cools, the melt zone resolidifies, forming a solid granite sarcophagus around the containers, entombing the waste forever.&lt;ref&gt;Gibb, Fergus (2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20120207132109/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/cm/research/LTNWM/The%20%20Deep%20%20Borehole%20Disposal%20%20Option%20%20for%20Spent%20%20Nuclear%20%20Fuel%20-%20Fergus%20Gibb%20%28Sheffield%20U%29.pdf "The Deep Borehole Disposal Option for Spent Nuclear Fuel".] [[University of Sheffield]].

The deep borehole concept can be applied to any amount of waste. For countries that do not rely on nuclear power plants, their entire inventory of high-level nuclear waste could perhaps be disposed of in a single borehole.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  Current estimates suggest that spent fuel generated from a single large nuclear power plant operating for multiple decades could be disposed of in fewer than ten boreholes.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  It is estimated that only 800 boreholes would be sufficient to store the entire existing nuclear waste stockpile of the USA.&lt;ref name="Tollefson2014" /&gt; Borehole disposal programs could be terminated at any time with little loss of investment because each borehole is independent.  The modular nature of borehole disposal would lend itself to regional, or on-site, disposal of nuclear waste.  Another attraction of the deep borehole option is that holes might be drilled and waste emplaced using modifications of existing oil and gas drilling technologies.

Finally, the environmental impact is small. The waste handling facility at the [[wellhead]], plus a temporary security buffer zone, would require about one square kilometer. When the borehole is filled and sealed, the land can be returned to a pristine condition.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Location of appropriate sites==
Every state in the U.S. has deep rocks suitable for its own borehole repository.&lt;ref name=Conca /&gt;  The required [[Basement (geology)|crystalline basement rocks]] are located far below [[sedimentary rock]] that is not very dense, far below drinking water [[aquifer]]s, and far below oil and gas deposits.&lt;ref name=Conca /&gt;  A single borehole would not be big enough to hold all of the nuclear waste produced by a country like the United States, and therefore a number of them might eventually exist within a single country.&lt;ref name =Conca /&gt;

==Speed of construction==
Scientists at the [[University of Sheffield]] in England say that deep boreholes for nuclear waste disposal can be built much more quickly than a traditional [[deep geological repository]] that is excavated like an underground mine for waste disposal.&lt;ref name=GCR&gt;[http://www.globalconstructionreview.com/news/us-drill-5-km-deep-boreh7ole-te7st-radioacti7ve/ "US to drill 5-km-deep borehole in test for radioactive waste storage"], ''GCR: Global Construction Review'' (February 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  The mined repository approach has been pursued unsuccessfully for many years but the University of Sheffield engineers say that a borehole could be drilled, filled and sealed in no more than five years, in contrast to the decades required for a mined repository.&lt;ref name=GCR /&gt;

'''Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language''', commonly known as '''e-business XML''', or '''ebXML''' (pronounced ee-bee-ex-em-el, [i'bi,eks,em'el]) as it is typically referred to, is a family of [[XML]] based standards sponsored by [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] and [[UN/CEFACT]] whose mission is to provide an open, XML-based infrastructure that enables the global use of [[electronic business]] information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all trading partners.

The ebXML architecture is a unique set of concepts; part theoretical and part implemented in the existing ebXML standards work.

The ebXML work stemmed from earlier work on ooEDI (object oriented [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]), [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] / [[UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology (UMM)|UMM]], XML markup technologies and the [[ANSI ASC X12|X12]] EDI "Future Vision" work sponsored by ANSI X12 EDI.

The melding of these components began in the original ebXML work and the theoretical discussion continues today.  Other work relates, such as the [[Object Management Group]] work and the OASIS BCM (Business-Centric Methodology) standard (2006).

== Conceptual overview of ebXML architecture ==
While the ebXML standards adopted by ISO and OASIS seek to provide formal XML-enabled mechanisms that can be implemented directly, the ebXML architecture is on concepts and methodologies that can be more broadly applied to allow practitioners to better implement e-business solutions.

A particular instance is the Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS) work that continues within UN/CEFACT, whereas its cousin - UBL - [[Universal Business Language]] - specification is used within OASIS that implements specific XML transactions by applying the principles of CCTS to typical [[supply chain]] transactions such as invoice, purchase order, ship notice and so on.

== History ==
ebXML was started in 1999 as a joint initiative between the [[UN/CEFACT|United Nations Centre for Trade facilitation and Electronic Business]] (UN/CEFACT) and [[OASIS (organization)|Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards]] (OASIS). A joint coordinating committee composed of representatives from each of the two organizations led the effort. Quarterly meetings of the working groups were held between November 1999 and May 2001. At the final plenary a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by the two organizations, splitting up responsibility for the various specifications but continuing oversight by the joint coordinating committee.

The original project envisioned five layers of data specification, including XML standards for:

* Business processes,
* Collaboration protocol agreements,
* Core data components,
* Messaging,
* Registries and repositories

All work was completed based on a normative requirements document and the ebXML Technical Architecture Specification.

After completion of the 6 specifications by the two organizations, 5 parts of the work were submitted to ISO TC 154 for approval. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has approved the following five ebXML specifications as the ISO 15000 standard, under the general title, Electronic business eXtensible markup language:

* ISO 15000-1: ebXML Collaborative Partner Profile Agreement (ebCPP)
* ISO 15000-2: ebXML Messaging Service Specification  (ebMS)
* ISO 15000-3: ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM)
* ISO 15000-4: ebXML Registry Services Specification (ebRS)
* ISO 15000-5: ebXML Core Components Specification (CCS) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61433 ISO 15000-5:2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

OASIS technical committees and UN/CEFACT retain the responsibility for maintaining and advancing the above specifications.

== Collaborative Partner Profile Agreement ==
Collaborative Partner Profile Agreements are [[XML]] based documents specifying a trading agreement between trading partners. 
Each trading partner will have their own Collaboration Protocol Profile (CPP) document that describes their abilities in an XML format. For instance, this can include the messaging protocols they support, or the security capabilities they support. 
A CPA (Collaboration Protocol Agreement) document is the intersection of two CPP documents, and describes the formal relationship between two parties. The following information will typically be contained in a CPA document:
*Identification information: the unique identifiers for each party and their roles within the trading relationship
*Security information: for instance, are digital signatures required, and what algorithms do they use
*Communication information: the protocols that will be used when exchanging documents
*Endpoint locations: the URL, service and action messages should be sent to
*Rules to follow when acknowledgments are not received for messages, including how long to wait before resending, and how many times to resend
*Whether duplicate messages should be ignored
*Whether acknowledgments are required for all messages

==Messaging Service Specification==
The Message Service Specification (ebMS) describes a communication-neutral mechanism Message Service Handlers (MSH) must implement in order to exchange business documents. ebMS3.0 is the current version of the specification.
ebMS3.0 is built as an extension on top of the [[SOAP with Attachments]] specification. The [[SOAP]] message contains the meta-data required to exchange the business document in a secure and reliable manner, while the business payload is attached to the [[SOAP]] message. Multiple business payloads may be attached to a single message, and the format of the payloads is beyond the scope of the ebXML specifications.
The information trading partners place in ebMS messages is largely dictated by the CPA agreement that defines the relationship between them. The following information is typically contained within ebMS messages:
*Unique message identifier
*Who the message is for
*Who sent the message
*A conversation identifier for linking related messages
*A digital signature based on the [[XML Signature]] specification
*An indication for whether duplicate messages should be ignored
*An indication for whether acknowledgments are required

ebMS is communication protocol neutral, although the most common underlying protocols are [[HTTP]] and [[SMTP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14927">{{About|high voltage-induced sprays|mass spectrometry ion formation|electrospray ionization}}

The name '''electrospray''' is used for an apparatus that employs electricity to disperse a liquid or for the fine aerosol resulting from this process. High voltage is applied to a liquid supplied through an '''emitter''' (usually a glass or metallic capillary). Ideally the liquid reaching the emitter tip forms a [[Taylor cone]], which emits a liquid jet through its apex. [[Varicose wave]]s on the surface of the jet lead to the formation of small and highly charged liquid droplets, which are radially dispersed due to [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] repulsion.

==History==
In the late 16th century [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]]&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;Gilbert, W. (1628) De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth), London, Peter Short&lt;/ref&gt; set out to describe the behaviour of magnetic and electrostatic phenomena. He observed that, in the presence of a charged piece of amber, a drop of water deformed into a cone. This effect is clearly related to electrosprays, even though Gilbert did not record any observation related to liquid dispersion under the effect of the electric field.

In 1750 the French clergyman and physicist [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Jean-Antoine (Abbé) Nollet]] noted water flowing from a vessel would aerosolize if the vessel was electrified and placed near electrical ground. He also noted that similarly "a person, electrified by connection to a high-voltage generator, would not bleed normally if he were to cut himself; blood would spray from the wound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |chapter= 2 |title= Fundamental Studies of the Mechanisms and Applications of Field-Induced Droplet Ionization Mass Spectrometry and Electrospray Mass Spectrometry |url= http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/3992/12/complete_thesis.pdf |last= Grimm |first= Ronald L. |year= 2006|publisher= Caltech Library |accessdate= May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] theoretically estimated the maximum amount of charge a liquid droplet could carry;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rayleigh, L. |title = On the Equilibrium of Liquid Conducting Masses charged with Electricity | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | year = 1882 | volume = 14 | pages = 184–186 | doi=10.1080/14786448208628425}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is now known as the "Rayleigh limit". His prediction that a droplet reaching this limit would throw out fine jets of liquid was confirmed experimentally more than 100 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gomez, A  |author2=Tang, K |title = Charge and fission of droplets in electrostatic sprays. | journal = [[Physics of Fluids]] | year = 1994 | volume = 6 | issue=1 | pages = 404–414 | doi = 10.1063/1.868037|bibcode = 1994PhFl....6..404G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, [[John Zeleny]] published work on the behaviour of fluid droplets at the end of glass capillaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zeleny, J. |title = The electrical discharge from liquid points, and a hydrostatic method of measuring the electric intensity at their surfaces. | journal = [[Physical Review]] | year = 1914 | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 69 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.3.69 | bibcode=1914PhRv....3...69Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report presents experimental evidence for several electrospray operating regimes (dripping, burst, pulsating, and cone-jet). A few years later, Zeleny captured the first time-lapse images of the dynamic liquid meniscus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zeleny, J. |title = Instability of electrified liquid surfaces. | journal = [[Physical Review]] | year = 1917 | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–6 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.10.1 | bibcode=1917PhRv...10....1Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Between 1964 and 1969 [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] produced the theoretical underpinning of electrospraying.&lt;ref name=Taylor1964&gt;{{cite journal | author =  Geoffrey Taylor | year = 1964 | title = Disintegration of Water Droplets in an Electric Field | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 280 | page = 383  | issue = 1382 | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1964.0151 | jstor=2415876 | bibcode=1964RSPSA.280..383T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor1965&gt;Taylor, G. (1965) The force exerted by an electric field on a long cylindrical conductor. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical &amp; Engineering Sciences, 291, 145-158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taylor1969&gt;Taylor, G. (1969) Electrically Driven Jets. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical &amp; Engineering Sciences, 313, 453-475&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor modeled the shape of the cone formed by the fluid droplet under the effect of an electric field; this characteristic droplet shape is now known as the [[Taylor cone]]. He further worked with J. R. Melcher to develop the "leaky dielectric model" for conducting fluids.&lt;ref name=MelcherTaylor&gt;Melcher, J. R. &amp; Taylor, G. (1969) Electrohydrodynamics: A Review of the Role of Interfacial Shear Stresses. Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 1, 111-146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:Electrospray close-up.JPG|thumb|300 px|A close-up of an electrospray device, the jet of ionised spray is visible within the image.]]
To simplify the discussion, the following paragraphs will address the case of a positive electrospray with the high voltage applied to a metallic emitter. A classical electrospray setup is considered, with the emitter situated at a distance &lt;math&gt;d\,&lt;/math&gt; from a grounded counter-electrode. The liquid being sprayed is characterized by its viscosity &lt;math&gt;(\mu)\,&lt;/math&gt;, surface tension &lt;math&gt;(\gamma)\,&lt;/math&gt;, conductivity &lt;math&gt;(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt;, and relative permittivity &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_r)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Effect of small electric fields on liquid menisci===
Under the effect of surface tension, the liquid meniscus assumes a semi-spherical shape at the tip of the emitter. Application of the positive voltage &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; will induce the electric field:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L. B. Loeb |author2=A. F. Kip |author3=G. G. Hudson |author4=W. H. Bennett | year = 1941 | title = Pulses in negative point-to-plane corona | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 60 | issue = 10 | pages = 714–722 | url = | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.60.714|bibcode = 1941PhRv...60..714L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E={2V \over r \ln(4d/r)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the liquid radius of curvature. This field leads to liquid polarization: the negative/positive charge carriers migrate toward/away from the electrode where the voltage is applied. At voltages below a certain threshold, the liquid quickly reaches a new equilibrium geometry with a smaller radius of curvature.

===The Taylor cone===
Voltages above the threshold draw the liquid into a cone. Sir [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor]] described the theoretical shape of this cone based on the assumptions that (1) the surface of the cone is an equipotential surface and (2) the cone exists in a steady state equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Taylor1964"/&gt; To meet both of these criteria the electric field must have [[azimuth]]al symmetry and have &lt;math&gt;R^{1/2}\,&lt;/math&gt; dependence to balance the surface tension and produce the cone. The solution to this problem is:

:&lt;math&gt;V=V_0+AR^{1/2}P _{1/2} (\cos\theta _0)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V=V_0\,&lt;/math&gt; (equipotential surface) exists at a value of &lt;math&gt;\theta _0&lt;/math&gt; (regardless of R) producing an equipotential cone.  The magic angle necessary for &lt;math&gt;V=V_0\,&lt;/math&gt; for all R is a zero of the [[Legendre polynomial]] of order 1/2, &lt;math&gt;P _{1/2} (\cos\theta _0)\,&lt;/math&gt;. There is only one zero between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\pi\,&lt;/math&gt; at 130.7099°, which is the complement of the Taylor's now famous 49.3° angle.

===Singularity development===
The apex of the conical meniscus cannot become infinitelly small. A singularity develops when the hydrodynamic [[relaxation time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau_H={\mu r \over \gamma}&lt;/math&gt; becomes larger than the charge [[relaxation time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau_C={\epsilon_r\epsilon_0 \over \kappa}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fernández de la Mora, J. |author2=Loscertales, I. G.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The current emitted by highly conductive Taylor cones. | journal = [[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]] | year = 1994 | volume = 260 | pages = 155–184 | doi = 10.1017/S0022112094003472| pmid = |bibcode = 1994JFM...260..155D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The undefined symbols stand for characteristic length &lt;math&gt;(r)\,&lt;/math&gt; and vacuum permittivity &lt;math&gt;(\epsilon_0)\,&lt;/math&gt;. Due to intrinsic varicose instability, the charged liquid jet ejected through the cone apex breaks into small charged droplets, which are radially dispersed by the space-charge.

===Closing the electrical circuit===
The charged liquid is ejected through the cone apex and captured on the counter electrode as charged droplets or positive ions. To balance the charge loss, the excess negative charge is neutralized electrochemically at the emitter. Imbalances between the amount of charge generated electrochemically and the amount of charge lost at the cone apex can lead to several electrospray operating regimes. For cone-jet electrosprays, the potential at the metal/liquid interface self-regulates to generate the same amount of charge as that lost through the cone apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Van Berkel, G. J. |author2=Zhou, F. M. | title = Characterization of an electrospray ion source as a controlled-current electrolytic cell | journal = [[Analytical Chemistry (journal)|Analytical Chemistry]] | year = 1995 | volume = 67 | issue = 17 | pages = 2916–2923 | doi = 10.1021/ac00113a028 | pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Electrospray ionization===
Electrospray became widely used as ionization source for mass spectrometry after the [[John Fenn (chemist)|Fenn]] group successfully demonstrated its use as ion source for the analysis of large biomolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fenn, J. B. |author2=Mann, M. |author3=Meng, C. K. |author4=Wong, S. F. |author5=Whitehouse, C. M. |title=Electrospray ionization for mass spectrometry of large biomolecules. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=2007 |volume=246 |pages=64–71 |doi=10.1126/science.2675315 |pmid=2675315 |issue=4926 |bibcode=1989Sci...246...64F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquid metal ion source===
A [[liquid metal ion source]] (LMIS) uses electrospray in conjunction with liquid metal to form [[ion]]s.&lt;ref name="Swanson1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=L.W.|title=Liquid metal ion sources: Mechanism and applications|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research|volume=218|issue=1-3|year=1983|pages=347–353|issn=0167-5087|doi=10.1016/0167-5087(83)91005-0|bibcode = 1983NIMPR.218..347S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clampitt1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clampitt|first1=R.|title=Advances in molten metal field ion sources|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research|volume=189|issue=1|year=1981|pages=111–116|issn=0167-5087|doi=10.1016/0029-554X(81)90132-4|bibcode = 1981NucIM.189..111C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ions are produced by field evaporation at tip of the Taylor cone. Ions from a LMIS are used in [[ion implantation]] and in [[focused ion beam]] instruments.

===Electrospinning===
{{main|Electrospinning}}
Similarly to the standard electrospray, the application of high voltage to a polymer solution can result in the formation of a cone-jet geometry. If the jet turns into very fine fibers instead of breaking into small droplets, the process is known as '''electrospinning''' .

===Colloid thrusters===
{{main|Colloid thruster}}
Electrospray techniques are used as low thrust [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] [[rocket engine]]s to control [[satellite]]s, since the fine-controllable particle ejection allows precise and effective thrust.

===Deposition of particles for nanostructures===
Electrospray may be used in [[nanotechnology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salata, O.V. |title=Tools of nanotechnology: Electrospray |journal=Current Nanoscience |year=2005 |volume=1 |pages=25–33 |doi=10.2174/1573413052953192 |bibcode=2005CNan....1...25S}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example to deposit single particles on surfaces. This is done by spraying [[colloids]] on average containing only one particle per droplet.  The solvent evaporates, leaving an [[aerosol]] stream of single particles of the desired type.  The ionizing property of the process is not crucial for the application but may be used in [[Electrostatic precipitator|electrostatic precipitation]] of the particles.

===Deposition of ions as precursors for nanoparticles and nanostructures===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Instead of depositing [[nanoparticle]]s, nanoparticles and nano structures can also fabricated in situ by depositing metal ions to desired locations. Electrochemical reduction of ions to atoms and in situ assembly was believed to be the mechanism of nano structure formation.

===Fabrication of drug carriers===
Electrospray has garnered attention in the field of drug delivery, and it has been used to fabricate drug carriers including polymer microparticles used in [[immunotherapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Duong, A.D. |title=Electrospray Encapsulation of Toll-Like Receptor Agonist Resiquimod in Polymer Microparticles for the Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis |journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics |year=2013 |volume=10 |pages=1045–1055 |doi=10.1021/mp3005098|pmc=3857017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lipoplexes used for [[nucleic acid]] delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wu, Y. |title=Coaxial Electrohydrodynamic Spraying: A Novel One-Step Technique To Prepare Oligodeoxynucleotide Encapsulated Lipoplex Nanoparticles |journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics |year=2009 |volume=6 |pages=1371–1379 |doi=10.1021/mp9000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-micrometer-sized drug particles created by electrospray possess increased dissolution rates, thus increased bioavailability due to the increased surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Radacsi, N. |author2=Ambrus, R. |author3=Szunyogh, T. |author4=Szabó-Révész, P. |author5=Stankiewicz, A. |author6=van der Heijden, A. |author7=ter Horst, J. H. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Electrospray Crystallization for Nanosized Pharmaceuticals with Improved Properties |journal=Crystal Growth &amp; Design |year=2012 |volume=12 |pages=3514–3520 |doi=10.1021/cg300285w}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side-effects of drugs can thus be reduced, as smaller dosage is enough for the same effect.

===Air purifiers===
Electrospray is used in some [[air purifier]]s. Particulate suspended in air can be charged by the electrospray aerosol electrospray, manipulated by an electric field, and collected on a grounded electrode. This approach minimizes the production of [[ozone]] which is common to other types of air purifiers.

In the field of [[solid-state physics]], '''enhancement or quenching of the radiation of QDs, Q-wires, and QW''' are methods used to reduce the radiative [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] of [[quantum dot]]s, [[quantum wire|wires]] and [[quantum well|wells]]. Many methods have been developed to enhance or quench the radiation by adjusting the size, changing the structure, and adding other materials to the quantum structures. By doing these, the radiation patterns are regulated, which are expected to have the potential to lead to a new class of light sources. In this page, recent research on [[zinc oxide]] (ZnO) [[nanostructure]]s is introduced and the principles of the enhancement and quenching in the structures are discussed.

==ZnO quantum dots==
The optical properties of ZnO quantum dots can be controlled by changing of the size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Size-dependent enhancement of nonlinear optical properties in nanocolloids of ZnO | url = http://dyuthi.cusat.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/purl/2586/1/Dyuthi-P0146.pdf| year = 2008 | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | pages = 033105-033105-7 | volume = 103 | vauthors = Irimpan L, Krishnan Deepthy BA, ((Nampoori VPN)), Radhakrishnan P | doi = 10.1063/1.2838178 |bibcode = 2008JAP...103c3105I | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the ZnO nanocolloids increases, the absorbance increases, but optical band gap of the nanocolloids decreases. The third-order optical susceptibility increases with increasing particle size.

==ZnO quantum wires==
Radiation fields are changed by the methods to fabricate the quantum wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Microphotoluminescence study of individual suspended ZnO nanowires | doi = 10.1063/1.2898168 | year = 2008 | journal = Applied Physics Letters | pages = 113112 | volume = 92 | vauthors = Gao M, Li W, Liu Y, Li Q, Chem Q, Peng LM |bibcode = 2008ApPhL..92k3112G | issue = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro photoluminescence spectra of an individual suspended as-grown ZnO nanowire and an individual ZnO nanowire processed by sonication/dispersion procedure. The thickness of the nanowire tends to change the radiation fields. The thickness of the nanowire is also related to the peak wavelength. For the nanowire with regular shape shown, only slight difference in UV to visible emission ratios was observed for the two parts with different diameters. Correspondingly, UV emission peaks have almost the same position at 375.2&amp;nbsp;nm. On the other hands, for the nanowire with irregular shape and rougher surface, with the decrease of the diameter, dramatically increased green emission and decreased UV emission can be observed, which was accompanied by the red shift of the UV emission peak energy.

==ZnO quantum wells==
Radiation fields of ZnO quantum wells can be adjusted by coupling through localized surface plasmons. By sputtering Ag islands onto ZnO films, their band gap emission coming through the Ag island films was enhanced by threefolds, while the defect emission was quenched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Enhancement of ZnO light emission via coupling with localized surface plasmon of Ag island film | doi = 10.1063/1.2839404 | year = 2008 | journal = Applied Physics Letters | pages = 041119 | volume = 92 | vauthors = Chen P, Li D, Yuan Z, Chen P, Yang D |bibcode = 2008ApPhL..92d1119C | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enhancement is mainly dependent on the Ag island size. photoluminescence spectra of seven samples which have different Ag island sizes are represented; #4 sample has the largest size of island, but # 1 sample has the smallest size of the island. It is revealed that sputtering time related to the island size have an effect on the enhancement of 380&amp;nbsp;nm band and 530&amp;nbsp;nm band. The PL enhancement or quenching may be due to the coupling of the light emission with the localized surface plasmon resonance of the Ag islands. When localized surface Plasmon resonance scattering dominates over the absorption process, the localized surface Plasmon energy can be recovered to free space emission, leading to the enhancement of light emission. Otherwise, light emission will be attenuated due to non-radiative dissipation of localized surface plasmon absorption.

The Executive Committee consists of a President, Vice-President, Treasurer and Secretary.

==FISEC's events==

FISEC is holding two annual conferences, the '''General Assembly''' and the '''Food Convention'''.

These conferences provide an excellent opportunity to meet our European counterparts and to learn more about their industries, usually by visiting food companies and talking to their representatives. At the General Assembly we also organize the necessary official parts of an association, like electing a new president.

==FISEC's history==



1989, May : The First Food Convention takes place at ENSIA, [[Massy, Essonne|Massy]], [[France]].

1989, November: Starting point for the work between students of the ENSIA and the ESB, [[Porto]], [[Portugal]].

1990, May 5: As a result of that cooperation FISEC is founded at the ESB in Porto by the following six universities: [[University of Reading]], UK; [[University of Milan]], Italy; [[Wageningen University]], [[Netherlands]]; ESB Porto, Portugal; ENSIA, Massy and ENSBANA, [[Dijon]], [[France]].

1991 : The Technical University of Berlin joined FISEC during this year . The last General Assembly was held in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France and the Food Convention was in [[Brussels]], Belgium. A decision was taken for the next Food Convention to be in [[Berlin]], Germany.

Through the years sometimes the separate FISEC teams have lost traces but it never stopped functioning and the students from the various universities across Europe have found their ways to gather.

1998 : FISEC’s official meeting gathers many new members and a few Universities that are very active members till nowadays join the association : Croatia ([[Zagreb]] and [[Osijek]]), Portugal (Porto), Belgium (Brussels), Spain ([[Zaragoza]]), England ([[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]), Hungary ([[Szeged]]), France ([[Nantes]]), Germany ([[Munich]]), Sweden([[Kalmar]]) and Netherlands (Wageningen) are among the participants in the event.

1999: The General Assembly was held in March 1999 and the Food Convention was organized by the team of FISEC Zagreb, Croatia in October during the same year.

2000: The record is only for the Food Convention that was held in Brussels, Belgium where teams from Austria ( University of [[Vienna]]) and Bulgaria ([[Plovdiv]]) joined the members of FISEC.

2001: The next two events gather even more interest.The General Assembly was organized by the team of FISEC-Berlin ( Germany) and the Food Convention was in [[Thessaloniki]] (Greece) . In 2001 Universities from Romania, Slovakia and Portugal(Algarve and Faro) are among FISEC’s new members.

2002: The official website of FISEC was created by Stefan Topfl - member of the Technical University of Berlin, Germany. The General Assembly was held in Plovdiv and the Food Convention in Faro, Portugal.

2003: The General Assembly has been organized in April 2003 by the FISEC team Nantes (France) and the Food Convention in the same year was voted to be in Brussels, Belgium.
During this year the first steps in FISEC’s collaboration with other student’s non-governmental organizations have been done by its current president Mauro Portela.

2004: General Assembly was held in Zagreb, Croatia

2005: General Assembly was held in [[Szeged]], Hungary and Food Convention was held in [[Istanbul]] Turkey on [[Istanbul Technical University]]

2006: General Assembly was held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria and Food Convention was held in Faro, Portugal

2007: General Assembly was held in Split, Croatia. Today's structure and members are accepted on this GA.

The efficiency of absorption of pumping energy in the fiber is an important parameter of a [[double-clad fiber]] laser. In many cases this efficiency can be approximated with&lt;ref name="Kouznetsov" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1- \exp\left(  - F \frac{\pi r^2}{S}\alpha L \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;~S~&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the cladding
:&lt;math&gt;~r~&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the core (which is taken to be circular)
:&lt;math&gt;~\alpha~&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absorption coefficient]] of pump light in the core
:&lt;math&gt;~L~&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the double-clad fiber, and
:&lt;math&gt;~F~&lt;/math&gt; is a [[dimensionless number|dimensionless]] adjusting parameter, which is sometimes called the "filling factor"; &lt;math&gt;~0&lt;F&lt;1~&lt;/math&gt;.

The filling factor may depend on the initial distribution of the pump light, the shape of the cladding, and the position of the core within it.

==Application==
The large (close to unity) filling factor is important in double-clad amplifiers; it allows them to reduce the requirements for the [[brightness]] of the pump and to reduce the length of the fiber laser.  Such a reduction is especially important for the [[power scaling]] of various nonlinear processes, and  contributions of [[stimulated scattering]] to the degradation of signal. Use of the filling factor for the estimate of the efficiency of absorption of the pump in fiber lasers allows quick estimates without performing complicated numerical simulations.

In [[computing]], '''GeoServer''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] server written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] that allows users to share, process and edit [[Geographic information system|geospatial data]]. Designed for interoperability, it publishes data from any major spatial data source using [[open standard]]s.  GeoServer has evolved to become an easy method of connecting existing information to [[virtual globe]]s such as [[Google Earth]] and [[NASA World Wind]] as well as to web-based maps such as [[OpenLayers]], [[Google Maps]] and [[Bing Maps]].  GeoServer functions as the [[reference implementation]] of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] [[Web Feature Service]] standard, and also implements the [[Web Map Service]], [[Web Coverage Service]] and [[Web Processing Service]] specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/|title=GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
GeoServer aims to operate as a node within a free and open [[Spatial Data Infrastructure]].  Just as the [[Apache HTTP Server]] has offered a free and open web server to publish [[HTML]], GeoServer aims to do the same for geospatial data.

== Features ==
GeoServer reads a variety of data formats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/release/stable/|title=GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[PostGIS]]
* [[Oracle Spatial]]
* [[ArcSDE]]
* [[IBM DB2|DB2]]
* [[MySQL]]
* [[Shapefile]]s
* [[GeoTIFF]]
* [[GTOPO30]]
* [[ECW (file format)|ECW]], [[MrSID]]
* [[JPEG2000]]

Through standard protocols it produces [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], [[Geography Markup Language|GML]], Shapefile, [[GeoRSS]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[GeoJSON]], [[JPEG]], [[GIF]], [[SVG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and more. In addition, one can edit data via the [[Web Feature Service#Transactions|WFS transactional profile]] (WFS-T).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html|title=WFS reference — GeoServer 2.14.x User Manual|website=docs.geoserver.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GeoServer includes an integrated [[OpenLayers]] client for previewing data layers.

GeoServer additionally supports efficient publishing of geospatial data to [[Google Earth]] through the use of network links, using KML.  Advanced features for Google Earth output include templates for customized pop-ups, time and height visualizations, and "super-overlays".

GeoServer relies on [[GeoTools]], a [[geographic information system|GIS]] library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geoserver.org/about/|title=About - GeoServer|website=geoserver.org|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
* [[MassGIS]] (Massachusetts state GIS) 
* [[MACRIS Maps]] (Massachusetts Historical Commission)
* [[TriMet]]  (Transit agency for Portland, Oregon)
* [[Ordnance Survey]] (National Mapping Agency of the UK)
* [[Institut Géographique National]] (National Mapping Agency of France)
* [[GBIF]] (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)

* GMOS (Global Mercury Observation System)
* [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)
* [[New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications]]
* TeamSurv
* ITU (International Telecommunication Union)

== Architecture ==
GeoServer uses the [[Spring Framework]], providing a request dispatch architecture for modules implementing OGC services. The web administration application uses wicket, allowing extensions to contribute additional configuration screens. The application provides a REST API implemented using the [[Spring Framework#Model–view–controller framework|spring-mvc-framework]].

GeoServer is a web application, supporting any common [[Java Servlet#Servlet containers|servlet container]] (a standalone distribution is available with the [[Jetty (web server)]] as an embedded server). [[GeoWebCache]], a Java-based caching component similar to [[TileCache]], is bundled with GeoServer, but available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geowebcache.org/trac |title=GeoWebCache |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405124130/http://geowebcache.org/trac |archivedate=2010-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, GeoServer packages GeoTools as a Java library, but it is also available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geotools.org/|title=GeoTools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GeoServer is a longstanding application and has undergone several architectural changes. GeoServer 1.0 was built around the STRUTS framework, with the migration to Spring and Wicket taking place for GeoServer 2.0. Early versions of the REST API used restlet before migration to [[Spring Framework#Model–view–controller framework|spring-mvc-framework]].

A '''gravity-based structure''' (GBS) is a support structure held in place by [[gravity]]. A common application for a GBS is an offshore [[oil platform]]. These structures are often constructed in [[fjords]] since their protected area and sufficient depth are very desirable for construction. A GBS intended for use as an offshore oil platform is constructed of steel [[reinforced concrete]], often with tanks or cells which can be used to control the buoyancy of the finished GBS. When completed, a GBS is towed to its intended location and sunk. Prior to deployment, a [[Offshore geotechnical engineering|study of the seabed]] have to be done in order to ensure it can withstand the vertical load exerted on it by that structure.&lt;ref name="Dean"&gt;Dean, E.T.R. (2010). Offshore Geotechnical Engineering - Principles and Practice. Thomas Telford, Reston, VA, U.S.A., 520 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravity-based structures are also used for offshore [[wind power]] plants. By the end of 2010, 14 of the world's offshore wind farms were supported by gravity-based structures. The GBS are suited for water depths greater than 20 m. The deepest registered offshore wind farm with gravity-based structures is Thornton Bank 1, Belgium, with a depth up to 27.5 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lorc.dk/Knowledge/Offshore-renewables-map/Offshore-site-datasheet/Thornton-Bank-1-Offshore-Wind-Farm/000030|title=LORC Knowledge. "Datasheet for site: Thornton Bank 1 offshore wind farm", 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As offshore wind power plants are growing in size and moving towards deeper waters, the GBS is considered competitive in comparison with other support structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">The Heterojunction-emitter [[bipolar transistor]] (HEBT), is a somewhat unusual arrangement with respect to emitter blocking of minority carriers. This is accomplished by using heterostructure confinement in the emitter, introducing an energy barrier to minority-carrier charge flow from the base. This is important as loss of minority carriers from the base to the emitter degrades [[analog signal|analog]] performance. The main difference of the HEBT from the [[Heterojunction bipolar transistor]] (HBT) is that the emitter–base interface is the same as in a [[bipolar junction transistor]] (BJT) with the blocking energy gap being moved back into the emitter bulk region.

==Functional Architecture==
[[Image:Heterostructure emitter bipolar transistor.jpg|thumb|HEBT, by Rutherford Research]]
The main advantage of HEBT architecture, compared to the HBT is a simplified [[fabrication process]] for the emitter–base junction. In particular the HEBT does not require as tight parametric control during [[epitaxial growth]], that equivalent abrupt or [[graded emitter]] structures might. This is very important as it is evident from [[scanning ion mass spectrometry]] data that out-[[diffusion]] base dopant into the emitter junction is difficult to control, as the base is, in general, very highly [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] in order to enhance performance.

==Application==

The HEBT is well positioned as a potential candidate for key roles in high-frequency [[optoelectronic]] markets, similar to the [[Heterojunction bipolar transistor]]. Also of importance for optoelectronic hybrids is that HEBT can be constructed in any semiconductor system that permits the use of band-gap–altering alloys in the emitter.

[[Image:Hobbles on a donkey.jpg|thumb|A hobbled donkey in Sardinia]]
A '''hobble''' (also, and perhaps earlier, '''hopple''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Second|volume=VII|page=380|ISBN=0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''spancel''' is a device which prevents or limits the [[Terrestrial locomotion|locomotion]] of a [[animal]], by [[tether]]ing one or more legs.  Although hobbles are most commonly used on [[horse]]s, they are sometimes used also on other animals.  On [[dog]]s, they are used especially during force-fetch training to limit the movement of a dog's front paws when training it to stay still.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gundogsonline.com/misc-dog-supplies/dog-hobbles.html Dog Hobbles], ''Gun Dogs Online'', accessed December 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They are made from [[leather]], [[rope]], or synthetic materials such as [[nylon]] or [[neoprene]]. There are various designs for breeding, casting, and mounting horses.

==Types==
[[Image:Hind leg pull up.jpg|thumb|Hind leg pull up strap]]
[[Image:Hobbles.JPG|thumb|Drovers' and cattle hobbles]]

===Western horse hobbles===
"Western"-style horse hobbles are tied around the pasterns or cannon bones of the horse's front legs. They comprise three basic types:
* The '''vaquero''' or '''braided hobble''', which is often of a quite fancy plaiting and lighter than other varieties, and is therefore only suitable for short term use.
* The '''figure eight hobble''' or '''Queensland Utility Strap''', a common style of hobble that [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] wear as a belt and can be used neck strap, lunch-time hobble, or tie for a “micky”. This hobble is made with three pieces of leather and two rings, plus a buckle fastening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=skt.netc.net.au|url=http://skt.netc.net.au/hide_belts.htm|title= Solid  Hide Belts|accessdate=November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''twist hobble''', made of soft leather or rope, with a twist between the horse's legs.

The above patterns are unsuitable for training as they can tighten around a leg and cause injury.

Western hobbles are normally used to secure a horse when no tie device, tree, or other object is available for that purpose, e.g.,  when if traveling across open lands a rider has to dismount for various reasons. Hobbles also allow a horse to graze and move short and slow distances, yet prevent the horse from running off too far. This is handy at night if the rider has to get some sleep; using a hobble ensures that in the morning he can find his horse not too far away.

Hobble training a horse is a form of "sacking out" and desensitizing a horse to accept restraints on its legs. This helps a horse accept pressure on its legs in case it ever becomes entangled in barbed wire or fencing. A hobble trained horse is less likely to pull, struggle, and cut its legs in a panic, since it has been taught to give to pressure in its legs.

===Other hobbles===
* '''Breeding or service hobbles''' usually fasten around a mare's hocks, pass between her front legs to a neck strap. They are used to protect a stallion from kicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nylon Breeding Hobbles|url=http://www.kyhorse.com/store/equipment/breedinghobbles.htm|publisher=KY Horse|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Casting hobbles''' are the same as the above, but with another rope or strap attached to the other hind foot. When these straps or ropes are pulled up together, the horse will fall.
* '''Cattle hobbles''' are a strong strap with a metal keeper in the middle and a buckle at the end. They are used on the hind legs for a short period when capturing feral cattle.
* '''Drovers’ or  grazing hobbles''' have a buckle on a wide double redhide or chrome leather strap and a swivel and 5 ring chain connecting them. They are placed around the pasterns.
* '''Hind leg pull up strap''' passes from a neck strap and around a hind pastern to draw up a hind foot for shoeing or treatment.
* '''Hopples''' (sometimes called hobbles) are a piece of equipment used by [[Standardbred]] pacers to help the horse maintain its pacing gait.
* '''Humble or one leg hobble''' is a strap placed around the front pastern, and then the leg is lifted and the strap is wrapped around the upper leg and then buckled, leaving the horse with three legs to stand on.
* '''Mounting hobbles''' are knee hobbles that are made with a quick release, on a lead that passes to the rider. They are used to mount fractious horses and when mounted the rider can retrieve them.

* '''Picket hobble''' is a single hobble that is placed on a front pastern and then attached to a tether chain.
* '''Sideline hobbles''' may be made in the same manner as above, but with a longer chain to hobble a front and back leg. Rope may also replace the chain. They, too, are placed around the pasterns. This pattern may be useful on a persistent jumper or a horse that has mastered the art of travelling in front leg hobbles
* '''Three or four leg hobbles''' are made in a similar pattern to the above and hobble three or four legs. Used for securing legs for operations, etc.

The '''iodine pit''', also called the '''iodine hole''' or '''xenon pit''', is a temporary disabling of a [[nuclear reactor]] due to buildup of short-[[Half-life|lived]] [[nuclear poison]]s in the [[reactor core]]. The main isotope responsible is [[xenon-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe]], mainly produced by natural [[beta decay|decay]] of [[iodine-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I]]. &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I is a weak [[neutron absorber]], while &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is the strongest known neutron absorber. When &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe builds up in the [[fuel rod]]s of a reactor, it significantly lowers their [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]], by absorbing a significant amount of the neutrons which provide the nuclear reaction.

The presence of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I and &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe in the reactor is one of the main reasons for its power fluctuations in reaction to change of [[control rod]] positions.

The buildup of short-lived [[fission product]]s acting as nuclear poisons is called '''reactor poisoning''', or '''xenon poisoning'''. Buildup of stable or long-lived neutron poisons is called '''reactor slagging'''.

==Fission products decay and burnup==
One of the common [[fission product]]s is [[tellurium-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Te]], which undergoes [[beta decay]] with [[half-life]] of 19 seconds to [[iodine-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I]]. &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I itself is a weak neutron absorber. It builds up in the reactor in the rate proportional to the rate of fission, which is proportional to the reactor thermal power. &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I undergoes beta decay with half-life of 6.57 hours to [[xenon-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe]]. The yield of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe for uranium fission is 6.3%; about 95% of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe originates from decay of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I.

&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe has a huge [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for [[thermal neutron]]s, 2.6×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[barn (unit)|barns]],&lt;ref name="stacey" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it acts as a [[neutron absorber]] or "[[nuclear poison|poison]]" that can slow or stop the [[chain reaction]] after a period of operation. This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the [[Manhattan Project]] for [[plutonium]] production. As a result, the designers made provisions in the design to increase the reactor's reactivity (the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of [[nuclear fuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/hanford_operational.htm |title=Hanford Becomes Operational |work=The Manhattan Project: An Interactive History |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of History and Heritage Resources |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014114829/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/hanford_operational.htm |archivedate=October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is the most powerful known neutron absorber. Its buildup in the fuel rods significantly lowers [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]] of the reactor core. By a [[neutron capture]], &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is transformed ("burned") to [[xenon-136|&lt;sup&gt;136&lt;/sup&gt;Xe]], which is stable and does not significantly absorb neutrons. The burn rate is proportional to the [[neutron flux]], which is proportional to the reactor power; a reactor running on twice the power will have twice the xenon burn rate.

&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe beta-decays with half-life of 9.2 hours to [[caesium-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]]; a poisoned core will spontaneously recover after several half-lives. For some reactors, the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe concentration will be equal to its equilibrium concentration at full power. After about 3 days of shutdown, the core can be assumed to be free of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, without it introducing errors into the reactivity calculations.&lt;ref name="tpubdoe"/&gt;

The increase in the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe concentration during lowering of the reactor power can lower the reactivity enough to effectively shut down the reactor. As there are not enough neutrons to offset their absorption by &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, nor to burn the built-up xenon, the reactor has to be kept in shutdown state for 1–2 days until enough of the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe decays. The inability of the reactor to be restarted in such state is called '''xenon precluded start up''' or '''dropping into an iodine pit'''; the duration of this situation is known as '''xenon dead time''', '''poison outage''', or '''iodine pit depth'''. Due to the risk of such situations, in the early Soviet nuclear industry, many servicing operations were performed on running reactors, as downtimes longer than an hour led to xenon buildup that could keep the reactor offline for significant time, lower the production of valuable weapon [[plutonium-239|&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu]], and cause an investigation by a committee and punishment of the operators.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

===Xenon-135 oscillations===
The interdependence of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe buildup and the neutron flux can lead to periodic power fluctuations. In large reactors, with little neutron flux coupling between their regions, flux nonuniformities can lead to formation of '''xenon oscillations''', periodic local variations of reactor power moving through the core with a period of about 15 hours. A local variation of neutron flux causes increased burnup of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe and production of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I, depletion of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe increases the reactivity in the core region. The local power density can change by factor of three or more, while the average power of the reactor stays more or less unchanged. Strong negative [[temperature coefficient]] of reactivity causes [[damping]] of these oscillations, and is a desired reactor design feature.&lt;ref name="tpubdoe" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Xenon-135  Oscillations|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/doe/h1019v2/css/h1019v2_63.htm|accessdate=2014-08-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iodine pit behavior===
[[File:reactor shutdown xe chart en.png|thumb|right|400px|Development of &lt;span style="color:RoyalBlue;"&gt;'''(1)'''&lt;/span&gt; concentration of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe and &lt;span style="color:OrangeRed;"&gt;'''(2)'''&lt;/span&gt; reactor [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]] after reactor shutdown. (Until shutdown the [[neutron flux]] was φ=10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.)]]&lt;!-- TODO: upload the image from russian wikipedia --&gt;
The reactivity of the reactor after the shutdown first decreases, then increases again, having a shape of a pit; this gave the "iodine pit" its name. The degree of poisoning, and the depth of the pit and the corresponding duration of the outage, depends on the [[neutron flux]] before the shutdown. Iodine pit behavior is not observed in reactors with neutron flux density below 5×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, as the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is primarily removed by decay instead of neutron capture. As the core reactivity reserve is usually limited to 10% of Dk/k, thermal power reactors tend to use neutron flux at most about 5×10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to avoid restart problems after shutdown.&lt;ref name="tpubdoe"/&gt;

The concentration changes of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe in the reactor core after its [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] is determined by the short-term [[power history]] of the reactor (which determines the initial concentrations of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I and &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe), and then by the half-life differences of the isotopes governing the rates of its production and removal; if the activity of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I is higher than activity of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe, the concentration of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe will rise, and vice versa.

During reactor operation at a given power level, a [[secular equilibrium]] is established within 40–50 hours, when the production rate of iodine-135, its decay to xenon-135, and its burning to xenon-136 and decay to caesium-135 are keeping the xenon-135 amount in the reactor constant at a given power level.

The equilibrium concentration of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I is proportional to the neutron flux φ. The equilibrium concentration of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe however depends very little on neutron flux for φ&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Increase of the reactor power, and the increase of neutron flux, causes a rise in production of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I and consumption of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe. At first, the concentration of xenon decreases, then slowly increases again to a new equilibrium level as now excess &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I decays. During typical power increases from 50 to 100%, the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe concentration falls for about 3 hours.&lt;ref name="Xenon decay transient graph"&gt;[http://www.tpub.com/content/doe/h1019v2/css/h1019v2_64.htm Xenon decay transient graph]&lt;/ref&gt;

Decrease of the reactor power lowers production of new &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I, but also lowers the burn rate of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe. For a while &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe builds up, governed by the amount of available &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I, then its concentration decreases again to an equilibrium for the given reactor power level. The peak concentration of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe occurs after about 11.1 hours after power decrease, and the equilibrium is reached after about 50 hours. A total shutdown of the reactor is an extreme case of power decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = DOE Fundamentals Handbook: Nuclear Physics and Reactor Theory Volume 2| date = January 1993| publisher = U.S. Department of Energy| url = http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/techstds/docs/handbook/h1019v2.pdf| accessdate = 2013-03-12| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121109194948/http://www.hss.doe.gov/nuclearsafety/techstds/docs/handbook/h1019v2.pdf| archivedate = 2012-11-09| df = }}, pages 35-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design precautions==
If sufficient [[reactivity (nuclear)|reactivity]] control authority is available, the reactor ''can'' be restarted, but a xenon burn-out [[Transient state|transient]] must be carefully managed.  As the [[control rod]]s are extracted and [[critical mass|criticality]] is reached, [[neutron flux]] increases many orders of magnitude and the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe begins to absorb neutrons and be transmuted to &lt;sup&gt;136&lt;/sup&gt;Xe.  The reactor ''burns off'' the nuclear poison.  As this happens, the reactivity increases and the control rods must be gradually re-inserted or reactor power will increase.  The time constant for this burn-off transient depends on the reactor design, power level history of the reactor for the past several days (therefore the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe and &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I concentrations present), and the new power setting. For a typical step up from 50% power to 100% power, &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe concentration falls for about 3 hours.&lt;ref name="Xenon decay transient graph"/&gt;

Reactors with large physical dimensions, e.g. the [[RBMK]] type, can develop significant nonuniformities of xenon concentration through the core. Control of such nonhomogeneously poisoned cores, especially at low power, is a challenging problem. The [[Chernobyl disaster]] resulted from an attempt to recover the reactor from a nonuniformly poisoned state.

The iodine pit effect has to be taken in account for reactor designs. High values of [[power density]], leading to high production rates of fission products and therefore higher iodine concentrations, require higher amount and enrichment of the [[nuclear fuel]] used to compensate. Without this reactivity reserve, a reactor shutdown would preclude its restart for several tens of hours until &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;I/&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe sufficiently decays, especially shortly before replacement of spent fuel (with high [[burnup]] and accumulated [[nuclear poison]]s) with fresh one.

Fluid fuel reactors cannot develop xenon inhomogeneity because the fuel is free to mix. Also, the [[Molten Salt Reactor Experiment]] demonstrated that spraying the liquid fuel as droplets through a gas space during recirculation can allow xenon and krypton to leave the fuel salts. However, removing &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe from neutron exposure also means that the reactor will produce more of the [[long-lived fission product]] [[caesium-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Cs]].

'''''Joe 90''''' is a 1960s [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Science fiction on television|science-fiction]] television series that follows the adventures of a nine-year-old boy, Joe McClaine, who starts a [[double life]] as a schoolchild-turned-superspy after his scientist father invents a device capable of duplicating expert knowledge and experience and [[Mind uploading|transferring]] it to a [[human brain]]. Equipped with the skills of the foremost academic and military minds, Joe is recruited by the World Intelligence Network (WIN) and, as its "Most Special Agent",&lt;ref group="e" name="The Most Special Agent"/&gt; pursues the objective of [[world peace]] and saving human life. Created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]] and filmed by [[Century 21 Productions]], the 30-episode series followed ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''.

First broadcast in the UK between September 1968&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 140"/&gt; and April 1969&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 149"/&gt; on the [[Associated Television|ATV]] network, ''Joe 90'' was the sixth and final of the Andersons' productions to be made exclusively using the form of [[marionette]] puppetry termed "[[Supermarionation]]". Their final puppet series, ''[[The Secret Service]]'', used this process only in combination with extensive live-action filming. As in the case of its antecedent, ''Captain Scarlet'', the puppets of ''Joe 90'' are of natural proportions as opposed to the more [[caricature]]d design of the characters of ''Thunderbirds''.

Although not as successful as Century 21's previous efforts,&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Supermarionation Classics, 290"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2g2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 115"/&gt; since its inception, ''Joe 90'' has been praised, among other aspects, for the level of [[characterisation]] of its smaller puppet cast&lt;ref name="BFI"/&gt; and the quality of its [[Scale model|model sets]] and [[special effects]].&lt;ref name="Supermarionation Classics, 290"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt; Critics have interpreted ''Joe 90''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Spy-fi (neologism)|spy-fi]] theme and the choice of a child character as the protagonist as either a "kids play [[James Bond|Bond]]" concept&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt; or an enshrinement of children's powers of imagination.&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt; Points of criticism range from the [[Media violence research|violence]] depicted in a number of episodes&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt; to the absence of female characters,&lt;ref name="SAInterview"/&gt; which is interpreted either as the inevitable result of the series' composition as a "boy's own adventure"&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 181"/&gt; or as being tantamount to [[sexism]].&lt;ref name="Peel, 243"/&gt;

As for its earlier productions, Century 21 launched a number of [[merchandising]] campaigns based on ''Joe 90'', which included [[toy car]]s&lt;ref name="60s70sToys"/&gt; and [[comic strip]]s featuring the continuing adventures of Joe McClaine.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 170"/&gt; The series was [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|syndicated]] in the United States in 1969,&lt;ref name="AllMovie"/&gt; re-broadcast in the UK during the 1990s&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 260"/&gt; and released on DVD in most [[DVD region code|regions]] in the 2000s.&lt;ref name="2000sBeyondDVD"/&gt; The idea of a live-action film adaptation of ''Joe 90'' has been considered more than once since the 1960s,&lt;ref name="BBCNews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toonhound05"/&gt; but without further development.

{{Main|List of Joe 90 episodes}}

''Joe 90'' is set in the near future.&lt;ref name="Cull, 197"/&gt; The timeframe is most commonly stated to be 2012 and 2013;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 137"/&gt; various other sources point to an undetermined year in the early 21st century,&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt; while the official scriptwriters' guide states that the year is 1998.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 142"&gt;Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on visual evidence, the events of "[[The Unorthodox Shepherd]]" occur in 2013.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Unorthodox Shepherd"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Unorthodox Shepherd|episodelink=The Unorthodox Shepherd|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by [[Tony Barwick]].

Nine-year-old British schoolboy Joe McClaine is the [[adopted]] son of Professor Ian "Mac" McClaine, a computer expert. Outwardly, the McClaines are an unexceptional father and son; they live in an antiquated [[Elizabethan]]-style cottage overlooking Culver Bay in [[Dorset]], and are waited on by their housekeeper, Mrs Harris. Yet, residing in a secret underground laboratory is Mac's latest invention, the "BIG RAT" ('''B'''rain '''I'''mpulse [[wikt:galvanoscope|'''G'''alvanoscope]] '''R'''ecord '''A'''nd '''T'''ransfer), a machine capable of [[Mind uploading|recording knowledge and experience]] from leading experts in various fields and transferring it to another human brain. At the heart of the design is the "Rat Trap": a spherical, rotating cage in which a subject is seated during the transfer of "brain patterns".

Sam Loover, a family friend and an agent of World Intelligence Network (WIN), persuades Mac to dedicate the services of Joe and the BIG RAT to the organisation: Joe will become a WIN operative with a difference, the unlimited possibilities offered by the BIG RAT serving as an invaluable tool for completing missions.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Most Special Agent"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Most Special Agent|episodelink=The Most Special Agent|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]].

Given that a boy would never be suspected of espionage, Joe's innocence is as useful an asset as the BIG RAT, and he comes to be regarded as WIN's "Most Special Agent".&lt;ref group="e" name="The Most Special Agent"/&gt; Reporting to Shane Weston, the [[commander-in-chief]] of WIN's London Headquarters, Joe is also equipped with a special briefcase, which externally appears to be nothing more than a school case but which secretly contains an adapted handgun and [[transceiver]].&lt;ref group="e" name="The Most Special Agent"/&gt;&lt;ref group="e" name="Hi-jacked"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hi-jacked|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by Tony Barwick. Directed by Alan Perry|airdate=20 October 1968}} Episode 4.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some inconsistency as to why Joe is assigned the codename "90". Contemporary series publicity stated that, in the [[The Most Special Agent|pilot episode]], Joe enlists in WIN as its 90th London-based agent.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt; However, in the episode "Project 90", reference is made to the BIG RAT being documented in WIN's "File Number 90", from which Joe's designation is explicitly stated to originate.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt;&lt;ref group="e" name="Project 90"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Project 90|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by Tony Barwick. Directed by Peter Anderson|airdate=13 October 1968}} Episode 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The series ends with a [[clip show]] episode, "The Birthday", in which a selection of Joe's missions are presented as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] at a surprise party on the day that the character turns ten.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Birthday"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Birthday|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by Tony Barwick.

Like antecedent series, plot elements of ''Joe 90'' include hi-tech gadgetry,&lt;ref group="e" name="The Professional"&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Professional|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by [[Donald James]]. Directed by Leo Eaton|airdate=26 January 1969}} Episode 18.&lt;/ref&gt; rescue operations,&lt;ref group="e" name="Relative Danger"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Relative Danger|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by [[Shane Rimmer]].

The [[in-joke]] of "WIN", the abbreviated form of "World Intelligence Network", is similar to that of "WASP", the [[acronym]] for the World Aquanaut Security Patrol that appears in ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''.&lt;ref name="Cull, 199"&gt;Cull, p.&amp;nbsp;199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fictional universe of ''Joe 90'', the [[Cold War]]—significant at the time of the series' TV debut, owing to the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968—has ended, and a [[world government]] has been established.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Most Special Agent"/&gt;&lt;ref group="e" name="Attack of the Tiger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull, 197"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull, 205"&gt;Cull, p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt; WIN is the successor organisation to [[MI6]], the [[CIA]] and the [[KGB]], all of which have been merged in the formation of the global network.&lt;ref name="Cull, 197"/&gt; Although the pilot sees Joe hijacking a Russian jet fighter to expose the secrets of its construction to the [[Western world|West]], the storyline is ultimately revealed to be a speculative fiction posited by Weston as an example of the espionage that Joe would have to perform if he were to join WIN.&lt;ref group="e" name="The Most Special Agent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull, 197"/&gt; The plot twist, in particular the revelation that Russia and the West are allies in the future, is praised by academic [[Nicholas J. Cull]] for its "progressiveness of spirit", and for exemplifying Anderson's "[taking] an end to the Cold War as a given in his work".&lt;ref name="Cull, 197"/&gt; Anderson was motivated by what he perceived as a "duty to the rising generation to avoid perpetuating Cold War stereotypes",&lt;ref name="Cull, 197"/&gt; once stating that he "tried very hard not to put [his] ten cents into creating [[World War Three]]".&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt;

Despite the existence of a global government and intelligence organisation, the nations of Earth are still politically divided into Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] blocs; here, Cull argues, ''Joe 90'' is similar to other Anderson series in that it "unashamedly capitalized on the Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown".&lt;ref name="Cull, 199"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull, 200"&gt;Cull, p.&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/ref&gt; The recurring antagonist of WIN and Joe is the non-aligned "Eastern Alliance", which dominates Asia and appears in the episodes "Attack of the Tiger"&lt;ref group="e" name="Attack of the Tiger"/&gt; and "Mission X-41".&lt;ref group="e" name="Mission X-41"/&gt; Meanwhile, villains in "International Concerto",&lt;ref group="e" name="International Concerto"/&gt; "Business Holiday",&lt;ref group="e" name="Business Holiday"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Business Holiday|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by Tony Barwick.

"Arctic Adventure" and "Attack of the Tiger" combine the threat from the East with the hazards of nuclear technology: in the former, Joe must recover a stray atomic warhead from the ocean floor while avoiding enemy submarines, while in the latter, he is tasked with destroying an Eastern nuclear device that is about to be launched into Earth orbit.&lt;ref group="e" name="Attack of the Tiger"/&gt;&lt;ref group="e" name="Arctic Adventure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull, 198"/&gt; By contrast, an episode that presents the benign aspects of such technology is "Big Fish", in which Joe labours to remove a defective nuclear submarine from the [[territorial waters]] of a [[Latin America]]n police state.&lt;ref group="e" name="Big Fish"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Big Fish|series=Joe 90|credits=Written by Shane Rimmer.

==Production==
Following ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', ''Joe 90'' was purposely conceived and developed to be a different kind of [[Supermarionation]] series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on [[characterisation]]&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hulse|first1=Stephen R.|title=''Joe 90'': A Television Heaven Review|url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/joe90.htm|work=''televisionheaven.co.uk''|year=2000|accessdate=26 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416172837/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/joe90.htm|archivedate=16 April 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcus|first1=Laurence|title=Gerry Anderson: The Puppet Master – Part 3|url=http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson3.htm|work=''teletronic.co.uk''|date=October 2005|accessdate=25 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221150836/http://www.teletronic.co.uk/gerryanderson3.htm|archivedate=21 February 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 182"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Supermarionation Classics'', p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt; and plotlines subscribing more to the [[spy thriller]] genre than science fiction.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 137"&gt;Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', p.&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"&gt;Bentley: ''Captain Scarlet'', p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; Co-creator [[Gerry Anderson]] explained, "The show majored on its characters, which I thought were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware."&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 140"&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;167.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'', handling recording tape on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 177"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities,&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 177"/&gt; explaining, "I read somewhere that the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and [[Mind uploading|transferring]] them to another brain. I was really likening it to [[magnetic recording]], where material could be stored or transferred to another tape."&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 140"/&gt; When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, ''[[Fireball XL5]]'', the surname "Ninety" had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 166"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loover's car was designed to be open-top to meet the requirements of the puppet-size set that the roof include a gap for the head wires.&lt;ref name="LooverCar"/&gt; In practice, however, sequences set inside the vehicle used the "under control" variations of the puppets, which were operated from below the set with the aid of levers.&lt;ref name="LooverCar"/&gt;]]

[[Keith Wilson (production designer)|Keith Wilson]] and Grenville Nott superseded Bob Bell as heads of the [[art department]] and built the interior of Culver Bay Cottage from a design by [[Mike Trim]].&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 182"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;183.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson remembered his satisfaction with the cottage set: "The interior, with its beams and lovely soft furnishings, was really beautiful."&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 140"/&gt; The construction of the BIG RAT model, meanwhile, was entrusted to the newly formed incorporated company Century 21 Props&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 184"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 141"&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;141.&lt;/ref&gt; (or Electronics),&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 171"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; which was responsible for the various gadgets that appeared in the series and was based in [[Bourne End, Buckinghamshire|Bourne End]] in [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref group="l"&gt;Century 21 Props: {{Coord|51.5752|-0.7096|type:landmark_region:GB-NWP|name=Bourne End, Buckinghamshire|format=dms}} (props and electronics)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 171"/&gt;

Although mostly occupied with ''Thunderbird 6'' and ''Doppelgänger'', [[Derek Meddings]] briefly reprised his role as head of [[special effect]]s to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 182"/&gt; The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: "The car looked like no other piece of hardware we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped. Maybe the whole thing was becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 170"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 182"/&gt; Stephen La Rivière, writer of ''Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future'', views the Jet Air Car as an update of ''Supercar'', the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 [[Supercar (TV series)|series of the same name]], but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the "star vehicle" of ''Joe 90'',&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 182"/&gt; it is visually unappealing in comparison to the "beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 182"/&gt;

===Puppets===

The Supermarionation puppets featured in ''Joe 90'' are of the more accurately proportioned kind introduced for ''Captain Scarlet'', and which would also be used for the Andersons' final puppet series, ''[[The Secret Service]]''. Simultaneously, the drive for enhanced realism across all major design aspects which started with the preceding series&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toonhound entry|url=http://www.toonhound.com/joe90.htm|work=''toonhound.com''|accessdate=26 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504191227/http://www.toonhound.com/joe90.htm|archivedate=4 May 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; continued for ''Joe 90''.&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ToonhoundEntry"/&gt; Main character puppets from ''Captain Scarlet'' were re-used for ''Joe 90''&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HowsWhys"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wickes |first1=Simon |title=The Hows and Whys of Supermarionation – Part 4 |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81 |work=''tvcentury21.com'' |date=29 December 2003 |accessdate=26 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00Txsuc?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=81 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exceptions of the [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] and [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] marionettes. Few new puppets were constructed,&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HowsWhys"/&gt; the only notable exceptions being Professor McClaine (sculpted by Mary Turner and modelled on 'bouncing bomb' designer [[Barnes_Wallis|Barnes Wallis]]),&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt; Joe&lt;ref name="Teletronic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt; (sculpted by Tim Cooksey),&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt; and Mrs Harris.

The Joe puppet was the first child marionette to be made as part of the new generation of Supermarionation puppets introduced for ''Captain Scarlet'', for which the sculpting team were careful to achieve realistic proportions for the body of a nine-year-old boy.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 180"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt; The puppets of Sam Loover and Shane Weston had each made several appearances in the previous series,&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 112"/&gt; but for their regular role in the new series a variety of alternative heads were created from the "expressionless" templates – including "smilers", "frowners" and "blinkers"&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt; – and the Shane Weston puppet was re-wigged.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley: ''Captain Scarlet'', p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the recycled "revamp puppets", used to depict supporting characters for ''Captain Scarlet'', were also duplicated with [[Person of color|darker]] skin colours to portray characters from a range of ethnicities. Further to these requirements, the use of two shooting [[soundstage]]s necessitated the duplication of all the "expressionless" main character puppets to avoid conflicts over resources between the two filming units.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt; As in the previous series, "under control" puppets, manipulated by levers from below as opposed to wires from a gantry above, feature in ''Joe 90''.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt;

===Music===
The opening and ending [[Theme music|theme]] and [[incidental music]] of ''Joe 90'' composed by [[Barry Gray]], who was responsible for music on other Anderson series. Episodes of ''Joe 90'' start with either a [[cold open]] (the first Anderson series to do so) or the main [[title sequence]], which sees Joe sitting in the BIG RAT's "Rat Trap" and receiving transferred knowledge from the machine. The sequence is accompanied by Gray's opening theme, which is dominated by the notes of guitarist [[Vic Flick]],&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 170"/&gt; known for performing lead guitar in the recording of the "[[James Bond Theme]]" for ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 170"/&gt; In Anderson's biography, ''What Made Thunderbirds Go!'', the ''Joe 90'' theme is described as a "dizzying piece of [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] pop art that could have been produced only in the late Sixties".&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 170"/&gt; The [[closing credits]] are superimposed over images of objects such as Joe's BIG RAT spectacles, his WIN badge, and also his briefcase, gun, and transceiver;&lt;ref name="Volume5DVD"&gt;{{cite AV media|date=2002|title=''Joe 90'' Collector's Edition DVD Box Set: Disc 5 Special Features|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Carlton Communications|Carlton]]|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the concepts for these images were photographic, the final versions were augmented with airbrush artwork.&lt;ref name="Volume5DVD"/&gt;

==Voice cast==
[[File:Joe90PuppetCast.jpg|275px|thumb|alt=Three men and one boy stand in a palatial setting. A desert landscape is visible from a balcony in the background. One man on the far left is grey-haired and wears a grey suit and tie, the man to the right of him dark-haired and in deep navy blue. Both men are orientated in the direction of the (blond-haired) boy, who is also formally attired in grey. The third man, also blond but wearing a cream-shaded suit, stands directly behind him.|Four of the ''Joe 90'' regular characters: (left to right) Sam Loover, Shane Weston, Professor Ian "Mac" McClaine and (in front of Mac) Joe McClaine.]]

In comparison to ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', ''Joe 90'' features a smaller cast, voicing just five regular characters.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt; Like ''Captain Scarlet'', the series has been viewed as more "English-sounding",&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt; the Andersons abandoning their stipulation dating from the production of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' that the puppet cast be American&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 180"/&gt; and thus dispensing with the established format of their series' principal character being a "square-jawed, fair-skinned male with a [[Mid-Atlantic English|Mid-Atlantic]] accent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christopher|first1=David|title=British Culture: An Introduction|year=1999|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, UK|isbn=0-415-22053-X|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in a manner similar to ''Captain Scarlet'', ''Joe 90'' focuses on the strong American supporting characters of Sam Loover and Shane Weston.&lt;ref&gt;Cull, p.&amp;nbsp;202.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Len Jones]]''' as '''Joe McClaine''', a nine-year-old [[adoptee]] who balances schoolwork with missions as a [[spy]] for the World Intelligence Network (WIN), using the aid of [[Mind uploading|knowledge and experience captured]] by a brilliant invention, the Brain Impulse [[wikt:galvanoscope|Galvanoscope]] Record And Transfer (BIG RAT). For realism,&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 181"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;181.&lt;/ref&gt; Joe is voiced by [[child actor]] Jones rather than an actress as had usually been the case for the representation of younger characters on earlier [[Supermarionation]] series. On the subject of female casting, [[Gerry Anderson]] recalled, "...&amp;nbsp;it always sounded rather odd to me. It never sounded like a real little boy&amp;nbsp;... With ''Joe 90'', I suggested finding a British kid and making him repeat the lines [[parrot fashion]]. That's what we did with Len Jones. His performance was only adequate, but at least it sounded authentic."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 170"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 140"/&gt;
*'''[[Rupert Davies]]''' as '''Professor Ian "Mac" McClaine''', Joe's adoptive father and inventor of the BIG RAT. At the time of production, Davies was well known for acting the leading role in the [[Maigret (1960 TV series)|1960s TV adaptation]] of the [[Maigret]] novels,&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 180"/&gt; and was the most distinguished actor yet to contribute to an Anderson series.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 180"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/&gt; Experiencing [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] as a result of his earlier role as the fictional French detective,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/&gt; [[voice acting]] provided Davies with the opportunity to broaden the horizons of his career.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/&gt; In Gerry Anderson's biography, ''What Made Thunderbirds Go!'', Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn credit Mac's "warm yet distinguished"&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/&gt; English tones as a "perfect counterpoint"&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/&gt; to the American voices of the characters of Sam Loover and Shane Weston.
*'''[[Keith Alexander (actor)|Keith Alexander]]''' as '''Sam Loover''', a long-time friend of Mac and Deputy Head of WIN's London offices, whom Joe affectionately calls "Uncle". Australian actor Alexander had provided voices for the second ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' film, ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'', as a replacement for actor [[Ray Barrett]].&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 181"/&gt; During the 1960s, he provided the voice for another puppet character, [[Topo Gigio]], on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the United States.&lt;ref name="TVHeaven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="60s70sPromotional"&gt;{{cite web|last=Frampton|first=Andrew|title=ITC Promotional Booklet|date=9 April 2009|url=http://www.bigrat.co.uk/merchandise/60s70s/promo_book.html|work=''bigrat.co.uk''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214101328/http://www.bigrat.co.uk/merchandise/60s70s/promo_book.html|archivedate=14 February 2006|accessdate=12 April 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[David Healy (actor)|David Healy]]''' as '''Shane Weston''', the [[commander-in-chief]] of WIN's London Headquarters and Deputy Head of the international organisation, who has a penchant for feeble jokes. Healy, an American actor resident in the United Kingdom, had voiced supporting characters in ''Captain Scarlet'', and was often contracted to play transatlantic characters in British television.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 169"/&gt;
*'''[[Sylvia Anderson]]''' as '''Mrs. Ada Harris''', the McClaines' long-suffering housekeeper, who is unaware that Mac and Joe are members of an intelligence organisation. Anderson, whose voice had first featured in the 1961 series ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', was best known for voicing the character of [[Lady Penelope]] in ''Thunderbirds'' and its two feature films. (The reason for the choice of the name "Ada Harris" is unclear; whether it was a coincidence or by deliberate choice, the name is also that of the protagonist of author [[Paul Gallico]]'s ''Mrs. 'Arris'' novels.)

[[Supporting character]]s were voiced by Alexander, Healy and Anderson as well as earlier Anderson contributors '''[[Gary Files]]''', '''[[Martin King (actor)|Martin King]]''', '''[[Jeremy Wilkin]]''', '''[[Shane Rimmer]]''' and (for one episode, "Viva Cordova") '''[[Elizabeth Morgan (actress)|Liz Morgan]]'''. Rimmer and Morgan, however, are not credited in the closing titles.&lt;ref name="Bentley: Episode Guide, 139"&gt;Bentley: ''Episode Guide'', p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; Files recalls that he felt honoured to be asked to rejoin the Andersons for another production following ''Captain Scarlet'',&lt;ref name="GFInterview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Files Interview |url=http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm |work=''thevervoid.com'' |accessdate=28 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072515/http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm |archivedate=26 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was "tickled pink"&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 180"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GFInterview"/&gt; to be performing with Davies, adding, "I hated the way that so many so-called producers wouldn't meet his eye. He was Maigret forever, you see, in their eyes."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 180"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GFInterview"/&gt; Morgan, meanwhile, explains how she was contracted for her single voice role in ''Joe 90'': "They needed a voice, they called around and everyone else was out shopping. So they called me in."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt;

==Broadcast==

==Reception==
{{Quote box|quote=I liked the idea of it all being a sort of family thing and I also liked the puppets themselves more than the ones in ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons|Captain Scarlet]]''. They had more character and were a bit of a move back to the earlier characters.

In an episode guide to the Anderson TV series, science-fiction writer [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] questions Mac's ethics in "experimenting on" Joe to further the development of the BIG RAT.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel, 247"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;247.&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of Joe as a secret agent he remarks, jokingly, "Presumably there are no [[child labour]] laws in the future!"&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;224.&lt;/ref&gt; La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines at the end of the pilot, in a scene that he considers "amusing"; the professor's admonition "Don't come crying to me if you get hurt!" represents his preparedness to "abnegate all parental responsibility" towards his adoptive son.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 179"/&gt; Observing the series' subscription to "wider themes in Cold War culture", Cull likens the BIG RAT's powers to [[brainwashing]], but concludes that it is a fundamentally "benign" technology.&lt;ref name="Cull, 199"/&gt; The more violent style introduced in ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' is sometimes evident in ''Joe 90'': in "Hi-jacked", Joe kills an enemy with a grenade,&lt;ref group="e" name="Hi-jacked"/&gt; while in "Project 90", Professor McClaine is menaced by a drill poised to pulverise his head.&lt;ref group="e" name="Project 90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt; On the subject of violence, episode director [[Desmond Saunders]] comments: "There was an unpleasant side to it which I never really understood.

On the other hand, producer [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] praises the series for its increased humour following the dark tone of ''Captain Scarlet''&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 114"/&gt; and sees ''Joe 90'' as much more [[Family-friendliness|family-oriented]] in comparison to its forerunner,&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 114"/&gt; summing up the series as "a great little programme."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 168"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: Captain Scarlet, 114"/&gt; Anthony Clark of the [[British Film Institute]] commends ''Joe 90'' for more effective [[characterisation]] than ''Captain Scarlet'',&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Anthony|title=BFI screenonline entry|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442501/index.html|work=''[[British Film Institute|BFI]] [[screenonline]]''|accessdate=27 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516123603/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442501/index.html|archivedate=16 May 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also compliments the quality of its scripts&lt;ref name="BFI"/&gt; and [[Barry Gray]]'s musical score.&lt;ref name="BFI"/&gt; La Rivière underlines a connection between the child protagonist and the theme of espionage, writing, "The premise that drives ''Joe 90'' taps into the fantasy indulged by most boys that they, even at nine years old, can be [[James Bond]]."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 177"/&gt; Writer John R.

La Rivière noted the intimacy of the series and the predominantly male voice cast and characters, suggesting that ''Joe 90'' is "very much a [[Boy's Own Paper|''Boy's Own'']] adventure."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 181"/&gt; Out of the 30 episodes, only ten feature appearances from female characters,&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 181"/&gt; a fact which La Rivière attributes to the increased demands on Century 21 for its feature film productions, ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'' and ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]''.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 181"/&gt; Peel suggests that the female absence leaves ''Joe 90'', with many other Anderson productions, inferior to previous [[Supermarionation]] effort ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'',&lt;ref name="Peel, 243"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the character of [[Lady Penelope]] has a primary role in several episodes. Grouping ''Joe 90'' with the earlier ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Secret Service]]'',&lt;ref name="Peel, 243"/&gt; Peel concludes, "It is hardly coincidental that these tend to be the least-loved of [Anderson's] series; he had, after all, ignored half of his potential audience."&lt;ref name="Peel, 243"/&gt; For Peel, this return of the "standard Anderson [[sexism]]"&lt;ref name="Peel, 243"/&gt; is only one aspect of deterioration between ''Joe 90'' and previous productions. Peel challenges La Rivière's asserted "kids play Bond" theme,&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 185"/&gt; writing that, "being a somewhat [[nerd]]y kid with glasses and [[brain implant]]s was not really thrilling."&lt;ref name="Peel, 247"/&gt;

Peel's view was contested by Anderson's and Cull's belief that the series, with its bespectacled main character of Joe McClaine, can increase the self-confidence of young viewers who wear glasses:&lt;ref name="h2g2"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV Puppets|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A206470|work=[[BBC Online]]|date=19 November 1999|accessdate=26 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114011939/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A206470|archivedate=14 November 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull, 205"/&gt; "Suddenly they were proud because they had something in common with Joe 90."&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 140"/&gt; Since the series' first appearance, the epithet "Joe 90" has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults with glasses reminiscent of Joe's&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 141"/&gt; (such as snooker player [[Dennis Taylor]]).&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 141"/&gt; During UK repeats in the 1990s, similarities were drawn between Joe and then-Prime Minister [[John Major]], also known for wearing large spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Evans, writer of ''The Penguin TV Companion'', criticises the plot element of the glasses, writing, "Joe simply dons a pair of scientific glasses, making him look like the class swot than a secret agent."&lt;ref name="PenTVCom"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Jeff|title=The Penguin TV Companion|year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=978-0-14-101221-6|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook reads further into the concept of child empowerment in ''Joe 90'', writing that the series creates a "[[technological utopia]]"&lt;ref&gt;Cook, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; around youth, remarking, "Through the character of Joe, his brain hardwired at the start of each episode into the BIG RAT [[supercomputer]], the young are shown to be literally at one with technology."&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt; He adds that the instant access to brain patterns that the BIG RAT affords to Joe may be interpreted as heralding the development of the Internet over a decade after ''Joe 90'' was produced.&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt; With his intellectual horizons broadened, Joe becomes the manifestation of ''[[homo superior]]'',&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt; yet his youthfulness grants him the power to change the fraught political world in ways that no adult could due to the limitations of their imagination.&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt; In this respect, Cook holds up ''Joe 90'' as a precursor to the 1970s television series ''[[The Tomorrow People]]'',&lt;ref name="Cook, 98"/&gt; which also concerned ideas of human transcendence in children. This idea, Cook says, was evident in the title of ''Joe 90'' itself:&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt; "no longer is he a nine-year-old boy but instead his status and capacities have been multiplied tenfold to transform him into agent 'Joe 90', his name an appealing futuristic echo of the then distant year of 1990."&lt;ref name="Cook, 97"/&gt;

'''Magnetocapacitance''' is a property of some [[dielectric]] or insulating materials and/or metal-insulator-metal heterostructures that exhibit a change in the value of their [[capacitance]] when an external [[magnetic field]] is applied to them. Magnetocapacitance can be an intrinsic property of some dielectric materials, such as [[multiferroic]] compounds like BiMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kimura |first=T. |authorlink= |date=May 2003 |title=Magnetocapacitance effect in multiferroic BiMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=[[Physical Review B]]|volume=67|issue=18|page=180401|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.67.180401|bibcode = 2003PhRvB..67r0401K |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or can be a manifest of properties extrinsic to the dielectric but present in capacitance structures like Pd/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=K.T. |date=March 2003 |title=Magnetocapacitance: Probe of Spin-Dependent Potentials |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=90|issue=11|page=117201 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.117201 |pmid=12688961 |bibcode=2003PhRvL..90k7201M|arxiv = cond-mat/0206427 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12267">'''Magnetoresistance''' is the tendency of a material (preferably ferromagnetic) to change the value of its [electrical resistance] in an externally-applied [[magnetic field]]. There are a variety of effects that can be called magnetoresistance: some occur in bulk non-magnetic metals and semiconductors, such as geometrical magnetoresistance, [[Shubnikov–de Haas effect|Shubnikov de Haas oscillations]], or the common positive magnetoresistance in metals.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Pippard: Magnetoresistance in Metals, Cambridge University Press (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Other effects occur in magnetic metals, such as negative magnetoresistance in ferromagnets&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{Citation |first1=R.V. |last1=Coleman |first2=A. |last2=Isin |title=Magnetoresistance in Iron Single Crystals|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=37 |date=1966 |pages=1028 |doi=10.1063/1.1708320|bibcode = 1966JAP....37.1028C }}&lt;/ref&gt; or anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Finally, in multicomponent or multilayer systems (e.g. magnetic tunnel junctions), [[giant magnetoresistance]] (GMR), [[tunnel magnetoresistance]] (TMR), [[colossal magnetoresistance]] (CMR), and [[extraordinary magnetoresistance]] (EMR) can be observed.

The first magnetoresistive effect was discovered by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], better known as Lord Kelvin, in 1856, but he was unable to lower the electrical resistance of anything by more than 5%. Nowadays, systems, e.g. [[semimetal]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unstoppable Magnetoresistance|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-10-unstoppable-magnetoresistance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; or concentric ring [[Extraordinary magnetoresistance|EMR]] structures, are known where a magnetic field can change resistance by orders of magnitude. As the resistance may depend on magnetic field through various mechanisms, it is useful to separately consider situations where it depends on magnetic field directly, e.g. geometric magnetoresistance and multiband magnetoresistance, and those where it does so indirectly through magnetisation, e.g. AMR, [[Tunnel magnetoresistance|TMR]].

==Discovery==
[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] first discovered ordinary magnetoresistance in 1856.&lt;ref name=Kelvin&gt;{{Citation |first=W. |last=Thomson |title=On the Electro-Dynamic Qualities of Metals:—Effects of Magnetization on the Electric Conductivity of Nickel and of Iron |journal=Proc.

He then did the same experiment with nickel and found that it was affected in the same way but the magnitude of the effect was greater. This effect is referred to as anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR).

[[Image:Corbino disc.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Corbino disc. With the magnetic field turned off, a radial current flows in the conducting annulus due to the battery connected between the (infinite) conductivity rims. When a magnetic field along the axis is turned on,(B points directly out of the page) the [[Lorentz force]] drives a circular component of current, and the resistance between the inner and outer rims goes up. This increase in resistance due to the magnetic field is called ''magnetoresistance''.]]

In 2007, [[Albert Fert]] and [[Peter Grünberg]] were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of [[Giant Magnetoresistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2007 |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date=9 Oct 2007 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/ |accessdate=25 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometrical magnetoresistance==
An example of magnetoresistance due to direct action of magnetic field on electric current can be studied on a Corbino disc (see Figure).
It consists of a conducting annulus with perfectly conducting rims. Without a magnetic field, the battery drives a radial current between the rims. When a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the annulus is applied, (either into our out of the page) a circular component of current flows as well, due to the [[Lorentz force]]. A discussion of the disc is provided by Giuliani.&lt;ref name=Giuliani&gt;{{cite journal |author=G Giuliani, |title=A general law for electromagnetic induction |year=2008 |journal=EPS |volume=81 |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0295-5075/81/6/60002/epl_81_6_60002.html |doi=10.1209/0295-5075/81/60002 |pages=60002|bibcode = 2008EL.....8160002G |issue=6 |arxiv = 1502.00502 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial interest in this problem began with Boltzmann in 1886, and independently was re-examined by Corbino in 1911.&lt;ref name=Giuliani/&gt;

In a simple model, supposing the response to the Lorentz force is the same as for an electric field, the carrier velocity '''v''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mu \left( \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v \times B} \right), \ &lt;/math&gt;

where μ is the carrier mobility.  Solving for the velocity, we find:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \frac{ \mu}{1+(\mu B)^2} \left( \mathbf{E} + \mu \mathbf{E \times B} + \mu^2 (\mathbf{B \cdot E}) \mathbf{B}  \right) = 
   \frac{ \mu}{1+(\mu B)^2} \left( \mathbf{E}_{\perp} + \mu \mathbf{E \times B}\right) + \mu\mathbf{E}_{\parallel} , \ &lt;/math&gt;

where the effective reduction in mobility due to the '''B'''-field (for motion perpendicular to this field) is apparent. Electric current (proportional to the radial component of velocity) will decrease with increasing magnetic field and hence the resistance of the device will increase. Critically, this magnetoresistive scenario depends sensitively on the device geometry and current lines and it does not rely on magnetic materials.

In a [[semiconductor]] with a single carrier type, the magnetoresistance is proportional to (1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''μB'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where μ is the [[electron mobility|semiconductor mobility]] (units m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·V&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; or T&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''B'' is the magnetic field (units [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s). [[Indium antimonide]], an example of a high mobility semiconductor, could have an electron mobility above 4&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·V&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&amp;nbsp;K. So in a 0.25&amp;nbsp;T field, for example the magnetoresistance increase would be 100%.

==Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR)==
[[File:AMR of Permalloy.png|thumbnail|250px|The resistance of a thin [[Permalloy]] film is shown here as a function of the angle of an applied external field.]]Thomson's experiments&lt;ref name="Kelvin"/&gt; are an example of AMR,&lt;ref name=McGuirePotter&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McGuire | first1 = T. | last2 = Potter | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1109/TMAG.1975.1058782 | title = Anisotropic magnetoresistance in ferromagnetic 3d alloys| url = http://www.unife.it/scienze/lm.fisica/insegnamenti/proprieta-magnetiche-materia/materiale/magnetoresistenza_anisotropa.pdf| journal = IEEE Transactions on Magnetics | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 1018–1038| year = 1975 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1975ITM....11.1018M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  property of a material in which a dependence of electrical resistance on the angle between the direction of electric current and direction of '''magnetization''' is observed. The effect arises from the simultaneous action of magnetization and [[Spin–orbit interaction|spin-orbit interaction]] and its detailed mechanism depends on the material. It can be for example due to a larger probability of s-d scattering of electrons in the direction of magnetization (which is controlled by the applied magnetic field). The net effect (in most materials) is that the electrical resistance has maximum value when the direction of current is parallel to the applied magnetic field. AMR of new materials is being investigated and magnitudes up to 50% have been observed in some ferromagnetic uranium compounds.&lt;ref name="Wiśniewski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiśniewski | first1 = P. | year = | title = Giant anisotropic magnetoresistance and magnetothermopower in cubic 3:4 uranium pnictides | url = | journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 90| issue = | pages = 192106| doi = 10.1063/1.2737904 |bibcode = 2007ApPhL..90s2106W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In polycrystalline ferromagnetic materials, the AMR can only depend on the angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\psi-\theta&lt;/math&gt; between the magnetization and current direction
and (as long as the resistivity of the material can be described by a rank-two tensor), it must follow&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=E. |last1=De Ranieri |first2=A. W. |last2=Rushforth |first3=K. |last3=Výborný |first4=U. |last4=Rana |first5=E. |last5=Ahmed |first6=R. P. |last6=Campion |first7=C. T. |last7=Foxon |first8=B. L. |last8=Gallagher |first9=A.

&lt;math&gt;\rho(\varphi) = \rho_\perp + (\rho_\parallel - \rho_\perp) \cos^2 \varphi &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the (longitudinal) [[resistivity]] of the film and  &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\parallel,\perp}&lt;/math&gt; are the resistivities for &lt;math&gt;\varphi=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Associated with longitudinal resistivity, there is also transversal resistivity dubbed (somewhat confusingly[[#Footnotes|[1]]]) the planar Hall effect. In monocrystals, resistivity &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; depends also on &lt;math&gt;\psi, \theta&lt;/math&gt; individually.

To compensate for the non-linear characteristics and inability to detect the polarity of a magnetic field, the following structure is used for sensors. It consists of stripes of aluminum or gold placed on a thin film of [[permalloy]] (a ferromagnetic material exhibiting the AMR effect) inclined at an angle of 45°. This structure forces the current not to flow along the “easy axes” of thin film, but at an angle of 45°. The dependence of resistance now has a permanent offset which is linear around the null point. Because of its appearance, this sensor type is called '[[barber pole]]'.

The AMR effect is used in a wide array of sensors for measurement of Earth's magnetic field (electronic [[compass]]), for electric current measuring (by measuring the magnetic field created around the conductor), for traffic detection and for linear position and angle sensing. The biggest AMR sensor manufacturers are [[Honeywell]], [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[STMicroelectronics]], and [http://www.sensitec.com Sensitec GmbH].

{{Essay|date=March 2012}}

== History ==

Some of the earliest computers were military computers.
Military requirements for portability and ruggedness led to some of the earliest transistorized computers, such as the 1959 AN/MYK-1 ([[MOBIDIC]]),
the 1960 [[M18 FADAC]],
and the 1962 [[D-17B]];
the earliest integrated-circuit based computer,
the 1964 [[D-37C]];
as well as one of the earliest laptop computers, the 1982 [[Grid Compass]].
Military requirements for a computer small enough to fit through a submarine's hatch led to the [[AN/UYK-1]].

== Construction ==
[[Image:Chassis-plans-rugged-computer.jpg|thumb|Rugged 901D Computer for Navy Shipboard Installation]]Typically a military computer is much more robust than an industrial computer enclosure. Most electronics will be protected with a layer of [[conformal coating]]. There will be more structure inside to support the components, the plug-in cards will be individually supported and secured to assure they do not pop out of their sockets, the processor and [[heat sink]] will be secured, memory will be glued into their sockets, and so forth. This is to assure nothing moves during the shock events.

There are several differentiators between military computers and typical office or consumer computers:

* Cost
* Intended environment
* Long term availability
* Architecture
* Feature set

'''Cost''' – Military computers are generally much more expensive than office/consumer computers.  Consumer computers from manufacturers such as [[Dell]] are manufactured in very high quantities which leads to lower costs due to economy of scale.  Military programs, on the other hand, can require small numbers of systems leading to higher costs.  Military computers will typically also be constructed of more robust materials with more internal structure, more cooling fans, a more robust power supply, and so forth.

'''Intended Environment''' – An office or consumer computer is intended for use in a very controlled shirt-sleeve environment with moderate temperatures and humidity and minimal dust.  A military computer can be designed to operate in very adverse environments with extremes of temperature such as -20C to +65C operating, 5% to 95% humidity levels, and high dust loading in the air as well as other insults to the hardware. They may be required to operate in high salt environments such as on a ship or designed for high shock and vibration such as on a ship or submarine.  Military computers may be intended for installation on aircraft in which case they need to be crash worthy and able to operate at high altitudes if in unpressurized aircraft.  The same computer may be required to operate in Afghanistan as well as in Alaska with no change in the design.

'''Long Term Availability''' – Military programs last years and identical replacement hardware may be required over the life of the program.  Consumer computers are often driven by the latest and greatest to realize the highest possible performance, such as required to play games.  The motherboard in a consumer grade computer may have an availability measured in months instead of years or decades. In a consumer level computer, over the lifetime of the product availability, it is not unheard of for all the components such as the motherboard, drives, BIOS, video board, etc., to be different from computer to computer.  That is not acceptable in a military computer for which supporting documents have been created and systems tested and approved.    

'''Architecture''' – There are many types of computer architecture.  The most common that people know of is the PC as created by IBM.  Many military computer systems are built around alternative plug-in bus structures such as [[VMEbus]] or [[Compact PCI]].  A military computer may not provide for plug-in cards and be in a dedicated form factor for a specific application such as installation on a [[UAV]] such as the [[Global Hawk]]. 

'''Feature Set''' – A military computer may have features not found on a consumer grade computer such as [[Circular connectors]], hot swap power supplies, hot swap fans, custom front panel features such as LCD displays, and so forth.

== MIL standards and specifications ==
[[Image:barge test preparation.jpg|thumb|Barge Explosion Test Preparation]]

[[Image:barge explosion test.jpg|thumb|Actual Barge Explosion Test]]

The [[Armed Forces]] have many numerical designations for computers or other equipment, to guide the military buyer's choice of appropriate technology for their application. For instance, [[MIL-S-901D]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chassis-plans.com/PDF/MIL-S-901D.pdf MIL-S-901D]&lt;/ref&gt; would indicate that the computer passed shock and vibration requirements of specific tests for Navy installation. Some of these tests are specific to application usage, such as barge explosion testing, which simulates a torpedo hit and subsequent high peak shock to a ship on which the computer is installed.  The "gold standard" of testing for compliance with 901D is the Barge Test. A Barge Test is performed four times, each time placing 60&amp;nbsp;lbs HBX-1 explosive 24 feet under water, starting at 40 feet away, then at 30, 25 and finally 20 feet. In addition, the tests are performed in a fore-and-aft orientation to simulate an explosion at the bow or stern of the ship and athwartship to simulate an explosion by the side of the ship. A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swAWpmboN64 video of a barge test] can be viewed.

Other more common requirements are [[MIL-STD-810]] for environmental testing such as storage and operating temperature, humidity, salt spray, dirt, etc.  Another common specification is [[MIL-STD-461]] for electromagnetic compatibility.  There are specifications for workmanship, wiring, packaging, and so forth, that military computers are required to meet.  

More on MIL Standards and Specifications at [[Defense Standard]].

== Security Standards &amp; Specifications ==
To meet the challenges of defending the U.S. cyber network, the U.S. military has taken steps to improve the security of devices connected to Department of Defense information networks. According to [[United States Cyber Command]], "Cyber threats demand new approaches to managing information, securing information, and ensuring our ability to operate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcyber.army.mil/org-uscc.html "United States Cyber Command"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928103608/http://www.arcyber.army.mil/org-uscc.html |date=2013-09-28 }}. arcyber.army.mil. Retrieved on 25 September, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

All military computers must conform to the latest [[FIPS 140]] standards ([[FIPS 140-2]]) which specify the latest requirements for cryptography modules on devices used throughout the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf "FIPS PUB 140-2: Security Requirements For Cryptographic Modules"]. 25 May, 2001. Retrieved on 25 September, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[FIPS 140-3]], currently under development, will address new requirements to face existing threats, including software security and an additional level of security.

To address the risks associated with the increasing prevalence of commercial mobile devices (CMDs), a DoD Inspector General report from March 2013 identifies improvements necessary to track and configure commercial mobile devices to meet Army compliance standards. The report identifies existing gaps in tracking and sanitization for over 14,000 CMDs, recommending a "clear and comprehensive policy to include requirements for reporting and tracking all commercial mobile devices purchased under pilot and non-pilot programs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodig.mil/pubs/documents/DODIG-2013-060.pdf "Improvements Needed With Tracking and Configuring Army Commercial Mobile Devices"]. 26 March, 2013. Retrieved on 25 September, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Field risks ==
The progress of small-scale computer technology in military applications was initially slow due to concerns about security and the ability to survive rugged environments and enemy weaponry. PC-based technology in the 20th century was not robust enough to withstand combat conditions and severe environments.

Hazards in the field include water and corrosives, sand and wind, extreme temperatures, high shock and vibration, power interruptions, susceptibility to EMI/RFI radiation, etc. Also, operator interface was complex, and most [[operating system]]s were not fast in operation, or easy to learn and use in pressure situations.

In the last decade, improvements in design and operator interface have resulted in new mandates for the use of small [[computer technology]] in the military. Some of the improvements have migrated over from home and business computing. Others have migrated over from industrial computing, where designs for environments such as [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|Zone 1 hazardous areas]] in oil &amp; gas exploration have been modified for army and navy environments.

*Sealed enclosures using materials such as cast aluminum with magnesium have improved environmental resistance to contaminants and hazards, including EMI-burst weaponry.
*Low-heat [[Central processing unit|CPU]] designs have made sealed enclosures possible even for environments like the desert or naval bridge wing display under the open sun.
*Advances like [[flash memory]] have eliminated moving parts and reduced mechanical failures.

In the last 20 years, wide acceptance of small-scale computer technology in the military has occurred, and is likely to increase greatly. Confidence has improved in the ability of equipment to withstand combat and extreme environment conditions. Most importantly, modern combat has become a duel of speed. Faster and more technologically advanced weaponry demonstrates first-strike capability in current combat situations, which is likely only to encourage further implementation of computer technology into systems used in the US Armed Forces in the future.

Various branches of the military have mandated that future systems will be based on Zero Client or [[Thin Client]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.army.mil/article/103851/ "Army publishes IT reference architecture for Thin/Zero Client Computing" www.army.mil June 12, 2013"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/navy-moving-thin-client-computing-says-halvorsen/2011-03-03 "Navy moving to thin client computing, says Halvorsen FierceGovernmentIT March 3, 2011"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mycorestoration''' is the use of [[fungi]] to restore degraded environments. It is a multi-method approach to restore damaged habitats such as [[oil spill]] sites and [[logging roads]], while also restoring the health of targeted forest sites that have been compromised in development. Mycorestoration is also used to control insect populations. It generally uses a four-tier approach of [[mycofiltration]], [[mycoforestry]], [[mycoremediation]], and [[mycopesticides]]. The mycelia of a number of different gilled fungi are used in some of these applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wildlandscpr.org/biblio-notes/evaluating-use-mycorestoration-decommissioned-roads-arizona | title=Evaluating the Use of Mycorestoration on Decommissioned Roads in Arizona | publisher=Wildlands CPR | date=December 11, 2005 | accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Neutrodyne''' [[radio receiver]], invented in 1922 by [[Louis Alan Hazeltine|Louis Hazeltine]], was a particular type of [[Tuned radio frequency receiver|tuned radio frequency]] (TRF) receiver, in which the instability-causing inter-electrode [[capacitance]] of the [[triode]] RF tubes is cancelled out or "neutralized".&lt;ref name="HazeltinePatent"&gt;US Patent No. 1450080, Louis Alan Hazeltine, [https://www.google.com/patents/US1450080?dq=1450080&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bvoZU9KLCInvoAT-rYL4Bw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA    "Method and electric circuit arrangement for neutralizing capacity coupling"]; filed August 7, 1919; granted March 27, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazeltine"&gt;{{cite journal

In most designs, a small extra winding on each of the RF [[amplifier]]s' tuned anode coils was used to generate a small antiphase signal, which could be adjusted by special variable trim [[capacitor]]s to cancel out the stray signal coupled to the grid via plate-to-grid capacitance.  The Neutrodyne circuit was popular in radio receivers until the 1930s, when it was superseded by the [[superheterodyne]] receiver.

==History==
The circuit was developed about 1922 by Harold Wheeler who worked in [[Louis Alan Hazeltine|Louis Hazeltine]]'s laboratory at Stevens Institute of Technology, so Hazeltine is usually given the credit.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book

A major defect of the TRF receiver was that, due to the high interelectrode [[capacitance]] of early [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]]s, [[feedback]] within the RF amplifier stages gave them a tendency to [[oscillate]], creating unwanted radio frequency alternating currents.  These [[parasitic oscillation]]s mixed with the [[carrier wave]] in the detector, creating [[heterodyne]]s (beat notes) in the audio frequency range, which were heard as annoying whistles and howls from the speaker. 

Hazeltine's innovation was to add a circuit to each radio frequency amplifier stage which fed back a small amount of energy from the plate (output) circuit to the grid (input) circuit with opposite [[phase (waves)|phase]] to cancel ("neutralize") the [[feedback]] which was causing the oscillation.  This effectively prevented the high-pitched squeals that had plagued early radio sets.   A group of more than 20 companies known as the Independent Radio Manufacturers Association licensed the circuit from Hazeltine and manufactured "Neutrodyne" receivers throughout the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;  At the time, [[RCA]] held a virtual monopoly over commercial radio receiver production due to its ownership of the rights to the Armstrong [[regenerative receiver|regenerative]] and [[superheterodyne]] circuits.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; The Neutrodyne ended this control, allowing competition. Compared to the technically superior [[superheterodyne]] the Neutrodyne was cheaper to build. As basically a TRF receiver, it was also considered easier for non-technical owners to use than the early superhets. After manufacture each [[tuned amplifier]] stage had to be ''neutralized'', adjusted to cancel feedback; after this the set would not produce the [[parasitic oscillation]]s which caused the objectionable noises. By 1927 some ten million of these receivers had been sold to consumers in [[North America]].

By the 1930s, advances in vacuum tube manufacturing had yielded the [[tetrode]], which had reduced control grid to plate (Miller) capacitance. These advances made it possible to build TRF receivers that did not need neutralization,  but also made [[Edwin Armstrong]]'s [[superheterodyne]] design practical for domestic receivers.   So the TRF circuit, including the Neutrodyne, became obsolete in radio receivers and was superseded by the superheterodyne design.

The Neutrodyne neutralization technique continues to be used in other applications to suppress [[parasitic oscillation]], such as in RF power amplifiers in [[radio transmitter]]s.

Operational [[database]] management systems (also referred to as [[OLTP]] On Line Transaction Processing databases), are used to update data in real-time. These types of databases allow users to do more than simply view archived data. Operational databases allow you to modify that data (add, change or delete data), doing it in [[Real-time computing|real-time]].&lt;ref name="Techopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5711/operational-database-odb |title=Operational Database (ODB)|publisher=Techopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLTP databases provide [[Database transaction|transactions]] as main abstraction to guarantee data consistency that guarantee the so-called [[ACID properties]]. Basically, the consistency of the data is guaranteed in the case of failures and/or concurrent access to the data.

Since the early 90's, the operational database software market has been largely taken over by [[SQL]] engines. Today, the operational [[DBMS]] market (formerly [[OLTP]]) is evolving dramatically, with new, innovative entrants and incumbents supporting the growing use of unstructured data and [[NoSQL]] DBMS engines, as well as [[XML database]]s and [[NewSQL|NewSQL databases]]. NoSQL databases typically have focused on scalability and have renounced to data consistency by not providing transactions as OLTP system do. Operational databases are increasingly supporting [[distributed database]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Distributed Databases|last=Ozsu|first=M. Tamer|last2=Valduriez|first2=Patrick|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4419-8833-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; architecture that can leverage distribution to provide [[high availability]] and [[fault tolerance]] through [[replication (computing)|replication]] and [[scale out]] ability.

The growing role of operational databases in the [[information technology|IT]] industry is moving fast from legacy databases to real-time operational databases capable to handle distributed web and mobile demand and to address [[Big data]] challenges. Recognizing this, [[Gartner]] started to publish the [[Magic Quadrant]] for Operational Database Management Systems in October 2013.&lt;ref name="Gartner Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2610218/magic-quadrant-operational-database-management |title=Gartner Magic Quadrant for Operational Database Management Systems|publisher=Gartner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in business ==

Operational databases are used to store, manage and track real-time business information. For example, a company might have an operational database used to track warehouse/stock quantities. As customers order products from an online web store, an operational database can be used to keep track of how many items have been sold and when the company will need to reorder stock.  An '''operational database''' stores information about the activities of an [[organization]], for example [[customer relationship management]] transactions or financial operations, in a computer [[database]].

Operational databases allow a business to enter, gather, and retrieve large quantities of specific information, such as company legal data, financial data, call data records, personal employee information, sales data, customer data, data on assets and many other information.  An important feature of storing information in an operational database is the ability to share information across the company and over the Internet.  Operational databases can be used to manage mission-critical business data, to monitor activities, to audit suspicious transactions, or to review the history of dealings with a particular customer.  They can also be part of the actual process of making and fulfilling a purchase, for example in [[e-commerce]].

==Data warehouse terminology==

In [[Data warehouse|data warehousing]], the term is even more specific: the operational database is the one which is accessed by an [[operational system]] (for example a customer-facing website or the application used by the customer service department) to carry out regular operations of an organization. Operational databases usually use an [[online transaction processing]] database which is optimized for faster transaction processing ([[create, read, update and delete]] operations). An operational database is the source for a data warehouse.&lt;ref name="Techopedia" /&gt;

'''RONJA''' ('''Reasonable Optical Near Joint Access''') is a [[free-space optical communication]] system originating in the [[Czech Republic]], developed by Karel Kulhavý of Twibright Labs and released in 2001. It transmits data [[wireless]]ly using beams of [[light]]. Ronja can be used to create a 10 Mbit/s [[full duplex]] [[Ethernet]] point-to-point link. It has been estimated that 1000 to 2000 links have been built worldwide &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0162243910368398| title = Free Space Optics in the Czech Wireless Community: Shedding Some Light on the Role of Normativity for User-Initiated Innovations| journal = Science, Technology &amp; Human Values| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 423| year = 2010| last1 = Soderberg | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of the basic configuration is {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The device consists of a receiver and [[transmitter]] pipe (optical head) mounted on a sturdy adjustable holder. Two [[coaxial cable]]s are used to connect the rooftop installation with a protocol translator installed in the house near a [[computer]] or [[network switch|switch]]. The range can be extended to {{convert|1.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} by doubling or tripling the transmitter pipe.

== Technology ==
[[File:RONJA System Overview.jpg|thumb|Block diagram of a full duplex RONJA system.]]

A complete RONJA system is made up of 2 [[transceivers]]: 2 optical [[transmitters]] and 2 optical [[Optical receiver|receivers]]. They are assembled individually or as a combination. The complete system layout is shown in the [[block diagram]].
 
=== Optical receiver – Preamplifier stage ===
[[File:RONJA-installations-world.png|thumb|Map showing the distribution of the 153 registered installations of RONJA as of 1 October 2007.  Based on data found at the [http://ronja.twibright.com/installations.php official RONJA website]]]

The usual approach in FSO (Free Space Optics) [[preamplifier]]s is to employ a [[transimpedance amplifier]]. A transimpedance amplifier is a very sensitive [[broadband]] high-speed device featuring a [[feedback loop]]. This fact means the layout is plagued with stability problems and special compensation of [[PIN diode]] [[capacitance]] must be performed, therefore this doesn't allow selection of a wide range of cheap PIN photodiodes with varying capacitances.

Ronja however uses a feedbackless design&lt;ref name="Building Ronja 10M Receiver"/&gt; where the PIN has a high working [[electrical resistance]] (100 [[Ohm|kilohm]]s)&lt;ref name="Building Ronja 10M Receiver"/&gt; which together with the total input capacitance (roughly 8 pF, 5 pF PIN and 3 pF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/BF908-R_N.pdf|title=NXP Semiconductors: BF 908 Datasheet, page 2, table row "input capacitance at gate 1"|author=|date=|website=nxp.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; input [[MOSFET]] [[cascode]]) makes the device operate with a [[passband]] on a 6&amp;nbsp;dB/oct slope of low pass formed by PIN working resistance and total input capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electric2.ee.psu.ac.th/~ton/FSO_Ronja_TENCON2006_Final2.pdf Phanumas Khumsat, Noppadol Wattanapisit, Karel Kulhavey, "Low-Cost Laser-Based Wireless Optical Transceiver for 10-Mbps Ethernet Link", Proceedings of IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON), Hong Kong, China (2006) (full text), pag 2 upper left, mention about "unwanted lossy integrator".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How does Ronja work"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronja.twibright.com/technotes/how_rx.php|title=How does Ronja work?|author=|date=|website=ronja.twibright.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by [[signal noise]], and then a compensation of the 6&amp;nbsp;dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/NE592.pdf|title=Philips Semiconductors RF Communications Products: NE592 Product specification, page 1 lines 6–7 of the 1st paragraph and page 8, heading "FILTER NETWORKS".|author=|date=|website=nxp.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an NE592 video amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electric2.ee.psu.ac.th/~ton/FSO_Ronja_TENCON2006_Final2.pdf Phanumas Khumsat, Noppadol Wattanapisit, Karel Kulhavey, "Low-Cost Laser-Based Wireless Optical Transceiver for 10-Mbps Ethernet Link", Proceedings of IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON), Hong Kong, China (2006) (full text)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How does Ronja work"/&gt; A surprisingly flat characteristic is obtained. If the PIN diode is equipped with 3 kΩ working resistor to operate in flat band mode, the range is reduced to about 30% due to [[thermal noise]] from the 3 kΩ resistor.

=== Optical transmitter – Nebulus infrared LED driver ===

The HSDL4220 [[infrared]] [[light-emitting diode|LED]] is originally unsuitable for 10 Mbit/s operation. It has a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of 9&amp;nbsp;MHz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/239/LiteOn_HSDL_4220_4230-195195.pdf|title=HSDL-4220 Datasheet|author=|date=|website=mouser.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 10 Mbit/s [[Manchester encoding|Manchester]]-modulated systems need bandwidth of around 16&amp;nbsp;MHz. Operation in a usual circuit with current drive would lead to substantial signal corruption and range reduction. Therefore, Twibright Labs developed a special driving technique consisting of driving the LED directly with 15-fold 74AC04 gate output in parallel with RF voltage applied current-unlimited directly to the LED through large capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronja.twibright.com/schematics/nebulus_00.pdf|title=Ronja Nebulus (infrared transmitter) schematic|author=|date=|website=twibright.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the voltage to keep the nominal LED average current (100mA) varies with temperature and component tolerances, an AC-bypassed current sense resistor is put in series with the LED. A feedback loop measures voltage on this resistor and keeps it at a preset level by varying supply voltage of the 74AC04 gates. Therefore, the nominally digital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~mathys/ecen1400/pdf/references/74AC04.pdf|title=Fairchild: 74AC04 Datasheet|author=|date=|website=colorado.edu|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 74AC04 is operating as a structured power [[CMOS]] switch completely in analog mode.

This way the LED [[semiconductor junction|junction]] is flooded and cleared of [[charge carrier|carriers]] as quickly as possible, basically by [[short circuit]] discharge. This pushes the speed of the LED to maximum, which makes the output optical signal fast enough so that the range/power ratio is the same as with the faster red HPWT-BD00-F4000 LED. The side effects of this brutal driving
technique are: 1) the LED overshoots at the beginning of longer (5&amp;nbsp;MHz/1&amp;nbsp;MHz) impulses to about 2x brightness. This was measured to have no adverse effect on range. 2) A blocking [[ceramic capacitor]] bank backing up the 74AC04 switching array is crucial for correct operation, because charging and discharging the LED is done by short circuit. Under dimensioning this bank causes the leading and trailing edges of the optical output to grow longer.

=== Transceiver – Ronja Twister ===

Ronja Twister is an electronic interface for free space optical datalink based on counter and shift register chips. It is a part of the Ronja design. It is effectively an optical Ethernet transceiver without the optical drive part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronja.twibright.com/twister/|title=Ronja Twister|author=|date=|website=ronja.twibright.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original design has been superseded with Twister2 but the logic circuit remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronja.twibright.com/twister2/|title=Ronja Twister2|author=|date=|website=ronja.twibright.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open source hardware approach ==

Soderberg, studying Ronja sociologically, writes: "Arguably, the first project that vindicated the methods and licensing schemes of free software development, applied those practices to open hardware development, and pulled off a state-of-the-art technology without any backing from universities or firms, was the Ronja project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/how-open-hardware-drives-digital-fabrication-tools-such-3d-printer|title=How open hardware drives digital fabrication tools such as the 3D printer|author=|date=|website=policyreview.info|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole [[toolchain]] is built strictly upon free tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronja.twibright.com/sw.php|title=Software used for Ronja development|author=|date=|website=ronja.twibright.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[source code|source files]] are provided, free, under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ronja.twibright.com/schematics/|title=All Schematics|author=|date=|website=ronja.twibright.com|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows anyone to enter the development, start manufacture or invest into the technology without [[barriers to entry|entry costs]]. Such costs normally can include [[software licence]] costs, time investment into resolution of compatibility issues between proprietary applications, or costs of [[intellectual property]] licence negotiations. The decision to conceive the project this way was inspired by observed organizational efficiency of [[Free Software]].

On Christmas 2001, Ronja became the world's first 10 Mbit/s Free Space Optics device with free sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/01/12/22/1432211/build-your-own-10mbitsec-optical-data-link|title=Build Your Own 10Mbit/sec Optical Data Link – Slashdot|author=|date=|website=hardware.slashdot.org|accessdate=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of tools used in development:

* gEDA gschem ([[Schematic capture]])&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://geda.seul.org|title=Schematic capture}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[QCad]]

==History==
The company opened its first store in 1987 and has since grown to become the third largest money transfer service in the world.&lt;ref name=RiaMoneyTransferService&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riamoneytransfer.com/about-ria|title=Ria Money Transfer Service: About|accessdate=4 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ria currently serves customers in 144 countries through more than 314,000 locations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.euronetworldwide.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=994773|title=Euronet - Euronet Worldwide Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results|website=ir.euronetworldwide.com|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ria began working with post offices in 2010 and on July 31, 2014,  partnered with [[Kenya Post Office Savings Bank|Postbank]], which is owned by the Kenyan Government, allowing their customers to send money through any of the bank’s 99 branches, or receive it directly into their accounts.&lt;ref name=PostandParcel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postandparcel.info/62438/postal-access-forum/ria-money-transfer-and-postbank-kenya-sign-deal-to-boost-remittance-flows/|title=Ria Money Transfer and Postbank Kenya sign deal to boost remittance flows|accessdate=4 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company continues to expand its postal partnerships to reach more underbanked and underserved customers in hard to reach places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theriablog.com/2016/06/28/post-office-partnerships-unbanked-underbanked/|title=Ria adds more Post partnerships to reach underbanked|date=2016-06-28|website=Ria Blog|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until [[privatisation]] in 1987 they were the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] and later the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].

==Origin==
Prior to the 1930s Britain's ordnance manufacturing capability had been concentrated within the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]]. In the late nineteenth century the term 'Royal Ordnance Factories' began to be used collectively of the manufacturing departments of the Arsenal (principally the [[Royal Laboratory]], [[Royal Gun Factory]] and Royal Carriage Works) which, though they shared the same site, operated independently of one another. This use of the term is seen in the name of the [[Royal Ordnance Factories F.C.|Royal Ordnance Factories Football Club]] (founded 1893) and it continued through the [[First World War]]. The emerging threat of [[air strikes|aerial bombing]], however, prompted the government to consider dispersing its ordnance factories around the country.

==Development==
The majority of the ROFs were built in the [[Rearmament (UK, 1930s)|re-armament]] period just before the start of the 1939–45 World War to enhance the capacity of the three ordnance sites that had continued in operation after the end of [[World War I]]: the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Royal Gunpowder Factory]] (RGPF) [[Waltham Abbey (town)|Waltham Abbey, Essex]] and the [[Royal Small Arms Factory]], (RSAF) [[Enfield Town|Enfield]]. These three sites were in or near London and were considered to be vulnerable to aerial [[bombing]] from continental Europe.

The Royal Arsenal designed many of the ROFs and was also the [[wiktionary:agent|agent]] for the construction of all of the Rifles ROFs, the Medium Machine ROF and the Small Arms Ammunition ROFs. The Ministry of Supply, the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and two other private companies were agents for the construction of the remaining ROFs.&lt;ref name=kohan&gt;Kohan (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other WW II explosive factories===
A number of World War II [[munitions]] factories in the UK were built and owned by [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). These [[ICI Nobel|ICI Nobel Explosives]] owned factories were not considered part of the Ministry of Supply's Royal Ordnance Factory organisation and they were not called ROFs. ICI also managed munitions factories constructed with Ministry of Supply funding. These were known as "Agency Factories" and three of them became part of [[Royal Ordnance]] upon the ROFs' privatisation.

====Agency Factories====
Some of the ROF Filling Factories built later during World War II were government-owned but managed, as Agency Factories, by private companies unconnected with the explosives industry. For example, [[J. Lyons and Co.|Joseph Lyons &amp; Co]] ran [[ROF Elstow]] throughout the war.&lt;ref name=bates&gt;Bates (n/d).&lt;/ref&gt; Other Filling Factories were run by [[Imperial Tobacco|Imperial Tobacco Co Ltd]], [[Courtaulds Ltd]], [[Co-operative Wholesale Society|The Co-operative Wholesale Society]] (CWS), Metal Closures Ltd and [[Lever Brothers]].

== Siting of the ROFs ==
The new ROFs were to be built in areas regarded as "relatively safe", which until 1940 meant from [[Bristol]] in the south and then west of a line that ran from (roughly) [[Weston-super-Mare]] in Somerset northwards to [[Haltwhistle]], Northumberland; and then northwestwards to [[Linlithgow]] in Scotland. The South, South East and East of England were regarded as "dangerous" and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] area, including [[Birmingham]] as "unsafe". This definition of "safe" area was later changed, and in 1940 ignored in the case of ROF Chorley.&lt;ref&gt;Hornby (1958) Chapter IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siting of the individual ROFs north and west of this line was of vital importance. ROFs involved with [[explosive]] manufacture or filling needed, on safety grounds, to be located away from centres of population. However they needed access to good transport links, such as railways; the availability of adequate workers within reasonable travelling distance; a plentiful guaranteed supply of clean process water; and (to avoid the danger of frozen explosives) tended to be located at or just above sea Level. Some ROFs located in [[Wales]] and Scotland were the result of political [[lobbying]] as these areas had high unemployment rates in the 1930s. The ROFs were guarded by what was to become the [[Ministry of Defence Police|Ministry of Defence Police Force]].

== Responsibilities and functions ==
{{Main|Engineering ROF|Explosive ROF|Filling Factories}}
The Royal Ordnance Factories were set up with six generic types of factories:
* [[Engineering ROF]]s;
* [[Explosive ROF]]s;
* [[Filling Factories]], including [[small arms]] ammunition (SAA) Filling Factories;
* Medium Machine Shops, specifically [[ROF Patricroft]];
* Rifles ROFs, specifically [[ROF Fazakerley]] and [[ROF Maltby]]; and,
* Small Arms Ammunition (SAA) Factories.

The three main types were: Engineering, Filling and Explosives.

The largest ROFs tended to be the Explosive ROFs and the Filling Factories as these needed an explosives safeguarding zone around the [[perimeter]] of the factory; as well as separation, or reduced separation and traverses, between buildings. [[ROF Bishopton]] occupied over {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} and [[ROF Chorley]] was {{convert|900|acre|km2}}.

=== Management of the ROFs ===
Each ROF tended to be self-contained, apart from its raw [[Raw material|material]]s: with their own coal-fired [[power stations]], for generating [[steam]] for heating and process use, and electricity via high-pressure steam [[turbines]] if needed; engineering workshops; [[plumbers]] and chemical plumbers; leather workers; electricians; buildings and works departments; [[House|housing]] and [[hostels]] for workers; [[Canteen (place)|canteen]]s; [[Laundry|laundries]] and medical centres.

The UK's ROFs were set up and operated as production factories. The design of [[explosives]], [[propellants]] and [[munitions]] was carried out at separate government-owned research and development establishments such as the Research Department, which was initially based at the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]] and then [[Halstead, Kent|Fort Halstead]], in [[Sevenoaks]], Kent; and at PERME Waltham Abbey, Essex, which later moved to become RARDE Fort Halstead.

==Post-war history==
=== Closures of temporary ROFs ===
{{see also|1957 Defence White Paper}}

A number of the ROFs were designated ''temporary'', for use during the war's duration only. They closed shortly after the end of World War II. Other ROFs were designated ''permanent'' and they remained open into more recent times. In 1957, a Defence [[White paper]] led to a reorganisation of the aircraft industry, a restructuring of the [[British Army]] and a concentration on [[missile]] systems. A number of the ''permanent'' ROFs closed in the late 1950s, after the end of the [[Korean War]], and others closed in the 1970s. The largest of these, based at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]], formally closed on 31 March 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Saint, A., Guillery, P. (2012). ''[[Survey of London]], Volume 48: Woolwich''. Yale Books, London. {{ISBN|978-0-300-18722-9}}. p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporary ROFs, or ROFs which closed in the 1950s and 1970s, tended to be taken over by other Government Departments. Some closed ROFs and [[Admiralty]] explosive sites, such as the [[Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent]], were retained by the Ministry of Defence as ammunition storage areas; others became Government Industrial Estates or Trading Estates; others were used as [[Brownfield status|brown field]] sites to build Prisons or Open Prisons.

Part of [[ROF Thorp Arch]] became the [[Boston Spa]] depository of the [[British Library]]. Three of the seven hostels that served [[ROF Swynnerton]] became a [[Training]] School for the [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] (GPO) Telephones, which later became [[British Telecom]]. Now called Yarnfield Park Training and Conference Centre and run by [[Accenture]]. [[ROF Elstow]] was taken over by the [[CEGB]] and became a storage depot. The site has been cleared; and, as of 2008, is in the process of becoming the new town of [[Wixams]].

=== The Trading Fund ===
In, July 1974, the Royal Ordnance Factories were set up as a [[Trading Fund]], under the Government's Trading Funds Act 1973.&lt;ref name=nevell-4&gt;Nevell, Roberts and Smith (1999), Chapter 5: "From Royal Ordnance Factory to Plc, 1957–1984".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privatisation of the remaining ROFs===
{{Main|Royal Ordnance|Dstl|QinetiQ}}
As part of its [[privatisation]] process in the 1980s, the UK Government transferred some of the, formerly separate, research and development capability of the [[Defence Research Establishments]] into the ROFs. Other parts of the UK's defence research and design capability were later closed down; remained with the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], as [[Dstl]]; or became part of [[QinetiQ]].

On 2 January 1985 the majority of the Royal Ordnance Factories were vested in the UK Government-owned company [[Royal Ordnance]] Plc; it was bought by [[British Aerospace]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John and Yarrow, George (1993). ''Privatization: An Economic Analysis''. Cambridge Massachusetts and London, England: Massachusetts Institute of Technology. {{ISBN|0-262-22033-4}}, page 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence Police]] left most of the ROFs on or within a few years of privatisation.

The small number of ROFs involved in [[nuclear weapon]]s production, [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|ROF Burghfield]] and [[ROF Cardiff]], were removed from ROF management and did not pass over to Royal Ordnance upon privatisation. They were transferred to the control of AWRE; which later became the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2517">[[Image:School bus.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The crossing arm can be seen in use. Note the presence of the rotated yellow bar on the front bumper.]]
A '''school bus crossing arm''' is a safety device intended to protect children from being struck while crossing in front of a [[school bus]]. 
Typically, school bus crossing arms are wire or [[plastic]] devices which extend from the front bumper on the right side of the bus while it is stopped for loading/unloading and form a barrier. The devices force [[children]], who need to cross the road, to stand several feet in front of the bus itself before they can begin to cross the road.  This ensures that the bus driver can see them as they cross, avoiding a common [[blind spot (vehicle)|blind spot]] immediately in front of the bus, closest to the bumper. The crossing arm retracts flush against the bumper while not activated, such as when the bus is in motion.

Unlike traffic warning lights and many other safety-related features typically found on school buses in the United States, crossing arms are not required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for School Buses. Regulations for equipment and use vary widely on a state-by-state basis. In some places, they are optional at the discretion of a local school district or [[school bus contractor]].

The 1990 death of 6 year old Elizabeth "Betsy" Kyung Lee Anderson, in Washington state, led to the installation of school bus crossing arms, also referred to as "Betsy Bars" or "Betsy Gates" on all Washington state school busses by 1992.  The crossing arms, when extended, require students to cross at least 5 feet in front of the bus.

In Manitoba, Canada, provincial school buses have been required to have an extendable safety arm mounted on the bus since a seven-year-old boy died in 1996 in St. Norbert, after getting off his school bus.

A '''shoe hanger''', also called a shoe display hanger,   is commonly used to hang and display footwear in retail stores for the purpose of space efficient storage and to present footwear to customers. Shoe hangers have secondary functions of providing support for footwear and for displaying key information, such as style and shoe size. Shoe hangers come in a variety of styles for different display purposes and footwear types. The most common styles are wing, hook and clip designs, which are made from plastic.

==Designs==

Wing shoe hangers have an elongated base that terminates at the upper end with a hook. Usually a flat disc appears just below the hook where information about the footwear is displayed.  The bottom end of the base terminates into a U-shape. Each arm of the U acts as an element where a shoe can be fitted. These arms often extend and loop back down on each other to create a wing, which offers more support for the shoe. In U-shaped and wing designs, each shoe of the pair is hung adjacent to each other. This design is most commonly used for flat soled footwear such as trainers, sandals, slippers and pumps.

Hook shoe hangers are more basic in their design and resemble small clothes hangers. The arms are far shorter and have a hook at their end. This design is commonly used to hang flip-flops or sandals.

Clip shoe hangers are used to hand and display boots. The base is short and terminates at the upper end with a hook. Directly below the hook is a flat disc that acts as a display for information and also as a grip to open the spring clip. The clip displays boots side on as opposed to other shoe hanger designs that display footwear front on.

==History==

One of the earliest patented shoe hangers was used for the purpose of hanging shoes in public service areas such as school, where it was important to be able to store shoes in an organised manner. It was also important to prominently display shoes so that the wearer would have easy access to them. Like modern shoe hangers in retail stores, its secondary function was to support shoes. The main difference between this design and modern shoe hangers was that the soles of the shoes would lie flat against the wall. This early shoe hanger, which was made from wire, was patented in 1926 by Jesse S. Harding.

As retail space became increasingly expensive it became necessary to display shoes and other clothing items in a more space efficient way. The first modern shoe hanger was filed by the Japanese Tsuneji Matsubara in 1970 and consisted of a base with an element for placing a pair of shoes adjacent to each other. Various improvements where made over the next few decades to accommodate the storage and display of different types of shoes, as seen in the wing, hook and clip designs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5105">'''Shore power''' or '''shore supply''' is the provision of shoreside electrical power to a ship at berth while its main and auxiliary engines are shut down.&lt;ref name="CTPx"&gt;[http://crosstree.info/Documents/ColdIroning.pdf] Article: Cold-Iron the Ships by Capt. Pawanexh Kohli&lt;/ref&gt; While the term denotes [[shore]] as opposed to [[sea|off-shore]], it is sometimes  applied to aircraft or land-based vehicles (such as campers, heavy trucks with sleeping compartments and [[Sleeper bus|tour buses]]), which may plug into grid power when parked for [[idle reduction]].

The source for land-based power may be grid power from an electric utility company, but also possibly an external remote generator. These generators may be powered by diesel or renewable energy sources such as wind or solar.

Shore power saves consumption of fuel that would otherwise be used to power vessels while in port, and eliminates the air pollution associated with consumption of that fuel. A port city may have [[anti-idling]] laws that require ships to use shore power. Use of shore power may facilitate maintenance of the ship's engines and generators, and reduces noise.

==Oceangoing ships==
"[[Cold ironing]]" is specifically a [[shipping|shipping industry]] term that came into use when all ships had [[coal]]-fired engines. When a ship tied up at port, there was no need to continue to feed the fire and the iron engines would literally cool down, eventually going completely cold – hence the term "cold ironing". If commercial ships can use shore-supplied power for services such as cargo handling, pumping, ventilation and lighting while in port, they need not run their own diesel engines, reducing air pollution emissions.

==Small craft==
[[File:Small boats using shore power.jpg|thumb|Small boats using shore power]]
On small [[Pleasure craft|private boats]], the power supply used is usually the same as regular household electric power. Some small craft may not need electric power while docked, or may replace on-board generators (if any) with solar panels sufficient to run a small battery-operated system. Boats that are connected to shorepower only need sufficient battery capacity to last until the next shorepower connection.

Batteries on a vessel may be used to power an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] to produce [[alternating current|AC]], which can be used for appliances that require AC power.

== Trucks ==
Shore power, as it relates to the trucking industry, is commonly referred to as "Truck Stop Electrification" (TSE). The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates that trucks plugging in versus idling on diesel fuel could save as much as $3240 annually.&lt;ref name="energy_gov-idle_red"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center: Truck Stop Electrification for Heavy-Duty Trucks|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/idle_reduction_electrification.html}} 090916 afdc.energy.gov&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 138 truck stops&lt;ref name="energy_gov-tse_listings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/progs/tse_listings.php|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711100412/http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/progs/tse_listings.php|archivedate=2009-07-11|df=}} 090916 afdc.energy.gov&lt;/ref&gt; in the USA that offer on-board systems (also called Shore power) or off-board systems (also called single system electrification) for an hourly fee.
[[Auxiliary power unit]]s offer another alternative to both idling and shore power for trucks.

==Aircraft==
[[File:201701 EI-XLD with GPU supply.jpg|thumb|A [[Rossiya Airlines]] airplane connected to its ground power unit at [[Phuket International Airport]].]]
Similar to shore power for ships, a [[Ground_support_equipment#Ground_power_units|ground power unit]] (GPU) may be used to supply electric power for an aircraft on the ground, to sustain interior lighting, ventilation and other requirements before starting of the main engines or the aircraft [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU). It is also used by aircraft with APUs if the airport authority does not permit the usage of APUs at its docks or if the carrier wishes to save on the use of jet fuel (which APUs use). This may be a self-contained engine-generator set, or it may convert commercial power to the voltage and frequency needed for the aircraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5050">'''Sillage''' (\si.jaʒ\) in [[perfume]] refers to the aura or trail created by a perfume when it is worn on the skin. It comes from the word in French for "wake" and can best be described as how a fragrance diffuses around the wearer. Sillage or diffusion in fragrances can also be called the "projection" of a fragrance.

Compounds such as [[Hedione]] (methyl dihydrojasmonate) can be used to enhance the diffusivity of a fragrance. Hedione is a synthetic relative of [[methyl jasmonate]],  a naturally occurring compound in floral scents such as [[jasmine]], [[Polianthes tuberosa|tuberose]] and [[magnolia]]. Methyl jasmonate is also found in many other plant parts and is considered to be a signalling molecule. It is considered one of the compounds responsible for the projection of the scent in living flowers and was first fully characterised in between 1957 and 1962 in jasmine absolute (0.8%) by the fragrance chemist [[Edouard Demole]] who was working at [[Firmenich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theimer |first1=Ernst T |title=Fragrance Chemistry Science of the Sense of Smell, The. |date=2014 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=9780323138604 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1044713310 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful fragrance to utilise Hedione was [[Eau Sauvage]] by perfumer [[Edmond Roudnitska]] for [[Parfums Christian Dior|Christian Dior]] , launched in 1966. The addition of Hedione to a classically hesperidic fragrance construction created a dewy lemony magnolia-jasmine dimension without being directly floral, and gave it a new type of projection and transparency not experienced before in this type of perfume. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is considered to be the beginning of a new trend in perfumery towards transparency and projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Ralf Günter |title=Scent and Chemistry. The Molecular World of Odors. By Günther Ohloff, Wilhelm Pickenhagen and Philip Kraft. |date=2012 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201201256 |language=en|doi=10.1002/anie.201201256|publisher=Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds such as [[Damascone|damascones,]] Iso-E super, [[linalool]] and some of the synthetic musks such as [[cashmeran]] may also be added to fragrances to enhance their diffusion and sillage.

A fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage;   fragrances such as Giorgio Beverly Hills for women and Poison (Dior) are very good examples of this. Eau Sauvage and [[L'eau d'Issey]] ([[Jacques Cavallier|Jaques Cavallier]] for [[Issey Miyake]]) have a large sillage but may be considered much lighter examples of this.

Sillage in a perfume could also be considered to be how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin. According to an article by Mookerjee, a fragrance is perceived by the diffusion of individual fragrance molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mookerjee |first1=B. D |last2=Patel |first2=S.

Once a fragrance is applied to the skin, the skin itself becomes a substrate to the scent.

== History ==
In 1851 [[John Benjamin Dancer]] invented microphotographs using a [[collodion]] process  and a microscope converted to a camera.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt; This resulted in a microphotograph about {{convert|3|mm2}} in area.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt; The main disadvantage of Dancer's method was that the viewing of the microphotographs required a microscope which was at the time an expensive instrument.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt; In 1857 Dagron solved the problem by inventing a method of mounting the microphotographs at the end of a small cylindrical lens.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tissandier"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyhandbooko00tissuoft/historyhandbooko00tissuoft_djvu.txt A history and handbook of photography (1877)] Author: Tissandier, Gaston, 1843-1899 Subject: Photography; Photography Publisher: New York : Scoville Manufacturing Quote: "It is a miniature microscope with considerable magnifying powers. The image seen through it is magnified about three hundred times." and "The lens used for toy micropliotographs resembles the Stanhope lens, but is not cut down in the centre to form a diaphragm. It consists simply of a cylinder of flint glass, or long plano-convex lens whose focus is its ovm plain surface, to which the photograph is attached with Canada balsam."&lt;/ref&gt; Dagron modified the Stanhope lens by sectioning the normally [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|biconvex]] Stanhope lens and introducing a planar section so that the plane was located at the [[focal length]] of the convex side of the cylindrical lens.&lt;ref name="The Strad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tissandier"/&gt; This produced a [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|plano-convex]] lens, where Dagron was able to mount the microscopic photograph on the flat side of the lens using [[Canada balsam]] as adhesive.&lt;ref name="The Strad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tissandier"/&gt; This arrangement enabled the picture to be focused.&lt;ref name="The Strad"/&gt;

The Stanhope optical viewers were also mounted inside the bows of [[violin]]s by French violin maker [[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume]], probably using Dagron's methods and equipment.&lt;ref name="The Strad"/&gt; The violin Stanhopes featured the portraits of famous people such as [[Paganini]], [[Tourte]] and [[Stradivari]].&lt;ref name="The Strad"/&gt;

The sectioned lens could magnify the microphotograph three hundred times,&lt;ref name="Tissandier"/&gt; so that the viewing of the microphotographs no longer required a bulky and expensive microscope. The modified Stanhope lens was small enough to be mounted in all manner of miniature artifacts such as rings, ivory miniatures, wooden toys etc.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt; Dagron also designed a special microphotographic camera which could produce 450 exposures approximately {{convert|2|x|2|mm}} on a {{convert|4.5|x|8.5|cm|adj=on}} wet collodion plate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geh.org/fm/mees/htmlsrc/mD12700001_ful.html George Eastman House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315230038/http://www.geh.org/fm/mees/htmlsrc/mD12700001_ful.html |date=2009-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Stanhope ring.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Stanhope ring]]
Dagron's efforts met with great success.&lt;ref name="Bio Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PJ8DHBay4_EC&amp;pg=PA927&amp;lpg=PA927&amp;dq=microphotography++Dagron&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZP5XOo5QF7&amp;sig=9lS8X3hm61rBhK2ym0PUgBJHWps&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oG9ESrmWGYW0Nub4tJsB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10 Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Photography]'' By John Hannavy Publisher CRC Press, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-415-97235-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viewers were first introduced to the general public at the 1859 International Fair in Paris.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt;

The success of his viewers enabled Dagron to purpose-build a factory dedicated to their production.&lt;ref name="Bio Dictionary"/&gt; As of June 1859, Dagron's factory was manufacturing the stanhopes, mounted in jewellery and souvenirs. In August 1859 he exhibited them at the International Exhibition in Paris where they met with great success. In 1862 he had 150 employees and was manufacturing 12,000 units a day.&lt;ref name="The Strad"/&gt;

In 1860 Dagron obtained the patent for his viewers under the title ''Bijoux Photomicroscopiques''.&lt;ref name="British photo journal"/&gt; Dagron also developed [[mail order]] marketing techniques for his viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Jean |date=2002 |title=Stanhopes: A Closer View--A History &amp; Handbook For Collectors Of Microphotographic Novelties |location=Witham, United Kingdom |publisher=Greenlight |isbn=978-1897738092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Telescope Stanhope.PNG|thumb|left|150px|A stanhope in the form of a miniature telescope]]
In 1862 Dagron published his book ''Cylindres photo-microscopiques, montés et non montés sur bijoux''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dagron |first=René |date=1862 |title=Cylindres photo-microscopiques, montés et non montés sur bijoux |trans-title=Photo-microscopic cylinders, mounted and unmounted on jewelry |url= |language=fr |location= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century Eugène Reymond took control of Dagron's stanhope lens factory in [[Gex, Ain|Gex]], [[France]]. He was succeeded in the management of the factory by his son Roger. In 1972 the factory, run by Roger Remond, produced the last stanhope lens made by the traditional methods. In 1998, after Roger's death, the workshop was closed and its equipment dismantled and sold. Stanhope lenses are still manufactured to this day, but they are not produced according to Dagron's methodology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanhopes.info/who_made_stanhopes.html Who made stanhopes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the most common stanhopes are usually gold or silver crosses with Christian prayers in the microphotograph.&lt;ref name="Focal encyclopedia of photography"/&gt;

Kare was originally hired into the Macintosh software group to design user interface graphics and fonts; her business cards read "[[Human Interface|HI]] Macintosh Artist". Later, she was a Creative Director in Apple Creative Services working for the Director of that organization, Tom Suiter.

She is the designer of many [[typeface]]s, icons, and original marketing material for the original [[Macintosh]] [[operating system]]. Descendants of her groundbreaking work can still be seen in many computer graphics tools and accessories, especially icons such as the Lasso, the Grabber, and the Paint Bucket. These designs created the first visual language for Apple's new point-and-click computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/iconic-iconographer-susan-kare-explains-how-%E2%8C%98-came-to-be/|title=Iconic Designer Susan Kare Explains How ⌘ Came to Be|last=Gonzalez|first=Robbie|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kare was an early pioneer of [[pixel art]]. Her most recognizable works from her time with Apple are the [[Chicago (typeface)|Chicago]] typeface (the most prominent user-interface typeface seen in [[classic Mac OS]] interfaces from System 1 in 1984, to Mac OS9 in 1999, as well as the typeface used in the first four generations of the Apple [[iPod]] interface); the [[Geneva (typeface)|Geneva]] typeface; the original [[Monospaced font|monospace]] [[Monaco (typeface)|Monaco]] typeface; "Clarus the [[Dogcow]]"; the "[[Happy Mac]]" icon (the smiling computer that welcomed Mac users when starting their machines), and the [[Command key]] symbol on Apple keyboards.&lt;ref name="hom_su" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tobin" /&gt;

After leaving Apple, Kare joined [[NeXT]] as a designer, working with clients such as [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]].&lt;ref name="Tobin" /&gt; Her projects for Microsoft included the card deck for [[Windows 3.0]]'s [[Solitaire (Windows)|solitaire]] game,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thisisstory.com/susan-kare-discusses-windows-3-solitaire-iconography-nostalgia/|title=In Conversation With Susan Kare: On Windows 3.0 Solitaire, Iconography, and Nostalgia - STORY|date=2016-09-27|work=STORY|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt96"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kare.com/articles/nytimes.html|title=The Designer Who Made the Mac Smile|author=Laurence Zuckerman|date=1996-08-26|work=[[The New York Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812002119/http://www.kare.com/articles/nytimes.html|archivedate=2007-08-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2007-08-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as numerous icons and design elements for Windows 3.0.&lt;ref name="sjm" /&gt; Many of her icons, such as those for [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]] and various [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panels]], remained essentially unchanged by Microsoft until [[Windows XP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13713">'''Telepsychiatry''' is the application of [[telemedicine]] to the specialty field of [[psychiatry]]. The term typically describes the delivery of [[psychiatric assessment]] and care through [[telecommunications]] technology, usually [[videoconferencing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/professional-interests/underserved-communities/telepsychiatry | title = Telepsychiatry | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | accessdate = 7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telepsychiatry services can be offered through intermediary companies that partner with facilities to increase care capacities, or by individual providers or provider groups. Most commonly, telepsychiatry encounters take place at medical facilities under the supervision of onsite staff, though at-home models are becoming accepted&lt;ref name="NYT-2011.09.25a"&gt;{{cite news |last = Hoffman | first = Jan | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/fashion/therapists-are-seeing-patients-online.html?_r=1 | title = When Your Therapist Is Only a Click Away | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | date = 23 September 2011 | accessdate = 7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as long as they are in compliance with [[HIPAA]] standards.

One of the drivers behind telepsychiatry's growth in the United States has been a national shortage of psychiatrists, particularly in specialty areas such as [[child and adolescent psychiatry]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/727435 | title = Psychiatric Care Shortage: What the Future Holds | date = 2 September 2010 | accessdate = 7 August 2013 | first = Jeffrey A. | last = Lieberman | publisher = [[Medscape]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; telepsychiatry can allow fewer doctors to serve more patients by improving utilization of the psychiatrist's time. Telepsychiatry can also make it easier for psychiatrists to treat patients in rural or under-served areas by eliminating the need for either party to travel. The most common means of insurance coverage for telehealth services among the United States is to incorporate coverage into the Medicare program. Reimbursement for Medicare-covered services must satisfy federal requirements of efficiency, economy and quality of care. Since 1999, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for all kinds of telehealth services have expanded, requirements of providers have been reduced, and grants have been given to support [[telehealth]] program adoption. For 2014, the Center for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] (CMS) services does cover telemedicine services, including telepsychiatry in many areas.

==Sub-specialties==
Telepsychiatry includes a variety of sub-specialties based on different contexts of service delivery.

===Home-based telepsychiatry===
Psychiatric treatment of patients who are at home or in another private setting is called home-based telepsychiatry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ikelheimer | first = Douglas M. | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23297081_Treatment_of_opioid_dependence_via_home-based_telepsychiatry | title = Treatment of Opioid Dependence via Home-Based Telepsychiatry | journal = [[Psychiatric Services]] | volume = 59 | issue = 10 | pages = 1218 | accessdate = 7 August 2013 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ps.59.10.1218-a| year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or direct-to-consumer telepsychiatry, and it can require only a [[webcam]] and high-speed internet service. However, in order to avoid the risk of violating the patient-provider relationship, issues of security and possible [[HIPAA]] violations, providers who wish to practice in-home telepsychiatry are best served doing so from within a secure, HIPPA compliant online platform.

Led by psychiatrist [[Jill Afrin]], [[South Carolina Department of Health]] Deaf Services Program has used home-based telepsychiatry as a part of its services since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=NLM&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Jill Afrin|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_2.html|work=Changing the Face of Medicine|publisher=National Library of Medicine|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual psychiatrists are adopting this method more and more with willing, interested patients,&lt;ref name=NYT-2011.09.25a /&gt; and it is an especially useful tool for consumers with limited mobility included the elderly and the disabled. Unfortunately, home-based telepsychiatry is not typically reimbursed by private payors or Medicaid, though many states are adopting measures into their legislation in the form of parity laws that would allow for it to be reimbursed in the future.

===Forensic telepsychiatry===
Forensic telepsychiatry is the use of a remote psychiatrist or nurse practitioner for psychiatry in a [[prison]] or correctional facility, including psychiatric assessment, medication consultation, suicide watch, pre-[[parole]] evaluations and more. Telepsychiatry can deliver significant cost savings to correctional facilities by eliminating the need for prisoners to be escorted to off-site appointments and psychiatric interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = T. W. | last2 = Burton | first2 = D. C. | last3 = Hill | first3 = K. | last4 = Luftman | first4 = G | last5 = Veltkempf | first5 = L. J. | last6 = Swope | first6 = M. | title = Telepsychiatry: critical dimensions for forensic services. | journal = [[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law]] | date = 2005 | volume = 33 | number = 4 | pages = 539–546 | pmid=16394233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On-demand telepsychiatry===
As of 2008, guidelines are being developed for the provision of telepsychiatric consultation for emergency psychiatric patients, such as the evaluation of [[suicide|suicidal]], [[homicide|homicidal]], [[violent]], [[psychotic]], [[Major depressive disorder|depressed]], [[mania|manic]], and [[anxious|acutely anxious]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Emergency Management Guidelines For Telepsychiatry |author1=Shore JH |author2=Hilty, D.M. |author3=Yellowlees, P. | journal=General Hospital Psychiatry | volume=29 | issue=3 | pages=199–206 | pmc=1986661 | year=2007 | doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2007.01.013 | pmid=17484936}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, emergency telepsychiatry services are already being provided to hospital emergency departments, jails, community mental health centers, substance abuse treatment facilities, and schools. Emergency telepsychiatry can ease staff shortages in overworked hospital [[emergency department]]s and increase patient throughput and ED disposition. Rather than employ expensive, short-term [[locum tenens]] doctors or have emergency department physicians evaluate the psychiatric stability of their patients, hospitals can use telepsychiatry to decrease costs and increase patient access to behavioral health evaluations by psychiatric specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Williams | first = Mike | last2 = Pfeffer | first2 = Michael | last3 = Boyle | first3 = Juliana | last4 = Hilty | first4 = Donald M. | url = http://www.chcf.org/~/media/MEDIA%20LIBRARY%20Files/PDF/T/PDF%20TelepsychiatryProgramsED.pdf | title = Telepsychiatry in the Emergency Department: Overview and Case Studies | publisher = [[California HealthCare Foundation]] | date = December 2009 | accessdate = 7 August 2013 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101204858/http://www.chcf.org/~/media/MEDIA%20LIBRARY%20Files/PDF/T/PDF%20TelepsychiatryProgramsED.pdf | archivedate = 1 November 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crisis telepsychiatry is also an efficient means of reducing the need for psychiatric boarding. Psychiatric boarding is when a mentally ill resident is detained, often in a hospital emergency department, while waiting for proper psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref&gt;title=Alleviate Psychiatric Boarding in Washington with Telepsychiatry | author=James Varrell, MD| source=Insight Bulletin http://insightbulletin.com/alleviate-psychiatric-boarding-in-washington-with-telepsychiatry/&lt;/ref&gt; With the increased throughput offered by telepsychiatry, psychiatric consumers enjoy reduced wait times and faster access to care.

===Scheduled Telepsychiatry===
Many facilities that offer behavioral health care are turning to telepsychiatry providers to allow for an increased care capacity. With routine telepsychiatry, a consistent provider or small group of providers serve a regular caseload of consumers in previously scheduled blocks of time. Remote providers can be consulted for medication management, treatment team meetings, supervision, or to offer traditional psychiatric assessment and consultations.

Having access to remote providers allows facilities, especially those in rural areas that struggle to recruit and maintain providers, access to a greater variety of speciality care to offer their consumers.

Facilities that use routine telepsychiatry include:

Community Mental Health Centers ([[Community mental health center|CMHCs]])
Outpatient clinics
Federally Qualified Health Centers ([[FQHC]]s)
Universities and Schools
Residential Programs
Nursing Homes
Accountable Care Organizations ([[Accountable care organization|ACOs]])
Substance Use Treatment Centers
Military Bases

==HIPAA compliance in the United States==
[[HIPAA]] (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a [[United States]] federal law that establishes security and privacy standards for electronic medical information exchange, including [[telemental health]] services. In order to comply with HIPAA guidelines, many providers develop their own specialized [[videoconferencing]] services, since common third-party consumer solutions do not include sufficient security and privacy safeguards. There are also a growing number of HIPAA-compliant technologies available for telepsychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation/make link|http://www.telementalhealthcomparisons.com/|Comparison of Telemental Health Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In India==
[[India]]'s large population and relatively small number of psychiatrists makes telepsychiatric service a good option for expanding access to mental health care. Telepsychiatry in India is still a young industry, but it is gradually growing, led by institutes such as the [[Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research]] in [[Chandigarh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pgimer.edu.in/PGIMER_PORTAL/PGIMERPORTAL/Department/Global/JSP/home_dept.jsp?CP=Eng&amp;deptid=d53&amp;B2=GO | title = Telemedicine Centre | website = [[PGIMER]], Chandigarh | accessdate = 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Schizophrenia Research Foundation]] in [[Chennai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scarfindia.org/tele-medicine/ | title = Tele Medicine | website = [[Schizophrenia Research Foundation|Scarf India]] | accessdate = 10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the UK==
The [[NHS]] has been slow at recognising the merits of telepsychiatry, perhaps because the regional set up of the NHS makes the provision non-location based virtual service difficult for the bureaucracy of a state owned model to implement, though there are now some NHS Mental Health Trusts such as [http://www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/ Oxford NHS Foundation Trust] who are starting to see the cost benefits and to set up services. There is a UK based group of consultant psychiatrists, [https://www.psychiatry-uk.com/ Psychiatry-UK LLP], working in a chamber model, providing a national telepsychiatry service. However, though they are registered with the [[Care Quality Commission]] as a qualified provider of medical services and can be found on the [[NHS Choices]] website, they are, as yet, only seeing patients who self fund or who have suitable health insurance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4004">'''Test compression''' is a technique used to reduce the time and cost of testing [[integrated circuit]]s.  The first ICs were tested with test vectors created by hand.  It proved very difficult to get good coverage of potential faults, so [[Design for test]]ability (DFT) based on scan and [[automatic test pattern generation]] (ATPG) were developed to explicitly test each gate and path in a design.  These techniques were very successful at creating high-quality vectors for manufacturing test, with excellent test coverage.  However, as chips got bigger the ratio of logic to be tested per pin increased dramatically, and the volume of scan test data started causing a significant increase in test time, and required tester memory.  This raised the cost of testing.

Test compression was developed to help address this problem.  When an ATPG tool generates a test for a fault, or a set of faults, only a small percentage of scan cells need to take specific values. The rest of the scan chain is ''don't care'', and are usually filled with random values.  Loading and unloading these vectors is not a very efficient use of tester time.  Test compression takes advantage of the small number of significant values to reduce test data and test time.  In general, the idea is to modify the design to increase the number of internal scan chains, each of shorter length.   These chains are then driven by an on-chip decompressor, usually designed to allow continuous flow decompression where the internal scan chains are loaded as the data is delivered to the decompressor.   Many different decompression methods can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Survey of Test Vector Compression Techniques |author=Touba, NA |journal=IEEE Design &amp; Test of Computers |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=294–303 |year=2006 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1683715 |doi=10.1109/MDT.2006.105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One common choice is a linear finite state machine, where the compressed stimuli are computed by solving linear equations corresponding to internal scan cells with specified positions in partially specified test patterns.  Experimental results show that for industrial circuits with test vectors and responses with very low fill rates, ranging from 3% to 0.2%, the test compression based on this method often results in compression ratios of 30 to 500 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Embedded deterministic test |author=Rajski, J. and Tyszer, J. and Kassab, M. and Mukherjee, N. |journal=IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=776–792 |year=2004 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1291587 |doi=10.1109/TCAD.2004.826558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a large number of test chains, not all the outputs can be sent to the output pins.  Therefore, a test response compactor is also required, which must be inserted between the internal scan chain outputs and the tester scan channel outputs. The compactor must be synchronized with the data decompressor, and must be capable of handling unknown (X) states.  (Even if the input is fully specified by the decompressor, these can result from false and multi-cycle paths, for example.)  Another design criteria for the test result compressor is that it should give good diagnostic capabilities, not just a yes/no answer.

'''The Cloisters''' in [[Letchworth Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] was built in 1905 as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]] and where students were taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. After a period of neglect during [[World War II]] The Cloisters became the North Hertfordshire Masonic Centre in 1951.

==Annie Jane Lawrence==
[[File:Annie Jane Lawrence 1910.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Annie Jane Lawrence c1910]]
The Cloisters was built by [[Quaker]] Miss Annie Jane Lawrence (16 April 1863&amp;ndash;3 August 1953), the daughter of Alfred Lawrence (1826 - 1875), who, with his brother Frederick, owned 'Lawrence Brothers, Smiths and Founders', and his wife Mary Elizabeth (née Ridge, 1838-1903).&lt;ref name=Miles&gt;Miles, V.W., ''The Cloisters, Letchworth, 1907-1967'' Published by The Lawrence Cloisters Trust (1967) pg 7&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandfather William Lawrence (1789-1855) came from humble origins but went on to be elected Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Carpenters]] in 1848 and an Alderman of the [[City of London]], while her uncle [[Sir James Lawrence, 1st Baronet|Sir James Lawrence]] was [[Lord Mayor of London]] in 1868. Her younger brother was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence]] (1871-1961).&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;[http://thecloisters.org.uk/About.aspx About The Cloisters - A Brief History - The Cloisters, Letchworth website]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 she was a pupil at the School for Ladies in [[Hove]] in [[Sussex]], while in 1895 she visited Boston in the USA.&lt;ref name=Ancestry/&gt; 

As a young woman she undertook social work in the slums of London, which urged her on to action. Lawrence decided to build a centre dedicated as a school of thought from which adults could go out and effect social change. She chose Letchworth because it was the world's First Garden City; here she leased three acres of land on which she built The Cloisters and Cloisters Lodge, intending that the former should be a School of Philosophy while she lived in the latter.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

==Design==
The design reputedly came to Miss Lawrence in a dream. The building originally consisted of a large half-oval 'open-air room' called the `Cloisters Garth' with an open colonnade to the south and large glazed bays to the north; this was flanked by two wings, one housing the kitchen and store rooms and the other the cubicles and dressing rooms for an oval open-air swimming pool. It was designed according to the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement, and was built using [[marble]]s and other materials from all over [[Europe]].

==1905-1907==
Originally built as an open-air school dedicated to [[Psychology]], with accommodation for 20 students, students were encouraged to study "how thought affects action and what causes and produces thought." Through healthy outdoor living it was intended that the students would develop healthy minds. The building was also designed to hold lectures, conferences, drama and musical performances as well as organ recitals. Students were also taught skills from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].&lt;ref name=Miles/&gt;

Designed by [[architect]] [[William Harrison Cowlishaw]], building commenced on the {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site in 1905, and the building opened on 17 January 1907, having cost the then huge sum of £20,000. Miss Lawrence built a house for herself, 'Cloisters Lodge', alongside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Cloisters.htm Utopia Britannica - British Utopian Experiments 1325 - 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1907-1939==
[[File:cloisters1908.jpg|The Cloisters in 1908|thumb|right]]
A small community developed at ''The Cloisters'' dedicated to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. It became the base for the ''Alpha Union'' set up by J. Bruce Wallace of the Brotherhood Church, who organised summer schools and residential courses there. Miss Lawrence, although somewhat deaf, was a great music lover. On one occasion she brought The London Concert Orchestra, made up of 40 unemployed musicians, to play at the Cloisters Garth. This was part of an ongoing series of concerts that she organised attended by audiences of 1,000, making organ recitals, band and choral concerts a regular part of the new town's cultural life. The last concert was given by the Brotherhood Orchestra in 1939 on the day the [[Second World War]] broke out.

== History since 1939==
[[File:Cloistersletchworth1b.JPG|thumb|right|The Masonic Temple at The Cloisters]]
The Cloisters was commandeered by the Army during the [[Second World War]] and suffered damage. By 1948 Miss Lawrence found it increasingly difficult to maintain the building and to repair the damage caused by the Army. She initially offered it to the local Council, who turned it down. Eventually, she offered it to the local [[Freemasons]] who accepted it, turning it into the [[North Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Centre. About sixty [[Masonic lodges]] and 'side degrees' meet at The Cloisters, and the centre is run and maintained by an elected Board of Trustees, The Lawrence Cloisters Trust. A Craft Lodge, the 'Cloisters Lodge No 7100' was formed there in 1951 to commemorate Miss Lawrence's generous gift of the building to [[Hertfordshire]] [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, Jack ''The Cloisters, Letchworth'' in ''Freemasonry Today'' Issue 11 (Winter 1999/2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16291128?versionId=19104779 Christodoulou, Glenn ''The Cloisters Lodge: the Next Twenty-Five Years'' Privately printed  by the Cloisters Lodge No. 7100 Festival Committee  (2001) [[National Library of Australia]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miss Lawrence eventually moved out of Cloisters Lodge into a house on Willian Way in Letchworth but her increasing frailty led to her moving to St Catherine's Nursing Home where she died aged 90 on 3 August 1953.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; She is buried in the churchyard of [[Church of All Saints, Willian|All Saints Church]] in [[Willian, Hertfordshire|Willian]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. In her will she left £41,246 2s 6d to George Ernest Hinman (Solicitor) and her brother the Rt. Hon. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence|Frederick William Pethick-Lawrence]].&lt;ref name=Ancestry&gt;[http://person.ancestry.co.uk/tree/87123076/person/80019953384/facts Annie Jane Lawrence - [[Ancestry.com]] - pay to view]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cloisters has been designated by Letchworth Garden City Corporation as one of the 'great historic buildings' of [[North Hertfordshire]]. It is a Grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1102019|desc=The Cloisters|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013 The Cloisters appeared in episode 4 of [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s five-part series ''Britain's Secret Homes'', placing it in 16th place out of 50 historic buildings in Britain selected by [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/britains-secret-homes/episode-4/ 'Britain's Secret Homes: Episode 4' on the '[[English Heritage]]'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although structurally sound, in October 2013 the building was put on [[English Heritage]]'s 'At Risk Register' owing mainly to the poor condition of its roof tiles which have allowed water to cause damage.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical building 'at risk' says English Heritage' - 'HItchin, Letchworth &amp; Baldock Advertiser'' October 16, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The Cloisters on at risk register' - ''The Hitchin Comet'' October 17, 2013 pg 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lacassane Company''' is a land management company, with a goal of [[sustainable land management]] using an [[environmental management scheme]] that involves a host of tools including [[holistic management]]. Located primarily in [[Jefferson Davis Parish|Jefferson Davis]] and [[Cameron Parish|Cameron]] [[parish]], with property in [[Ragley, Louisiana]], the company headquarters is in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]].

== History ==
Founded in 1929, by eight [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] area businessmen, with land purchased from Jim Gardiner. The company was formed with 2250 common shares of stock with share-holders including, W. P. Weber, H. G. Chalkley, C. O. Noble, Henry Pomeroy, George M. King and Frank Roberts, M. J. Muller, and purchased 21,000 acres that included farm machinery, implements, stock, and cattle bought for $380,000.00, that included what was the Lowery and Illinois plantations, that became known as "The Illinois Plant", and "The Lowery Plant".

The Lacassane company continued with the previous form of [[tenant farming]], increasing the original cattle herd, establishing trapping, hunting, oil and gas leases, and then the [[wetlands]] mitigation project. The [[Lacassine National Wildlife Refuge]] was established in 1937, when the company sold {{Convert|13,000|acres}} south of the Illinois Plant to the United States Government for $51,774.00.

== Current ==
The Illinois Plant is called the '''''Lacassane Coastal Prairie Mitigation Bank''''' and the Ragley property, in conjunction with the "Calcasieu Mitigation Bank" and partnered with  Ecosystem Investment Partners (EIP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.calcasieubank.com/ | title=Calcasieu Bank | publisher=Ecosystem Investment Partners | work=Mitigation Banking | date=2010 | accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is known as the '''''Bill Jackson Longleaf Savannah Mitigation Bank'''''. Both have been designated (through The Lacassane Company) by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] as a [[mitigation banking|mitigation bank]] providing [[ecosystem services]] to the public in the form of [[Environmental mitigation]] (compensatory mitigation) to ensure the [[no net loss wetlands policy]]&lt;ref name="wetlands mitigation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/wetlandsmitigation_index.cfm | title=mitigation regulation | publisher=EPA | accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is followed to prevent [[Biodiversity offsetting|Biodiversity loss]] that keeps the [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse]] [[Greenhouse debt|debt]] in check. The Lacassane Company partnered with The Coastal Plain Conservancy to hold [[Soil conservation|conservation]] [[Servitude in civil law|servitude]]s on the land. The banks are monitored and maintained by Wildlands, Inc., an environmental consulting and [[plant propagation]] company.

The company operations now include land leases for waterfowl (Waterfowl Limited Liability Company)&lt;ref name="Waterfowl Limited Liability Company"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_la/34875076K | title=Opencorporates | publisher=Louisiana Secretary Of State, Commercial Division, [http://coraweb.sos.la.gov/commercials] | date=26 Mar 2012, 10 May 2013 | accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other hunting,&lt;ref name="Hunting on The Lacassane Company property"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/The-Thrills-of-the-Hunt_9282/p/2 | title=The Thrills of the Hunt | publisher=Cigar Aficionado | date=November–December 2009 | accessdate=June 23, 2014 | author=John Maxwell Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; cattle grazing, alligator hide and egg harvesting, oil and gas exploration, and wetland projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4653">'''The Thor washing machine''' was the first electric clothes washer sold commercially in the United States.  Produced by the Chicago-based Hurley Electric Laundry Equipment Company, the 1907 Thor is believed to be the first electrically powered washer ever manufactured, crediting Hurley as the inventor of the first automatic [[washing machine]]. Designed by Hurley engineer Alva J. Fisher, a patent for the new electric Thor was issued on August 9, 1910, three years after its initial invention.&lt;ref&gt;About.com – ''History of the Washing Machine'' http://inventors.about.com/od/wstartinventions/a/washingmachines.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an automatic washing machine had been around for many years but these were crude mechanical efforts that typically involved a manually operated [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] or similar design.&lt;ref name="oldewash.com"&gt;OldeWash.com – ''Who Invented the First Washing Machine?'' http://www.oldewash.com/articles/Electric_Washer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In many ways, the patent of the new Thor washer sounds modern, even today.  The patent states that a "perforated cylinder is rotatably mounted within the tub containing the wash water".  A series of blades lifted the clothes as the cylinder rotated.  After 8 rotations in one direction, the machine would reverse rotation to "prevent the cloths from wadding up into a compact mass".&lt;ref&gt;''Her century A chronology of 100 years of highs and lows'' http://www.projo.com/cgi-bin/include.pl/specials/women/timeline.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Drive belt]]s attached to a [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] motor connected to three wheels of different sizes, which moved the drum during operation.  The design also included a [[clutch]], which allowed the machine to switch direction, and an emergency stop rod.  The new Thor washer was [[Mass marketing|mass marketed]] throughout the United States beginning in 1908.&lt;ref name="oldewash.com"/&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Thor Washing Machine (6602612223).jpg|thumb|Penngrove Museum, CA]]
There is dispute over who was the first inventor of the automatic washer.  A company called Nineteen Hundred Washing Machine Company of [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton, NY]] claims to have produced the first electric washer in 1906; a year before Thor's release.&lt;ref&gt;Washing Machine Dryers http://washingmachinedryers.co.uk/washing-machine-history/&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, it has been stated in various articles on the Internet that a [[Ford Motor Company]] employee invented the electric washer in late 19th century or early 20th century. Since Ford was incorporated in 1903, it seems unlikely that the Ford story is valid.  Regardless, Thor remains one of the first (if not the first) company to manufacture and sell an automatic washing machine on a large scale.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Other Thor innovations==

===Tilt-a-whirl agitator===
Thor invented the tilt-a-whirl system in which the [[Agitator (device)|agitator]], typically in the shape of disk, tilted back and forth within the washer [[Drum (container)|drum]] while simultaneously rotating.  The early 1930s tilt-a-whirl design was the first agitator to move water in both a horizontal and vertical motion.  The 1936 version of the Thor tilt-a-whirl incorporated sculpted hands embossed on the agitator.  At the time, some Thor dealers painted the fingernails of the hands on demonstration machines.&lt;ref name="oldewash.com"/&gt;

===Automagic washer/dishwasher===
In the 1940s, Thor introduced the Automagic hybrid washer/[[dishwasher]]. The top-loading machine included both a removable clothes washing drum and a dish-washing drum.  The Automagic was widely marketed but disappeared from the marketplace soon after its introduction, as many consumers soured on the idea of washing dirty clothing and dishes in the same machine.&lt;ref&gt;AutoMagic Advertisement https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C2Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6qQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2503,310927&amp;dq=automagic+thor&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thor today===
The Thor trademark was acquired in 2002 by Los Angeles–based Appliances International, a supplier of [[washer dryer]] combos and stacking washers and dryers.  Soon after the brand acquisition, the company introduced a new line of laundry appliances under the Thor brand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6949">Between 1871 and 1910, the [[German Empire]] experienced a period of both large-scale [[industrialization]] and large-scale [[urbanization]]. As a result of this movement of people from rural areas to cities, living and working conditions were often poor, setting the scene for the social conflict within Germany that was to follow.

Between 1871 and 1910, the number of Germans who lived in urban areas significantly increased.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; While the percentage of Germans who lived in communities (localities) with less than 2,000 people decreased from 64% to 40% between 1871 and 1910, the percentage of Germans who lived in communities with 20,000 to 99,999 people increased from 8% to 13% and the percentage of Germans who lived in communities with 100,000 or more people increased from 5% to 21% during the same time period.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

However, this urbanization occurred unevenly throughout Germany.&lt;ref name="ghi-dc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3073 |title=GHDI – Document – Page |publisher=Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org |date= |accessdate=2017-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424173830/http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3073 |archivedate=2017-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Germany's urbanization and industrialization was focused on the north and west while Germany's south and east retained their predominantly rural character.&lt;ref name="Abrams2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrams |first=Lynn |title=Bismarck and the German Empire: 1871–1918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1eAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |date=24 January 2007 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-22915-4 |pages=13– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424193115/https://books.google.com/books?id=o1eAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |archivedate=24 April 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, two-thirds of the population of both [[East Prussia]] and [[Posen Province]] (in the eastern part of Germany) lived in communities of less than 2,000 people in 1910 while only two-fifths of all Germans did and while only one-fifth of the population in both the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]] (in the western part of Germany) did.&lt;ref name="ghi-dc1"/&gt; Overall, the most robust urbanization in Germany during this time period occurred in the Rhineland, Westphalia, [[Saxony]], and [[Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name="ghi-dc1"/&gt; Similarly, industrial development in Germany during this time focused on the [[Ruhr]], Saxony, and [[Silesia]].&lt;ref name="GannDuignan1977"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gann |first1=Lewis H. |last2=Duignan |first2=Peter |title=The Rulers of German Africa, 1884–1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTisAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |year=1977 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-0938-5 |page=1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424175700/https://books.google.com/books?id=XTisAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |archivedate=2017-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of the total population in these provinces, 47% of Brandenburg's population, 40% of Westphalia's population, and 50% of the Rhineland's population lived in communities of 20,000 people or more in 1910.&lt;ref name="ghi-dc1"/&gt;

[[Image:Voltmeter hg.jpg|thumb|Demonstration voltmeter]]
A '''voltmeter''' is an instrument used for measuring [[electrical potential]] difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an [[analog to digital converter]]. 

A voltmeter in a circuit diagram is represented by the letter ''V'' in a circle. 

Voltmeters are made in a wide range of styles. Instruments permanently mounted in a panel are used to monitor generators or other fixed apparatus. Portable instruments, usually equipped to also measure current and resistance in the form of a [[multimeter]], are standard test instruments used in electrical and electronics work. Any measurement that can be converted to a voltage can be displayed on a meter that is suitably calibrated; for example, pressure, temperature, flow or level in a chemical process plant.

General purpose analog voltmeters may have an accuracy of a few percent of full scale, and are used with voltages from a fraction of a volt to several thousand volts. Digital meters can be made with high accuracy, typically better than 1%. Specially calibrated test instruments have higher accuracies, with laboratory instruments capable of measuring to accuracies of a few parts per million. Meters using [[amplifier]]s can measure tiny voltages of microvolts or less.

Part of the problem of making an accurate voltmeter is that of calibration to check its accuracy. In laboratories, the [[Weston Cell]] is used as a standard voltage for precision work. Precision voltage references are available based on electronic circuits.

==Analog voltmeter==
[[Image:Galvanometer diagram.svg|thumb|A moving coil [[galvanometer]] of the [[d'Arsonval]] type.

A moving coil [[galvanometer]] can be used as a voltmeter by inserting a [[resistor]] in [[series circuit|series]] with the instrument. The galvanometer has a coil of fine wire suspended in a strong magnetic field. When an electric current is applied, the interaction of the magnetic field of the coil and of the stationary magnet creates a torque, tending to make the coil rotate. The torque is proportional to the current through the coil. The coil rotates, compressing a spring that opposes the rotation. The deflection of the coil is thus proportional to the current, which in turn is proportional to the applied voltage, which is indicated by a pointer on a scale. 

One of the design objectives of the instrument is to disturb the circuit as little as possible and so the instrument should draw a minimum of current to operate. This is achieved by using a sensitive galvanometer in series with a high resistance, and then the entire instrument is connected in parallel with the circuit examined.

The sensitivity of such a meter can be expressed as "ohms per volt", the number of ohms resistance in the meter circuit divided by the full scale measured value. For example, a meter with a sensitivity of 1000 ohms per volt would draw 1 milliampere at full scale voltage; if the full scale was 200 volts, the resistance at the instrument's terminals would be {{val|200000}} ohms and at full scale the meter would draw 1 milliampere from the circuit under test. For multi-range instruments, the input resistance varies as the instrument is switched to different ranges.

Moving-coil instruments with a permanent-magnet field respond only to direct current. Measurement of AC voltage requires a [[rectifier]] in the circuit so that the coil deflects in only one direction. Some moving-coil instruments are also made with the zero position in the middle of the scale instead of at one end; these are useful if the voltage reverses its polarity.

Voltmeters operating on the [[Electrostatic voltmeter|electrostatic principle]] use the mutual repulsion between two charged plates to deflect a pointer attached to a spring. Meters of this type draw negligible current but are sensitive to voltages over about 100 volts and work with either alternating or direct current.

== VTVMs and FET-VMs ==
The sensitivity and input resistance of a voltmeter can be increased if the current required to deflect the meter pointer is supplied by an amplifier and power supply instead of by the circuit under test. The electronic amplifier between input and meter gives two benefits; a rugged moving coil instrument can be used, since its sensitivity need not be high, and the input resistance can be made high, reducing the current drawn from the circuit under test. Amplified voltmeters often have an input resistance of 1, 10, or 20 megohms which is independent of the range selected. A once-popular form of this instrument used a vacuum tube in the amplifier circuit and so was called the vacuum tube voltmeter, or VTVM. These were almost always powered by the local AC line current and so were not particularly portable. Today these circuits use a solid-state amplifier using [[field-effect transistor]]s, hence FET-VM, and appear in handheld [[multimeter|digital multimeters]] as well as in bench and laboratory instruments. These are now so ubiquitous that they have largely replaced non-amplified multimeters except in the least expensive price ranges.

Most VTVMs and FET-VMs handle DC voltage, AC voltage, and resistance measurements; modern FET-VMs add current measurements and often other functions as well. A specialized form of the VTVM or FET-VM is the AC voltmeter. These instruments are optimized for measuring AC voltage. They have much wider bandwidth and better sensitivity than a typical multifunction device.

== Digital voltmeter ==
[[Image:Voltmeter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two digital voltmeters. Note the 40 microvolt difference between the two [[measurement]]s, an offset of 34 parts per million.]]

A '''digital voltmeter''' (DVM) measures an unknown input voltage by converting the voltage to a digital value and then displays the voltage in numeric form. DVMs are usually designed around a special type of [[analog-to-digital converter]] called an [[Integrating ADC|integrating converter]].

DVM measurement accuracy is affected by many factors, including temperature, input impedance, and DVM power supply voltage variations. Less expensive DVMs often have input resistance on the order of 10 MΩ. Precision DVMs can have input resistances of 1 GΩ or higher for the lower voltage ranges (e.g. less than 20 V). To ensure that a DVM's accuracy is within the manufacturer's specified tolerances, it must be periodically calibrated against a [[Voltage reference|voltage standard]] such as the [[Weston cell]].

The first digital voltmeter was invented and produced by [[Andrew Kay]] of Non-Linear Systems (and later founder of [[Kaypro]]) in 1954.&lt;ref name="Andrew Kay Obituary by John Markoff "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/business/andrew-kay-pioneer-in-computing-dies-at-95.html | title=Andrew Kay, Pioneer in Computing, Dies at 95 | publisher=New York Times | work=Obituary | date=5 Sep 2014 | accessdate=7 September 2014 | author=Markoff, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1830">'''William Corin''' (13 October 1867- 2 March 1929) was an [[England|English]]-born electrical engineer, who undertook some of the early design of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme|Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electricity Scheme]] in [[Australia]].

He was born in [[Kent]], [[England]] and was educated at [[King's College School]] and [[University College, London]].  He worked as a civil engineer after graduating until 1891 when he became an electrical engineer.  He migrated to [[Tasmania]] in 1895.

In Australia his interest in electrical engineering took off.  He designed the [[Duck Reach Power Station]] and made early surveys for the Great Lakes schemes.  In 1907 he was made Chief Electrical Engineer to the New South Wales Department of Public Works.  He was in charge of the generation of [[thermal electricity]].  In 1915 he commenced writing a series of reports on a Snowy River scheme. In 1920 Corin estimated the cost of the Snowy River scheme at £2 million and that it would produce 1,500GwH of power.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.crawford.anu.edu.au/degrees/pogo/discussion_papers_previous/dp_60.html Snowy Mountain Scheme - How did it manage without an EIA?] &lt;/ref&gt; He worked for both the British and French Governments on projects in Fiji and New Caledonia. Finding working in the Government uncongenial he resigned in 1923 to undertake private consulting.

He died of cancer in Sydney in 1929 and is buried in the Northern Suburbs cemetery.

[[Corin Dam]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] is named after him.

'''Window coverings''' are material used to cover a [[window]] to manage [[sunlight]], to provide additional weatherproofing, to ensure privacy or sometimes security, or for purely decorative purposes.

Window coverings, especially in the American market, are usually on the interior side of windows, but exterior solutions are also available.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Types of coverings include:
*[[Curtain]]s and [[drapes]]
*[[Window blind]]s, including:
**[[Venetian blinds]]: wood, faux wood, vinyl, aluminum
**[[Mini blind]]s
*[[Window shutter]]s, both the more traditional Colonial style and plantation shutters with larger louver sizes
*Window shades, including:
**Roman &amp; folding shades
**Roller shades
**[[Cellular shades]]
*[[Solar screen]]
*Various types of boarding, nailed or screwed to the window casing, can be used as temporary window covering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honeycomb Shades |url=https://www.hunterdouglas.com/window-treatments/cellular-honeycomb-shades/duette |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Z-Push''' (presumably Z is for Zarafa) is a [[Free and open source software|FOSS]] implementation of the [[Exchange ActiveSync|Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync]] protocol which is used to synchronize email, personal contacts and other items between a central server and a mobile device.  Note the difference between this protocol, and an earlier (technologically unrelated) protocol named [[ActiveSync (protocol)|Microsoft ActiveSync]].

Z-Push enables any PHP-based [[groupware]] package to become fully syncable with any ActiveSync-compliant device.

Currently, Z-Push includes four backends: the [[IMAP]] and the [[Maildir]] backend for e-mail synchronization, the [[vCard]] backend for contact synchronization and one for the ''[[Zarafa (software)|Zarafa]]'' package which is sold by allowing full synchronization of E-mail, Calendar, Contacts and Tasks.

There is also a 3rd party project that implements a [[Zimbra]] Backend allowing Z-push to be used with a ZCS server (Including opensource edition).

Since 2.3.0, released in July 2016, significant performance improvements have been achieved, as well as significantly lower memory usage. Connecting to Outlook 2013 and 2016 via EAS is also officially supported. With the optional Kopano Outlook Extension (available only for paid subscribers of Zarafa/Kopano), additional Outlook features are enabled such as Out of Office replies, Notes synchronisation, opening of shared and public folders and synchronisation of the Global Address Book. 

Z-Push is under active development with new releases approximately every month including bug fixes, improvements and new features.

==Technical background &amp; Architecture==
{{Advert|section|date=August 2010}}
The Z-Push protocol is HTTP based, and uses [[WBXML]] (WAP Binary XML) as a communication layer, which is used for bi-directional communication between the PDA/cellular phone and the Server.

Inside the protocol there is everything you expect from a synchronization protocol: the process of sending items from one side to the other, while keeping track of what has already been sent. The Z-Push hides the complexity of handling these protocol requests to the backend developer, who only needs to implement various standard functions, like getting a list of items, and getting the data for a specific item. All that is needed is a good understanding of the WBXML object definitions and fields, and a developer can quite easily get the items of any [[groupware]] solutions onto the PDA/cellular phone.

The Z-Push has various performance and usability-related features; for example, the entire architecture of the project is based on the idea that only one message should ever have to be in memory at one time, even when the server is sending hundreds of messages to a PDA. This may sound easy, but in most XML-based applications, the XML result data is built in-memory before being serialized to the network - exactly the opposite to what Z-Push does, as data is streamed to the client while it is read from the backend. This not only improves already restricted memory usage in [[PHP]], it also makes the progress bar on the client more user-friendly, as data starts arriving as soon as the synchronization request is made. Z-Push has provided a streaming WBXML encoder and decoder to make this happen.

When a backend supports it, Z-Push can also make use of advanced features which bring server load down even lower, for example reading message changes directly from a 'diff' source, instead of comparing all the messages with whatever was in there last time. So if the groupware backend can provide a list of changes on-the-fly, then Z-Push can use this information almost instantaneously. Zarafa provides an incremental synchronization backend for its own MAPI-based solution here through their PHP-MAPI extension, enabling extremely low-load synchronizations.
