The '''Brixton riots''' of 1995 began on 13 December after the death of a black 26-year-old, Wayne Douglas, in police custody. Douglas had allegedly robbed a couple in bed at knifepoint hours earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Independent|date=19 November 1996|title=Man whose death sparked Brixton riot `was robber'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trouble broke out after what had been a peaceful protest outside the Brixton Police Station where the death occurred. With several hundred people involved, the riot resulted in damage to property and vehicles in the area. Police sealed off a three-kilometre (2 mile) area around [[Brixton]] in south [[London]].

The riot lasted for five hours. 22 people were arrested and charged with public order offences, theft and criminal damage. Three police officers were hurt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/13/newsid_2559000/2559341.stm | work=BBC News | title=1995: Riots break out in Brixton | date=1995-12-13 | accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The then-Deputy Prime Minister, [[Michael Heseltine]], condemned the riots and said "efforts to improve Brixton would continue".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DD1739F936A25751C1A963958260 Man's Death Sets Off Riot In London]"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death of Wayne Douglas ==
Wayne Douglas was in police custody to be  questioned about a burglary. Police reported that he collapsed in Brixton Police Station. The police statement said that Douglas died after collapsing while being questioned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Although the post-mortem on Douglas revealed that he had died of heart failure, the inquest into his death showed that he had been held face-down with his hands cuffed behind his back on four different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/142385.stm | work=BBC News | title=New Wayne Douglas inquest ruled out | date=1998-07-30 | accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post-mortem also revealed that Douglas had suffered from heart disease.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== The Riots ==
The picketing of Brixton Police Station over the death of Douglas reportedly developed into a march down [[Brixton Road]] (Brixton High Street). Violence was triggered by a standoff between the police and about 100 demonstrators. Witnesses have reported hearing groups of black youths shouting "Killers, killers" at the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Some eyewitness accounts describe the police presence at the demonstration as "incredibly heavy-handed".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The BBC reported that "hundreds" of black and white youths participated in the riot. Rioters attacked police, ransacked shops and burned cars. According to the police "Officers were wearing protective clothing because we had reports of missiles being thrown." In an attempt to contain the riot around 50 police officers in [[riot gear]] formed lines to close Brixton's main road (Brixton Road), preventing anyone from entering the area. The street had been the scene of rioting in 1981. Police also sealed off a two-mile area around the centre of Brixton and closed [[Brixton tube station|Brixton]] and [[Stockwell tube station|Stockwell]] stations. A police helicopter was dispatched over Brixton. It was reported that shots were fired as the centre of the demonstration moved into the area of the [[Ritzy Cinema]]. It was also reported that a crowd of at least ten rioters pulled a police motorcyclist from his machine.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The Dogstar, [[Coldharbour Lane]] was among the businesses attacked by the rioters. Formerly The Atlantic, a predominantly black pub, and recently refurbished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reggaezine.co.uk/brixtonrenaissance.html A Brixton Renaissance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The riot later developed into what police called "sporadic pockets of trouble in the area around Brixton town centre". The police stated that "We gave them every opportunity to move off peacefully but they hadn't done so."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

One police officer suffered a broken shoulder, fractured ribs and bruising during the riots. He praised the [[Territorial Support Group]] for protecting him from rioters after he was knocked off his motorbike and beaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/injured-pcs-life-was-in-the-lap-of-the-gods-1525747.html|title= Injured PC's life was 'in the lap of the gods' |date=15 December 1995|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2009-11-08 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that local residents were outraged by the death of a black man in police custody and saw the riots as expression of alienation in an impoverished area devastated by race riots in 1981.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; It quotes Harold Douglas, 39, as saying: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Last night happened because the only time a black man is seen and listened to is when he comes out on the street...They cause a million pounds of damage and then people start taking notice.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a news conference at the time, Metropolitan Police Commissioner [[Paul Condon]] is quoted to have said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was not Brixton rioting last night. It was a small minority of thugs and criminals who, as ever, were looking for the opportunity to embark on criminal activities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A local resident at the time stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Local people are not only pissed off with the death of Wayne Douglas but the whole gentrification of Brixton. Council houses and houses occupied by [[Squatting|squat]]ters are being sold off and local pubs like the Atlantic, traditionally run by black people, was opened last week by yuppies as 'The Dog Star'. In anger this was smashed, looted and burnt out. The £33 million City Challenge development including [[CCTV]] is only of benefit to big business not local stallholders.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news53.htm SchNEWS 53 - 15th December 1995 - Baylon's Burning - black deaths in custody - direct action conference - In defence of the Criminal Justice Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709025442/http://www.schnews.org.uk/archive/news53.htm |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

SchNews quoted another local resident, identified as 'Joyce', as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People were putting up barricades. There were hundreds of people involved, mostly young black and white people and they were local, they weren't outsiders. This was a combination of black people dying in police custody and the way Brixton is at the moment. The place is being yuppified with City Challenge while unemployed centres, adventure playgrounds and libraries are getting shut.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]].&lt;/ref&gt;), a [[Shafi‘i]] [[Muhaddith]] and [[Historiography of early Islam|historian of Islam]].

==Biography==
Al-Dhahabi was born in [[Damascus]] on 5 October 1274. His family was of [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] descent, originally lived in Mayyafariqin, northeast of [[Diyar Bakr|Diyar bakr]]. At some point, they moved to Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2016|title=al- Dhahabī|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]|publisher=Brill Publishers|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/al-dhahabi-COM_25995|last=Bori|first=Caterina|date=|editor-last=Fleet|editor-first=Kate|edition=3rd|page=73|isbn=9789004305748|editor2-last=Krämer|editor2-first=Gudrun|editor3-last=Matringe|editor3-first=Denis|editor4-last=Nawas|editor4-first=John|editor5-last=Rowson|editor5-first=Everett}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes identified himself as Ibn al-Dhahabi (son of the goldsmith) in reference to his father's profession. He began his study of [[hadith]] at age eighteen, travelling from Damascus to [[Baalbek]], [[Homs]], [[Hama]], [[Aleppo]], [[Nabulus]], [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Hijaz]], and elsewhere, after which he returned to Damascus, where he taught and authored many works and achieved wide renown as a perspicuous critic and expert examiner of the hadith, encyclopedic historian and biographer, and foremost authority in the canonical readings of the [[Qur'an]]. He studied under more than 100 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.al-athariyyah.com/media/pdf/sisters/female_teachers.pdf |title=The Female Teachers of the Historian of Islam: al-Ḏh̲ahabī}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most important teacher at Baalbek included a woman, [[Zaynab bint ʿUmar b. al-Kindī]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-dhahabi-COM_0159 |title=" al-Ḏh̲ahabī." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online , 2012. Reference. Princeton University Library. 09 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his sight two years before he died, leaving three children: his eldest daughter Amat al-`Aziz and his two sons `Abd Allah and Abu Hurayra `Abd al-Rahman. The latter taught the hadith masters Ibn Nasir-ud-din al-Damishqi&lt;ref&gt;al-Sakhawi, ''al-Daw' al-Lami''` (8:103).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], to whom he transmitted several works authored or narrated by his father.

==Teachers==
Among al-Dhahabi's most notable teachers in [[hadith]], [[fiqh]] and [[aqida]]:
* Abd al-Khaliq bin ʿUlwān
* [[Zaynab bint ʿUmar b. al-Kindī|Zaynab bint ʿUmar bin al-Kindī]]
* Abu al-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Mas‘ud ibn Nafis al-Musali
* [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] Taqi ad-Din Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah
* Ibn al-Zahiri, Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn `Abd Allah al-Halabi
* Sharaf-ud-din Abd al-Mu'min ibn Khalaf al-Dimyati, the foremost Egyptian authority on hadith in his time
* Shaykh al-Islam [[Ibn Daqiq al-'Id]], whom he identified in his youth as Abu al-Fath al-Qushayri, later as Ibn Wahb.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''al-`Uluw'' (Abu al-Fath) and ''al-Muqiza'' (Ibn Wahb).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jamal-ud-din Abu al-Ma`ali Muhammad ibn `Ali al-Ansari al-Zamalkani al-Damishqi al-Shafi`i (d. 727), whom he called "Qadi al-Qudat, the Paragon of Islam, the standard-bearer of the Sunna, my shaykh".
* Ahmad ibn Ishaq ibn Muhammad al-Abarquhi al-Misri (d. 701), from which al-Dhahabi received the Suhrawardi Sufi path.&lt;ref&gt;''Siyar A`lam al-Nubala'' [SAN] (17:118–119 #6084, 16:300–302 #5655).

==Works==
Dhahabi authored nearly a hundred works, some of them of considerable size. His work regarding the practice of prophetic medicine was straightforward in its presentation, but also categorized by the author as alternative medicine. Much of it consisted of an integration of medicine as understood from the revelations of the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]] and the practices of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] with [[Ancient Greek medicine]], quoting heavily from the ideas and terminologies of [[Hippocrates]] and [[Ibn Sina]].&lt;ref&gt;Emilie Savage-Smith, "Medicine."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14723">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Alabama'' Claims}}
[[File:CSSAlabama.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Painting of the CSS ''Alabama''&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''''Alabama'' Claims''' were a series of demands for damages sought by the [[federal government of the United States|government of the United States]] from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1869, for the attacks upon [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] merchant ships by [[Confederate States Navy|Confederate Navy]] commerce raiders built in British shipyards during the [[American Civil War]]. The claims focused chiefly on the most famous of these raiders, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, which took more than sixty prizes before she was [[Battle of Cherbourg (1864)|sunk off the French coast]] in 1864.

After [[international arbitration]] endorsed the American position in 1872, Britain settled the matter by paying the United States $15.5 million, ending the dispute and leading to a treaty that restored friendly relations between Britain and the United States. That international arbitration established a precedent, and the case aroused interest in codifying [[public international law]].

==British political involvement==
{{main|Britain and the American Civil War}}
The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] failed to stop the ''Alabama'' from putting to sea from the [[shipyards]] of [[John Laird Sons and Company]] in [[Birkenhead]]. The United States Legation in London had explicitly opposed this, and the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American Minister]] to Britain, [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]], charged that the ship was bound for the Confederacy, where it would be used against the United States.

Though both the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary were thought to favor the Confederacy at the time of ''Alabama''{{'s}} construction, British public opinion was divided on the issue, and MPs such as [[Richard Cobden]] campaigned against it. The subsequent departure of the ''Alabama'' proved to be publicly embarrassing, and Palmerston and Russell were later forced to admit that the ship should not have been allowed to depart. The Government had requested advice from the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Sir Alexander Cockburn]], who ruled that her release did not violate Britain's neutrality, because she was not outfitted with guns at the time that they left British ports.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard. ''The Foreign Enlistment Act- Question'', 27 March 1863. http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1863/mar/27/united-states-the-foreign-enlistment-act&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next year, Britain detained two [[ironclad]] warships constructed in [[Birkenhead]] and destined for the Confederacy. As a result of the uproar over the ''Alabama'', Palmerston instructed the [[British Admiralty]] to tender an offer for the purchase of the ships. They had been bought by a go-between, Monsieur Bravay of [[Paris]] (who had ordered their construction as intermediary for Confederate principals).

==The claims==
In what was called the ''Alabama'' Claims, in 1869 the United States claimed direct and collateral damage against Great Britain. In the particular case of the ''Alabama'', the United States claimed that Britain had violated neutrality by allowing five warships to be constructed, especially the ''Alabama'', knowing that it would eventually enter into naval service with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].

Other particulars included the following: In the summer of 1862, the British-built steam warship ''Oreto'', later renamed the [[CSS Florida (cruiser)|CSS ''Florida'']], was delivered to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]] with the secret understanding that it would be later transferred to the [[Confederate States Navy]]. British [[Royal Navy]] Admiral [[George Watson (Royal Navy officer)|George Willes Watson]] (1827–1897) aided the transfer, and Watson's actions were reviewed by the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth M.. Startup, "'This Small Act of Courtesy:' Admiral Sir George Willes Watson, Trouble, Trials, and Turmoil in Bahama Waters," ''Journal of the Bahamas Historical Society'', October 2009, Vol. 31, pp 57-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Other warships included the {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}} (built at [[Alexander Stephen and Sons]] in Glasgow), {{ship|CSS|Lark}} (built at John Laird and Sons, like the ''Alabama''), and {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}} (built at [[J &amp; W Dudgeon]] in London).

===Payment===
Senator [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]], the chairman of the U.S. [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], originally wanted to ask for $2 billion in damages, or alternatively, the ceding of [[Canada]] to the United States. When American Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in "[[Manifest Destiny]]", primarily for its commercial advantages to the United States. Seward expected the West Coast Province of [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the United States and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other U.S. politicians endorsed annexation, with the goal of annexing British Columbia, the central Canadian [[Red River Colony]] (later [[Manitoba]]), and eastern [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for  dropping the damage claims.

The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for several reasons: London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute in cash, the [[Dominion of Canada]] offered to have British Columbia enter the Canadian Confederation on very generous terms, which bolstered nationalist sentiment in British Columbia that already favored fealty to the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion after the long years, expenses and losses of the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Doris W. Dashew, "The Story of an Illusion: The Plan to Trade ''Alabama'' Claims for Canada," ''Civil War History'', December 1969, Vol. 15 Issue 4, pp 332-348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David E. Shi, "Seward'S Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865–1869," ''Pacific Historical Review'', May 1978, Vol. 47 Issue 2, pp 217-238&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treaty of Washington===
{{further|Treaty of Washington (1871)|Hamilton Fish|Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant}}

In 1871, [[Hamilton Fish]], President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s Secretary of State, worked out an agreement with British representative [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rose]] to create a commission in Washington comprising six members from the British Empire and six members from the United States. Its assignment was to resolve the ''Alabama'' claims, refinancing, and other international disputes between Canada and the United States by treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jean Edward (2001). ''Grant''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks. {{ISBN|0-684-84927-5}}. pp. 510, 511.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 1871, the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] was signed at the State Department and the U.S.  Senate ratified the treaty on May 24, 1871.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), 512-514&lt;/ref&gt; In accord with the treaty, an international [[arbitration]] tribunal met in Geneva. The treaty included the settlement process for the ''Alabama'' Claims, settled disputed Atlantic fisheries and the [[San Juan Boundary Dispute|San Juan Boundary]] (concerning the [[Oregon]] boundary line). Britain and the United States became perpetual allies after the treaty, with Britain having expressed regret over the ''Alabama'' damages.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2001), 512-515&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tribunal==
The tribunal was composed of representatives:
*Britain: [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Sir Alexander Cockburn]]
*United States: [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]], with [[William Maxwell Evarts]] serving as counsel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=E000262|title=EVARTS, William Maxwell - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Italy]]: [[Federico Sclopis]]
*[[Switzerland]]: [[Jakob Stämpfli]]
*[[Brazil]]: [[Marcos Antônio de Araújo, 2nd Baron of Itajubá]].

Negotiations had taken place in [[Suitland, Maryland]], at the estate of businessman [[Samuel Taylor Suit]]. The tribunal session was held in a reception room of the Town Hall in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. This has been named {{lang|fr|salle de l'Alabama}}.

The final award of $15,500,000 formed part of the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] and was paid out by Great Britain in 1872. This was balanced against damages of $1,929,819 paid by the United States to Great Britain for illegal Union blockade practices and ceded fishing privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bailey, A Diplomatic History of the American People, NY (1958), 6th ed., pp. 388-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
This established the principle of international [[arbitration]], and launched a movement to codify [[public international law]] with hopes for finding peaceful solutions to international disputes. The arbitration of the ''Alabama'' claims was a precursor to the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]], the [[League of Nations]], the [[World Court]], and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Cook (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Union]] carefully studied the ''Alabama'' claims when assessing whether it could claim damages in response to [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=20028203 |page=139 |title=Russia after Genoa and the Hague}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vladimir Nabokov]], the core incident has a legacy in literary reference, being used as a plot device in ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In one early passage, Stiva Oblonsky has a dream that may show his having read of the Alabama Claims through the ''Kölnische Zeitung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author=Nabokov, Vladimir | authorlink= Vladimir Nabokov| title=Lectures on Russian Literature | publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich | year=1981 | page= 132| isbn= 0151495998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Jules Verne]] novel ''Around the World in Eighty Days'' Inspector Fix warns Phileas Fogg that the riot they encounter in San Francisco may be connected to the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author=Verne, Jules | authorlink= Jules Verne| title=Around the World in Eighty Days| publisher=| year=1872 | page= | isbn= }}{{page needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alice Auma Lakwena Behrend.jpg|thumb|200px|Book cover with photo]]

'''Alice Auma''' (1956 – 17 January 2007) was an [[Acholi people|Acholi]] spirit-medium who, as the head of the [[Holy Spirit Movement]] (HSM), led a [[Millennialism|millennial]] rebellion against the Ugandan government forces of President [[Yoweri Museveni]] from August 1986 until November 1987. The primary [[spirit]] she purportedly channelled was that of a dead army officer called "Lakwena", meaning messenger, which the Acholi believe to be a manifestation of the Christian [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite journal | volume=98 | issue=390 | author=Ruddy Doom and Koen Vlassenroot | year=1999 | publisher=Oxford Journals / Royal African Society | title=Kony's message: A new Koine? The Lord's Resistance Army in northern Uganda | pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined persona of Alice Auma channelling the spirit Lakwena is often referred to as "Alice Lakwena".

==Biography==
Auma was born in 1956. Remaining childless after two marriages, she moved away from her hometown. She eventually converted to Christianity but, on 25 May 1985, she reportedly went insane, unable to either hear or speak, later claiming to have been possessed by the spirit Lakwena. Her father took her to eleven different witches, but none alleviated her condition. Alice claimed Lakwena then guided her to [[Paraa National Park]], where she disappeared for 40 days and returned a spirit-medium, a traditional ethnic religious role.

Before the defeat of [[Tito Okello]], Auma was one of many spirit-mediums working near the town of [[Gulu]] as a minor [[oracle]] and spiritual healer. She worked in the midst of the chaos of the anti-[[National Resistance Army]] (NRA) insurgency of the [[Uganda People's Democratic Army]] and the increasingly brutal counterinsurgency of the NRA. Legend in the later movement holds that on 6 August 1986, Lakwena ordered Auma to stop her work as a diviner and healer, which was pointless in the midst of war, and create a [[Holy Spirit Movement]] (HSM) to fight evil and end the bloodshed. This divine mission required the retaking of the capital of [[Kampala]]. Thus the Acholi would redeem themselves from the violence they had collectively imposed on the civilians of the [[Luwero triangle]], and would initiate a paradise on earth. A letter to local missionaries explained the transition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The good Lord who had sent the Lakwena decided to change his work from that of a doctor to that of a military commander for one simple reason: it is useless to cure a man today only that he be killed the next.  So it became an obligation on his part to stop the bloodshed before continuing his work as a doctor.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Auma claimed that Lakwena required that she be possessed by numerous other spirits to achieve its goals. This was unusual in Acholi spirit-behavior. 

{{LRA}}At this time, there was a perceived spiritual crisis in the area coinciding with the threat posed by occupying southern forces. The increased level of societal tension and number of deaths were attributed to witchcraft. Moreover, many soldiers fleeing back into Acholi after their defeat at Kampala refused traditional purification ceremonies. These rituals were believed to protect the community from the [[vengeful spirit]]s of the people the soldiers had killed, but the elders found that they no longer had the authority to force compliance with the convention.

After a series of spectacular victories, Auma led the Holy Spirit Movement (HSM) south out of [[Acholiland]] towards Kampala. There, she garnered much support from other ethnic groups that had grievances with the Museveni government. However, subsequent military setbacks suffered by the HSM prompted some followers to accuse Auma of being a witch and of using spirits for destructive ends. As the HSM suffered its final defeat under [[artillery]] fire in the forests near Kampala, Auma fled and claimed Lakwena had left her.

Auma lived in the Ifo [[refugee]] camp near [[Dadaab]] in northern [[Kenya]] for the remainder of her life, and claimed to have been abandoned by the spirits. In November 2004, she was implicated in child trafficking from Gulu to the refugee camp. In 2006, she claimed to have discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS. Auma died on 17 January 2007, after having been sick for about a week with an unknown illness claimed to be HIV/AIDS.

Alice is believed to be the cousin of [[Joseph Kony]], the leader of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]].

==The Tale of Paraa==

Although Auma's practice as a medium immediately after returning to Gulu was not particularly successful, the tale of Paraa became the central text of the HSM. In particular Lakwena's discourse that the [[insurgency]] was a rebellion of nature deserves explication. According to the story, Lakwena first held court with all the animals of the park to explore the theme of the ongoing war in the south and the destruction of the environment by warring parties:&lt;blockquote&gt;Lakwena said to the animals: "You animals, God sent me to ask you whether you bear responsibility for the bloodshed in Uganda." The animals denied blame, and the [[African Buffalo|buffalo]] displayed a wound on his leg, and the [[hippopotamus]] displayed a wound on his arm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lakwena then questioned the water about the war:&lt;blockquote&gt;Lakwena said to the waterfall: "Water, I am coming to ask you about the [[sin]]s and bloodshed in this world." And the water said: "The people with two legs kill their brothers and throw their bodies into the water." The spirit asked the water what it did with the [[sin]]ners, and the water said: "I fight against the sinners, for they are the ones to blame for the bloodshed. Go and fight against the sinners, because they throw their brothers into the water."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Acholiland, Uganda.png|thumb|200px|[[Acholiland]]]]

After briefly returning home, Lakwena led Auma to [[Mount Kilak]] to deal with the issue of witchcraft. The mountain greeted their arrival with large explosions&lt;blockquote&gt;The spirit Lakwena said to the mountain or to the rock: "God has sent me to find out why there is theft in the world." The mountain answered: "I have gone nowhere and have stolen no one’s children. But people come here to me and name the names of those whom I should kill [by casting spells]. Some ask me for medicine [to bewitch]. This is the sin of the people. I want to give you water to heal diseases. But you must fight against the sinners."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the climax to the story, God himself specifies who is to blame for all of the suffering and bloodshed:&lt;blockquote&gt;God said that there was a tribe in Uganda that was hated everywhere. This tribe was the Acholi. And God ordered that a lamb be offered, so that they should repent their sins and to put an end to the bloodshed in Acholi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10806">'''Andreas Maislinger''' (born 26 February 1955 in [[Sankt Georgen bei Salzburg|St. Georgen]] near [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]) is an Austrian historian and [[wiktionary:Founder|founder]] of the [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]] and [[Braunau Contemporary History Days]].

== Studying and learning ==
Maislinger studied law and [[political science]] in Salzburg and political science and eastern-European history in [[Vienna]], with study visits in, amongst others, [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Innsbruck]]. During his studies in Salzburg, Maislinger advocated for Austrian participation in the [[International Youth Meeting Center in Oświęcim/Auschwitz]]; Austrian president [[Rudolf Kirchschläger]] declined.&lt;ref name=Maislinger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maislinger |first=Andreas |url=http://www.auslandsdienst.at/de/projekt/pressearchiv-1979-1990/internationale-jugendbegegnungsst%C3%A4tte-auschwitz-kritisches |title=Internationale Jugendbegegnungsstätte Auschwitz |journal=Kritisches Christentum |volume=33 |date=December 1979 |language=German |trans-title=The International Youth Meeting Center in Auschwitz |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220537/http://www.auslandsdienst.at/de/projekt/pressearchiv-1979-1990/internationale-jugendbegegnungsst%C3%A4tte-auschwitz-kritisches |archivedate=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchschläger later acknowledged the value of Maislinger's proposal of [[civilian service]] for reconciliation and atonement related to the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auslandsdienst.at/archiv/1995/950203.htm |title=Brief von Dr. Rudolf Kirchschläger an Dr. Andreas Maislinger, Wien 3.

In 1980 he received his doctorate for a dissertation on the problems of Austrian defence policy. He subsequently held posts at the Institute for Political Science at the [[University of Innsbruck]], the University of [[New Orleans]] as visiting assistant professor, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] for a research visit, and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

In 1982 he co-founded the [[working group]] of independent [[peace]] initiatives of Austria and in 1986 he became a member of the founding committee of the [[Austria]]n-[[Israel]]i society [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]]. Until 1996, he published columns in the "Jüdische Rundschau" (Jewish Review).

== Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service ==
Together with [[Andreas Hörtnagl]], Maislinger founded the [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]] (AHMS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austrianinformation.org/winter-2009/austrian-holocaust-memorial-service.html Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service] (austrianinformation.org)&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully pleaded for the legal establishment of this kind of alternative to mandatory military service, aiming at promoting education and raising awareness about the [[Holocaust]].

On [[Invasion of Poland|September 1]], 1992 the first young Austrian started his AHMS at the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum|Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. Since then more the 500 AHMS representatives worked in 23 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/palomafriedman/docs/p_friedman_new_righteous The New Righteous: Austrian youth serve the memory of the Holocaust abroad] (Paloma Friedman)&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent supporters of this program include [[Simon Wiesenthal]], [[Teddy Kollek]], [[Ari Rath]] and [[Gerhard Röthler]].

1998 he founded the [[Austrian Service Abroad]] with Andreas Hörtnagl and in 2001 [[Michael Prochazka]] became the second vice-chairman.

In October and November 2009 Andreas Maislinger made a 3-week lecturing and promoting tour through Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2009/10/30/maislinger-austrian-service-holocaust/ Austrian political scientist Andreas Maislinger talks about Austria’s role] (The Harvard Crimson)&lt;/ref&gt;

== House of Responsibility (HRB) ==

As a reaction to the participation of the [[FPÖ]] (Austrian Freedom Party) in the Austrian federal government in 2000, Maislinger suggested that the city of [[Braunau am Inn]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auslandsdienst.at/press/archive/latimes_13.1.2001.htm Austrian Town of Hitler's Birth Aims to Transform 'the Burden'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531200722/http://www.auslandsdienst.at/press/archive/latimes_13.1.2001.htm |date=2011-05-31 }}, Paul Watson, [[Los Angeles Times]] (13 January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; should establish a "[[House of Responsibility]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://root.riskommunal.net/gemeinde/braunau/gemeindeamt/html/zhous1.htm History as responsibility - House of Responsibility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103100403/http://root.riskommunal.net/gemeinde/braunau/gemeindeamt/html/zhous1.htm |date=2004-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the birth house of [[Adolf Hitler]].

== Further activities ==

Since 1992, Maislinger has served as the scientific director of the annual [[Braunau Contemporary History Days]] in Braunau am Inn.

He also participates actively in projects promoting [[gifted|gifted children]].

Since 2003 he is in charge of the Georg Rendl Symposion. He had founded the symposium to familiarise people with the life and works of the painter and author Georg Rendl, whom Maislinger had already met as a child in his hometown St. Georgen/Salzburg.

In 2006 he initiated the [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Award]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjss.org.cn/200610182.htm Professor Pan Guang received Austrian Holocaust Memorial Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104130945/http://www.cjss.org.cn/200610182.htm |date=2011-01-04 }} (cjss.org.cn)&lt;/ref&gt; rewarding people who actively contribute to the remembrance of the Holocaust.

==Awards==

In 2005 Maislinger received the [[Decoration of Honour in Silver for Services to the Republic of Austria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question | language = German | page=1684 |trans-title=| format = pdf | accessdate = 20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the president of Austria, [[Heinz Fischer]], and the Medal of Merit of the state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]] from [[Herwig van Staa]] and [[Luis Durnwalder]].

On 8 November 2009 Andreas Maislinger was awarded with a Lifetime Achievement Award for "''his 10 year fight to obtain official recognition of alternative, philanthropic service''" at the Annual Dinner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lamoth.org/news--events/news/detail/7/ L.A.

In [[historical reenactment]], '''authenticity''' (sometimes referred to as the '''A-factor''' or simply '''A''') is a measure of how close an item, prop, action, weapon, or custom is to what would actually have been used or done in the time period being depicted.

For example, in most northern European [[medieval reenactment]] cotton is an ''inauthentic'' material&amp;mdash;as opposed to wool or linen&amp;mdash;though it would be ''authentic'' in more modern periods and events, such as [[American Civil War reenactment]] or [[World War II reenactment]]. Likewise, [[popular culture|pop culture]] references and talking about modern events or objects (e.g., [[wrist watch]]es, [[mobile phone]]s, or President [[Donald Trump]]) is inauthentic.

Generally, the ratio of events and groups enforcing strict authenticity to those permitting (limited) inauthenticity among the participating reenactors is estimated to be half-half, i.e., there are approximately as many groups enforcing historical accuracy as there are permitting a more liberal use of the term "authentic". This does, however, vary from country to country.

==Degrees==
In the US, reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into three categories, based on the level of concern for authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/revwar/reenactors |title=Reenactors in the Parks: A Study of External Revolutionary War Reenactment Activity at National Parks |accessdate=2008-07-28 |author=Stanton, Cathy |date=1999-11-01 |format=PDF |publisher=National Park Service |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Farbs ===
	 
Some, called "[[Farb (reenactment)|Farb]]s" or "polyester soldiers"&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, Robert Lee. "Reliving the Civil War: A reenactor's handbook". Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books, 1999. p 209 and p 219&lt;/ref&gt; are reenactors who spend relatively little of their time or money maintaining authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or even period behavior. The 'Good Enough' attitude is pervasive among farbs, although even casual observers may be able to point out flaws. 
	 
The origin of the word "farb" (and the derivative adjective "farby") is unknown, though it appears to date to early centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 8 ''Ross M. Kimmel states that it was used at the Manassas reenactment in 1961...George Gorman and his 2nd North Carolina picked up the term at the First Manassas Reenactment in 1961 and enjoyed using it constantly with condescension and sarcasm directed toward other units.''&lt;/ref&gt; Some think that the origin of the word is a truncated version of "Far be it from authentic."{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} An alternative definition is "Far Be it for me to question/criticise",&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wesclark.com/jw/forigin.html]&lt;/ref&gt; or "Fast And Researchless Buying".&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 8 ''Juanita Leisch calls it "Fast And Researchless Buying," and other sources insist it came from the Bicentennial and Revolutionary War groups and means "Fairly Authentic Royal British."''&lt;/ref&gt; Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German ''Farbe'', color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined,&lt;ref name="Hadden p8"&gt;Hadden p8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-far1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; or the German ''farbische'', manufactured, indicating obviously modern items.&lt;ref name="Hadden p8"/&gt; According to Mr. Burton K. Kummerow, a member of "The Black Hats, CSA" reenactment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden, p 219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mainstream===
Another group of reenactors often is called "Mainstream." These reenactors are somewhere between [[Farb (reenactment)|farb]] and authentic. They are more common than either [[Farb (reenactment)|farb]]s or authentics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Most mainstream reenactors make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the time-period, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items, such as air mattresses and sleeping bags, are sometimes used "after hours" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Progressive===
[[File:The Liberty Guards Mess a group of hardcore reenactors, this is a tintype of their Shermans bummers portrayl.jpg|thumb|The Liberty Guards Mess, a group of hardcore reenactors, in a Sherman's bummers portrayal.]]
At the other extreme from farbs are "hard-core authentics" or "progressives," as they prefer to be called,&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 138&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes derisively called "stitch counters"&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 224&lt;/ref&gt; Hard-cores generally seek an "immersive" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of their chosen time period might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event.&lt;ref&gt;Hadden p 138 "Like soldiers of the Civil War, progressives experience the same poor conditions that the original soldiers did, camping without tents and sleeping out exposed to the cold and rain. They spend weekends eating bad and insufficient food, and they practice a steady regimen of work, marching, and drill. They suffer the cold, carrying insufficient clothing and blankets as well as sleeping campaign-style by spooning with each other for warmth."&lt;/ref&gt;
			
Hard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate "reenactorisms".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

== The historical persona ==
To make their equipment authentic, a reenactor must first decide on the time period, geographic location, and social status they wish to portray. The collection of clothing and equipment is typically called a "kit" and the fictional alter ego is called a "persona".

Sometimes when a person has interests that a single persona can't reasonably encompass, for the sake of being authentic, they might create more than one persona. For example, someone might be interested in [[Norsemen|Norse]] ("Viking") cultures but also be interested in economics and social history that led to the [[Landsknecht]], might create two separate personae and kits. They can then choose the persona they will portray according to which hobby they want to do, the location of the reenactment, or the weather (cultures that wore a lot of [[wool]] and [[fur]] are more popular to reenact in winter than summer).

== The quest for authenticity ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J0628-0006-001, Interessengemeinschaft Mandan-Indianer.jpg|thumb|Interessengemeinschaft Mandan-Indianer Leipzig 1970, reenactment of Native Americans  was quite popular in communist Eastern Germany]]

Since authenticity of certain equipment vary between periods and regions, it can be difficult to ensure an entire set or ''kit'' of clothing and gear is authentic for a particular historical persona.  Most organized societies have recognized norms for kit and garb for their historic and regional specialty.  A key philosophy is to research items in advance, vs. buying things and then trying to "fit them in" to the time and place being reenacted.  For example, the Vikings are not known to have used plate armour, but some would try to justify it because the earlier Roman Army did.  Or a person might try to pass off an interesting Polish hat by claiming their French persona had traveled to Poland.  Such tactics serve to confuse an uneducated audience, however, since many will simply assume that if everyone is portraying Vikings, French pikemen, Prussians grenadiers, etc. that they are also wearing and using items common to that era and people.

Authenticity can apply to other things. For example, a card game, song, or military tactic is authentic if known to be popular during the period.

The quest for authentic clothes and equipment often requires archaeological evidence and other historical sources that reveal what was used at the time. A reenactor may become a scholar of history in pursuit of an accurate persona.  Many time-periods now have on-line discussion boards where reenactors and historians argue the merits of various items, how to make them, or where to purchase them.

Several factors commonly limit the attainable level of authenticity. These include:

* Safety considerations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/historical_reenactment/58426/1 |title=Safety - Is it more important than Authenticity? |publisher=Suite101.com |accessdate=2009-05-05 |date=2001-01-26 |last=McConnell enchz |first=Megan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724204016/http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/historical_reenactment/58426/1 |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Climate/weather
* Available information
* Cost in money and/or time

The specific German approach of Authenticity (reenactment) is less about replaying a certain event, but to allow an immersion in a certain [[era]]. Historic city festivals and events are quite important to build up local communities and contribute to the self-image of municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Benita Luckmann: Bretten, Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt. Enke, Stuttgart 1970, {{ISBN|3-432-01618-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Events in monuments or on historical sites are less about the events related to them but as mere [[staffage]] for the immersion experience.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Petzet: "ln the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enforcement ==
The strictness with which authenticity is enforced varies widely with different events and groups. While some consider only documented historical use to be authentic, and ban all inauthentic gear and behaviour from reenactment activities, others permit materials that plausibly could have existed, others permit inauthentic materials that can't be seen by the public, and still others only require that "it has to look authentic from 10 meters away" (i.e. from a distant audience's perspective).

Similarly, many groups permit equipment combined from a wider range of centuries than what could be considered historically accurate (e.g. 12th century soldiers wearing [[barbute]] helmets). This sometimes results from safety rules that require protective gauntlets and helmets, even when this interferes with historical accuracy.

In addition to mixing multiple centuries of a general period in a single event (usually to ensure a larger number of participants), some events feature more than a single period, especially if the event strongly focuses on combat displays or battles. In such cases, it is not unusual that the same reenactor participates in more than one show, sometimes with only slightly altered gear (depending on how strictly authenticity is enforced).
A typical example is a ''clankie'' (a reenactor in full plate armour) removing his armour, picking up a [[round shield]] and participating in a Dark Age battle.

Many groups, especially in medieval reenactment, heavily promote the use of "market speech", i.e., talking in a way that ''sounds'' appropriate for the period. Inauthentic equipment and behaviour is often referred to via descriptive phrases like "pocket dragon" (for a lighter or box of matches) and "horseless carriage" (for a car or other engine-powered vehicle) to circumvent strict enforcement of authentic speech. Other groups expect reenactors to stay fully in-character throughout an event, and refrain from commenting on non-period items. To adequately explain activities to an audience, many such groups designate one or two people as "interpreters" who can step out of character to discuss things from a modern perspective.

Other ways to circumvent the need for authentic equipment include "hiding" plastic bottles (usually by wrapping them in cloths or furs), using "bindings" (long straps of cloth or fur) to make inauthentic footgear look more adequate, or simply hiding coolboxes inside wooden chests.

For safety and comfort, authenticity is usually restricted to designated public areas, thus allowing for the use of [[portaloo|portable toilet]]s and inauthentic tenting by reenactors outside these areas.

A typical issue among strictly authentic reenactors is the inclusion of female combatants, as this is a clash between authenticity (there were no female combatants in most reenacted periods) and modern concepts of sexual equality.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the discussions by American Civil War reenactors at [http://thesewingacademy.org/index.php?topic=1677.msg31109#msg31109] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027005836/http://geocities.com/womansoldier/].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly some groups enforce authentic hairstyles (e.g., 20th century soldiers are usually not expected to wear long hair or beards) and often (inauthentic) jewelry is not permitted—although in combat reenactment this is often more of a safety issue than a question of authenticity.

'''Bloody Sunday''' – sometimes called the '''Bogside Massacre'''&lt;ref name="McCann" /&gt; – was an incident on 30 January 1972 in the [[Bogside]] area of [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], when [[British Army|British soldiers]] shot 28 unarmed civilians during a [[peaceful protest]] march against [[Operation Demetrius|internment]]. Fourteen people died: thirteen were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by [[rubber bullet]]s or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/deadinj.htm 'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30 January 1972 – Names of the Dead and Injured].

Retrieved 16 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The march had been organised by the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]], also known as "1 Para".&lt;ref name="WIDGERY" /&gt;

Two investigations have been held by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. The [[Widgery Tribunal]], held in the immediate aftermath of the incident, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. It described the soldiers' shooting as "bordering on the reckless", but accepted their claims that they shot at gunmen and bomb-throwers. The report was widely criticised as a "[[whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = More 'butcher' than 'grocer' | author = David Granville | url = http://www.irishdemocrat.co.uk/features/more-butcher-than-grocer/ | publisher = [[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Morning Star]] | date = 28 July 2005 | accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Schooled in scandal | author = Nick Cohen | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/kelly/comment/0,,1136486,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 1 February 2004 | accessdate =18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1972: 'Bloody Sunday' report excuses Army | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |publisher=BBC News | date = 19 April 1972| accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saville Inquiry]], chaired by [[Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate|Lord Saville of Newdigate]], was established in 1998 to reinvestigate the incident. Following a 12-year inquiry, Saville's report was made public in 2010 and concluded that the killings were both "unjustified" and "unjustifiable". It found that all of those shot were unarmed, that none was posing a serious threat, that no bombs were thrown, and that soldiers "knowingly put forward false accounts" to justify their firing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-inquiry-key-findings |title=Bloody Sunday inquiry: key findings |publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/10/bloody-sunday-inquiry-northern-ireland|title=Bloody Sunday killings to be ruled unlawful|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=10 June 2010|accessdate=12 June 2010 | first1=Henry | last1=McDonald | first2=Richard | last2=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the publication of the report, British prime minister [[David Cameron]] made a formal apology on behalf of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10320609 |title=Bloody Sunday report published |publisher=BBC|date=15 June 2010|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, police began a murder investigation into the killings.

Bloody Sunday was one of the most significant events of "[[the Troubles]]" because a large number of civilians were killed, by forces of the state, in full view of the public and the press.&lt;ref name="McCann"&gt;{{cite book | author=Eamonn McCann| title=The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – The Families Speak Out | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-7453-2510-6}} pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; It was the highest number of people killed in a single shooting incident during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/majinc.htm Significant Violent Incidents During the Conflict]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody Sunday increased [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] hostility towards the British Army and exacerbated the conflict. Support for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) rose and there was a surge of recruitment into the organisation, especially locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000|isbn=1-84115-316-8}} P. 293: "Youngsters who had seen their friends die that day flocked to join the IRA…"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|The Troubles}}
The City of Derry was perceived by many Catholics and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in Northern Ireland to be the epitome of what was described as "fifty years of Unionist misrule": despite having a nationalist majority, [[gerrymandering]] ensured elections to the City Corporation always returned a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] majority. At the same time the city was perceived to be deprived of public investment – rail routes to the city were closed, motorways were not extended to it, a university was opened in the relatively small (Protestant-majority) town of [[Coleraine]] rather than Derry and, above all, the city's housing stock was in an appalling state.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gallager |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm#chap1 |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1983|accessdate=21 April 2011|isbn = 0-7190-0919-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city therefore became a significant focus of the civil rights campaign led by organisations such as [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) in the late 1960s and it was in Derry that the so-called [[Battle of the Bogside]] – the event that more than any other pushed the Northern Ireland administration to ask for military support for civil policing – took place in August 1969.&lt;ref name="Purdie"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bob Purdie |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie.htm#nicra |title=Politics in the Streets: The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland |publisher=Blackstaff Press |year=1990|accessdate=21 April 2011|isbn = 0-85640-437-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a neutral force, in contrast to what was regarded as a sectarian police force, relations between them soon deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Niall Ó Dochartaigh |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/troops/chap4.htm#honey |title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |publisher=Cork University Press |year=1997 |accessdate=19 April 2011|isbn = 978-1-85918-108-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to escalating levels of violence across Northern Ireland, [[Operation Demetrius|internment without trial]] was introduced on 9 August 1971.&lt;ref name="g45"&gt;{{cite book | last = Geraghty | first = Tony | authorlink = Tony Geraghty | title = The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence | publisher = [[Harper Collins]] | year = 2000 | page = 45 | isbn = 978-0-00-638674-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was disorder across Northern Ireland following the introduction of internment, with 21 people being killed in three days of rioting.&lt;ref name="e141"&gt;{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | year = 2003 | page = 141 | isbn = 0-330-49388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belfast, soldiers of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] shot dead 11 Catholic civilians in what became known as the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]]. On 10 August, [[Bombardier (rank)|Bombardier]] Paul Challenor became the first soldier to be killed by the Provisional IRA in Derry, when he was shot by a sniper on the [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan estate]].&lt;ref name="b83"&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | title = Brits: The War Against the IRA | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 | page = 83 | isbn = 0-7475-5806-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further six soldiers had been killed in Derry by mid-December 1971.&lt;ref name="b84"&gt;''Brits'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 1,332 rounds were fired at the British Army, who also faced 211 explosions and 180 [[nail bomb]]s,&lt;ref name="b84" /&gt; and who fired 364 rounds in return.

IRA activity also increased across Northern Ireland with thirty British soldiers being killed in the remaining months of 1971, in contrast to the ten soldiers killed during the pre-internment period of the year.&lt;ref name="e141" /&gt; Both the [[Official IRA]] and Provisional IRA had established [[no-go area]]s for the British Army and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in Derry through the use of barricades.&lt;ref name="b82"&gt;''Brits'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to prevent access to what was known as [[Free Derry]], 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name="b82" /&gt; IRA members openly mounted roadblocks in front of the media, and daily clashes took place between nationalist youths and the British Army at a spot known as "aggro corner".&lt;ref name="b82" /&gt; Due to rioting and damage to shops caused by [[incendiary device]]s, an estimated total of {{Nowrap|£4 million}} worth of damage had been done to local businesses.&lt;ref name="b82" /&gt;

===Lead-up to the march===
On 18 January 1972, [[Brian Faulkner]], [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], banned all parades and marches in Northern Ireland until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Events+surrounding+one+of+the+darkest+days+in+history.-a061037924 |title=Events surrounding one of the darkest days in history |last=Macaskill |first=Jamie |work=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=28 March 2000 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 1972, a week before Bloody Sunday, an anti-internment march was held at [[Magilligan]] strand, near Derry. The protesters marched to a new internment camp there, but were stopped by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment. When some protesters threw stones and tried to go around the barbed wire, paratroopers drove them back by firing [[rubber bullet]]s at close range and making [[baton charge]]s. The paratroopers badly beat a number of protesters and had to be physically restrained by their own officers. These allegations of brutality by paratroopers were reported widely on television and in the press. Some in the Army also thought there had been undue violence by the paratroopers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter009 Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume I, Chapter 9], paragraphs 202–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm 'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt;

NICRA intended, despite the ban, to hold another anti-internment march in Derry on Sunday 30 January. The authorities decided to allow it to proceed in the Catholic areas of the city, but to stop it from reaching [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall Square]], as planned by the organisers. The authorities expected that this would lead to rioting. Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]], then Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, ordered that the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (1 Para), should travel to Derry to be used to arrest possible rioters.&lt;ref name="Saville2.16-17"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter002 |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry |year=2010 |volume=2.15–2.16 |accessdate=22 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915134440/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter002/ |archivedate=15 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest operation was codenamed 'Operation Forecast'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry].

He gave orders to Lieutenant Colonel [[Derek Wilford]], commander of 1 Para. He in turn gave orders to Major [[Ted Loden]], who commanded the [[Company (military unit)|company]] who launched the arrest operation.

The protesters planned on marching from Bishop's Field, in the Creggan housing estate, to the Guildhall, in the city centre, where they would hold a rally. The march set off at about 2:45pm. There were 10,000–15,000 people on the march, with many joining along its route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume02/chapter014/ Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume II, Chapter 14: The beginning of the march]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]], in his now discredited tribunal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0616/1224272613911.html |title='Relief and vindication in Derry at findings in 5,000-page report'|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=26 March 2011|date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/7827351/Bloody-Sunday-soldiers-should-face-trial-but-not-jail-families-say.html |title='Bloody Sunday: soldiers should face trial but not jail, families say'|publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=26 March 2011|location=London|first1=John|last1=Bingham|first2=Rosa|last2=Prince|first3=Thomas|last3=Harding|date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.independent.co.uk/topic/saville-widgery |title='saville widgery' |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=26 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129214943/http://search.independent.co.uk/topic/saville-widgery |archivedate=29 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1997/02/06/00031.asp |title='Written Answers. – Bloody Sunday Inquiry'|publisher=House of the Oireachtas |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that there were only 3,000 to 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/181194/Bloody-Sunday-March-that-led-to-deadly-clashes |title=Bloody Sunday: March that led to deadly clashes |last=Flanagan |first=Padraic |work=Sunday Express |location=London |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The march made its way along William Street but, as it neared the city centre, its path was blocked by British Army barriers. The organisers redirected the march down Rossville Street, intending to hold the rally at [[Free Derry Corner]] instead. However, some broke off from the march and began [[criminal rock throwing|throwing stones at soldiers]] manning the barriers. The soldiers fired [[rubber bullet]]s, [[CS gas]] and [[water cannon]] to try to disperse the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. [[The Stationery Office]]. 15 June 2010. p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Such clashes between soldiers and youths were common, and observers reported that the rioting was not intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Pringle &amp; Philip Jacobson |title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? |location=London |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2000 |isbn=1-84115-316-8}} P. 100: "…the level of rioting was no greater than usual – and no petrol bombs or nail bombs were being thrown."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the crowd spotted paratroopers hiding in a derelict three-story building overlooking William Street, and began throwing stones at the windows. At about 3:55pm, these paratroopers opened fire. Civilians Damien Donaghy and John Johnston were shot and wounded while standing on waste ground opposite the building. These were the first shots fired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers claimed Donaghy was holding a black cylindrical object,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson |title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? |location=London |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2000 |isbn=1-84115-316-8}}P 116: "Seconds after the corporal fired, he would say that he spotted the same man with a black cylindrical object in one hand strike what appeared to be a match against the wall. Johnston was standing a few feet from Donaghy. One of the bullets sliced through his right thigh."&lt;/ref&gt; but the Saville Inquiry concluded that all of those shot were unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-inquiry-key-findings |title=Bloody Sunday inquiry: key findings |last1=Siddique |first1=Haroon |last2=French |first2=Megan |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:07pm, the paratroopers were ordered to go through the barriers and arrest rioters. The paratroopers, on foot and in armoured vehicles, chased people down Rossville Street and into the Bogside. Two people were knocked down by the vehicles. Brigadier MacLellan had ordered that only one company of paratroopers be sent through the barriers, on foot, and that they should not chase people down Rossville Street. Colonel Wilford disobeyed this order, which meant there was no separation between rioters and peaceful marchers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The paratroopers disembarked and began seizing people. There were many claims of paratroopers beating people, clubbing them with rifle butts, firing rubber bullets at them from close range, making threats to kill, and hurling abuse. The Saville Report agreed that soldiers "used excessive force when arresting people […] as well as seriously assaulting them for no good reason while in their custody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume03/chapter044/|title=Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume III, Chapter 44: Conclusions on the treatment of those arrested in Sector 2|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of paratroopers took up position at a low wall about {{convert|80|yd|m}} in front of a rubble barricade that stretched across Rossville Street. There were people at the barricade and some were throwing stones at the soldiers, but none were near enough to hit them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume05/chapter070 Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume V, Chapter 70], paragraph 20&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers fired on the people at the barricade, killing six and wounding a seventh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

A large group of people fled or were chased into the car park of Rossville Flats. This area was like a courtyard, surrounded on three sides by high-rise flats. The soldiers opened fire, killing one civilian and wounding six others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. p.22&lt;/ref&gt; This fatality, Jackie Duddy, was running alongside a priest, [[Bishop Edward Daly|Father Edward Daly]], when he was shot in the back.&lt;ref name="CAINBS"&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30&amp;nbsp;January 1972 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/circum.htm | publisher = [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) | accessdate =16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of people fled into the car park of Glenfada Park, which was also a courtyard-like area surrounded by flats. Here, the soldiers shot at people across the car park, about 40–50 yards away. Two civilians were killed and at least four others wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The Saville Report says it is "probable" that at least one soldier fired from the hip towards the crowd, without aiming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume06/chapter102/ Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume VI, Chapter 102], paragraph 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The soldiers went through the car park and out the other side. Some soldiers went out the southwest corner, where they shot dead two civilians. The other soldiers went out the southeast corner and shot four more civilians, killing two.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. pp.28–30&lt;/ref&gt;

About ten minutes had elapsed between the time soldiers drove into the Bogside and the time the last of the civilians was shot.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. p.31&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 rounds were fired by the soldiers.&lt;ref name="12-years"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/7831441/Bloody-Sunday-the-shooting-lasted-an-hour-the-inquiry-took-12-years.html |title=Bloody Sunday: the shooting lasted an hour, the inquiry took 12 years |last=Kirkup |first=James |work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of those shot were given [[first aid]] by civilian volunteers, either on the scene or after being carried into nearby homes. They were then driven to hospital, either in civilian cars or in ambulances. The first ambulances arrived at 4:28pm. The three boys killed at the rubble barricade were driven to hospital by the paratroopers. Witnesses said paratroopers lifted the bodies by the hands and feet and dumped them in the back of their APC, as if they were "pieces of meat". The Saville Report agreed that this is an "accurate description of what happened". It says the paratroopers "might well have felt themselves at risk, but in our view this does not excuse them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume07/chapter122/ Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume VII, Chapter 122], paragraphs 290–293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===
[[File:Murder victims of Bloody Sunday.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Murals in Northern Ireland|Mural]] by the [[Bogside Artists]] depicting all who were killed by the British Army on the day]]
In all, 26 people were shot by the paratroopers; 13 died on the day and another individual died of his injuries four months later. Most of the fatalities were killed in four main areas: the rubble barricade across Rossville Street, the courtyard car park of Rossville Flats (on the north side of the flats), the courtyard car park of Glenfada Park, and the forecourt of Rossville Flats (on the south side of the flats).&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;

All of the soldiers responsible insisted that they had shot at, and hit, gunmen or bomb-throwers. The Saville Report concluded that all of those shot were unarmed and that none were posing a serious threat. It also concluded that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks, or threatened attacks, by gunmen or bomb-throwers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. pp.36–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The casualties are listed in the order in which they were killed.

* '''John 'Jackie' Duddy''', age 17. Shot as he ran away from soldiers in the car park of Rossville Flats.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt; The bullet struck him in the shoulder and entered his chest. Three witnesses said they saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt; He was the first fatality on Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt; Like Saville, Widgery also concluded that Duddy was unarmed.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;
* '''Michael Kelly''', age 17. Shot in the stomach while standing at the rubble barricade on Rossville Street. Both Saville and Widgery concluded that Kelly was unarmed.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;
* '''Hugh Gilmour''', age 17. Shot as he ran away from soldiers near the rubble barricade.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt; The bullet went through his left elbow and entered his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Bloody Sunday in Derry'' pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; Widgery acknowledged that a photograph taken seconds after Gilmour was hit&lt;ref&gt;''Bloody Sunday in Derry'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; corroborated witness reports that he was unarmed, and that tests for gunshot residue were negative.&lt;ref name="WIDGERY" /&gt;
* '''William Nash''', age 19. Shot in the chest at the rubble barricade. Witnesses stated Nash was unarmed.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt; Three people were shot while apparently going to his aid, including his father Alexander Nash.&lt;ref name=savillechapter86&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume05/chapter086/ Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume V, Chapter 86], paragraphs 360–364&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''John Young''', age 17. Shot in the face at the rubble barricade, apparently while crouching and going to the aid of William Nash.&lt;ref name=savillechapter86/&gt; Two witnesses stated Young was unarmed.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;
* '''Michael McDaid''', age 20. Shot in the face at the rubble barricade, apparently while crouching and going to the aid of William Nash.&lt;ref name=savillechapter86/&gt;
* '''Kevin McElhinney''', age 17. Shot from behind, near the rubble barricade, while attempting to crawl to safety. Two witnesses stated McElhinney was unarmed.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;
* '''James 'Jim' Wray''', age 22. Shot in the back while running away from soldiers in Glenfada Park courtyard. He was then shot again in the back as he lay mortally wounded on the ground. Witnesses, who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal, stated that Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;
* '''William McKinney''', age 27. Shot in the back&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwuk.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BloodySundayWeek8.pdf rwuk.org (page 10 of 26)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102231700/http://www.rwuk.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BloodySundayWeek8.pdf |date=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as he attempted to flee through Glenfada Park courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279147/0029_vi.pdf www.gov.uk pages 14 &amp; 147 of 630]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwuk.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BloodySundayWeek8.pdf rwuk.org (page 5 of 26)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102231700/http://www.rwuk.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BloodySundayWeek8.pdf |date=2 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gerard McKinney''', age 35. Shot in the chest at Abbey Park. A soldier ran through an alleyway from Glenfada Park and shot him from a few yards away. Witnesses said that when he saw the soldier, McKinney stopped and held up his arms, shouting "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!", before being shot. The bullet apparently went through his body and struck Gerard Donaghy behind him.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;
* '''[[Gerard V. Donaghy|Gerard Donaghy]]''', age 17. Shot in the stomach at Abbey Park while standing behind Gerard McKinney. Both were apparently struck by the same bullet. Bystanders brought Donaghy to a nearby house, where he was examined by a doctor. The doctor opened Donaghy's clothes to examine him, and his pockets were also searched for identification. Two bystanders then attempted to drive Donaghy to hospital, but the car was stopped at an Army checkpoint. They were ordered to leave the car and a soldier drove it to a Regimental Aid Post, where an Army medical officer pronounced Donaghy dead. Shortly after, soldiers found four nail bombs in his pockets. The civilians who searched him, the soldier who drove him to the Army post, and the Army medical officer, all said that they did not see any bombs. This led to claims that soldiers planted the bombs on Donaghy to justify the killings. Donaghy was a member of [[Fianna Éireann]], an IRA-linked republican youth movement.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt; Paddy Ward, a police informer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derryjournal.com/journal/Death-of-39informer39-.6096320.jp Death of 'informer' – Local – Derry Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who gave evidence at the Saville Inquiry, claimed he gave two nail bombs to Donaghy several hours before he was shot.&lt;ref name="INNES"&gt;{{cite news | title = McGuinness is named as bomb runner | author = John Innes | url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&amp;id=1161662003 |work=The Scotsman | location=Edinburgh | date = 21 October 2003 | accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saville Report concluded that the bombs were probably in Donaghy's pockets when he was shot. However, it concluded that he was not about to throw a bomb when he was shot; and that he was not shot because he had bombs. "He was shot while trying to escape from the soldiers".&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;

* '''Patrick Doherty''', age 31. Shot from behind while attempting to crawl to safety in the forecourt of Rossville Flats. He was shot by soldiers who came out of Glenfada Park. Doherty was photographed, moments before and after he died, by French journalist [[Gilles Peress]]. Despite testimony from "Soldier F" that he had shot a man holding a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs show Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Inquiry urged to identify soldiers | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2004398.stm |publisher=BBC News | date = 23 May 2002 | accessdate =16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bernard 'Barney' McGuigan''', age 41. Shot in the head when he walked out from cover to help Patrick Doherty. He had been waving a white handkerchief to indicate his peaceful intentions.&lt;ref name="WIDGERY"&gt;{{cite web | title = Widgery Report | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/widgery.htm | publisher = [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) | accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAINBS" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10138851 |title=The victims of Bloody Sunday |work=BBC News |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official army position, backed by the British [[Home Secretary]] the next day in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], was that the paratroopers had reacted to gun and nail bomb attacks from suspected IRA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Northern Ireland |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1972/jan/31/northern-ireland |house=House of Commons |date=31 January 1972 |column_start=32 |column_end=43 |speaker=Reginald Maudling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the soldiers, all eyewitnesses—including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present—maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims.&lt;ref name="12-years"/&gt;

On 2 February 1972, the day that 12 of those killed were buried, there was a [[general strike]] in the Republic. It was described as the biggest general strike in Europe since the Second World War relative to population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/bloody-sunday-helped-reconcile-southern-nationalists-to-partition-1.453388|title=Bloody Sunday helped reconcile Southern nationalists to partition|work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial services were held in Catholic and Protestant churches, as well as synagogues, throughout the Republic. The same day, irate crowds burned down the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Dublin|British embassy]] on [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/2/newsid_2758000/2758163.stm 1972: British embassy in Dublin destroyed] BBC News Online.

In the days following Bloody Sunday, [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]], the independent Irish nationalist [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster]], expressed anger at what she perceived as British government attempts to stifle accounts being reported about the shootings. Having witnessed the events firsthand, she was infuriated that Speaker [[Selwyn Lloyd]] consistently denied her the chance to speak in Parliament about the shootings, although parliamentary convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Daughters of Ireland |author = Ros Wynne-Jones |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/daughters-of-ireland-1271972.html |work=The Independent |location=UK |date = 9 March 1997 |accessdate =6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |house=House of Commons |title=Northern Ireland |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1972/jan/31/northern-ireland |date = 31 January 1972 |column_start = 32 |column_end = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after Bloody Sunday, the British Parliament adopted a resolution for a [[tribunal]] into the shootings, resulting in Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] commissioning the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]], to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to [[boycott]] the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly-produced report—completed within 10 weeks (on 10 April) and published within 11 weeks (on 19 April)—supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based [[solder]].

Although there were many IRA men—both Official and Provisional—at the protest, it is claimed they were all unarmed, apparently because it was anticipated that the paratroopers would attempt to "draw them out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rumours of plan to clear Bogside are 'nonsense' |author=David Sharrock |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/30/nuls130.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020627205642/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F03%2F30%2Fnuls130.html |archivedate=27 June 2002 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=30 March 2000 |accessdate=16 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; March organiser and MP [[Ivan Cooper]] had been promised beforehand that no armed IRA men would be near the march.

Later identified as a member of the Official IRA, this man was also photographed in the act of drawing his weapon, but was apparently not seen or targeted by the soldiers. Various other claims have been made to the Saville Inquiry about gunmen on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bloody Sunday Inquiry Transcript – Day 008 |url = http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/transcripts/Archive/Ts008.htm |date = 6 April 2000 |accessdate =17 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040549/http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk/transcripts/Archive/Ts008.htm |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[inquest]] into the deaths was held in August 1973. The city's [[coroner]], Hubert O'Neill, a retired [[British Army]] major, issued a statement at the completion of the inquest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm 'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN). 23 March 2006. Retrieved 27 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He declared:
{{quote|This Sunday became known as Bloody Sunday and bloody it was. It was quite unnecessary. It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing. They were shooting innocent people. These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately. I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated murder. It was murder.}}

Several months after Bloody Sunday, the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment—again under Lt Col [[Derek Wilford]]—were involved in another controversial shooting incident. On 7 September, 1 Para raided houses and the headquarters of the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) in the [[Ulster Protestant|Protestant]] [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] area of Belfast. Two Protestant civilians were shot dead and others wounded by the paratroopers, who claimed they were returning fire at [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] gunmen. This sparked angry demonstrations by local Protestants, and the UDA declared: "Never has Ulster witnessed such licensed sadists and such blatant liars as the 1st Paras. These gun-happy louts must be removed from the streets". A unit of the British Army's [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] refused to carry out duties until 1 Para was withdrawn from the Shankill.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ian S. ''Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA''. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp.104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1972, Lt Col Wilford, who was directly in charge of the soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday, was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10287463|title=Bloody Sunday: Key soldiers involved|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[John Major]], writing to John Hume stated: "The Government made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Don Mullan]] |title=Eyewitness Bloody Sunday |location=Wolfhound |publisher=Printing Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-86327-586-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, General (then Captain) Sir [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]], adjutant of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, said: "I have no doubt that innocent people were shot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1998, Lt Col Derek Wilford expressed his anger at Tony Blair's intention of setting up the Saville inquiry, stating that he was proud of his actions on Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I+was+proud+to+lead+the+Paras+on+Bloody+Sunday...don't+dare+say+sorry...-a060659224|title=I was proud to lead the Paras on Bloody Sunday...don't dare say sorry for me, Mr Blair.|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 2000 during an interview with the BBC, Wilford said: "There might have been things wrong in the sense that some innocent people, people who were not carrying a weapon, were wounded or even killed. But that was not done as a deliberate malicious act. It was done as an act of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/northern_ireland/2000/bloody_sunday_inquiry/673039.stm|title=BLOODY SUNDAY INQUIRY – Col Wilford: Don't blame my soldiers|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although British prime minister John Major rejected John Hume's requests for a [[public inquiry]] into the killings, his successor, Tony Blair, decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, was established in January 1998 to re-examine Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref name="bbchist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/saville_inquiry_into_bloody_sunday |title=Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday |work=BBC History |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other judges were [[John Toohey (judge)|John Toohey]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], a former [[Judge|Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir [[Edward Somers]] QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice [[William Lloyd Hoyt|William Hoyt]] QC, former [[Chief Justice]] of [[New Brunswick]] and a member of the [[Canadian Judicial Council]]. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010.&lt;ref name="bbchist"/&gt; The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. Lord Saville declined to comment on the Widgery report and made the point that the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday, not the Widgery Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |title=Operation Banner: The British Army in Northern Ireland 1969 – 2007 |last=Van der Bijl |first=Nick |publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military |isbn=978-1-8441-5956-7 |year=2009 |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence given by [[Martin McGuinness]], a senior member of [[Sinn Féin]] and later the [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]], to the inquiry stated that he was second-in-command of the Derry City brigade of the Provisional IRA and was present at the march.&lt;ref name="bbchist"/&gt; A claim was made at the Saville Inquiry that McGuinness was responsible for supplying detonators for nail bombs on Bloody Sunday. Paddy Ward claimed he was the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann]], the youth wing of the IRA in January 1972. He claimed that McGuinness, the second-in-command of the IRA in the city at the time, and another anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts on the morning of 30 January, the date planned for the civil rights march. He said his organisation intended to attack city-centre premises in Derry on the day when civilians were shot dead by British soldiers. In response McGuinness rejected the claims as "fantasy", while Gerry O'Hara, a Sinn Féin councillor in Derry stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.&lt;ref name="INNES" /&gt;

Many observers allege that the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] acted in a way to impede the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Bloody Sunday footage release calls |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2710309.stm |publisher=BBC News |date = 30 January 2003 |accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,000 army photographs and original army helicopter video footage were never made available.

By the time the inquiry had retired to write up its findings, it had interviewed over 900 witnesses, over seven years, making it the biggest investigation in [[Law of the United Kingdom|British legal]] history.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A" /&gt; The cost of this process has drawn criticism; as of the publication of the Saville Report being {{Nowrap|£195 million}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/10320609.stm|work=BBC News |title=Bloody Sunday Report Published. |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report concluded that an Official IRA sniper fired on British soldiers, albeit that on the balance of evidence his shot was fired ''after'' the Army shots that wounded Damien Donaghey and John Johnston. The Inquiry rejected the sniper's account that this shot had been made in reprisal, stating the view that he and another Official IRA member had already been in position, and the shot had probably been fired simply because the opportunity had presented itself.&lt;ref name="SavilleSnipers312"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&amp;nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003 |archivedate=24 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the Saville Inquiry was inconclusive on Martin McGuinness's role, due to a lack of certainty over his movements, concluding that while he was "engaged in paramilitary activity" during Bloody Sunday, and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were "sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire".&lt;ref name="SavilleMcGuinness3119"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&amp;nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |quote=3.119 in the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day. In the end we were left in some doubt as to his movements on the day. Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003 |archivedate=24 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the soldiers in charge on the day of Bloody Sunday, the Saville Inquiry arrived at the following findings:

*Lieutenant Colonel [[Derek Wilford]]: Commander of 1 Para and directly responsible for arresting rioters and returning to base. Found to have 'deliberately disobeyed' his superior Brigadier Patrick MacLellan's orders by sending Support Company into the Bogside (and without informing MacLellan).&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;
*Major [[Ted Loden]]: Commander in charge of soldiers, following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Cleared of misconduct; Saville cited in the report that Loden "neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt; The inquiry found that Loden could not be held responsible for claims (whether malicious or not) by some of the individual soldiers that they had received fire from snipers.
*Captain [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]]: Second in command of 1 Para on the day of Bloody Sunday. Cleared of sinister actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major Loden on why they had fired. This list became known as the "Loden List of Engagements" which played a role in the Army's initial explanations. While the inquiry found the compiling of the list was 'far from ideal', Jackson's explanations were accepted based on the list not containing the names of soldiers and the number of times they fired.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;
*Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]]: Commander of land forces and set the British strategy to oversee the civil march in Derry. Cleared of any fault, but his selection of 1 Para, and in particular his selection of Colonel Wilford to be in control of arresting rioters, was found to be disconcerting, specifically as "1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;
*Brigadier Pat MacLellan: Operational commander of the day. Cleared of any wrongdoing as he was under the impression that Wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base, and could not be blamed for Wilford's actions.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;
*Major Michael Steele: With MacLellan in the operations room and in charge of passing on the orders of the day. The inquiry report accepted that Steele could not believe other than that a separation had been achieved between rioters and marchers, because both groups were in different areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2521517.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – N Ireland – Major gives Bloody Sunday evidence|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other soldiers: Lance Corporal F was found responsible for a number of the deaths and that a number of soldiers have "knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;
*Intelligence officer Colonel Maurice Tugwell and [[Colin Wallace]], (an IPU army press officer): Cleared of wrongdoing. Saville believed the information Tugwell and Wallace released through the media was not down to any deliberate attempt to deceive the public but rather due to much of the inaccurate information Tugwell had received at the time by various other figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/8577087.stm|title=BBC News – Britain's propaganda war during the Troubles|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on the findings of the Saville Inquiry in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the British prime minister [[David Cameron]] said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic. I never want to believe anything bad about our country. I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10322295|title=BBC News – Bloody Sunday: PM David Cameron's full statement|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the publication of the report, a murder investigation was begun by the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]'s Legacy Investigation Branch. On 10 November 2015, a 66-year-old former member of the Parachute Regiment was arrested for questioning over the deaths of William Nash, Michael McDaid and John Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-34775466|title=Bloody Sunday: Ex-soldier arrested over Londonderry shootings|publisher=BBC News|date=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Wilson]], then the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the House of Commons, reiterated his belief that a [[united Ireland]] was the only possible solution to Northern Ireland's Troubles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kaufmann | first = Eric | title = The Orange Order: A Contemporary Northern Irish History | publisher = OUP Oxford | date = 17 May 2007 | pages = 77 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Omhzj_610d4C&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Harold%20Wilson%20united%20Ireland%20%20only%20possible%20solution&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q=Harold%20Wilson%20united%20Ireland%20%20only%20possible%20solution | isbn = 9780199208487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]], then Stormont Home Affairs Minister, suggested that the west bank of Derry should be ceded to the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wharton | first = Ken | author-link = Ken Wharton (writer) | title = The Bloodiest Year 1972: British Soldiers in Northern Ireland in Their Own Words | publisher = The History Press | date = 21 October 2011 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUU7AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=William%20Craig%20west%20bank%20of%20Derry&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=William%20Craig%20west%20bank%20of%20Derry | isbn = 9780752472980 | pages = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was deployed on duty in Northern Ireland, the British Army was welcomed by Roman Catholics as a neutral force there to protect them from Protestant mobs, the RUC and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]].&lt;ref&gt;This "Honeymoon period", as it has come to be known, ended around the time of the [[Falls Road Curfew]] on 3 July 1970. See CAIN for details here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch70.htm]. The 'B-Specials' were disbanded and replaced by the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) on 1 April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; After Bloody Sunday many Catholics turned on the British army, seeing it no longer as their protector but as their enemy. Young [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] became increasingly attracted to violent [[Irish republicanism|republican]] groups. With the Official IRA and [[Official Sinn Féin]] having moved away from mainstream Irish republicanism towards [[Marxism]], the Provisional IRA began to win the support of newly radicalised, disaffected young people.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the following twenty years, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other smaller republican groups such as the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) stepped up their [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|armed campaigns]] against the state and those seen as being in service to it. With rival paramilitary organisations appearing in both the nationalist/republican and [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]/[[Ulster loyalist|loyalist]] communities (such as the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA), [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), etc. on the loyalist side), the Troubles cost the lives of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_paramilitaries |title=Paramilitaries in the Troubles |website=BBC History |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British prime minister David Cameron stated: "These are shocking conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say. But you do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=''RTÉ News'' |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0615/bloodysunday.html |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustifiable' |date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers, and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also said that this was not a premeditated action, though "there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate" as "what happened should never, ever have happened". Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was "deeply sorry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/15/david-cameron-bloody-sunday-apology |title=David Cameron condemns Bloody Sunday killings and makes apology |work=The Guardian |location=London |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in June 2010 found that 61 per cent of Britons and 70 per cent of Northern Irish agreed with Cameron's apology for the Bloody Sunday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angus Reid Public Opinion |url=http://www.visioncritical.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010.06.28_Sunday_BRI.pdf |title=Britons and Northern Irish Welcome PM's Apology for Bloody Sunday |publisher=Angus Reid Public Opinion |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Pollard, solicitor representing several of the soldiers, said on 15 June 2010 that Saville had cherry-picked the evidence and did not have justification for his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Devenport, BBC NI Political Editor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/northern_ireland/10320609.stm |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustified and unjustifiable' |publisher=BBC News |date=30 January 1972 |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Celtic metal]] band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] addressed the incident in a song "Bloody Sunday" from their 2004 album ''[[Folk-Lore]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bolther, Giancarlo |title=Interview with Keith Fay |url=http://rock-impressions.com/cruachan_inter1e.htm |publisher=Rock-impressions.com |accessdate=24 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willie Doherty]], a Derry-born artist, has amassed a large body of work which addresses the troubles in Northern Ireland. "30 January 1972" deals specifically with the events of Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref name="popular culture" /&gt;

In mid-2005, the play ''[[Bloody Sunday: Scenes from the Saville Inquiry]]'', a dramatisation based on the Saville Inquiry, opened in London, and subsequently travelled to Derry and Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Out of crises, a drama |author=Liz Hoggard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/features/story/0,11710,1446221,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=27 March 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloody Sunday: Scenes from the Saville Inquiry |url=http://www.dublinks.com/index.cfm/loc/14/pt/0/spid/85F418D2-6CD9-4669-8A9FA731AF2AB0CC.htm |work=Dublinks |year=2005 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001223059/http://www.dublinks.com/index.cfm/loc/14/pt/0/spid/85F418D2-6CD9-4669-8A9FA731AF2AB0CC.htm |archivedate=1 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer, journalist [[Richard Norton-Taylor]], distilled four years of evidence into two hours of stage performance by [[Tricycle Theatre]]. The play received glowing reviews in all the British broadsheets, including ''The Times'': "The Tricycle's latest recreation of a major inquiry is its most devastating"; ''The Daily Telegraph'': "I can't praise this enthralling production too highly… exceptionally gripping courtroom drama"; and ''The Independent'': "A necessary triumph".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Bloody Sunday: Scenes from the Saville Inquiry |url=http://www.tricycle.co.uk/htmlnew/whatson/show.php3?id=71 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405182630/http://www.tricycle.co.uk/htmlnew/whatson/show.php3?id=71 |publisher=Tricycle Theatre |year=2005 |archivedate=5 April 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bric-à-brac''' or '''bric-a-brac''' (origin [[French language|French]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bric-a-brac Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; first used in the [[Victorian era]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' first reference in English: 1840.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to lesser [[Objet d'art|objets d'art]] forming [[collecting|collections]] of [[wikt:curio|curio]]s, such as elaborately decorated teacups and small vases, compositions of feathers or [[artificial flower|wax flowers]] under glass domes, decorated eggshells, porcelain figurines, painted [[Portrait miniature|miniatures]] or photographs in stand-up frames, and so on. 

In middle-class homes bric-à-brac was used as ornament on [[mantelpiece]]s, tables, and shelves, or was displayed in [[curio cabinet]]s: sometimes these cabinets have glass doors to display the items within while protecting them from dust. Today, "bric-à-brac" refers to a selection of items of modest value, often sold in street markets and charity shops, and may be more commonly known in colloquial English as "knick knacks."

[[Edith Wharton]] and [[Ogden Codman, Jr.]], in ''The Decoration of Houses'' (1897), distinguished three gradations of quality in such "household ornaments": ''bric-à-brac'', ''bibelots'' ([[wikt:trinket|trinket]]s) and ''objets d'art''.&lt;ref&gt;"French speech... has provided at least three designations, each indicating a delicate and almost imperceptible gradation of quality": Wharton and Codman, ''The Decoration of Houses'', 1897, Ch. XVI "Bric-à-brac" p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chris Braithwaite''', also known as '''Chris Jones''' (1885 - 9 September 1944), was a black [[Barbados|Barbadian]] who was leader of the [[Colonial Seamen's Association]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Høgsbjerg, "Mariner, renegade and castaway: Chris Braithwaite, seamen’s organiser and Pan-Africanist", ''[[Race &amp; Class]]'', Vol. 53, No. 2 (October–December 2011), pp. 36-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Barbados]], Braithwaite went to sea with the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|British merchant navy]] as a teenager and travelled the world as a sailor. He then settled in [[Chicago]] and founded a family, before rejoining the Merchant Navy during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Høgsbjerg, [http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/37551/The+inspiring+fight+of+socialist+seafarer+Chris+Braithwaite "The inspiring fight of socialist seafarer Chris Braithwaite"], ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', 25 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]] he lived in [[New York City]] for a while, before moving to settle in [[London]], working for the [[Shipping Federation]]. He married a white woman, Edna, from [[Stepney]], and they lived in Stepney.&lt;ref name=EAES&gt;Christian Høgsbjerg, [http://www.encyclopediaofafroeuropeanstudies.eu/encyclopedia/chris-braithwaite/ "Chris Braithwaite"], ''Encyclopedia of Afro-European Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Braithwaite became a member of the [[National Union of Seamen]], and in 1930 joined the Seamen's Minority Movement, a rank-and-file group organised by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB). Taking the pseudonym "Chris Jones" to avoid victimisation by his employer, Braithwaite had joined the CPGB by 1931. He helped distribute the ''Negro Worker'', and with [[Arnold Ward]] helped launch the [[Negro Welfare Association]], publicising the case of the [[Scottsboro Boys]]. In 1933 he followed [[George Padmore]] in resigning from the CPGB in protest at the implicit shift away from anti-imperialism involved with the emerging "[[Popular Front]]" strategy.&lt;ref name=EAES/&gt;

In 1935, opposing the new [[British Shipping (Assistance) Act 1935]], Braithwaite founded the [[Colonial Seamen's Association]] - which included Asian seamen alongside other black colonial seamen.&lt;ref name="Open University - Making Britain - British Shipping (Assistance) Act (1935)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/british-shipping-assistance-act-1935|title=British Shipping (Assistance) Act (1935)|work=Making Britain|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became organising secretary of the [[International African Service Bureau]] (IASB), established in May 1937, whose members included Padmore, [[C. L. R. James]], [[Jomo Kenyatta]], [[Amy Ashwood Garvey]] and [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson]]. Braithwaite wrote a monthly column, "Seamen's Notes", for the IASB journal, ''International African Opinion''. Braithwaite, Padmore and James continued to oppose the CPGB, turning up together to heckle CPGB meetings. Braithwaite and Padmore worked with the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and with ILP intellectuals like [[Reginald Reynolds]] and [[Ethel Mannin]].&lt;ref name=EAES/&gt;

He died from pneumonia on 9 September 1944, survived by his wife and six children.&lt;ref name=Padmore&gt;George Padmore, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/padmore/1944/chris-jones.htm "Chris Jones: Fighter for the Oppressed"], ''[[New Leader]]'', September 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EAES/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3684">A number of [[coin]]s are mentioned in the [[Bible]], and they have proved very popular among [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayles|first=Wayne G|title=Ancient Coin Collecting|year=2003|publisher=[[F+W Media]]|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific coins mentioned in the Bible include the [[Lesson of the widow's mite|widow's mite]], the [[tribute penny]] and the [[thirty pieces of silver]], though it is not always possible to identify the exact coin that was used.

==Widow's mite==
The coin referred to in the [[lesson of the widow's mite]] was a ''[[Greek lepton|lepton]]'', the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="lepton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.org/netbible/mar12.htm|title=Mark 12 footnote 83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tiberius%2C_Denar%2C_Lyon%2C_CNG.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A [[denarius]] of [[Tiberius]]]]
==Tribute penny==
The [[tribute penny]] was the coin that was shown to [[Jesus]] when he made his famous speech "[[Render unto Caesar...]]" It is usually thought that the coin was a [[Roman currency|Roman]] [[denarius]] with the head of [[Tiberius]]. However, it has been suggested that the coin may have instead been an Antiochan [[tetradrachm]] bearing the head of [[Tiberius]], with [[Augustus]] on the reverse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Pocket Guide to Saint Paul: Coins Encountered by the Apostle on his Travels | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qa3Rj6rnjOIC&amp;pg=PA19 | first1 = Peter E. | last1 = Lewis | first2 = Ron | last2 = Bolden | publisher = Wakefield Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-86254-562-6 | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the denarius of Augustus with [[Gaius Caesar|Caius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]] on the reverse. Coins of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Mark Antony]] and [[Germanicus]] are also considered possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coin-newbies.com/articles/caesars.html |title=Six Caesars Of The Tribute Penny |author=Michael E. Marotta |year=2001 |accessdate=7 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coin in the fish's mouth==
The [[coin in the fish's mouth]] mentioned in Matthew 17 is usually thought to be a [[Tyrian shekel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendin|first1=David|title=The coin in the fish’s mouth|url=http://www.coinsweekly.com/en/Archive/The-coin-in-the-fishs-mouth/8?&amp;id=136&amp;type=a|publisher=Coins Weekly|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Peter E.|last2=Bolden|first2=Ron|title=The Pocket Guide to Saint Paul: Coins Encountered by the Apostle on His Travels|date=2002|publisher=[[Wakefield Press (Australia)|Wakefield Press]]|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qa3Rj6rnjOIC&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thirty pieces of silver==
According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 26:15, the price for which [[Judas Iscariot]] betrayed [[Jesus]] was [[thirty pieces of silver]]. Scholars disagree on the identity of the coins involved. [[Donald Wiseman]] suggests two possibilities for the identity of the coins used to pay Judas. They may have been [[tetradrachm]]s of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], usually referred to as [[Tyrian shekel]]s (about 1.38 troy ounces), or they may have been [[stater]]s from [[Antioch]], which bore the head of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Wiseman|D. J. Wiseman]], ''Illustrations from Biblical Archaeology'' (London: Tyndale Press, 1958), 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, they may have been [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] tetradrachms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coin-newbies.com/articles/bible.html |title=So-called 'Coins of the Bible' |author=Michael E. Marotta |year=2001 |accessdate=11 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coty, Inc.'''   is a multinational beauty company founded in 1904 by [[François Coty]]. With its subsidiaries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=795040I Bloomberg]&lt;/ref&gt; it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes [[Aroma compound|fragrances]], [[cosmetics]], [[skin care]], nail care, and both professional and retail [[hair care]] products. Coty owns around 77 [[brand]]s as of 2018.&lt;ref name="Beauty"&gt;{{cite web |title=Coty Professional Beauty Opens New Headquarters |url=https://www.americansalon.com/news/coty-professional-beauty-north-america-opens-new-headquarters |website=American Salon |publisher=Questex LLC |accessdate=20 June 2018 |date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
In the early 20th century, Francois Coty dropped a bottle of his fragrance ''La Rose Jacqueminot'' on a countertop at the [[Grands Magasins du Louvre]], the Parisian department store. Attracted by the scent, customers swarmed the area demanding to buy the perfume. Coty's entire stock was gone in a few minutes and the store offered him a place on the selling floor for his products.&lt;ref name='visionary'&gt;{{cite book | last = Healy | first = Orla | authorlink = | title = Coty: the Brand of Visionary | publisher=Assouline | date = 15 September 2004 | location = New York, New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-84323-622-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this incident, he became a major part of the perfume industry.

===1960s and 1970s===
Coty and Coty International were sold in 1963 to Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co. for about US$26 million and became divisions in the pharmaceuticals company's consumer products group. In 1965, Coty introduced Imprevu, its first new perfume in 25 years. This became the leading Coty fragrance by the end of 1968.

Coty and Coty International were united in 1973. Among the new products introduced in the early 1970s were the Styx, Sweet Earth, and Wild Musk fragrances and the Equatone beauty-treatment line. The production facility was moved from New York City to Sanford, North Carolina, at this time. Coty products were being marketed to franchised accounts, including distributors, independent drugstores, mass merchandisers, and department stores. Results were not meeting expectations, however, for the subsidiary was reported to be on the block in 1974 for possibly as little as $20 million—less than [[Pfizer]] had paid a decade earlier.

===1990s===
Coty was purchased in 1992 by Benckiser Consumer Products, the U.S. arm of a family-owned German household-products giant named Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH (now known as [[JAB Holding Company]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-05/business/fi-1444_1_health-care | title=Pfizer Selling Its Coty Unit to German Company : Restructuring: The divestiture will allow the pharmaceutical firm to focus on health care. | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=May 5, 1995 | accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Benckiser merged into Coty its Quintessence Inc. unit, which it had acquired the previous year. Coty, Inc., grew into a US$1.5-billion-a-year company in 1996, when Benckiser made its Lancaster Group a Coty division. (The existing Coty, renamed Coty Beauty, became the other division.) Lancaster, founded in [[Monaco]] in 1946 and acquired from SmithKline Beecham plc in 1990.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

During the year of 1998, 45 percent of the company's sales were in mass fragrances, 24 percent in mass cosmetics, and 31 percent in prestige-market beauty products. Fifty-five percent of sales volume came from Western Europe and 30 percent from North America.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Recent history===
In May 2005, Unilever announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell its global prestige fragrance business, [[Unilever]] Cosmetics International (UCI), to Coty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/21/business/fi-rup21.5 | title=Coty to Buy Unilever's Perfume Business | publisher=The Los Angeles Times | work=May 21, 2005 | accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several major brands were sold to [[Elizabeth Arden]].

Unilever reportedly received a consideration of US$800 million in cash at the closing, with the opportunity for further deferred payments contingent upon future sales.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The business included the perfume licenses for Calvin Klein, Cerruti, [[Vera Wang]], Chloé and [[Karl Lagerfeld|Lagerfeld]], as well as a manufacturing and distribution center in [[Mount Olive, New Jersey]], which was later closed in June 2007 as operations were transferred to the existing Coty-Sanford, [[North Carolina]], facility.

In December 2007, Coty announced the acquisition of DLI Holding Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coty-inc-and-del-laboratories-inc-announce-acquisition-of-del-laboratories-inc-by-coty-inc-58627712.html | title=Coty Inc. and Del Laboratories, Inc.

'''Delmer Myers Brown''' (November 20, 1909{{snd}}November 9, 2011) was an American [[academic]], [[historian]], [[author]], [[translator]] and [[Japanologist]].  He was a professor of Japanese history at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]].

==Early life, education, and personal life==
Brown was born on November 20, 1909 in [[Harrisonville, Missouri]] and grew up in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. In 1925, he moved with his family to [[Santa Ana, California]]. He attended [[Santa Ana Junior College]] and then [[Stanford University]], where he graduated with a degree in history in 1932.

Instead of going to law school, as originally planned, Brown took a position teaching English at a prestigious Japanese Imperial "Higher School" in [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa]], [[Japan]]. It was there that he met and married Mary Nelson Logan in 1934.&lt;ref name="SF Chron"&gt;{{cite web|title=Delmer Brown: Death Notice|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=Delmer-Brown&amp;pid=154640204|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 27, 2013|date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Brown served as an intelligence officer in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].&lt;ref name="SF Chron"/&gt;

Brown earned his Ph.D. in Japanese history from Stanford in 1946.&lt;ref name="nichibei"&gt;[http://www.csuchico.edu/~gwilliams/tsa/nl/kunsho_(medal_of_honor).html  "Dr. Delmer Brown Receives Medal from Japanese Government,"] ''Nichibei News'', April 29, 1997; retrieved 2013-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Mary died after 53 years of marriage. Brown was widowed twice more; by Margaret Young Brown in 2003 and Louise K. Weamer in 2010. He is survived by his companion Pauline Howland, two sisters, a son and three step-children, two granddaughters, and six great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="SF Chron"/&gt;

Brown died on November 9, 2011 following a [[stroke]].&lt;ref name="SF Chron"/&gt;

==Career==
From 1946 to 1977, Brown was a member of the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley. He was chairman of the history department from 1957 to 1961 and 1971 to 1975.&lt;ref name="nichibei"/&gt;

Brown was awarded a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] in Japan from 1959 to 1960.&lt;ref name="nichibei"/&gt;

In 1998, Brown started the process of establishing the [[Japanese Historical Text Initiative]] (JHTI), which is a searchable online database of Japanese historical documents and English translations. It is part of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of East Asian Studies (IEAS) at University of California, Berkeley, [http://ieas.berkeley.edu/cjs/resources_jhti.html  "Japanese Historical Text Initiative (JHTI)"]; retrieved 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  The development of JHTI involved negotiations with the [[University of Tokyo Press]] and Japan's [[National Institute of Japanese Literature]].&lt;ref name="IEAS"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://ieas.berkeley.edu/news/brown_in_memoriam.html |title=News&amp;nbsp;– Delmer Brown&amp;nbsp;– In Memoriam | accessdate=2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward E. Baptist''' (born 1970) is an American academic and writer.   He is a Professor of [[Cornell University Department of History|History]] at [[Cornell University]], located in [[Ithaca, New York]], where he specializes in the history of the 19th-century United States, and particularly the South. Thematically, he has been interested in the [[history of capitalism]], and has also been interested in [[digital humanities]] methodologies. He is the author of numerous books.

==Career==
Baptist is a Professor of [[History]] at Cornell University. His areas of interest are 19th-century United States and especially the history of [[Slavery in the United States|enslavement in America]].&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; Baptist is the author of many articles and books including ''[[The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism]]'' and the award-winning ''Creating an Old South''.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

In September 2014, Baptist's work came to prominence when ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine gave his book ''The Half Has Never Been Told'' an unfavorable review for characterizing slave owners negatively. The review generated widespread outrage against the publication and resulted in a rare withdrawal of the article and an apology from the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/books/21615864-how-slaves-built-american-capitalism-blood-cotton].  ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Baptist penned a response in ''[[Politico]]'' magazine, in which he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Had the ''Economist'' actually engaged the book's arguments, the reviewer would have had to confront the scary fact that the unrestrained domination of market forces can sometimes amplify existing forms of oppression into something more horrific. No wonder the ''Economist'' abandoned its long-standing intellectual commitments in favor of sloppy old paternalism on Sept. 4, because if it hadn't, Mr./Ms. Anonymous might have had to admit that [[market fundamentalism]] doesn't always provide the best solution for every economic or social problem.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Baptist (September 7, 2014).

Baptist supports replacing [[Andrew Jackson]] with [[Harriet Tubman]] on the [[United States twenty-dollar bill]]. When Howard Kittell, the CEO of the Andrew Jackson Foundation, claimed that the [[Indian Removal Act]] was "within the mainstream thinking," Baptist refuted that "At the time, there were alternatives, there were congressmen who suggested alternatives. The Indian Removal Act was contested, there were lots of folks who opposed it." He concluded, "Harriet Tubman is what's good about America...Andrew Jackson is what's problematic about our history."

In 2017 Baptist was awarded a prestigious [http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/04/baptist-hutchinson-awarded-guggenheim-fellowships Guggenheim Fellowship] for a new project on the history of the policing of African Americans from Jamestown to Ferguson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3407">'''Eric John Holmyard''' (1891–1959) was an English science teacher at [[Clifton College]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceatclifton.co.uk/clifton/alchemy.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and historian of science and technology. 

==Scholar==
Holmyard studied at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society. His scholarly work included rectification of accounts of the history of [[alchemy]], particularly in relation with [[Islamic science]]. He translated texts from Arabic and Latin, and wrote extensively on [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Geber]]. He was responsible with D. C. Mandeville for the re-attribution of the alchemical text ''De Mineralibus'' to an origin in [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/avicenna.htm |title=Avicenna |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220050756/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/avicenna.htm |archivedate=20 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmyard served as the founding editor of the scientific review and history of science journal ''[[Endeavour (journal)|Endeavour]]''.

==Textbooks==

As a textbook author, he pioneered an approach to science teaching that included historical material. "His historicized science books were an enormous and long-term commercial success, with ''Elementary Chemistry'' (1925) alone selling half-a-million copies by 1960."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 40| pages = 445–472| last = Mayer| first = A.

==Teacher==

He taught both [[Nevill Mott]] and [[Charles Coulson]] at Clifton, but his personal influence on them as scientists was low (in Coulson's case, even negative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quantum-chemistry-history.com/Coulson1.htm]: ''… Holmyard — the prolific writer of elementary textbooks — apparently met with no success in attracting him towards Chemistry; indeed, he chose quite firmly the Classics.''&lt;/ref&gt;). Holmyard also published best seller, A Higher School Inorganic Chemistry, along with W.G. Palmer.

'''Ernst Kris''' (April 26, 1900 – February 27, 1957) was an Austrian [[psychoanalyst]] and [[art historian]].

==Life==
Kris was born in 1900 to Leopold Kris, a lawyer, and Rosa Schick in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]].

Kris not only practiced as a psychoanalyst, he also worked as an art historian and published articles on art history. As a psychoanalyst, he made some important contributions to the psychology of the artist and the psychoanalytic interpretation of works of art and caricature. In the review ''Imago'' he published his first psychoanalytic study, ''"Ein geisteskranker Bildhauer"'' (A mentally ill sculptor) on [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]].

During the end of the 1910s and the beginning of the 1920s, Kris studied [[art history]] under [[Max Dvořák]] and [[Julius von Schlosser]] at the Department of Art History at the [[University of Vienna]], from which he received his doctorate in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ernst Kris|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1354233/Ernst-Kris| accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the professors was [[Emanuel Loewy]], a friend of [[Sigmund Freud]].

In 1927 Kris married Marianne Rie, the daughter of another friend of Freud, Oscar Rie. They had two children.
Kris and his wife both became psychoanalysts and Kris began to publish psychoanalytic papers.

A year later, in 1928, Kris intensified his working relationship with Freud, and he became a member of the [[Vienna Psychoanalytic Society]]. Between 1930 and 1938, Kris worked as a lecturer at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute.

In 1933, Freud asked Kris to become editor of the Imago magazine, in which he published a paper relating art to psychology in 1936. He argued that the difference between the artist and the psychotic is that the artist can return from the world of his imagination to the real world, while the psychotic cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Ernst Kris|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1354233/Ernst-Kris| accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Kris fled to England, after Hitler invaded Austria. In England he became a lecturer and training analyst at the [[London Institute of Psychoanalysis]], until 1940. In London, he also established a working relationship with art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] concerning the art of [[caricature]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gombricharchive.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/showdoc85.pdf E. H. Gombrich (with Ernst Kris), "The Principles of Caricature", ''British Journal of Medical Psychology'', Vol. 17, 1938, pp. 319-342.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Kris analyzed Nazi radio broadcasts for the [[BBC]], as his friend Gombrich also did.

In 1940, Kris and his family moved to New York, where he became a visiting professor at the [[New School for Social Research]], where he founded the ''Research Project on Totalitarian Communication'' (1941–44) alongside [[Hans Speier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kris, Ernst|url= http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd116546344.html|language=de|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he began to work as a lecturer at the [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]] and the [[City College of New York|College of the City of New York]].

In 1945 he co-founded the journal ''The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child'' with [[Anna Freud]] and [[Marie Bonaparte]].

In 1946, Kris became a fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an associate of the [[American Psychological Association]]. He also became a member of the editorial board of the [[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]].

Kris dedicated the last years of his life to the [[psychoanalytic theory]], [[ego psychology]], early childhood development and a theory of psychoanalytic technique.

Kris was one of the first developers of the new ego psychology, a school of psychoanalysis that originated in Freud's [[ego-superego-id model]].
He proposed a new way to enter the unconscious; not via a fast and immediate entrance, but via exploration by the surface. It consists of exposing defense mechanisms and not of exploring the id.

Kris died in New York City in 1957.

'''Johan Ernst Welhaven Sars''' (11 October 1835 &amp;ndash; 27 January 1917) was a Norwegian professor, historian, author and editor. His main work was ''Udsigt over den norske Historie'', four volumes issued from 1873 to 1891. He co-edited the magazines ''Nyt norsk Tidskrift'' from 1877 to 1878, and ''[[Nyt Tidsskrift]]'' from 1882 to 1887. He was politically active for the [[Liberal Party of Norway]] and among the party's most central theoreticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://denstoredanske.dk/Geografi_og_historie/Norge_og_Sverige/Historikere_-_Danmark,_Sverige,_Norge_og_Finland/Johan_Ernst_Welhaven_Sars|title=Johan Ernst Welhaven Sars|publisher=  Den Store Danske |accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Personal life===
Sars was born in the parish of  [[Kinn]] (now Flora) in [[Sogn og Fjordane|Nordre Bergenhus Amt]] (now Sogn og Fjordane), Norway. He was the son of  [[Michael Sars]] (1805–1869) and [[Maren Sars|Maren Cathrine Welhaven]] (1811–1898). His father was vicar at [[Kinn Church]] and at [[Manger Church]] and was professor of zoology at the [[University of Christiania]] from 1854.  His mother was a sister of poet [[Johan Sebastian Welhaven]] and author [[Elisabeth Welhaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://nbl.snl.no/Michael_Sars|title=  Michael Sars|publisher=  Norsk biografisk leksikon |author= Geir Hestmark|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://nbl.snl.no/Maren_Sars|title=  Maren Sars|publisher=  Norsk biografisk leksikon|author= Else Boye|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a brother of singer [[Eva Nansen|Eva Sars]] and zoologist [[Georg Ossian Sars]].  He was a cousin of architect [[Hjalmar Welhaven]] as well as a brother-in-law of explorer and scientist [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and musician [[Thorvald Lammers]]. He was not married, and lived along with his brother at their mother's residence until she died in 1898. He died at [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =  https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/wiki/Ernst_Sars

===Career===
Sars attended the [[Bergen Cathedral School]] from 1849. In 1853 he moved to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo) as a student. 
He initiated studies in medicine, but he started to study history. In 1856, he was awarded the Crown Prince's gold medal (''Kronprinsens gullmedalje'') for having written a prize-winning treatise on the [[Kalmar Union]].
He spent the summers 1858 and 1859 in [[Copenhagen]], in order to copy Norwegian documents in Danish archives. He wrote a pioneering work on [[Denmark–Norway|Norway during the union with Denmark]] ({{lang|no|Norge under Foreningen med Danmark}}), published in four parts between 1858 and 1865. He was appointed   as an assistant at the [[National Archival Services of Norway]] ({{lang-no|Riksarkivet}}) from 1860 to 1874.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

After having received a scholarship he lectured at the [[University of Oslo|University of  Kristiania]] from 1870, where he first introduced the subject [[positivism]], and later lectured on [[Norwegian history]]. His main work was ''Udsigt over den norske Historie'', a continuous treatment of Norwegian history from the [[Viking era]] to contemporary times, which was published in four volumes between 1873 and 1891. The first volume of the series established Sars among the leading intellectuals in Norway. It earned him an extraordinary professorship in 1874, after a [[Norwegian Parliament|Parliamentary]] decision.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Ernst Sars |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Narve |last=Fulsås|authorlink=Narve Fulsås|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Ernst_Sars/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sars co-edited the magazines ''Nyt norsk Tidskrift'' (with [[Jens Lieblein]]) from 1877 to 1878, and ''[[Nyt Tidsskrift]]'' (with [[Olaf Skavlan]]) from 1882 to 1887.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007|title=Ernst Sars |first=Tor Ragnar |last=Weidling |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Ernst_Sars |language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in politics, and was active for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], along with [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; After his publication of ''Historisk Indledning til Grundloven'' (Historical Introduction to the [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]]) in 1882, he was regarded among the Liberal Party's most central theoreticians. He also regarded the dissolution of the [[union between Sweden and Norway]] to be the only practical solution to the conflicts with Sweden. He wrote the work ''Norges politiske historie 1815–85'', published between 1899 and 1904,&lt;ref name=snl/&gt; and continued lecturing until 1911.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary ethics''' is a field of inquiry that explores how evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding of [[ethics]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;William Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology." ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Available online at: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of issues investigated by evolutionary ethics is quite broad. Supporters of evolutionary ethics have claimed that it has important implications in the fields of [[descriptive ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[metaethics]].

Descriptive evolutionary ethics consists of biological approaches to morality based on the alleged role of [[evolution]] in shaping human [[psychology]] and behavior. Such approaches may be based in scientific fields such as [[evolutionary psychology]], [[sociobiology]], or [[ethology]], and seek to explain certain human moral behaviors, capacities, and tendencies in evolutionary terms. For example, the nearly universal belief that incest is morally wrong might be explained as an evolutionary adaptation that furthered human survival.

Normative (or prescriptive) evolutionary ethics, by contrast, seeks not to explain moral behavior, but to justify or debunk certain normative ethical theories or claims. For instance, some proponents of normative evolutionary ethics have argued that evolutionary theory undermines certain widely held views of humans' moral superiority over other animals.

Evolutionary metaethics asks how evolutionary theory bears on theories of ethical discourse, the question of whether objective moral values exist, and the possibility of objective moral knowledge. For example, some evolutionary ethicists have appealed to evolutionary theory to defend various forms of moral anti-realism (the claim, roughly, that objective moral facts do not exist) and moral skepticism.

==History==
The first notable attempt to explore links between evolution and ethics was made by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871). In Chapters IV and V of that work Darwin set out to explain the origin of human morality in order to show that there was no absolute gap between man and animals. Darwin sought to show how a refined moral sense, or conscience, could have developed through a natural evolutionary process that began with social instincts rooted in our nature as social animals.

Not long after the publication of Darwin's ''The Descent of Man'', evolutionary ethics took a very different—and far more dubious—turn in the form of [[Social Darwinism]]. Leading Social Darwinists such as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[William Graham Sumner]] sought to apply the lessons of biological evolution to social and political life. Just as in nature, they claimed, progress occurs through a ruthless process of competitive struggle and "survival of the fittest," so human progress will occur only if government allows unrestricted business competition and makes no effort to protect the "weak" or "unfit" by means of social welfare laws.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Bassham, ''The Philosophy Book: From the Vedas to the New Atheists, 250 Milestones in the History of Philosophy''. New York: Sterling, 2015, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]] roundly criticized such attempts to draw ethical and political lessons from Darwinism, and by the early decades of the twentieth century Social Darwinism was widely viewed as discredited.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''Social Darwinism in American Thought'', rev. ed. Boston: Beacon Press, 1955, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival of evolutionary ethics owes much to E. O. Wilson's 1975 book, ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''. In that work, Wilson argues that there is a genetic basis for a wide variety of human and nonhuman social behaviors. In recent decades, evolutionary ethics has become a lively topic of debate in both scientific and philosophical circles.

==Descriptive evolutionary ethics==
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
The most widely accepted form of evolutionary ethics is descriptive evolutionary ethics. Descriptive evolutionary ethics seeks to explain various kinds of moral phenomena wholly or partly in genetic terms. Ethical topics addressed include altruistic behaviors, an innate sense of fairness, a capacity for normative guidance, feelings of kindness or love, self-sacrifice, incest-avoidance, parental care, in-group loyalty, monogamy, feelings related to competitiveness and [[Retributive justice|retribution]], moral "cheating," and [[hypocrisy]].

A key issue in evolutionary psychology has been how altruistic feelings and behaviors could have evolved, in both humans and nonhumans, when the process of natural selection is based on the multiplication over time only of those genes that adapt better to changes in the environment of the species. Theories addressing this have included [[kin selection]], [[group selection]], and [[reciprocal altruism]] (both direct and indirect, and on a society-wide scale). Descriptive evolutionary ethicists have also debated whether various types of moral phenomena should be seen as adaptations which have evolved because of their direct adaptive benefits, or spin-offs that evolved as side-effects of adaptive behaviors.

==Normative evolutionary ethics==
Normative evolutionary ethics is the most controversial branch of evolutionary ethics. Normative evolutionary ethics aims at defining which acts are right or wrong, and which things are good or bad, in evolutionary terms. It is not merely ''describing'', but it is ''prescribing'' goals, values and obligations. [[Social Darwinism]], discussed above, is the most historically influential version of normative evolutionary ethics. As philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] famously argued, many early versions of normative evolutionary ethics seemed to commit a logical mistake that Moore dubbed the ''naturalistic fallacy''. This was the mistake of defining a normative property, such as goodness, in terms of some non-normative, naturalistic property, such as pleasure or survival.

More sophisticated forms of normative evolutionary ethics need not commit either the naturalistic fallacy or the is-ought fallacy. But all varieties of normative evolutionary ethics face the difficult challenge of explaining how evolutionary facts can have normative authority for rational agents. "Regardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational agent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I instead renounce and resist it as far as I am able?"&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 3.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary metaethics ==
Evolutionary theory may not be able to tell us what is morally right or wrong, but it might be able to illuminate our use of moral language, or to cast doubt on the existence of objective moral facts or the possibility of moral knowledge. Evolutionary ethicists such as [[Michael Ruse]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]], and [[Sharon Street]] have defended such claims.

Some philosophers who support evolutionary meta-ethics use it to undermine views of human well-being that rely upon Aristotelian [[teleology]], or other goal-directed accounts of human flourishing. A number of thinkers have appealed to evolutionary theory in an attempt to debunk [[moral realism]] or support moral skepticism. Sharon Street is one prominent ethicist who argues that evolutionary psychology undercuts moral realism. According to Street, human moral decision-making is "thoroughly saturated" with evolutionary influences. Natural selection, she argues, would have rewarded moral dispositions that increased fitness, not ones that track moral truths, should they exist. It would be a remarkable and unlikely coincidence if "morally blind" ethical traits aimed solely at survival and reproduction aligned closely with independent moral truths. So we cannot be confident that our moral beliefs accurately track objective moral truth. Consequently, realism forces us to embrace moral skepticism. Such skepticism, Street claims, is implausible. So we should reject realism and instead embrace some antirealist view that allows for rationally justified moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Street, "A Darwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value." ''Philosophical Studies'', 127: 109-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of moral realism have offered two sorts of replies. One is to deny that evolved moral responses would likely diverge sharply from moral truth. According to David Copp, for example, evolution would favor moral responses that promote social peace, harmony, and cooperation. But such qualities are precisely those that lie at the core of any plausible theory of objective moral truth. So Street's alleged "dilemma"—deny evolution or embrace moral skepticism—is a false choice.&lt;ref&gt;David Copp, "Darwinian Skepticism about Moral Realism." ''Philosophical Issues'', 18: 186-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second response to Street is to deny that morality is as "saturated" with evolutionary influences as Street claims. William Fitzpatrick, for instance, argues that "[e]ven if there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many of our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral beliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through autonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our mathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, "Morality and Evolutionary Biology," Section 4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variability of moral codes, both across cultures and historical time periods, is difficult to explain if morality is as pervasively shaped by genetic factors as Street claims.

Another common argument evolutionary ethicists use to debunk moral realism is to claim that the success of evolutionary psychology in explaining human ethical responses makes the notion of moral truth "explanatorily superfluous." If we can fully explain, for example, why parents naturally love and care for their children in purely evolutionary terms, there is no need to invoke any "spooky" realist moral truths to do any explanatory work. Thus, for reasons of theoretical simplicity we should not posit the existence of such truths and, instead, should explain the widely held belief in objective moral truth as "an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes in order to get us to cooperate with one another (so that our genes survive)."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ruse and E. O. Wilson, "The Evolution of Ethics." ''New Scientist'', 102: 1478 (17 October 1985): 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here again the central question is whether the influence of evolution on morality is as pervasive as the critics of moral realism claim. If, as seems likely, there are important aspects of morality that cannot be explained in genetic terms, appeals to moral truth may not be explanatory fifth-wheels.

'''''Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition''''' is a book by [[Owen Beattie]] and [[John G. Geiger|John Geiger]], first published in 1987 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]]. The book focuses on the dramatic events surrounding the [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin Expedition]] of 1845-1848, led by [[John Franklin|Sir John Franklin]], as well as the scientific work and forensic testing on the bodies of three perfectly preserved Victorian seamen 138 years after their deaths, solving the mysteries of the Franklin Expedition. In 2004, the authors substantially revised the book, adding an Epilogue and altering and updating the text. [[Margaret Atwood]] wrote an introduction. In 2017, the authors added a new Afterword to the Canadian edition, and a new Foreword by [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]] was added.

== Content ==
''Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition'' has two parts, each covering a certain aspect of the Franklin Expedition. Part One focuses on the history of the expedition and the circumstances that led to its disastrous result, based on the findings of Owen Beattie and his team.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-77164-079-4 "Frozen in Time"]. ''Publishers Weekly'', &lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 1845, Sir John Franklin and a crew of 128 men, along with the [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS Terror]] and [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS Erebus]], set sail from [[Greenhithe]], England in search of the [[Northwest Passage]]. The Northwest Passage is a shipping route through the Arctic archipelago to the Pacific Ocean&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canadianmysteries.ca/sites/franklin/voyage/voyageIntro_en.htm|title=Franklin's Last Voyage (Franklin Expedition)|website=www.canadianmysteries.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was very sought after by the [[Admiralty]] and many sailors, due to its economic value as it was a short route connecting the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific ocean]]. In an effort to traverse the passage, the two ships became icebound on the coast of [[King William Island]] in the Canadian Arctic and the entire expedition was lost with only fragmentary evidence that gave clues to the fate of Franklin and his men. In 1981, Owen Beattie, an associate Professor of [[Anthropology]] at the [[University of Alberta]], led a team of scientists to King William Island where they planned to retrace the steps of dying Franklin crewmen 133 years before&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/mystery-shrouds-fate-of-franklin-s-1845-expedition-1.1147041 "Mystery shrouds fate of Franklin's 1845 expedition"]. ''CBC News'', By Brian Case Aug 03, 2012 &lt;/ref&gt;. Beattie and his team successfully discovered fragmentary remains such as human bones of Franklin crewmen and through scientific analysis, had found cut marks on the bones, corroborating past [[Inuit]] accounts of [[Cannibalism in humans|cannibalism]] being practised among the dying Franklin crewmen.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ualberta.ca/newtrail/winter20122013/features/acoldcase|title=A Cold Case - New Trail|website=www.ualberta.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviewcanada.ca/magazine/2012/05/the-franklin-mystery/ "The Franklin Mystery"]. ''Literary Review of Books'', May 2012 issie. Adriana Craciun.&lt;/ref&gt; Further forensic analysis on the bones also led to the discovery of high [[lead]] levels, which led to the theory that the Franklin crewmen had succumbed to [[lead poisoning]]. The discovery of lead in the bones would lead Beattie and his team to [[Beechey Island]] to exhume the graves of three Franklin crewmen to determine the origins of lead in the expedition and the effect it had on the crewmen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/26/lead-poisoning-polar-sir-john-franklin "Why our explanation of the 1845 polar tragedy should be put on ice"]. ''The Guardian'',  Robin McKie, 26 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Part Two of the book focuses on the exhumation of the three graves on Beechey Island and the autopsies performed on the exhumed bodies of the crewmen to further determine the cause of death. Each grave included a [[headstone]] which provided important details such as name, age and year of death and the graves were of Petty Officer [[John Torrington]], Able-bodied Seaman [[John Hartnell]] and Royal Marine [[William Braine]]. Beattie had obtained exhumation and reburial permits from the government of the [[Northwest Territories]], notification of permission from the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and clearance from the [[Chief Medical Officer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition|last=Beattie|first=Owen|last2=Geiger|first2=John|publisher=Grafton Books|year=1989|isbn=0-586-20320-6|location=Great Britain|pages=96-97}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the book, Beattie and Geiger provide extensive details on the investigation and autopsy work along with photographs of the bodies and the gravesite for later restoration. After careful exhumation, the bodies were shown to be remarkably well preserved, due to the surrounding [[permafrost]], allowing for testing on preserved tissue&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The autopsies determined that [[tuberculosis]], [[scurvy]] and lead poisoning were large factors in the deaths of these men. Near the gravesite, Beattie had discovered a pile of [[Tin can|tin cans]], which was the storage for food on the Franklin expedition. Through forensic testing, the lead [[soldering]] found on the cans matched the lead found in the bodies, determining that lead from the cans had contaminated the food supply and caused the deaths of many in the Franklin expedition. There is a portion of the book in which Beattie and Geiger use the evidence to theoretically reconstruct the final hours of the three Franklin crewmen in a way they believe may have happened as well as theoretical descriptions of how the burial processes transpired on Beechey Island in 1846.

== Reception ==
''Frozen in Time: The Fate of the Franklin Expedition'' became a bestseller in the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany and was published in seven countries. Roy Herbert of ''[[New Scientist]]'' states "The account of the Franklin voyage and its aftermath and then the account of the recent exhumations and autopsies- are enthralling"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=Ow4fxEelljAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=the+account+of+the+franklin+voyage+and+its+aftermath+and+then+the...exhumation+and+autopsies-+are+enthralling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OZj_oFNVAD&amp;sig=AWyWaZatlI0zu6BgpEt06S_caLE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiei_C64brVAhXCX5QKHeURDicQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20account%20of%20the%20franklin%20voyage%20and%20its%20aftermath%20and%20then%20the...exhumation%20and%20autopsies-%20are%20enthralling&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|last=Information|first=Reed Business|date=1987-12-03|publisher=Reed Business Information|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Peter Gorner of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' described it as "Chilling...The scientists' exhumations, autopsies and reburials-replete with haunting photos- will keep you up nights turning pages"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-10-19/features/8802080824_1_franklin-expedition-northwest-passage-british|title=A Challenger-type Disaster, Circa 1848|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Jacket blurbs were provided by [[Margaret Atwood]], who described the research as "A remarkable piece of forensic deduction.", and by [[William S. Burroughs]] who called the book "A cautionary tale of scholarly merit."

'''Geoffrey Haydon Manning''' (1926 – 12 September 2018) was an Australian author and historian, commonly known as Geoff Manning, known particularly for his books on South Australian placenames: first edition ''Romance of Place Names of South Australia'' 1986 followed by ''Manning's Place Names of South Australia'' 1990 and his final illustrated edition of 1,400 pages, ''The Place Names Of Our Land: A South Australian Anthology''.

==History==
Manning was born in [[Waikerie, South Australia]], a son of carpenter Richard Baker Manning (1896–1936) and his wife Grace Maud Manning, née Hein (1901– ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoffmanning.net.au/index.html|title=Geoff Manning: Insight|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was employed by the [[Savings Bank of South Australia]] until his retirement in 1982, since when he has written on local history.
His fully indexed work on South Australian placenames has been digitized by the [[State Library of South Australia]] and is, with his collection of significant articles from South Australian newspapers [http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/manning/search.html freely available on-line]. His works on South Australian placenames contains much information supplemental to, and correcting, the much earlier ''Nomenclature of South Australia'' (1908) by [[Rodney Cockburn]] (1877–1932) and ''What's in a Name'', a revised edition by his son Stewart Cockburn.

==Family==
[[Haydon R. Manning]], political scientist of [[Flinders University]], is a son.

[[File:Lance point.JPG|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;The tip of a gonfalon from the 1839 [[Eglinton Tournament]] as held at [[Eglinton Castle]] in Scotland.]]
The '''gonfalon''', '''gonfanon''', '''gonfalone''' (from the early [[Italian language|Italian]] ''confalone'') is a type of [[heraldic flag]] or [[banner]], often pointed, swallow-tailed, or with several streamers, and suspended from a crossbar in an identical manner to the ancient Roman [[vexillum]]. It was first adopted by Italian [[medieval commune]]s, and later, by local Guilds, Corporations and Districts. The difference between a gonfanon with long tails and a standard is that a gonfanon displays the device on the non-tailed area, and the standard displays badges down the whole length of the flag.&lt;ref&gt;http://donna.hrynkiw.net/sca/flags/gonfanon.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A gonfalon can include a badge or coat of arms, or decoration. Today, every Italian [[comune]] (municipality) has a gonfalon sporting its [[coat of arms]]. The gonfalon has long been used for ecclesiastical ceremonies and processions. The papal "[[ombrellino]]", a symbol of the pope, is often mistakenly called "gonfalone" by the Italians because the pope's ceremonial umbrella was often depicted on the banner.

''Gonfalone'' was originally the name given to a neighbourhood meeting in medieval Florence, each neighbourhood having its own flag and coat of arms, leading to the word Gonfalone eventually becoming associated with the flag.

Gonfalons are also used in some university ceremonies, such as those at [[The College of New Jersey]], [[University of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/uchicagomagazine/3604204346/in/set-72157619305516185/ Alumni Procession]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Rowan University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rowan.edu/events/commencement/undergraduate/symbols.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rutgers University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/inauguration/media-color.html Presidential Inauguration: Pageantry and Color&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princeton University]], [[University of Toronto]], [[Loyola University New Orleans]] and the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stthomas.edu/commencement/video/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Gonfalon of State (Dutch: ''Rijksvaandel'' or ''Rijksbanier'') is part of the [[Regalia of the Netherlands]]. The banner is made of silk and it has been painted with the souvereign's coat of arms as they were in the 19th. century. The Gonfalon of State is only used when a new king or queen is sworn in.

A picture of a gonfalon is itself a [[heraldic charge]] in the coat of arms of the [[County Palatine of Tübingen| Counts Palatine of Tübingen]] and their cadet branches.&lt;ref&gt;attested since the 14th century; it has been suggested that the gonfalon in the Tübingen coat of arms originates as a re-interpretation of the tripod symbol found on ancient coins.

Bericht Jg. 1981, 9.&lt;!--see [[:de:Liste der Wappen mit dem Emblem der Pfalzgrafen von Tübingen]]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==
Gonfalons had great significance as Christian religious objects in Europe during the [[Medieval]] period,&amp;nbsp;{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} especially in central [[Italy]]. These religious objects consisted of a cloth, usually of canvas but occasionally of silk, supported by a wooden frame with a T-shaped support on the back, and a long pole to hold up the banner during ceremonies and processions. The banners were painted with [[tempera]] or [[oil]] paints, sometimes on both sides. Images on the gonfalons included the [[patron saints]] of cities, villages, [[confraternity|confraternities]] or [[guilds]], the [[Virgin and Child]], [[Jesus Christ]], [[God the Father]], plague [[saint]]s, and the Virgin Mary as [[Queen of Heaven]], Mediatrix, [[Theotokos]], or Madonna of Mercy. Because these banners were often associated with a particular group, highly unusual and individual [[iconography]] could appear.

These gonfalons were often commissioned and kept by confraternities, lay religious groups who gathered together for devotional purposes such as the singing of hymns ''(laudae)'', the performance of charitable works, or [[flagellation]]. The banners would be either displayed on the wall of the [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] or packed away until they were needed for their primary use, religious [[processions]]. During processions, the banner would be carried on its pole by members of the confraternity. This devotional act of carrying the banner in procession was believed to be a holy act of worship, and it was hoped that the act would gain divine favour from God, Jesus, Mary, and the saints portrayed on the banner. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, plague banners were produced and carried in processions as a way to plead for divine intercession to prevent or cure the plague.

'''Helen Maud Cam''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FBA|sep=,|size=100}}, [[Royal Historical Society|FRHistS]] (22 August 1885 – 9 February 1968) was an English historian of the [[Middle Ages]]

== Life and career ==
Cam was born at [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]], [[Berkshire]] (now [[Oxfordshire]]).  Educated at home by her father [[William Herbert Cam]], the headmaster of [[Abingdon School]], she did her undergraduate degree at [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway College]]  gaining a [[British undergraduate degree classification|First]] in History there, and later an MA in Anglo-Saxon and Frankish studies at the [[University of London]], after a fellowship year at [[Bryn Mawr College]] This degree led to her first book, ''Local Government in Francia and England, 768–1034'' (1912).

After teaching at [[The Cheltenham Ladies' College|Cheltenham Ladies' College]] and Royal Holloway, she became a fellow of [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], Cambridge in 1921. In 1948 she took up the Zemurray Radcliffe Professorship at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], a position she held until her retirement in 1954.

Cam's focus was on local administration, as opposed to the constitutional and legal history of the dominant historians of the age, [[William Stubbs|Stubbs]] and [[Frederic William Maitland|Maitland]]. Though an admirer of both, she greatly expanded on and revised the work of these men. Her work was of great scholarly value, but she was also able to write successfully for a wider audience, illustrated best by her ''England before Elizabeth'' (1950). She also had an interest in historical fiction, expressed in ''Historical Novels'' (1961). She strongly resented the whitewashing of particular historical figures, such as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32254 :'Nothing roused her wrath more than the attempted whitewashing of certain historical characters, especially Richard III.'&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 she was elected to the [[British Academy]], the third woman to be elected to the fellowship, and in the same year she became the first woman to deliver the Raleigh Lecture there. Cam was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received honorary doctorates from [[Smith College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], and Oxford. She acted as vice-president both of the [[Selden Society]] and of the [[Royal Historical Society]]. In 1957 she was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

'''Historic recurrence''' is the repetition of similar events in [[history]].{{efn|[[Mark Twain]] writes of "a favorite theory of mine—to wit, that no ''occurrence'' [Twain's emphasis] is sole and solitary, but is merely a repetition of a thing which has happened before, and perhaps often."  (A "repeat occurrence" is the definition of "[[:Wiktionary:recurrence|recurrence]]".)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII, p. 64].&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar thought of uncertain attribution has been ascribed to Twain:  "History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/] Quote Investigator, "History Does Not Repeat Itself, But It Rhymes", 2014/01/12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The concept of historic recurrence has variously been applied to the overall [[history of the world]] (e.g., to the rises and falls of [[empire]]s), to repetitive patterns in the history of a given [[polity]], and to any two specific events which bear a  striking similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hypothetically, in the extreme, the concept of historic recurrence assumes the form of the [[Eternal return|Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence]], which has been written about in various forms since [[Ancient times|antiquity]] and was described in the 19th century by [[Heinrich Heine]]{{efn|Philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] quotes [[Heinrich Heine]]: "[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them are also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', 1959, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].{{efn|The concept of "[[eternal recurrence]]" is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It appears in ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', and also in a posthumous fragment. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered the concept in the writings of [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist'', 1959, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, while it is often remarked that "History repeats itself", in cycles of less than [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] duration this cannot be strictly true.{{efn|G.W. Trompf writes:  "The idea of exact recurrence... was rarely incorporated into... these views, for in the main they simply presume the recurrence of ''sorts'' of events, or... event-types, -complexes, and -patterns."&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  In this interpretation of recurrence, as opposed perhaps to the Nietzschean interpretation, there is no [[metaphysics]].  Recurrences take place due to ascertainable circumstances and chains of [[causality]].{{efn|In 1814 [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] published an early articulation of [[causal determinism|causal or scientific determinism]]:  "We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future.  An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect, nothing would be uncertain and the future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], ''A Philosophical Essay'', New York, 1902, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar view had earlier been presented in 1763 by [[Roger Boscovich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Cercignani]], chapter 2:  "Physics before Boltzmann", in ''[[Ludwig Boltzmann]]:  The Man Who Trusted Atoms'', Oxford University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-850154-4}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  An example of the mechanism is the ubiquitous phenomenon of [[multiple independent discovery]] in [[science]] and [[technology]], which has been described by [[Robert K. Merton]] and [[Harriet Zuckerman]].

G.W. Trompf, in his book ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', traces historically recurring patterns of political thought and behavior in the west since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  If history has lessons to impart, they are to be found ''par excellence'' in such recurring patterns.

Historic recurrences of the "striking-similarity" type can sometimes induce a sense of "convergence", "resonance" or ''[[déjà vu]]''.{{efn|This sense is somewhat suggested, in popular culture, by the film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]''.}}

[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Polybius]]]]

Prior to the theory of historic recurrence that was offered by [[Polybius]], a Greek [[Hellenistic Period|Hellenistic]] historian (ca 200 – ca 118 BCE), ancient western thinkers who had thought about recurrence had largely been concerned with [[cosmological]] rather than historic recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 6-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western philosophers and historians who have discussed various concepts of historic recurrence include Polybius, the Greek historian and [[rhetoric]]ian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (c. 60 BCE – after 7 BCE), [[Luke the Evangelist]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1469–1527), [[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744), [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  An eastern concept that bears a kinship to western concepts of historic recurrence is the [[China|Chinese]] concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], by which an unjust ruler will lose the support of [[heaven#Chinese faiths|Heaven]] and be overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth J. Perry|Elizabeth Perry]], ''Challenging the Mandate of Heaven: Social Protest and State Power in China'', Sharpe, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7656-0444-2}}, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

G.W. Trompf describes various historic [[paradigm]]s of historic recurrence, including paradigms that view types of large-scale historic phenomena variously as "cyclical"; "fluctuant"; "reciprocal"; "re-enacted"; or "revived".&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 2-3 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes "[t]he view proceeding from a belief in ''the uniformity of [[human nature]]'' [Trompf's emphasis].  It holds that because human nature does not change, the same sort of events can recur at any time."&lt;ref name="G.W. Trompf, p. 3"&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 3 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; "Other minor cases of recurrence thinking," he writes, "include the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very ''striking similarity'' [his emphasis], and the preoccupation with ''parallelism'' [his emphasis], that is, with resemblances, both general and precise, between separate sets of historical phenomena."&lt;ref name="G.W. Trompf, p. 3"/&gt;

[[File:Arnold J. Toynbee Anefo.jpg|thumb|left|85px|[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]]]

G.W. Trompf notes that most western concepts of historic recurrence imply that "the past teaches lessons for... future action"—that "the same... sorts of events which have happened before... will recur..."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  One such recurring theme was early offered by [[Poseidonius]] (a Greek [[polymath]], native to [[Apamea, Syria]]; ca 135–51 BCE), who argued that dissipation of the old [[Rome|Roman]] virtues had followed the removal of the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] challenge to Rome's supremacy in the [[Mediterranean]] world.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme that [[civilization]]s flourish or fail according to their responses to the human and [[Natural environment|environment]]al challenges that they face, would be picked up two thousand years later by [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold J. Toynbee]], ''[[A Study of History]]'', 12 volumes, [[Oxford University Press]], 1934–61, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (c. 60 BCE{{snd}}after 7 BCE), while praising Rome at the expense of her predecessors{{efn|His was thus a quasi-[[exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] view.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}—[[Assyria]], [[Medes|Media]], [[Persia]], and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]—anticipated Rome's eventual decay.  He thus implied the idea of recurring decay in the history of world [[empire]]s—an idea that was to be developed by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BCE) and by [[Pompeius Trogus]], a 1st-century BCE [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[historian]] from a [[Celt]]ic tribe in [[Gallia Narbonensis]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 186–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 5th century, [[Zosimus]] (also called "Zosimus the Historian"; fl. 490s–510s:  a [[Byzantine]] historian who lived in [[Constantinople]]) could see the writing on the Roman wall, and asserted that empires fell due to internal disunity.  He gave examples from the histories of [[ancient Greece|Greece]] and Macedonia.  In the case of each empire, growth had resulted from consolidation against an external enemy; Rome herself, in response to [[Hannibal]]'s threat posed at [[Cannae]], had risen to great-power status within a mere five decades.  With Rome's world dominion, however, [[aristocracy]] had been supplanted by a [[monarchy]], which in turn tended to decay into [[tyranny]]; after [[Augustus Caesar]], good rulers had alternated with tyrannical ones.  The [[Roman Empire]], in its western and eastern sectors, had become a contending ground between contestants for power, while outside powers acquired an advantage.  In Rome's decay, Zosimus saw history repeating itself in its general movements.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancients developed an enduring [[metaphor]] for a [[polity]]'s evolution:  they drew an [[analogy]] between an individual human's [[Life history theory|life cycle]], and developments undergone by a [[body politic]].  This metaphor was offered, in varying iterations, by [[Cicero]] (106–43 BCE), [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (c. 1 BCE – 65 CE), [[Florus]] (c. 74 CE – ca 130 CE), and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (between 325 and 330 CE – after 391 CE).&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', pp. 188–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[social organism|social-organism]] metaphor would recur centuries later in the works of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903).

[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|105px|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]]]

[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], about to analyze the vicissitudes of [[Florence|Florentine]] and [[Italy|Italian]] politics between 1434 and 1494, described recurrent oscillations between "order" and "disorder" within states:

{{blockquote|when states have arrived at their greatest perfection, they soon begin to decline.  In the same manner, having been reduced by disorder and sunk to their utmost state of depression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend, and thus from good they gradually decline to evil and from evil mount up to good.|}}

Machiavelli accounts for this oscillation by arguing that ''virtù'' (valor and political effectiveness) produces peace, peace brings idleness (''ozio''), idleness disorder, and disorder ''rovina'' (ruin).  In turn, from ''rovina'' springs order, from order ''virtù'', and from this, glory and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Machiavelli, as had the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] historian [[Thucydides]], saw [[human nature]] as remarkably stable—steady enough for the formulation of rules of political behavior.  Machiavelli wrote in his ''Discorsi'':

{{blockquote|Whoever considers the past and the present will readily observe that all cities and all peoples... ever have been animated by the same desires and the same passions; so that it is easy, by diligent study of the past, to foresee what is likely to happen in the future in any republic, and to apply those remedies that were used by the ancients, or not finding any that were employed by them, to devise new ones from the similarity of events.&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Trompf, ''The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought'', p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

In 1377 the [[Islamic]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] observed that new dynasties achieve social cohesion and expand to the limit, but then become sedentary, wedded to luxury, enslaved by their desires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqadimmah]]'', 1377, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joshua S Goldstein]] suggests that empires, analogously to an individual's [[midlife crisis]], experience a [[political midlife crisis]]:  after a period of expansion in which all earlier goals are realized, overconfidence sets in, and regimes are then likely to attack or threaten their nearest rival; Goldstein cites four examples:  the [[British Empire]] and the [[Crimean War]]; the German [[Second Reich]] and [[World War I]]; the [[USSR]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; the [[United States]] and the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua S Goldstein]], ''Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age'', 1988, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Suggestions that the [[European Union]] is suffering a [[political midlife crisis]] have been put forward by [[Gideon Rachman]] (2010), [[Roland Benedikter]] (2014), and [[Natalie Nougayrede]] (2017).  

[[David Hackett Fischer]] has identified four waves in European history, each of some 150-200 years' duration. Each wave begins with prosperity, leading to inflation, inequality, rebellion and war, and resolving in a long period of equilibrium.  For example, 18th-century inflation led to the [[Napoleonic wars]] and later the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[The Great Wave (book)|The Great Wave:  Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History]]'', Oxford University Press, 1996, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Arthur Keith]]'s theory of a species-wide [[amity-enmity complex]] suggests that human conscience evolved as a duality:  people are driven to protect members of their [[in-group]], and to hate and fight enemies who belong to an [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]]. Thus an endless, useless cycle of ''ad hoc'' "isms" arises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Keith]], ''A New Theory of Human Evolution'', Watts, 1948, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
One of the recurrence patterns identified by G.W. Trompf involves "the isolation of any two specific events which bear a very ''striking similarity''".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;   The Spanish-American philosopher [[George Santayana]] observed that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Santayana]], ''The Life of Reason'', vol. 1: ''Reason in Common Sense'', 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Marx]], having in mind the respective [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] of [[Napoleon I]] (1799) and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] (1851), wrote acerbically in 1852: "[[Hegel]] remarks somewhere that all facts and personages of great importance in [[world history]] occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as [[tragedy]], the second time as [[farce]]."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'' (1852), in ''Marx Engels Selected Works'', volume I, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, Poland's [[Adam Michnik]] believes that history is not just about the past because it is constantly recurring, and not as farce, as [[Karl Marx|Marx]] had it, but as itself:  "The world", writes Michnik, "is full of [[inquisitor]]s and [[heretic]]s, liars and those lied to, [[terrorist]]s and the terrorized.  There is still someone [[Thermopylae|dying at Thermopylae]], someone [[Socrates#Trial and death|drinking a glass of hemlock]], someone [[Rubicon|crossing the Rubicon]], someone drawing up a [[proscription|proscription list]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilson (translator)|Paul Wilson]], "Adam Michnik:  A Hero of Our Time," ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 6 (April 2, 2015), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Poland]]'s [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]], [[Stanislaus of Szczepanów|Stanisław Szczepanowski]], is murdered by his former friend, King [[Bolesław the Bold]] (1079), and [[England]]'s Catholic Primate, [[Thomas Becket]], is murdered at the behest of his former friend, King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1170); [[China|Chinese]] Emperor [[Kublai Khan]]'s attempted conquest of [[Japan]] (1274, 1281) is frustrated by [[typhoon]]s (the original ''[[Kamikaze (typhoon)|kamikaze]]'', "divine wind"), and [[Spain|Spanish]] King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]'s attempted conquest of [[England]] (1588) is frustrated by a [[hurricane]]; [[Hernán Cortes]]'s fateful 1519 entry into [[Mexico]]'s [[Aztec Empire]] is reputedly facilitated by the natives' identification of him with their god [[Quetzalcoatl]], who had been predicted to return that very year, and [[England|English]] Captain [[James Cook]]'s fateful entry into [[Hawaii]] (1778), during the annual [[Makahiki]] festival honoring the [[List of fertility deities#Hawaiian|fertility and peace god]] [[Lono]], is reputedly facilitated by the natives' identification of Cook with Lono, who had left Hawaii, promising to return on a floating island, evoked by Cook's ship under full sail. 

In 1812 French Emperor [[Napoleon]]—born a [[Corsica|Corsican]] outsider—unprepared for an extended winter campaign, invades the [[Russian Empire]], precipitating the fall of the French Empire; and in 1941 German ''[[Führer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]]—born an Austrian outsider—unprepared for an extended winter campaign—invades the Russian Empire's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] successor ruled by [[Joseph Stalin]]—born a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] outsider—precipitating the fall of the German [[Thousand-Year Reich]].

[[Polity|Polities]] ignore [[Jan Gotlib Bloch|Jan Bloch]]'s 1898 warnings of the [[railroad]]-[[mobilization|mobilized]], [[industrial warfare|industrialized]], stalemated, [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] [[total war]], [[World War I]], that is on the way and will destroy an appreciable part of mankind;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gotlib Bloch|Jan Bloch]], ''Future war and its economic consequences'', 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; and polities ignore [[geologist]]s', [[oceanographer]]s',  [[atmospheric scientist]]s', [[biologist]]s', and [[climatologist]]s' warnings of the [[climate change|climate-change]] [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] that is on course to destroy all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Busby, "Warming World:  Why Climate Change Matters More Than Anything Else", ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', vol. 97, no. 4 (July / August 2018), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|On 8 October 2018 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] published a report stating that, if drastic changes in the global [[energy]] base and lifestyle are not made by about 2030—within a dozen years—civilization on planet Earth will become unsalvageable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], ''Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C'', 8 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Martin Amis 2012 by Maximilian Schoenherr.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Martin Amis]]]]

British novelist [[Martin Amis]] observes that recurring patterns of [[empire|imperial]] ascendance-and-decline are mirrored in the [[novel]]:  novels seem to follow the political power.  In the 19th century, when [[United Kingdom|Britain]] was ascendant on the planet, British novels were huge and tried to express what the whole society was.  British [[hegemony]] waned with [[World War II]] and ended after the war.  The British novel was then some 225 pages long and centered on narrower subjects such as career setbacks or marriage setbacks:  the British novel's "great tradition" increasingly looked depleted.  Ascendance had passed to the [[United States]], and Americans such as [[Saul Bellow]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Philip Roth]], and [[John Updike]] began writing huge novels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Tanenhaus]], "The Electroshock Novelist:  The Alluring Bad Boy of Literary England Has Always Been Fascinated by Britain's Dustbin Empire.  Now [[Martin Amis]] Takes On American Excess," ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 2 &amp; 9, 2012, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The British victory at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815 heralded the beginning of a new world order in which [[United Kingdom|Britain]] would be the supreme world power for the next one hundred years. At the time of Waterloo, the British Empire consisted of the [[New World]] territories in the [[West Indies]] and [[North America]] which had been retained following the loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. In addition to this, there was the penal colony of [[New South Wales]], the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] at the entrance to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and the territories controlled by the [[British East India Company]]. Victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] brought spoils to Britain which added more territories such as [[Malta]], [[British Guiana]], and [[Mauritius]] to the empire. It was the beginning of a golden era for Britain, and the new [[Royal Mint]] at [[Tower Hill]] coined a new [[gold sovereign]] in 1817. At the same time, the [[Spanish Empire]] was in decline with revolutions underway in the New World. The silver [[Spanish dollar|Spanish pieces of eight]] that had formed the staple international currency for nearly four hundred years were mostly minted at the New World mints at [[Potosí]], [[Mexico]], and [[Lima]]. The supplies of these silver dollars were cut off due to revolutionary wars, and since Britain had formally adopted a successful [[gold standard|gold specie standard]] in 1821, the British government decided in 1825 to introduce the sterling coinage in all of its colonies. An imperial order-in-council was issued to set ratings for the sterling coinage against the already-circulating [[Spain|Spanish]] and other foreign coins, for the purposes of facilitating the transition to sterling.

While this measure was remarkably unsuccessful in the [[British North American colonies]] and initially in some of the [[British West Indies]], the situation in New South Wales was different due to the absence of any already fully entrenched monetary system. As such, the British sterling currency was adopted in New South Wales with relative ease, and as this region of British influence expanded over the course of the nineteenth century to incorporate the rest of the Australian continent, New Zealand and a large number of Pacific islands, the British sterling currency followed.

==Monetary union==

From the latter half of the 19th century until the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], a [[monetary union]], based on the British gold sovereign existed in a part of the British Empire. This sterling part of the British Empire mainly consisted of Australia, New Zealand, the British Islands in the Pacific, British Southern Africa, [[British West Africa]], the British West Indies, Gibraltar, Malta, and the South Atlantic territories. It had been the plan of the British government in 1825 to have sterling coinage circulating in all of the British colonies. But, by the 1860s, the British government had given up trying to impose sterling coinage in territories such as [[Canada]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[British India]], and [[Hong Kong]] against resistance from existing entrenched practices, just as the British East India Company has similarly given up trying to impose the [[rupee]] on the [[Straits Settlements]]. Eventually even India and the Straits Settlements adopted a sterling exchange standard, leaving only Canada, Newfoundland, [[British Honduras]], and Hong Kong totally outside the sterling system.

This sterling monetary union existed throughout much the same period that the [[Latin Monetary Union]] existed, and in both cases, the First World War was the major factor that signalled the end of the union. In both cases, the union was maintained by virtue of the gold specie standard. During the period of monetary union, a standard issue of sterling coinage, minted at the Royal Mint at Tower Hill, [[London]] circulated in the United Kingdom, Australia and its dependencies such as [[Papua New Guinea]], New Zealand and its dependencies such as [[Western Samoa]], as well as in [[Fiji]] and the [[British Western Pacific Territories]]. As regards paper money, banknotes were issued by banks in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], Australia, and New Zealand.

In 1910, Australia introduced its own coinage in the likeness of sterling coinage. It was much the same as the United Kingdom's coinage, differing mainly in the use of distinctive Australian symbols on the reverse. At the same time, the law prohibited Australian banks from issuing banknotes, and such authority was reserved for the newly formed [[Commonwealth Bank]]. This left an interesting situation in which Australian private banknotes were limited to circulation in New Zealand, and such Australian notes were marked with the words New Zealand. This action by Australia in issuing its own national variety of sterling coinage had no practical effect on the monetary union as such. Initially, these Australian coins were minted at the Royal Mint at Tower Hill, London, despite the fact that there were three Royal Mint branches operating in Australia at that time. The reason was that these Australian branch mints, in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], only had the facilities to mint gold sovereigns. However, by 1916, the Australian varieties of sterling coinage were being minted locally.

With the suspension of gold coin payouts on the outbreak of the First World War, the binding factor was removed and paper money in the respective territories became unanchored and hence free to float, to the extent that the common coinage would permit. In the case of Australia, there was no complication because distinct Australian coins already existed. In the case of New Zealand and Fiji, the situation could have potentially proved to be problematic, but the issue didn't arise until the [[Great Depression]].

The Great Depression was the catalyst that forced more dramatic shifts in the exchange rates between the various pound units, and by 1934 both New Zealand and Fiji began to issue their own varieties of the sterling coinage.

==Australia==

Australia returned to the gold standard in 1925 in conjunction with the United Kingdom and [[South Africa]]. As in the case of the United Kingdom, there was no return to a gold specie standard, but rather the introduction of a gold bullion standard{{efn|In a gold specie standard, coins circulate which contain an amount of gold equivalent to the face value of the coin, while in a gold bullion standard the actual circulating money is exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold bullion on demand.}}. This once again formally locked the pound in Australia to parity with the pound in the United Kingdom. During the period between 1914 and 1925, the telegraphic money transfers between London and Australia had deviated somewhat from parity, but at that time, it was merely seen as a temporary hitch due to the emergency and the suspension of the gold standard. Nobody considered the [[Australian pound]] as such to be a separate currency from sterling. 
However, in 1929 the Great Depression struck, and the raw producing nations in the southern hemisphere, such as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], Australia, and New Zealand were the first to feel the effects. The Australian banks that controlled the exchanges with London began to sell the Australian unit at a discount in order to increase the competitiveness of their exports to London. The gold standard in Australia was simultaneously abandoned and the Australian pound was now at a 25% discount to the pound sterling.

When the United Kingdom itself then abandoned the gold standard in 1931, this opened up certain questions for the first time. What does an Australian pound mean if it is not connected to gold? It was decided after 1931 to formally peg the Australian pound at a fixed 25% discount to the pound sterling and to define it as just that. Hence, the Australian pound maintained its close connection with the pound sterling and when the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out in 1939, Australia joined the [[sterling area]] which was an emergency wartime measure designed to protect the pound sterling's external value, principally against the [[US dollar]].

In 1966, the Australian pound was decimalized at a rate of two new Australian dollars. When the pound sterling was devalued in 1967, the Australian unit did not follow suit but continued to peg to sterling at a new fixed rate. In 1971 Australia changed its peg to the US dollar and in June 1972, the sterling area as an exchange control area was shrunk to include only the British Isles. In September 1972, Australia responded by amending its own exchange control legislation accordingly, and with the floating of the British unit, which began in June 1972, all former connection between the two currencies had effectively come to an end.

==New Zealand==

Unlike Australia, in the critical period between 1914 and the Great Depression, New Zealand did not have anything that corresponded to a central bank or a monetary authority. New Zealand's link to the pound sterling was purely through the gold specie standard, and when the gold specie standard was suspended at the outbreak of the First World War, the linkage was based on nothing other than existing practice. The banks controlled telegraphic transfers between New Zealand and London, and so the exchange rate was entirely in their hands. New Zealand was now effectively on a sterling exchange standard, controlled by the largely Australian trading banks, and this sterling exchange standard became a gold exchange standard for the period between 1925 and 1931 when the United Kingdom was on a gold bullion standard. 

It wasn't however until the Great Depression that the Australian banks created any substantial divergence from the traditional one-to-one parity between the London pound and the New Zealand pound. Australian and New Zealand raw exports to London were badly hit by the depression, and in an attempt to sustain demand, the Australian banks decided to sell the New Zealand pound at a 9% discount, taking the exchange rate to 110 New Zealand pounds to 100 pounds sterling by 1931. As this was new territory in the history of money, the situation became somewhat confused because a state of affairs now existed in which the exchange rate between Australia and New Zealand was at par and did not correspond to their respective exchange rates with London. 
By 1933 the situation had settled to a state of affairs in which the New Zealand pound and the Australian pound were both at a 20% discount with respect to the London pound, taking the exchange rate to New Zealand 125 pounds equaling 100 pounds sterling. New Zealand joined the sterling area in 1939 at the outbreak of the Second World War and in 1948, the New Zealand pound once again returned to parity with the pound sterling.

In 1967, New Zealand decimalised its pound into two new New Zealand dollars and later that year, when the pound sterling was devalued, New Zealand took the opportunity to realign its new dollar to parity with the Australian dollar.

In 1971, New Zealand changed its peg to the US dollar, and in 1972, just like the United Kingdom and Australia, New Zealand ended its sterling area-based exchange control laws.

==Fiji==

From its earliest days as a British colony, British sterling coinage circulated in Fiji, supplemented by locally produced paper money. In 1917, as a wartime emergency measure, the Fijian treasury issued paper money for Fiji in lieu of British gold sovereigns. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Australian and New Zealand banks devalued the pound in their respective territories in order to bolster their exports to the UK. These same banks controlled the exchange rate for Fiji, and in 1933 the [[Fijian pound]] was devalued to £1.2.2 Fijian = £1 sterling in order to bring it into line with the devalued New Zealand pound, even though the New Zealand pound would very shortly devalue further to bring it into line with the devalued Australian pound. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the sterling area was set up as an exchange control area for the purposes of protecting the external value of the pound sterling, principally against the US dollar. Fiji immediately joined the sterling area.

When the pound sterling was devalued on 20 November 1967, Fiji immediately followed suit. However, over the next week, Fiji considered the adverse effects that this devaluation would have on imports to Fiji while keeping an eye on how Australia and New Zealand were going to respond to the situation. On 28 November 1967, Fiji decided to partially revalue its pound, hence resulting in a sterling exchange rate of £104.10.0 Fijian = £100 sterling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119705084/PDFSTART]&lt;/ref&gt; This had the effect of bringing the Fijian pound closer to its original relationship to Australian and New Zealand pounds prior to the upheavals which took place in the exchange rates at the time of the Great Depression. In 1969, the Fijian pound was replaced by the [[Fijian dollar]] at a rate of 1 Fijian pound = 2 Fijian dollars such that the new Fijian dollar was approximately equal to the new dollars in Australia and New Zealand.

In June 1972 the United Kingdom unilaterally ended its sterling area-based exchange control laws and floated the pound sterling. On 30 June 1972, Fiji enacted with similar legislation, thus ending any formal relationship between the British and the Fijian units.

==The Western Pacific High Commission Territories==

The British governor on Fiji also had responsibility for other groups of Pacific islands in his capacity as [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific]]. This jurisdiction included the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate]], the Anglo-French condominium known as the [[New Hebrides]], [[Nauru]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]], and the [[Kingdom of Tonga]]. In the mid-1930s there was confusion on these territories as to whether or not the pound unit of account represented a pound sterling or an Australian pound. Clarification was requested and it was decided that all sterling accounts in these territories, with the exception of the Pitcairn Islands, should be taken to mean the Australian pound. In the case of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, this was confirmed by King's regulations in 1935. Territories under direct Australian jurisdiction such as Papua New Guinea also used the Australian pound, while territories under New Zealand jurisdiction, such as Western Samoa and the [[Cook Islands]], as well as the Pitcairn Islands used the New Zealand pound. Hence there were now a total of three different pound units in use in the Australasian and Pacific region, none of them being equal to the pound sterling. There was the Australian pound, the Fijian pound, and the New Zealand pound. However, the New Zealand pound, as stated above, did return to parity with the pound sterling in 1948.

The ''' Industrial Heritage Association of Ireland''' ('''IHAI''') is an all-Ireland body set up in 1996 to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of sites, monuments and items of machinery that together constitute Ireland's industrial heritage and to encourage its protection by the relevant statutory authorities.&lt;ref name="bed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ihai.ie/ | title=Industrial Heritage Association of Ireland website | publisher=IHAI | accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IHAI functions as a link between government organisations, NGOs, and individuals working in the field of industrial heritage. By providing opportunities for open discussion and debate the IHAI advances awareness, enjoyment, and conservation of the many facets of industrial heritage.

One of the main objectives of the IHAI is the establishment of a national inventory of industrial sites. To this end, the Heritage Council assisted by publishing ''Recording and Conserving Ireland’s Industrial Heritage: An Introductory Guide to help public bodies, professionals, voluntary organisations and site owners in the identification, recording, conservation and protection of industrial sites''.&lt;ref name="ham"&gt;{{cite book | title=Recording and Conserving Ireland’s Industrial Heritage: An Introductory Guide to help public bodies, professionals, voluntary organisations and site owners in the identification, recording, conservation and protection of industrial sites. | author1=Hammond F |author2= McMahon M| year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IHAI engages with the public through conferences, workshops, field tours, lectures and publications, special-interest societies, as well as government and non-governmental organisations. Their conferences have covered a range of topics and the papers presented have been published by the IHAI, the most recent being ''Archaeology of Irish Industry: Recent Excavations'' (2009). Other titles include ''The Industrial Heritage of North East Ireland'' (2002); ''Power from Steam'' (1998); and ''Taking Stock of Ireland’s Industrial Heritage'' (1998).

The IHAI produces a Newsletter three times a year chronicling the activities of the IHAI and the industrial heritage sector in Ireland generally. Past newsletters are available to the general public on the IHAI website and are a source of information on publications relating to aspects of Ireland’s industrial heritage.

The '''Institute for Study of the Jewish Question''' or '''Institute for Research of the Jewish Question'''  (''Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage'') was a [[Nazi Party]]-political institution, founded in April 1939.&lt;ref name="Grimsted"&gt;Grimsted, Patricia Kennedy (2005). "Roads to Ratibor: Library and archival plunder by the Einsatz Reichsleiter Rosenberg." ''Holocaust and Genocide Studies'', vol. 19, no. 3. pp. 390-458; here: p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMB"&gt;"[http://www.jmberlin.de/raub-und-restitution/en/glossar_i.php Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage (IEJ)]" In: ''Glossary''. [[Jewish Museum, Berlin|Jüdisches Museum Berlin (Jewish Museum Berlin)]]. Retrieved 2015-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived as a branch of a [[Advanced School of the NSDAP|projected elite university]] of the party under the direction of [[Alfred Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="Grimsted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMB"/&gt; it officially opened in [[Frankfurt | Frankfurt am Main]] in March 1941, during the [[World War II|Second World War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMlcJ7QkM_QC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=Institute+for+Study+of+the+Jewish+Question+Gerhard+Kittel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pAG5v9u0JG&amp;sig=afp-ih5bjm0wft8lO957Cb2jB8o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tKahU_3DM9CK4gTStoD4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Institute%20for%20research%20of%20the%20Jewish%20Question%20was%20created%20in%201941&amp;f=false|title=Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany|author=Alan E Steinweis|year=2009|isbn=0674043995|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=12, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimsted"/&gt; and remained in existence until the end of the war, in 1945.

It should not be confused either with [[Goebbels]]'s propaganda ministry, the ''{{ill|Institut zum Studium der Judenfrage|de}}'' (Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question), later renamed to ''{{ill|Antisemitische Aktion|de}}'' (Anti-Semitic Action) and then again to ''{{ill|Antijüdische Aktion|de}}'' (Anti-Jewish Action).  In [[occupied France]], the ''[[Institut d'étude des questions juives]]'' (Institute for the Study of Jewish Affairs) was a propaganda institution established in Paris in 1943 by the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German military command]].

When the Institute was founded, the official journal "''Ziel und Weg''" (i.e. "''Goal and Way''") of the National Socialist German Doctors' League (NSDÄB), which was led by [[Leonardo Conti]], welcomed the new institution and demanded: "The Half-Jew has to be treated like the Full-Jew ... so that he is no danger for the protection of the racial value of the European peoples."&lt;ref&gt;"Handbuch des Antisemitismus. Judenfeindschaft in Geschichte und Gegenwart", Volume 6: Publications; by Brigitte Mihok, de Gruyter, {{ISBN|3110258722}}, page 780; Original German:"Der Halbjude muss wie der Volljude behandelt ... werden, daß er keine Gefahr für die Erhaltung des rassischen Wertes der europäischen Völker bildet."&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute cooperated with [[Walter Frank]]'s "Reich Institute for the History of the New Germany", especially with its "Research Department for the Jewish question" which was led by the demographer Dr. Friedrich Burgdörfer, who had published the pamphlet "Are the White Nations Dying? The Future of the White and the Colored Nations in the Light of Biological Statistics" which became the origin of the [[White genocide conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Burgdörfer, Sterben die weißen Völker? Die Zukunft der weißen und farbigen Völker im Lichte der biologischen Statistik, Munich, Callwey, 1934, 88 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's journal "The World-Struggle. Monthly for Global Politics, Racial Culture and the Jewish Question in all Countries" (Der Weltkampf. Monatsschrift für Weltpolitik, völkische Kultur und die Judenfrage aller Länder) was edited by [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow]]; contributors included [[Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch]] and [[Johann von Leers]].

Its effective aim was information-gathering for [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] purposes in support of [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policy and, later, the [[Holocaust]].

Dr. '''Jacob Wilson Chikuhwa''' is an author and leading political and cultural historian of [[Zimbabwe]]. Now retired and living in Sweden, he is the author of thirteen books on Zimbabwe, and is a lecturer and painter. Chikuhwa also operates the Chiedza Business Consultancy, a company based in [[Stockholm]], Sweden which offers seminars in business management.

==Early years==
In 1959, [[Edgar Whitehead]]'s government of [[Southern Rhodesia]] banned the ANC ([[African National Congress]]) and arrested nearly 500 leaders including one of young Jacob Chikuhwa's teachers. Shortly thereafter, the National Democratic Party against minority rule was formed and lasted less than two years. When the NDP was banned, the Zimbabwe African People's Union ([[ZAPU]]) was formed and Jacob Chikuhwa was a member of the youth league involved in political activities against colonial rule.

==In exile==
Chikuhwa was arrested in 1964 for his involvement in the resistance.&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt; Following his release from detention, he escaped into [[Zambia]] and later got a scholarship to study in the former Soviet Union where he received degrees in Economics and International Relations from the Kiev Institute of National Economy in Ukraine. Dr. Chikuhwa sought political asylum in Sweden where he attended the University of Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.algora.com/85/book/details.html |title=A Crisis of Governance - Zimbabwe - Jacob Chikhuwa - About the Author |publisher=Algora Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 1970s he became the publicity secretary for [[ZANU]] in Northern Europe, establishing a monthly Journal Zimbabwe Chimurenga/Impi yeNkululeko (Zimbabwe Revolution). He returned to Zimbabwe in 1981, following decolonization,&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/zimbabwe-marks-20-years-of-freedom-in-silence-721767.html |title=Zimbabwe marks 20 years of freedom in silence |first=Alex Duval |last=Smith |date=18 April 2000 |publisher=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; but left again in 1989 to return to Sweden.&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt;

==Zimbabwe historian==
Because of his close contact with Zimbabwean government officials dating back to his detention and time in exile, Dr. Chikuhwa published his first book on Zimbabwe in 1998. Dr. Chikuhwa was in Zimbabwe when the opposition party, the [[Movement for Democratic Change (pre-2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) participated in the June 2000 parliamentary election, and March 2002 presidential election, and has described being tortured by ZANU-PF officials for his MDC involvement during that period.&lt;ref name="manus"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.manusgruppen.se/dag_boecker/jacob_chikuhwa.htm |title=Jacob Chikuhwa |publisher=Projektet Manusgruppen |date=19 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since returned to Sweden where he became MDC Representative in Scandinavia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/artikel.asp?programid=1650&amp;artikel=2208649 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914040006/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/artikel.asp?programid=1650&amp;artikel=2208649 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 September 2012 |title=MDC om att försonas med Mugabe och debatt om kameraövervakning i Malmö |date=23 July 2008 |language=Swedish |publisher=Sveriges Radio 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and now writes full-time and lectures on Zimbabwe, in the US and Sweden.

He said in parliament upon being sworn in:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the saddest day in our nation's history. Tears have engulfed our nation and we are deeply saddened and distraught and I'm personally devastated, I've lost a father, I've lost a friend, I've lost a mentor and a senior comrade.

As a result of his elevation to the presidency, Mahama made political history by becoming the first [[List of heads of state of Ghana|Ghanaian head of state]] to have been born after Ghana's [[declaration of independence]] on 6 March 1957{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. The National Democratic Congress (NDC) held a Special National Delegates Congress on 30 August 2012 and endorsed President John Dramani Mahama as its 2012 presidential candidate. President Mahama, the sole candidate of the party, polled 2, 767 votes, representing 99.5% of total votes cast, to pick the slot for the party.&lt;ref name="ndc endorses president mahama as 2012 presidential candidate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allghananews.com/politics/5110-ndc-endorses-president-mahama-as-2012-presidential-candidate |title=ALL GHANA NEWS - My bid for President is no melodrama-Akpaloo |author=GNA |work=allghananews.com |accessdate=5 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112122741/http://www.allghananews.com/politics/5110-ndc-endorses-president-mahama-as-2012-presidential-candidate |archivedate=12 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahama has stated that his administration is deeply committed to continuing the [[Better Ghana Agenda]] started under President Mills.

Mahama won the [[Ghanaian general election, 2016|December 2012 general election]] with 50.70% of the total valid votes cast and a 3% winning margin beating his nearest rival, [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] of the main opposition [[New Patriotic Party]], who polled a close 47.74%.  This was just barely enough to win the presidency without the need for a runoff.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In addition, Mahama won the majority of valid votes cast in eight out of Ghana's ten administrative regions. Thirteen African Heads of State, one Prime Minister, two Vice-Presidents and 18 government delegations across the world attended his inaugural ceremony at the [[Black Star Square]] in [[Accra]] on 7 January 2013, when Mahama was sworn-in to begin his own four-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/201212/99293.php |title=11 Heads of States to attend Mahama's inauguration |author=Michael Ofori Amanfo Boateng |work=myjoyonline.com |accessdate=5 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222102/http://edition.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/201212/99293.php |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his investiture, the opposition [[New Patriotic Party]] led by its 2012 presidential candidate [[Nana Akufo-Addo]], running mate Dr [[Mahamudu Bawumia]] and the party chairman [[Jacob Otanka Obetsebi-Lamptey]], challenged the election results, alleging irregularities, malpractices, omissions and violations. The petition was heard by nine justices of the [[Supreme Court of Ghana]]. After eight months of hearing, the Court on 29 August 2013 dismissed the petition by a majority opinion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

'''Jules Schelvis''' (7 January 1921 – 3 April 2016) was a Dutch historian, writer, [[Holocaust survivor]], and [[Nazi hunter]]. He lost his wife and most of his family during [[The Holocaust]]. Schelvis was a [[plaintiff]] and [[expert witness]] during the trial of [[John Demjanjuk]].&lt;ref name="SoInt"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Netherlands Institute for War Documentation (NIOD) |title=Jules Schelvis (Amsterdam, 7 January 1921 – 3 April 2016, Amstelveen)  |at=Dutch Jews who survived Sobibor |url=https://www.sobiborinterviews.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14 |author=''Sobiborinterviews.nl''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AsPr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sobibor death camp survivor Jules Schelvis dies at 95 |author=Associated Press |date=4 April 2016 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3523047/Sobibor-death-camp-survivor-Jules-Schelvis-dies-95.html |work=Obituary in the New York Times |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd |via=Internet Archive |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160404174339/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-3523047/Sobibor-death-camp-survivor-Jules-Schelvis-dies-95.html |archivedate=April 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Schelvis was rounded up in [[Amsterdam]] along with his family on 26 May 1943 during the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="SoInt"/&gt; He was deported to [[Westerbork]] and after 6 days boarded the [[Holocaust train]] to [[Sobibor]]. The journey lasted for 4 days. At the ramp, Schelvis was separated from his family and selected to join the work unit sent to [[Lublin Reservation]] labour camp in [[Dorohucza]] to build latifundia of [[General Plan Ost]]. The Poles and Dutchmen, covered in lice, received one litre of soup per day, and sometimes dog meat. From there he was sent to the [[Radom Ghetto]], to work in the weapons factory, where he witnessed the ghetto liquidation action on 8 November 1943. He was sent on a [[death march]] to [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]]. From there he eventually reached Vaihingen near Stuttgart, where he was liberated by the French army on 8 April 1945.&lt;ref name="SoInt"/&gt;

'''Karl Maria Prosper Laurenz Brandi''' (20 May 1868 – 9 March 1946) was a German historian.{{sfn|Sabine Krüger|1955}}

In 1890&amp;ndash;91, he wrote his dissertation on the Reichenauer documents: ''Die Reichenauer Urkundenfälschungen'', which served as Volume 1 of ''Quellen und Forschungen zur Geschichte der Abtei Reichenau''. He followed his teacher to Berlin in 1891&amp;ndash;95. The Munich Historical Commission directed him to complete the [[death|posthumous]] works on [[August von Druffel]]'s contributions to imperial history and the [[Council of Trent]], ''Monumenta Tridentina''. In 1895 he completed his own habilitation in Göttingen. From 1902 until his retirement in 1936, and again, from the outbreak of [[World War II]] until shortly before his death, he held a professorship for German History at the [[University of Göttingen]].  His study of the court of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], maintaining it was an amalgamation of Burgundian and Spanish traditions is considered a ground breaking, although problematic, shift in the study of the importance of Charles' reign.{{sfn|Sabine Krüger|1955}}&lt;ref&gt;Aurelio Espinosa, ''The Empire of the Cities: Emperor Charles V, the Comunero Revolt, and the Transformation of the Spanish System.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5822">'''Konstantin Feodosyevich Shteppa''', {{lang-ru|Константин Феодосьевич Штеппа}}, also '''Step(p)a''' (3 December 1896, [[Lokhvytsia]], [[Poltava Governorate]] — 19 November 1958, [[New York City]]) was a Soviet and American historian of German-Ukrainian descent. He studied history of the Byzantine Empire, the Orthodox Church, late medieval history of Ukraine and the history of Stalin's purge. Being an [[NKVD]] informant, he switched allegiance to [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] during World War II and immigrated to the US after the war.

== Biography ==
Born into a family of an Orthodox priest of German descent in Ukraine. He studied history in Petrograd University, was a White Army officer during the Civil War. He was able to conceal his anti-Soviet past and became a prominent Soviet historian, head of the Chair of Antiquity and the Middle Age in [[Kiev University]], later dean of the historical faculty in the same university, deputy of Kiev city council. He co-authored with [[Oleksander Ohloblyn]] several propaganda articles against the "Russian imperial chauvinism and local nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.org.ua/zbirnyk/problems/12.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 to 1938 he was an NKVD informant. In February 1938 he was arrested for his alleged anti-Soviet sentiments. While he was in prison, his baby daughter died of hunger. In 1939 he was released without explication and restored to his professor position in the University; Ukrainian historians blame him of continued cooperation with NKVD.

During the German occupation he shortly worked as head of education department in the city administration and head of [[Kiev University]] (which was dissolved soon afterwards). He conflicted with the mayor of Kiev, [[Volodymyr Bahaziy]] and his supporters, a group of pro-Melnyk Ukrainian nationalists, which resulted in their arrest and execution, as well as banishment of the city newspaper "The Ukrainian Word". As a result, Shteppa was appointed editor-in-chief of the newly created newspaper "The New Ukrainian Word" (which, contrary to the dissolved one, was published in Russian). The newspaper took an open pro-German stance and criticized the "nationalist" policy of the previous city administration.

At the end of the war Shteppa worked in mass media of general [[Andrei Vlasov]]'s movement. His son Erasm was conscripted to Wehrmacht in 1944, was captured by the Soviets and spent subsequent 20 years in prison before he was able to emigrate to Germany.

Shortly after the war he met [[Fritz Houtermans]], a renowned physicist who had been his cell mate in 1938. The latter provided him and his family permits to stay in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=3gtLN3I0n_cC&amp;pg=PA414&amp;lpg=PA414&amp;dq=shteppa+houtermans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G7wsxaX4B0&amp;sig=gIO8CSVk4ZzgSLnNFcNafQ6P7RI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o_o2Vb-nE8udygTSjYCwCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=shteppa%20houtermans&amp;f=false T. Powers. Heisenberg's war]. p. 414&lt;/ref&gt; Later they co-authored a book "Russian Purge and the Extraction of Confession",&lt;ref&gt;Beck, F. and Godin, W. "Russian Purge and the Extraction of Confession" (Hurst and Blackett, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; which was published under the pseudonyms of Beck and Godin in order to protect their many friends and colleagues back in the USSR.&lt;ref name="Khriplovich, 1992, 35"&gt;Khriplovich, Iosif B. The Eventful Life of Fritz Houtermans, Physics Today Volume 45, Issue 7, 29 – 37 (1992), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1950s Shteppa himself managed to emigrate to the US with the rest of his family, where he worked as a history professor, published articles and books on the Soviet and Russian history. His role in persecutions of Ukrainian nationalists in Kiev under the German occupation was never forgotten and forgiven by them. [[Oleksander Ohloblyn]] ignores Shteppa in his publications on the modern Ukrainian historiography.

Shteppa's daughter Aglaia Gorman published a book of reminiscences about the family's history.

[[File:Portrait of Lenord C. Bruno.jpg|alt=|thumb]]
'''Leonard C. Bruno''' (born 1944) was the Science Manuscript Historian and subject specialist in the Manuscript Division at the [[Library of Congress]]. Amongst his books are reference guides to the library's collections in the [[history of science]]. After more than forty years of service at the Library of Congress he retired in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Achenbach|first=Joel|title=Library of Congress obtains astronomer Carl Sagan's personal papers|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/jun/29/saving-sagans-legacy-famed-astronomers-papers-find/?print|newspaper=Washington Post|date=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lesser Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Małopolska}}, {{lang-la|Polonia Minor}}) is a historical region (''dzielnica'') of [[Poland]]; its capital is the city of [[Kraków]].

It should not be confused with the modern [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]], which covers only the south-western part of Lesser Poland (darker rose on map to the right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotka.mol.uj.edu.pl/ho-conference/html/krakow.html|work=Heme Oxygenases 2007 Conference|publisher=[[Jagiellonian University]]|title=About Kraków|accessdate=14 August 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715084251/http://biotka.mol.uj.edu.pl/ho-conference/html/krakow.html|archivedate=15 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historical Lesser Poland was much bigger than the current [[Voivodeship (Poland)|voivodeship]] that bears its name. It reached from [[Bielsko-Biała]] in the south-west as far as to [[Siedlce]] in the north-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/web/geography/regions/malopolska/link.shtml|title=Malopolska (Little Poland)|publisher=University at Buffalo, [[SUNY]]|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604233223/http://info-poland.buffalo.edu/web/geography/regions/malopolska/link.shtml|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of the three voivodeships of [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków]], [[Sandomierz Voivodeship|Sandomierz]] and [[Lublin Voivodeship (1474–1795)|Lublin]]. 

It comprised almost 60,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area; today's population in this area is about 9,000,000 inhabitants. Its landscape is mainly hilly, with the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the south; it is located in the basin of the upper [[Vistula]] River. It has been noted for its mighty [[aristocracy]] (''[[magnat]]eria'') and rich [[nobility]] (''[[szlachta]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=1wpCTcAOhwMC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=malopolska%20nobles%20magnates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a2DxHgNivd&amp;sig=tBVQ0_1IYWtM109jif1VUHzWMto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4tarMk77SAhXJkZQKHf2fBE4Q6AEINDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=malopolska%20nobles%20magnates&amp;f=false|title=What Makes the Nobility Noble?: Comparative Perspectives from the Sixteenth to the Twentieth Century|first1=Christian|last1=Wieland|first2=Jörn|last2=Leonhard|date=18 May 2011|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|accessdate=5 March 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wider sense (see [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]]), Lesser Poland from the 14th century also encompassed [[Red Ruthenia]]. From the 16th century it included [[Podlachia]], [[Podolia]] and parts of modern [[Ukraine]].

In the era of partitions, the southern part, known as [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], was sometimes also called Lesser Poland. As a result of this long-lasting division, many inhabitants of the northern part of the pre-partition region of Poland (including those in such cities as [[Lublin]], [[Radom]], [[Kielce]] and [[Częstochowa]]) do not recognize their Lesser Polish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288|last=Podraza|first=Antoni|title=Małopolska w przeszłości i dziś|publisher=Wspólnota Małopolska|date=1 June 1999|quote=Czy dzisiejszy mieszkaniec Kielc, Radomia albo Lublina poczuwa się do tego, że pochodzi z Małopolski?

However, while [[Lublin]] ''(Lubelskie)'' was declared an independent Voivodeship as early as 1474,&lt;ref&gt;http://teatrnn.pl/leksykon/node/1819/lublin_pod_rządami_pierwszych_jagiellonów_1434–1474#6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026171952/http://teatrnn.pl/leksykon/node/1819/lublin_pod_rz%C4%85dami_pierwszych_jagiellon%C3%B3w_1434%E2%80%931474 |date=26 October 2016 }} Lublin pod rządami pierwszych Jagiellonów 1434–1474&lt;/ref&gt;  it still has speakers of the [[Lesser Polish dialect]]. In addition, it has various local traditions as well as cuisine that have been carried forward since the time of Lesser Poland.

== Geography and boundaries ==
[[File:ProwincjaMalopolska.png|thumb|right|The [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown]] in the widest sense &amp;ndash; with [[Red Ruthenia]], [[Podlachia]], [[Podolia]] and [[Kijowszczyzna|Kiev]]]]

Lesser Poland lies in the area of the upper confluence of the [[Vistula]] river and covers a large upland, including the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]] with the [[Kraków-Częstochowa Upland]] further west, [[Małopolska Upland]], [[Sandomierz Basin]], and [[Lublin Upland]]. Unlike other historical parts of the country, such as [[Kujawy]], [[Mazovia]], [[Podlachia]], [[Pomerania]], or [[Greater Poland]], Lesser Poland is mainly hilly, with Poland's highest peak, [[Rysy]], located within the borders of the province. Flat are northern and central areas of the province – around [[Tarnobrzeg]], [[Stalowa Wola]], [[Radom]] and [[Siedlce]], also valleys of the main rivers – the Vistula, the [[Pilica (river)|Pilica]], and the [[San (river)|San]]. Apart from Rysy, there are several other peaks located in the province – [[Pilsko]], [[Babia Góra]], [[Turbacz]], as well as [[Łysica]] in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains. Southern part of the province is covered by the [[Carpathian Mountains]], which are made of smaller ranges, such as [[Pieniny]], [[Tatra Mountains|Tatry]], and [[Beskids|Beskidy]].

Siebenbuergen nebst Theilen der angraenzenden Laender  | year=1525 | title=Claudii Ptolemaei geographicae enarrationis libri octo | language=Latin, German }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Almost whole area is located in the Vistula Basin, with the exception of western and southern parts, belonging to the [[Oder|Odra]] and [[Danube|Dunaj]] Basins. Main rivers of the province are the Vistula, upper [[Warta]], [[Soła]], [[Skawa]], [[Raba (river)|Raba]], [[Dunajec]], [[Wisłok]], [[Wisłoka]], [[San (river)|San]], [[Wieprz]], [[Przemsza]], [[Nida (river)|Nida]], [[Kamienna (river)|Kamienna]], [[Radomka]], and Pilica. Major lakes of the province are: [[Lake Rożnów]], [[Lake Czchów]], [[Lake Dobczyce]], [[Lake Czorsztyn]], [[Lake Czaniec]], [[Lake Międzybrodzie]], [[Lake Klimkówka]] and [[Żywiec Lake]]. Most of them are man-made reservoirs.

Lesser Poland stretches from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in the south to Pilica and [[Liwiec]] rivers to the north. It borders Mazovia to the north, [[Podlaskie Voivodeship|Podlaskie]] to the northeast, [[Red Ruthenia]] to the east, [[Slovakia]] to the south, [[Silesia]] to the west, and Greater Poland to the northwest. Currently, the region is divided between Polish [[voivodeship]]s – [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] (whole), Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship (whole), [[Silesian Voivodeship]] (eastern half), [[Podkarpackie Voivodeship]] (western part), [[Masovian Voivodeship]] (southern part), [[Łódź Voivodeship]] (southeastern corner), and [[Lublin Voivodeship]] (western part).

In Silesian Voivodeship, the border between [[Silesia]] and Lesser Poland is easy to draw, because with few exceptions, it goes along boundaries of local [[powiat|counties]]. In the south, it goes along western boundary of ancient [[Duchy of Teschen]], with the borderline along the [[Biała (Vistula)|Biała]] river, where [[Zwardoń]], [[Milówka, Silesian Voivodeship|Milówka]], and [[Rajcza]] are in Lesser Poland. [[Bielsko-Biała]] is a city made of two parts – Lesser Poland's Biala (also called ''Biala Krakowska''), makes eastern half of the city, and only in 1951 it merged with Silesian Bielsko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powiat-bielsko-biala.info/powiat|title=Bielsko-Biała – najważniejsze informacje|publisher=Powiat Bielsko-Biała|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231451/http://www.powiat-bielsko-biala.info/powiat|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further north, the border goes along western boundaries of cities of [[Jaworzno]], and [[Sosnowiec]], along the [[Przemsza]] and [[Brynica]] rivers.

Historically, Lesser Poland was divided into two lands - Kraków Land and Sandomierz Land, both of which emerged after the [[Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty]]. In the 14th century, [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]] and [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]] were created, and in 1474, [[Lublin Voivodeship (1474–1795)|Lublin Voivodeship]] was carved of three Sandomierz Voivodeship counties, located on the right bank of the [[Vistula]]. Historian Adolf Pawiński, who in the late 19th century was director of [[Polish Central Archives of Historical Records]], estimated in his book "Polska XVI wieku pod względem geograficzno-statystycznym", that the size of Kraków Voivodeship was 19,028&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Sandomierz Voivodeship had the area of 25,762&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;., and Lublin Voivodeship - 11,033&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Together with the [[Duchy of Siewierz]] (607&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.), and the parts of [[Spiš]] that belonged to Poland after the [[Treaty of Lubowla]] (1211&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.), total area of Lesser Poland was 57,640 square kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=1814&amp;from=publication|title=Małopolska.

== Origin of the name ==
[[Zygmunt Gloger]] in his work ''Historical geography of land of ancient Poland'' (''Geografia historyczna ziem dawnej Polski'') states that according to a Polish custom, whenever a new village was formed next to an older one, the name of the new entity was presented with an adjective ''little'' (or ''lesser''), while the old village was described as ''greater''. The same procedure was used in naming these two Polish provinces{{snds}}the "older" one, the cradle of the Polish state, was called ''Greater Poland'', while her "younger sister", which became part of Poland a few years later, was called ''Lesser Poland''. The name Greater Poland (''Polonia Maior'') was for the first time used in 1242, by princes Boleslaw and [[Przemysł I of Greater Poland|Przemysław I]], who named themselves ''Duces Majoris Poloniae'' (''Princes of the Older Poland'').{{sfn|Gloger|1903|p=170}} Lesser Poland, or ''Polonia Minor'', appeared for the first time in historical documents in 1493, in the [[Statutes of Piotrków]], during the reign of King [[Jan Olbracht]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polityka.pl/archive/do/registry/secure/showArticle?id=2004047 Jerzy Krasuski, Inne spojrzenie na początki Polski.

[[File:Sokolica a1.jpg|thumb|[[Pieniny|Pieniny National Park]]]]

=== Early period and Kingdom of Poland ===
In the first years of Polish statehood, southern Lesser Poland was inhabited by the [[West Slavs|West Slavic tribe]] of [[Vistulans]], with two major centers in Kraków and [[Wiślica]]. Their land, which had probably been part of [[Great Moravia]], and [[Bohemia]],{{sfn|Lerski|1996|p=309}} was annexed by [[Mieszko I of Poland]] some time in the late 10th century. Cosmas of Prague in his ''Chronicle of Bohemians'' wrote: "Polish prince Mieszko, a cunning man, seized by ruse the city of Kraków, killing with sword all Czechs he found there".{{sfn|Cosmas of Prague|2006|p=155}} Northern part of Lesser Poland (Lublin and Sandomierz) was probably inhabited by another tribe, the [[Lendians]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyklady.ekpu.lublin.pl/wyklady/segedaew4.htm Kievan Rus and the Old Polish state: historical parallels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009083120/http://www.wyklady.ekpu.lublin.pl/wyklady/segedaew4.htm |date=9 October 2011 }}"Lendizi (Lędzianie), who, according to G. Lovmyansky, inhabited Sandomierz–Lublin area"&lt;/ref&gt; and dr Antoni Podraza, historian of the [[Jagiellonian University]] claims that ancient division of Lesser Poland into two major parts – Land (Duchy) of Kraków, and Land (Duchy) of Sandomierz, is based on the existence of two Slavic tribes in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288 Antoni Podraza, Małopolska w przeszłości i dziś] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626172228/http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288 |date=26 June 2015 }}"Można sądzić, że pierwotny podział Małopolski na dwie części, krakowską i sandomierską, wiąże się właśnie z istnieniem nie jednego, a dwóch plemion na tym obszarze"&lt;/ref&gt; However, exact location of the Lendians has not been determined to this day. Some historians speculate that they occupied Red Ruthenia, and their center was in [[Przemyśl]].{{sfn|Labuda|1988|pp=167–211}}
Around the year 1000, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kraków]] was created, and its borders covered whole area of Lesser Poland. During the reign of [[Casimir I the Restorer]], Kraków for the first time became the capital of Poland (around 1040), since Greater Poland and [[Silesia]], with main Polish urban centers, such as [[Gniezno]] and [[Poznań]] were ravaged by Duke [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] of [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malopolskie.iap.pl/?id=30876&amp;location=f&amp;msg=1 Official portal of Lesser Poland Voivodeship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123094601/http://www.malopolskie.iap.pl/?id=30876&amp;location=f&amp;msg=1 |date=23 November 2009 }} "W roku 1038 Polske najechal czeski ksiaze Brzetyslaw I.

[[Bolesław III Wrymouth]] created the [[Seniorate Province]], which, among others, consisted of Kraków. At the same time, Lesser Poland was divided into two parts, when its eastern part formed the [[Duchy of Sandomierz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staypoland.com/cityHistory.aspx?TownId=67 StayPoland portal.

During the [[History_of_Poland#Fragmentation|fragmentation period]], both lands of Lesser Poland were frequently ruled by the same prince. Among them were [[Bolesław IV the Curly]], [[Mieszko III the Old]], [[Casimir II the Just]], [[Leszek I the White]], [[Bolesław V the Chaste]], [[Leszek II the Black]], [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]], and [[King of Bohemia]], [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]], who united Lesser Poland in 1290/1291. The province was pillaged during the Mongol invasion of Poland, when a combined army of Kraków and Sandomierz was destroyed by [[Baidar]] in the [[Battle of Chmielnik]]. The loss was so heavy that [[Norman Davies]] wrote: "At Chmielnik, the assembled nobility of Małopolska perished to a man."{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=71}} During their [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|1241]], [[Second Mongol invasion of Poland|1259]], and [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland|1287]] invasions, the Mongols burned major cities of Lesser Poland, killing thousands of people. Furthermore, the province, especially its northeastern part, was often raided by the [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], [[Rus' (people)|Rusyns]], [[Yotvingians]], and [[Old Prussians]]. The city of Lublin suffered most frequently – among others, it was burnt by the Rusyns in 1244, the Lithuanians 1255, the Prussians in 1266, and the Yotvingians in 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnn.pl/Konflikty_przygraniczne_1241_-_1288,2752.html |title=History of Lublin, Border conflicts 1241–1288 |publisher=Tnn.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053908/http://www.tnn.pl/Konflikty_przygraniczne_1241_-_1288,2752.html |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another center of the province, Sandomierz, was destroyed by the Tartars in 1260,{{sfn|Bedford|2008|p=224}} and burnt by the Lithuanians in 1349.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dziedzictwo.ekai.pl/@@sandomierz_katedra |title=The cathedral of Sandomierz |publisher=Dziedzictwo.ekai.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009095028/http://dziedzictwo.ekai.pl/@@sandomierz_katedra |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zamek w Będzinie.jpg|thumb|[[Będzin]] Castle, which guarded the western border of Lesser Poland]]
Unlike other Polish provinces, especially [[Silesia]], Lesser Poland did not undergo further fragmentation, and in the early 14th century became the core of the reunited nation (together with Greater Poland).&lt;ref&gt;[http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/coe21/publish/no15_ses/13_purchla.pdf Malopolska or Galicia.

The ceremony took place in Kraków's [[Wawel Cathedral]], and the king of the reunited country decided to choose Kraków as the capital. Through 14th and 15th centuries, Lesser Poland's position as the most important province of the nation was cemented. It became visible during the reign of [[Casimir III the Great]], who favored less known Lesser Poland's noble families, at the expense of Greater Poland's nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Grzesiek Supeł |url=http://www.wiw.pl/historia/poczet/termin.asp?et=kazimierz_wielki |title=Kings of Poland – Kazimierz Wielki |publisher=Wiw.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220944/http://www.wiw.pl/historia/poczet/termin.asp?et=kazimierz_wielki |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reign of Casimir the Great was a period of growing prosperity of Lesser Poland. With high density of population, fertile soils and rich deposits of minerals (especially salt in [[Bochnia]] and [[Wieliczka]], as well as lead in [[Olkusz]]), the province was the richest part of Poland. After annexation of [[Red Ruthenia]], Lesser Poland lost its status of the borderland, and both regions created an economic bridge between Poland and the ports of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Lerski|1996|p=309}} The king, who drew Jewish [[Casimir III the Great#Relationship with Polish Jews|settlers from across Europe to his country]], built several castles along western border of Lesser Poland, with the most notable ones in [[Skawina]], [[Pieskowa Skała]], [[Będzin Castle|Będzin]], [[Lanckorona]], [[Olkusz]], [[Lelów]], [[Bobolice Castle|Bobolice]], [[Krzepice]], [[Ogrodzieniec]], [[Ojców]], [[Olsztyn, Silesian Voivodeship|Olsztyn]], [[Bobolice]], [[Mirów, Silesian Voivodeship|Mirów]] (see also [[Eagle Nests Trail]]). Furthermore, he built or strengthened castles in other parts of the province, such as [[Szydlow]], [[Chęciny Castle|Chęciny]], [[Wiślica]], Radom, [[Niedzica Castle|Niedzica]], Opoczno, [[Lublin Castle|Lublin]], [[Sandomierz Castle|Sandomierz]], as well as the [[Wawel Castle]].

In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]], Lesser Poland was made of three [[voivodeship]]s – [[Kraków Voivodeship (14th century – 1795)|Kraków Voivodeship]], [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]], and [[Lublin Voivodeship (1474–1795)|Lublin Voivodeship]], created in 1474 out of eastern part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship.&lt;ref name="nowamalopolska.pl"&gt;[http://www.nowamalopolska.pl/newsysn/formatka.php?idwyb=288 Antoni Podraza, Małopolska w przeszłości i dziś.

The only exception was large part of contemporary [[Upper Silesia]] (the area around [[Bytom]], [[Toszek]], [[Siewierz]], and [[Oświęcim]]), which belonged to Duchy of Kraków until 1179. In that year, prince of Kraków [[Casimir II the Just]], handed these lands to Prince of [[Opole]] [[Mieszko I Tanglefoot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bytom.pl/pl/9/1197155410/1197128419/4 |title=History of Bytom |publisher=Bytom.pl |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007170713/http://www.bytom.pl/pl/9/1197155410/1197128419/4 |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Duchy of Siewierz]], ruled since 1443 by the [[Archbishop of Kraków]], merged with Lesser Poland in 1790. Other Silesian realms lost in 1179, also returned to Lesser Poland – [[Duchy of Zator]] (in 1513), and [[Duchy of Oświęcim]] (1564). Both duchies merged into a Silesian County of the Kraków Voivodeship, and shared the fate of Lesser Poland. Apart from Jews, among other ethnic minorities of the province were the [[Walddeutsche]], who settled the borderland of Lesser Poland and Red Ruthenia (14th through 17th centuries). In the Middle Ages, the Germans inhabited several cities of Lesser Poland, especially Kraków and Sandomierz (see [[Rebellion of wójt Albert]]).

In the late [[Middle Ages]], Lesser Poland gradually became the center of Polish statehood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.poland.com/texts/en/t-ap-4-1.php|title=LESSER POLAND|publisher=Poland.com portal|accessdate=19 April 2011|quote=However, already by the mid-11th century Lesser Poland had risen in status to be Poland's principal province.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715101725/http://travel.poland.com/texts/en/t-ap-4-1.php#|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kraków being the capital of the country from the mid-11th century until 1596.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Lesser Poland remained the most important part of the country. After the death of Casimir the Great, Lesser Poland's nobility promoted [[Louis I of Hungary]] as the new king, later supporting his daughter [[Jadwiga of Poland]] in exchange for [[Privilege of Koszyce]]. Since Jadwiga, crowned on 16 October 1384, was too young to rule the country, Poland was in fact governed by the Lesser Poland's nobility, who decided to find her a husband, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Grand Duke of Lithuania]], [[Jogaila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historia.gazeta.pl/historia/1,99863,6713823,krolowa_Jadwiga_Andegawenska.html |title=Królowa Jadwiga Andegaweƒska, by Martyna Bandurewicz, Gazeta Wyborcza, 12 June 2009 |publisher=Historia.gazeta.pl |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009063604/http://historia.gazeta.pl/historia/1,99863,6713823,krolowa_Jadwiga_Andegawenska.html |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, unions of Poland and Lithuania at [[Union of Krewo|Krewo]] and [[Union of Horodło|Horodło]] were the brainchildren of Lesser Poland's nobility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omp.org.pl/index.php?module=subjects&amp;func=viewpage&amp;pageid=615 Wladyslaw Konopczynski – O idei jagielloƒskiej] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110507/http://www.omp.org.pl/index.php?module=subjects&amp;func=viewpage&amp;pageid=615 |date=16 July 2011 }} "Unia krewska i horodelska byly dzielem panów malopolskich"&lt;/ref&gt; among whom the most influential individuals were [[Spytek z Melsztyna (died 1399)|Spytek z Melsztyna]], and cardinal [[Zbigniew Oleśnicki (cardinal)|Zbigniew Olesnicki]]. Other famous Lesser Poland's families are [[Lubomirski family]], [[Kmita family]], [[Tarnowski family]], [[Potocki family]], [[Sobieski family]], [[Koniecpolski family]], [[Ossolinski family]], [[Poniatowski family]].

Since Lesser Poland was the most important province of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|the country]], several important events took place on its territory. In 1364, Casimir the Great called the [[Congress of Kraków]], and in 1401, the [[Union of Vilnius and Radom]] was signed. In 1505 in Radom, the Sejm adopted the [[Nihil novi]] title, which forbade the King to issue laws without the consent of the nobility. In the same year, also in the same city, Polish law was codified in the [[Łaski's Statute]], and the [[Crown Tribunal]] (the highest appeal court in the Crown of the Polish Kingdom) held its sessions in Lublin. In 1525, the [[Treaty of Kraków]] was signed, ending the [[Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521)|Polish–Teutonic War]]. Lesser Poland also is home to the oldest Polish university – the [[Jagiellonian University]], founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great, and several outstanding figures of early Polish culture were born here, such as [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Mikołaj Rej]], [[Jan z Lublina]], [[Mikołaj Gomółka]], [[Maciej Miechowita]], [[Marcin Kromer]], [[Łukasz Górnicki]], and [[Mikołaj Radomski]].

=== Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ===
In the 16th century, Lesser Poland retained its position as the most important province of the country. As no major conflicts took place on its territory, it was the center of [[Renaissance in Poland]]. The province was home to numerous scholars, writers and statesmen, and it was here where [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was created in 1569 (see [[Union of Lublin]]). In the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland proper was the base of the [[Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown|Province of Lesser Poland]], which covered southern lands of the vast country. The province was made of Lesser Poland itself, also [[Red Ruthenia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Podolia]], and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] voivodeships – [[Kiev Voivodeship|Kijów Voivodeship]], [[Chernihiv Voivodeship|Czernihów Voivodeship]], and [[Bracław Voivodeship]], which, until 1569, had been part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

The period in Polish history known as the [[Polish Golden Age]] was very fortunate for Lesser Poland. Kings of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]], especially [[Sigismund I the Old]] (himself born in Lesser Poland's [[Kozienice]]), and his son [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (born in Kraków), resided in Kraków, which was the capital of the immense Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth. Lesser Poland's prosperity was reflected in numerous examples of [[Renaissance]] architecture complexes, built across the province. In 1499, hiherto [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Wawel Castle]] was damaged in a fire, and a few years later, Sigismund I, with help of the best native and foreign artists (such as Francesco the Florentine, Bartholomeo Berrecci or Niccolo Castiglione&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krakow-poland.com/Tourist-Attractions/Wawel-Castle-Krakow,he |title=Wawel – the Seat of Kings |publisher=Krakow-poland.com |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915094954/http://www.krakow-poland.com/Tourist-Attractions/Wawel-Castle-Krakow,he |archivedate=15 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) refurbished the complex into a splendid Renaissance palace. Furthermore, in the early 16th century, several palaces were built in Lesser Poland – in [[Drzewica]], [[Szydłowiec]], [[Ogrodzieniec]], and [[Pieskowa Skała]]. The province became rich mostly due to the grain trade, conducted along the Vistula, and among cities which prospered in the 16th century, there are Kraków, Sandomierz, Lublin, [[Kazimierz Dolny]], [[Pilzno]], [[Tarnów]], Radom, [[Biecz]]. In later years of the 16th century, further palaces were built or remodelled in [[Baranow Sandomierski]], and [[Niepołomice]].

In the early 16th century, [[Protestant Reformation]] spread across the Commonwealth, and Lesser Poland became one of early centers of the movement, when students from [[Wittenberg]] brought the news to Cracow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/westciv/reformat/poland.htm |title=Dr. E.

He actively supported the notions of [[Martin Luther]], and in 1528 was called to the Bishop of Kraków's court. Convinced of heresy, he was forced to leave Poland in 1535. Reformation soon became very popular among Lesser Poland's nobility, especially [[Calvinism]], and according to one estimate, some 20% of local [[szlachta]] converted from Roman Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marek Kurkierewicz |url=http://www.magazyn.ekumenizm.pl/content/article/20041209161417737.htm |title=Marek Kurkierewicz, Reformacja na ziemiach polskich, published in Magazyn Teologiczny Semper Reformanda |publisher=Magazyn.ekumenizm.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009134447/http://www.magazyn.ekumenizm.pl/content/article/20041209161417737.htm |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were attracted by Calvinism's democratic character, and Lesser Poland's center of the movement was set in the town of [[Pińczów]], which came to be known as ''Sarmatian Athens''. It was in Pińczów, where a local nobleman converted a Roman Catholic parish into a Protestant one, opened a Calvinist Academy, and published its Antitrinitarian confession in 1560 and in 1561.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanunitarian.org/hillarsocinian1.htm |title=ocinian Precursors of the American Constitutional Separation of Church and State by Marian Hillar, Houston, Texas |publisher=Americanunitarian.org |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927143710/http://www.americanunitarian.org/hillarsocinian1.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Calvinist synods took place in Lesser Poland – the first one in [[Słomniki]] (1554), Pińczów (the first united Synod of Poland and Lithuania – 1556{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=143}} 1561), and Kraków (1562). In 1563, also in Pińczów, the so-called [[Brest Bible]] was translated into Polish language. In 1570, the [[Sandomierz Agreement]] was signed by a number of Protestant groups, with the exception of the [[Polish Brethren]], another religious group very influential in Lesser Poland. The Brethren had their center in Lesser Poland's village of [[Raków, Kielce County|Raków]], where a main Arian printing press, as well as a college, known as Akademia Rakowska (''Gymnasium Bonarum Artium'') founded in 1602 were located. Among distunguished European scholars associated with the school, there were [[Johannes Crellius]], [[Corderius]], and [[Valentinus Smalcius]] (who translated into German the [[Racovian Catechism]]).

In 1572, the Jagiellon dynasty died out, and next year, [[Henry III of France]] became first elected king of the country. After his short reign, and [[War of the Polish Succession (1587–88)]], which also took place in Lesser Poland, the new ruler was [[Stephen Báthory of Poland]], who died in 1586. The ruler from [[Transylvania]] was followed by [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Sweden, whose election marked gradual decline of the province. Sigismund's eyes were set on Sweden, and for many years he concentrated his efforts on a futile attempt to regain his former Swedish throne (see [[Polish–Swedish union]], [[War against Sigismund]]). Therefore, Lesser Poland, located in southwestern corner of the Commonwealth, began to lose its importance, which was marked in 1596, when Sigismund moved his permanent residence, court and the crown headquarters to centrally-located Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawhotelstart.com/ Tourist Information – Warsaw Hotel Start] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030022311/http://www.warsawhotelstart.com/ |date=30 October 2009 }} "Its central location was the main reason for holding royal elections here.

Even though first half of the 17th century was filled with wars, all major conflicts did not reach Lesser Poland, and the province continued to prosper, which was reflected in its castles and palaces, such as the enormous [[Krzyztopor]]. Apart from minor wars, such as [[Zebrzydowski Rebellion]], and [[Kostka-Napierski Uprising]], the province remained safe. [[Cossack]]s of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] reached as far west as [[Zamość]] and [[Lwów]], but did not enter Lesser Poland. The province did not witness other wars, such as [[Polish–Swedish War (1626–29)]], [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)]], [[Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21)]], and [[Smolensk War]]. Nevertheless, Lesser Poland's nobility took active part in these conflicts – [[Marina Mniszech]], the daughter of Voivode of Sandomierz, [[Jerzy Mniszech]], was wife of [[False Dmitriy I]], as well as [[False Dmitriy II]]. Furthermore, Lesser Poland's lands, especially its northeastern part, became a base for Polish troops, fighting the Cossacks, and King [[John II Casimir Vasa]] often stayed in Lublin with his court, preparing military campaigns in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnn.pl/Powstanie_Chmielnickiego_w_Lublinie_1648_%E2%80%93_1655,2788.html |title=Chmielnicki Uprising in Lublin 1648–1655 |publisher=Tnn.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053925/http://www.tnn.pl/Powstanie_Chmielnickiego_w_Lublinie_1648_%E2%80%93_1655,2788.html |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed with the outbreak of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)]]. In October 1655, the Russo-Cossack armies under [[Ivan Vyhovsky]] entered eastern Lesser Poland, reaching the Vistula, and pillaging Lublin, [[Puławy]], and [[Kazimierz Dolny]]. The invaders quickly retreated, but a few months later, Lesser Poland was [[Deluge (history)|flooded]] by the [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]].

The invaders seized the capital of Lesser Poland after a [[Siege of Kraków (1655)|short siege]], and their occupation of the province was confirmed after their victories in the [[Battle of Wojnicz]], and the [[Battle of Golab]]. In those years, one of the most important and symbolic events in the history of the nation took place in Lesser Poland. It was the [[Siege of Jasna Góra]], which, according to some accounts, turned the course of the war. Furthermore, following the [[Treaty of Radnot]], Lesser Poland was invaded in January 1657 by [[George II Rákóczi]], whose troops caused more destruction. Foreign armies were not chased out of Lesser Poland until 1657, Kraków itself was recaptured on 18 August 1657. After these invasions, the province was ruined, with hundreds of villages, towns and cities burned. The population decreased (the urban population by nearly half&lt;ref&gt;Jaroslav Miller. ''Urban Societies in East-Central Europe''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. 2008. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;), the peasantry starved, and like other parts of the Commonwealth, Lesser Poland was devastated. The period of peace lasted for about forty years, when in 1700, another major conflict, the [[Great Northern War]] began. Lesser Poland once again became a battleground, with [[Battle of Kliszów]] taking place there in 1702, and the [[Sandomierz Confederation]] formed in 1704.

After the conflict, Lesser Poland began a recovery, which was hampered by several other factors. Province's cities frequently burned (Lublin 1719, Nowy Targ 1784, Nowy Sącz, Dukla 1758, Wieliczka 1718, Miechów 1745, Drzewica), there also were numerous outbreaks of plagues and typhus (in 1707–1708, some 20,000 died in Kraków and its area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wawel.net/liczby_kleski.htm |title=Krakow in dates and figures |publisher=Wawel.net |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110137/http://www.wawel.net/liczby_kleski.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Lesser Poland was one of main centers of the [[Bar Confederation]]. On 21 June 1786 in Kraków, local confederation was announced, and on the same day Voievode of Kraków, Michal Czarnocki, urged his citizens to join the movement. Soon afterwards, Kraków was captured by the Russian troops, and the center of Lesser Poland's insurgency moved to the mountainous south – areas around Dukla and Nowy Sącz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beskidniski.pl/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=258&amp;page=2 |title=Beskid Niski – informacje regionalne |publisher=Beskidniski.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009172903/http://www.beskidniski.pl/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=258&amp;page=2 |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Confederation, several battles and skirmishes took place there. In 1770, after the Battle of Iwonicz, the Russians ransacked Biecz. The movement ended in 1772, and its decline was connected with the [[Partitions of Poland]]. Another local center of the movement was [[Jasna Góra Monastery]] in Częstochowa, which was defended by [[Kazimierz Pulaski]] for almost two years (1770–1772).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krakow-info.com/czestoch.htm|title=Krakow Info - Czestochowa Sanctuary - Jasna Gora monastery - Our Lady of Czestochowa|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401092924/http://www.krakow-info.com/czestoch.htm|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partitions of Poland (1772–1918) ===
The [[Partitions of Poland]] began earlier in Lesser Poland than in other provinces of the country. In 1769, [[Austrian Empire]] annexed a small territory of [[Spisz]], and next year, the towns of [[Czorsztyn]], Nowy Sącz and Nowy Targ.{{sfn|Davies|2005|p=393}} In 1771, the Russians and the Prussians agreed on the first partition of the country, and in early 1772, Austrian Emperor [[Maria Theresa]] decided to join the two powers. In the first partition of the Commonwealth, the Austrians seized the territory which would later be called [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and which included southwestern corner of Lesser Poland (south of the Vistula river), with Żywiec, Tarnów, and Biecz, but without major urban centers of the province, such as Kraków, Sandomierz, Radom, Lublin, Częstochowa, and Kielce.

[[File:Sandomierz Wisła Statki.jpg|thumb|Vistula in [[Sandomierz]]]]
Second Partition of Poland (1793) did not result in significant changes of boundaries in the area, as the Austrian Empire did not participate in it. However, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] moved on, and in 1793 they annexed northwestern corner of the province, together with the city of Częstochowa,&lt;ref name="1909 guide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Częstochowa – Local history|publisher=Museum of the History of Polish Jews|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/czestochowa/3,local-history/|quote=In 1793, Częstochowa found itself annexed to Prussia.|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723112518/http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/czestochowa/3,local-history/|archivedate=23 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its vicinity, which became part of the newly created province of [[South Prussia]]. Therefore, in late 1793, Lesser Poland was already divided between three countries – Austrian Empire (south of the Vistula), Kingdom of Prussia (Częstochowa and northwestern corner), and still existing Commonwealth. After the Third Partition (1795), most of Lesser Poland was annexed by Austria, with all major cities. Prussia managed to seize a small, western part of the province, with the towns of [[Siewierz]], [[Zawiercie]], [[Będzin]], and [[Myszków]], calling this land [[New Silesia]], while the Austrians decided to name newly acquired lands of northern Lesser Poland [[West Galicia]]. In 1803, West Galicia was merged with [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]], but retained some autonomy. Lesser Poland was one of major centers of Polish resistance against the occupiers. On 24 March 1794 in Kraków, [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] announced the general insurrection (see [[Kosciuszko Uprising]]), mobilising all able males of Lesser Poland. Two weeks later, [[Battle of Raclawice]] took place, ending with a Polish victory. The uprising was suppressed by combined Prusso – Russian forces, and among battles fought in Lesser Poland, there is [[Battle of Szczekociny]].

During [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] was created by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] out of Polish lands which had been granted to Prussia in the Partitions. In 1809, after the [[Polish–Austrian War]], and the [[Treaty of Schönbrunn]], the Duchy was expanded, when northern Lesser Poland was added to its territory (with Kielce, Radom, and Lublin). Following the [[Congress of Vienna]], Duchy of Warsaw was turned into Russian-ruled [[Congress Poland]], and historical capital of the province, Kraków, was turned into [[Free City of Kraków]], which also included the towns of [[Trzebinia]], [[Chrzanów]], [[Jaworzno]], and [[Krzeszowice]]. In Congress Poland, the lands of Lesser Poland were initially divided between four palatinates – Palatinate of Kraków (with capital in Kielce), Palatinate of Sandomierz (with capital in Radom), Palatinate of Lublin, and Palatinate of Podlasie (with capital in Siedlce), (see also [[Administrative division of Congress Poland]]). Later, the palatinates were turned into [[Governorates of the Russian Empire|governorates]]. Thus, Russian part of Lesser Poland was divided into [[Kielce Governorate]], [[Lublin Governorate]], [[Radom Governorate]], [[Siedlce Governorate]], and [[Piotrków Governorate]] (western counties, with Częstochowa and industrial area of [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]]). Borders of these administrative units did not reflect historical boundaries of the province.

[[File:Wappen Königreich Galizien &amp; Lodomerien.png|left|thumb|[[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galizien]]]]
Most of the [[November Uprising]], which began in 1830, missed Lesser Poland, as major battles took place in the area around Warsaw. In early 1831, when Russian forces advanced into Congress Poland, some skirmishes took place in northern counties of the province – at Puławy, Kurow, and Kazimierz Dolny. In early 1846, a group of Polish patriots attempted a failed [[Kraków Uprising|uprising]] in the Free City of Kraków. The insurrection was quickly suppressed by the Austrian troops, and as a result, the Free City was annexed by the Austrian Empire. In the same year, Austrian part of Lesser Poland was witness to a massacre of Polish nobility by the peasantry, known as [[Galician slaughter]]. The peasants, led by [[Jakub Szela]], murdered about 1000 nobles, and destroyed about 500 manors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3965088|title=rabacja galicyjska|publisher=Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|language=Polish|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152642/http://encyklopedia.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=3965088|archivedate=7 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These events took place in three counties – [[Sanok]], [[Jasło]] and [[Tarnów]].

Northern and central Lesser Poland (the part of the province which was taken by the Russian Empire) was one of the main centers of the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864). In the first days of the insurrection, skirmishes with the Russian Army took place in such towns, as [[Łuków]], [[Kraśnik]], [[Szydłowiec]], [[Bodzentyn]], and [[Suchedniów]]. Since the Poles were poorly armed, the Russians did not have major problems with them, and soon afterwards, the insurrectionists decided to organize military camps. Among biggest camps in Lesser Poland, there were [[Ojców]] (3000 soldiers), and [[Wąchock]], where [[Marian Langiewicz]] gathered up to 1500 people. The uprising died out by early spring of 1864, and among counties where it continued for the longest time, was the extreme northeastern corner of Lesser Poland, around Łuków, where reverend [[Stanisław Brzóska]] was active. Since Russian military supremacy was crushing, the Poles were forced to limit their actions to guerrilla warfare. Among the biggest battles which took place in Lesser Poland there are: Battle of [[Szydłowiec]] (23 January 1863); Battle of [[Miechów]] (17 February 1863); Battle of [[Małogoszcz]] (24 February 1863); Battle of [[Staszów]] (17 February 1863); Battle of [[Pieskowa Skała]] (4 March 1863); two Battles of [[Opatów]] (25 November 1863, 21 February 1864).

As a result of their support of the failed insurrection, several Lesser Poland's towns lost their charters and were turned into villages. Among them were [[Kraśnik]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubelskie.info.pl/index.php?i=110&amp;d=105]{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bodzentyn]], [[Opatów]], [[Iłża]], [[Małogoszcz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malogoszcz.pl/asp/pl_start.asp?typ=14&amp;sub=2&amp;menu=10&amp;strona=1|publisher=Gmina Mologoszcz|title=Historia miasta|language=Polish|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716115414/http://www.malogoszcz.pl/asp/pl_start.asp?typ=14&amp;sub=2&amp;menu=10&amp;strona=1|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wąchock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b.1asphost.com/Custer/wachock.html|title=Powiat Stachowicki|language=Polish|accessdate=19 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110608232103/http://b.1asphost.com/Custer/wachock.html|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Busko-Zdrój]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kppspbusko.hg.pl/theme/page/historia%20miasta.html|title=Historia miasta|publisher=KOMENDA POWIATOWA; PAŃSTWOWEJ STRAŻY POŻARNEJ; W BUSKU – ZDROJU|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301112152/http://www.kppspbusko.hg.pl/theme/page/historia%20miasta.html|archivedate=1 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jędrzejów,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/sep-ow/PLI/ft/am/jedrz.htm |title=Jędrzejów, historia |language=pl |publisher=Ee.pw.edu.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928062614/http://www.ee.pw.edu.pl/sep-ow/PLI/ft/am/jedrz.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cmielow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.wyborcza.pl/temat/wyborcza/powstanie+styczniowe |title=POWSTANIE STYCZNIOWE – Gazeta Wyborcza – internetowe wydanie – Wyborcza.pl |language=pl |publisher=Info.wyborcza.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818131113/http://info.wyborcza.pl/temat/wyborcza/powstanie+styczniowe |archivedate=18 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zwoleń]], [[Drzewica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drzewica.pl/portal.php?aid=12103248264824175a41ff7 |title=Gmina Drzewica |publisher=Drzewica.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930141937/http://www.drzewica.pl/portal.php?aid=12103248264824175a41ff7 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wierzbica, Radom County|Wierzbica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=22 czerwiec 2008 |url=http://www.wierzbica.pl/ugwierzbica/?page_id=2 |title=» Historia Urząd Gminy w Wierzbicy: |publisher=Wierzbica.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002210816/http://www.wierzbica.pl/ugwierzbica/?page_id=2 |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czeladź]], [[Kazimierz Dolny]], [[Wolborz]], [[Stopnica]], [[Daleszyce]], [[Wiślica]], [[Pajęczno]], [[Lipsko]], [[Pacanów]], [[Ożarów]], [[Wolbrom]], [[Proszowice]], [[Nowe Miasto Korczyn]], [[Włoszczowa]], [[Przysucha]], [[Opole Lubelskie]].

[[File:Collegium Maius 07.JPG|thumb|right|In the 19th century, Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]] was a major center of Polish science and culture]]
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lesser Poland remained one of the centers of Polish culture, especially the city of Kraków, where Jagiellonian University was one of only two Polish-language colleges of that period (the other one was [[Lviv University|University of Lwów]]). Another significant center of national culture was the town of [[Puławy]], where in the late 18th century, a local palace owned by Czartoryski family became a museum of Polish national memorabilia and a major cultural and political centre. A number of prominent artists, both representing [[Romanticism in Poland|Romanticism]], and [[Positivism in Poland|Positivism]] was born in Lesser Poland, including [[Wincenty Pol]] (born in Lublin), [[Stefan Żeromski]] (born near Kielce), [[Aleksander Świętochowski]] (born near Łuków in extreme northeast corner of Lesser Poland), [[Walery Przyborowski]] (born near Kielce), [[Piotr Michałowski]], [[Helena Modjeska]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]] (born in Lublin), [[Leon Wyczolkowski]] (born near Siedlce), [[Juliusz Kossak]] (born in [[Nowy Wiśnicz]]), [[Jozef Szujski]] (born in Tarnów). In the early 20th century, Lesser Poland, especially its part which belonged to Austria-Hungary, was a center of a cultural movement called [[Young Poland]]. Many artists associated with the movement were born in Lesser Poland, with the most prominent including [[Wladyslaw Orkan]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Xawery Dunikowski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Jozef Mehoffer]], and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].

Since Austrian part of Poland enjoyed a wide autonomy, the province of Galicia, whose western part was made of Lesser Poland, became a hotbed of Polish conspirational activities. In anticipation of a future war, Galician Poles, with help of their brethren from other parts of the divided country, created several paramilitary organizations, such as [[Polish Rifle Squads]], and [[Riflemen's Association]]. The capital of Lesser Poland, Kraków, was a key center of pro-independence movements, with such individuals, as [[Józef Piłsudski]], being actively involved in those activities. In August 1914, after the outbreak of World War I, [[Polish Legions in World War I|Pilsudski's Legions]] crossed the Austrian – Russian border north of Kraków, and entered [[Congress Poland]]. However, the Pilsudski and his soldiers were disappointed to see that the inhabitants of Kielce did not welcome them with joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niepodleglosc.lodzkie.eu/page/index.php?str=35|title=ŁUW - serwis internetowy Łódzkiego Urzędu Wojewódzkiego w Łodzi - Niepodległość - Józef Piłsudski|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312064702/http://niepodleglosc.lodzkie.eu/page/index.php?str=35|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The division of Lesser Poland was more visible than ever.
[[File:43. TKB - Fickowa Pokusa z Jeleśni 01.JPG|thumb|[[Gorals]] from [[Beskidy]]]]

During World War I, Lesser Poland became one of main theaters of the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Russian push into the territory of Austria – Hungary resulted in the [[Battle of Galicia]]. Among other major battles which took place in Lesser Poland, there are the [[Battle of the Vistula River]], and the [[Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive]]. After Russian troops [[Great Retreat|had retreated east]], whole province was under control of the Austrians and the Germans, and northern Lesser Poland was part of the German-sponsored [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)]]. In later stages of the conflict, the divided province once again became a center of Polish independence movement. An independent Polish government was re-proclaimed in northern Lesser Poland's city of Lublin, on 7 November 1918. Soon afterwards, it formed the basis of the new government of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stamp Domain |url=http://www.stampdomain.com/country/poland/poland1918/ |title=POSTAL HISTORY OF POLAND 1918 |publisher=Stampdomain.com |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930052621/http://www.stampdomain.com/country/poland/poland1918/ |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the province, other governments were formed – [[Polish Liquidation Commission]] in Kraków, also the short-lived [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]].

The division of Lesser Poland along the Vistula river, which lasted from 1772 until 1918, is visible even today. For more than 100 years, southern Lesser Poland ([[Kraków]], [[Tarnów]], [[Bielsko-Biała|Biala Krakowska]], and [[Nowy Sącz]]) was administered by Austria, while northern, larger part of the province ([[Częstochowa]], [[Sosnowiec]], Kielce, Radom, Lublin, [[Sandomierz]]) was forcibly part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Inhabitants of Austrian part of Poland enjoyed limited autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewish-guide.pl/galicia/37 Jewish Guide, Galicia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323053119/http://www.jewish-guide.pl/galicia/37 |date=23 March 2010 }}"Under the rule of emperor Franz Josef broad autonomy was granted to Galicia due to the political shrewdness and common sense of Polish intelligentsia."&lt;/ref&gt; with Polish language institutions, such as [[Jagiellonian University]]. At the same time, Russian-controlled Poland was subject to [[Russification]]. As a result of decades of this division, most inhabitants of the areas stolen by Russia are not aware of their Lesser Poland's heritage. Furthermore, current administrative boundaries of the country still reflect the defunct border between the former Russian and Austria–Hungarian Empires.
[[File:Zamek Bobolice (Castle of Bobolice).JPG|thumb|Castle of [[Bobolice, Silesian Voivodeship|Bobolice]]]]

=== Interwar Poland (1918–1939) ===
In 1918, when [[Second Polish Republic]] was created, whole historical Lesser Poland became part of restored [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. The historical area of the province was divided between four voivodeships: [[Kraków Voivodeship (1919–39)|Kraków Voivodeship]] (whole), [[Kielce Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kielce Voivodeship]] (whole), [[Lwów Voivodeship]] (northwestern corner), and [[Lublin Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Lublin Voivodeship]] (western part). Furthermore, in the counties of central Lesser Poland, another administrative unit, [[Sandomierz Voivodeship (1939)|Sandomierz Voivodeship]] was planned, but due to the outbreak of World War II, it was never created. Boundaries between two major Lesser Poland voivodeships – Kraków, and Kielce, were the same as pre-1914 boundaries of Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Nevertheless, in the interbellum period, the notion of Lesser Poland was frequently associated only with former Austrian province of [[Galicia (Central-Eastern Europe)|Galicia]].&lt;ref name="nowamalopolska.pl" /&gt; Therefore, Western Galicia to the [[San (river)|San]] river, was called ''Western Lesser Poland'', while Eastern Galicia, east of the San, with the city of [[Lwów]], was called ''Eastern Lesser Poland'' (voivodeships of [[Tarnopol Voivodeship|Tarnopol]], [[Stanisławów Voivodeship|Stanisławów]], and [[Lwów Voivodeship|Lwów]]).

In late 1918, Lesser Poland emerged as one of main centers of fledgling Polish administration and independence movement. According to historian Kazimierz Banburski of Tarnów's District Museum, [[Tarnów]] was the first Polish city which became independent, after 123 years of [[Partitions of Poland|oppression]]. On 31 October 1918, at 8&amp;nbsp;am, Tarnów's inhabitants began disarming demoralized Austrian soldiers, and after three hours, the city was completely in Polish hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Marek Ciesielczyk |url=http://interia360.pl/artykul/tarnow-byl-pierwszym-niepodleglym-miastem-w-polsce,8913 |title=Tarnów był pierwszym niepodległym miastem w Polsce – Informacje w Interia360.pl – wiadomości, dziennikarstwo obywatelskie |publisher=Interia360.pl |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818144242/http://interia360.pl/artykul/tarnow-byl-pierwszym-niepodleglym-miastem-w-polsce,8913 |archivedate=18 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 1918, [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] was created in Kraków. A few days later, socialist peasants founded the [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]]. In the night of 6/7 November 1918, ''Polish People's Republic'' was proclaimed in Lublin, by [[Ignacy Daszynski]] and other activists. In 1919, [[Polish legislative election, 1919|the legislative election]] took place in Lesser Poland without major problems.

[[File:Wieliczka salt mine.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wieliczka Salt Mine]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]

At that time Lesser Poland, like other provinces of the country, faced several problems. Even though major post-World War I conflicts (such as [[Polish–Soviet War]]) did not take place there, it suffered from unemployment, overpopulation, and poverty, especially in towns and countryside. Furthermore, Polish government had to connect parts of the hitherto divided country. There was no direct rail link between Kraków, and Kielce, Radom, and Lublin, and until 1934, when line from Kraków to [[Tunel (railroad station)|Tunel]] was opened, all travelers had to go via [[Sosnowiec]] – Maczki. Lack of rail communication between former Austrian and former Russian parts of Lesser Poland is visible even today. Between Kraków and [[Dęblin]], there are only two rail bridges along the Vistula. Residents of the province tried to improve their conditions using legal means, but when it turned out to be impossible, they took to fighting ([[1923 Kraków riot]], [[1937 peasant strike in Poland]]). As if to exacerbate the desperate situation, Lesser Poland witnessed [[1934 flood in Poland|a catastrophic flood]] in 1934, after which the government decided to construct dams on local rivers.

Even though Lesser Poland's countryside was almost exclusively Polish, its towns and cities were inhabited by numerous [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]], whose communities were very vibrant. In Kraków, Jews made 25% of the population, in Lublin – 31%, in Kielce – 30%, and in Radom – 32%. Apart from the Jews, and Gypsies scattered in the south, there were no other significant national minorities in interbellum Lesser Poland.

Since Lesser Poland was safely located in the middle of the country, away from both German and Soviet border, in the mid-1930s Polish government initiated one of the most ambitious project of the Second Polish Republic – [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], which was located almost exclusively in Lesser Poland. Even though the project was never completed, several plants were constructed, both in [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]], and in other counties of the province. The brand new city of Stalowa Wola was established in dense forests, around a [[Huta Stalowa Wola|steel mill]]. In the late 1930s, Lesser Poland was quickly changing, as construction of several factories, and job opportunities caused influx of rural inhabitants to the towns. Such towns, as [[Dębica]], [[Starachowice]], [[Puławy]], or [[Kraśnik]], quickly grew, with their population rising. Earlier, in 1927, Lesser Poland's [[Dęblin]] became a major center of Polish aviation, when [[Polish Air Force Academy]] was opened there, and in [[Mielec]], [[PZL Mielec]] was opened, which was the largest aerospace manufacturer in Poland. Central Industrial Region, however, did not affect western counties of Lesser Poland, which had already been urbanized and industrialized ([[Bielsko-Biała|Biala Krakowska]], [[Żywiec]], [[Kraków]], [[Jaworzno]], [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], [[Zawiercie]], and [[Częstochowa]]). The government of Poland planned further investments, such as a major East – West rail line, linking [[Volhynia]], and [[Upper Silesia]], but they never materialized. Desperate situation and lack of jobs caused thousands of inhabitants of Lesser Poland (especially from its southern part) to leave their land, mostly for the United States of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=hlclark |url=http://ellis-island-immigration.com/ellis-island-immigrants-italian-irish-and-polish/ |title=Ellis Island Immigrants: Italian, Irish and Polish – Ellis Island Immigration |publisher=Ellis-island-immigration.com |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815150029/http://ellis-island-immigration.com/ellis-island-immigrants-italian-irish-and-polish/ |archivedate=15 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also Brazil, and Canada.

[[File:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope John Paul II]] was born in [[Wadowice]], Lesser Poland, in 1920]]

Lesser Poland remained a center of Polish culture, with Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]], [[AGH University of Science and Technology]], and [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin|Catholic University of Lublin]], which was opened in 1918. Several important figures of interbellum political, military, and cultural life of Poland were born in Lesser Poland. Among them were [[Wincenty Witos]], [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]], [[Józef Haller]], [[Władysław Belina-Prażmowski]], [[Tadeusz Kutrzeba]], [[Feliks Koneczny]], [[Stefan Żeromski]], [[Tadeusz Peiper]], [[Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Jan Kiepura]], [[Stefan Jaracz]]. In 1920, in Lesser Poland's town of [[Wadowice]], [[Karol Wojtyla]], the future Pope John Paul II, was born.

=== World War II ===
On 1 September 1939, armed forces of Nazi Germany attacked Poland (see: [[Invasion of Poland]]). Lesser Poland, due to its proximity to the then-border with Germany, became a battleground on the first day of the invasion. The Germans attacked the province both in its northwest (area west of Częstochowa), and in the south ([[Podhale]]), along the border with [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], [[Third Reich]]'s ally.

Lesser Poland was defended by the following Polish armies:

* [[Karpaty Army]], which covered southern, mountainous border of the province,
* [[Kraków Army]], guarding western part of the province, together with adjacent Polish part of [[Upper Silesia]]. Later in the course of war it joined the Karpaty Army, forming the ''Lesser Poland Army'' (''Armia Małopolska''),
* [[Łódź Army]], which protected extreme northwestern corner of the province, north of Częstochowa,
* [[Prusy Army]], which was main reserve of the Commander in Chief, and was concentrated in central and northern Lesser Poland (between Radom and Kielce),
* [[Lublin Army]], improvised after 4 September, and concentrated in the area of Lublin and Sandomierz in northeastern Lesser Poland.

After a few days the [[Battle of the Border]] was lost, and forces of German [[Army Group South]] advanced deep into Lesser Poland's territory. Polish troops resisted fiercely, and among major battles in initial stages of the war, which took place in Lesser Poland, there are [[Battle of Mokra]], [[Battle of Jordanów]], and [[Battle of Węgierska Górka]]. By 6 September, Polish forces were in general retreat and Marshal of Poland [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] ordered all troops to fall back to the secondary lines of defences at the Vistula and [[San (river)|San]] Rivers. German units entered Częstochowa on 3 September (where on the next day they [[Częstochowa massacre|murdered hundreds of civilians]]), Kielce on 5 September, Kraków on 6 September, and Radom on 8 September (see also [[Battle of Radom]]). Within a week, almost whole Lesser Poland was under Nazi occupation. Northeastern part of the province, the area of Lublin, was held by the Poles until 17 September, but eventually, and after fierce battles (see [[Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski]]), all Lesser Poland was firmly under Nazi control. First draft of [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] stipulated that northeastern Lesser Poland (east of the Vistula river) was to be occupied by the Soviet Union, and forces of the [[Red Army]] reached the area of Lublin after 20 September, but withdrew east on 28 September.

On 12 October 1939, upon a decree of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[General Government]], a separate region of the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]] was created, with [[Hans Frank]] as its [[Governor-General]]. Its capital was established in Kraków, and it covered most of the area of historical Lesser Poland, except for its western counties, which were directly incorporated into Nazi Germany's [[Upper Silesia Province]] ([[Będzin]], [[Sosnowiec]], [[Zawiercie]], [[Bielsko-Biała|Biała]], [[Żywiec]], [[Chrzanów]], [[Olkusz]]).

{{Further information|Administrative division of Polish territories during World War II}}

In Lesser Poland, like in all provinces of the occupied country, the Nazis ruled with savage brutality, killing hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, both Polish and Jewish (see: [[World War II crimes in Poland]], [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)]], [[Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Poland]], [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles]], [[German AB-Aktion in Poland]], [[Sonderaktion Krakau]]). The [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], located at the border of Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia, was opened on 14 June 1940, and on 1 October 1941, the Germans opened [[Majdanek concentration camp]] on the outskirts of Lublin. The third concentration camp in Lesser Poland was in [[Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp|Kraków's district of Płaszów]]. In late 1939 and early 1940, in Lesser Poland's spa of [[Zakopane]], and in Kraków, several [[Gestapo–NKVD Conferences]] took place, during which the mutual cooperation between Nazi Germany and Soviet Union was discussed.

Anti-Nazi resistance was particularly strong in Lesser Poland, and it was in the extreme northwestern corner of the province (around Opoczno), that armed struggle against the occupiers began in late 1939 and early 1940 (see [[Henryk Dobrzański]]). Structures of the [[Home Army]] were well-developed in the region. Lesser Poland's independent areas of the Home Army were located in Kraków, Kielce-Radom, and Lublin. During [[Operation Tempest]] in mid-1944, several Lesser Poland's towns were liberated, also [[Kraków Uprising (1944)|uprising in Kraków]] was prepared, but never realized. Apart from the Home Army, other resistance groups were strong in the province, such as pro-Communist [[Armia Ludowa]], peasant's [[Bataliony Chłopskie]], and right-wing [[National Armed Forces]], with its [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]].

In all major Lesser Poland's cities, Jewish ghettos were opened, with the biggest ones in [[Kraków Ghetto|Kraków]], and [[Lublin Ghetto|Lublin]]. At first the Nazis were planning to create a so-called "reservation" for European Jews, located around Lesser Poland's town of [[Nisko]] (see [[Nisko Plan]]), but they changed the plan, and decided to murder all Jews. Condemned to death, Jews in Lesser Poland took to fighting (see [[Częstochowa Ghetto Uprising]]), but their efforts failed. As a result of [[The Holocaust in Poland]], once thriving and numerous Jewish population of Lesser Poland was decimated.

In the summer of 1944, after [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]], Red Army pushed the Wehrmacht from eastern Lesser Poland. The city of Lublin was captured by the Soviets on 22 July 1944, Stalowa Wola – on 1 August, and Sandomierz, on the left bank of the Vistula – on 18 August. The front line stabilized along the Vistula for about six months (with some bridgeheads on the western bank on the Vistula – see [[Battle of Studzianki]]), and in early 1945, Soviet [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]] began, which pushed Germans to the gates of Berlin. The Soviets entered Kielce on 15 January, Częstochowa – on 17 January, and Kraków on 19 January. On 27 January, the Red Army entered Sosnowiec. In took the Soviets much longer to clear the areas in the mountains – they did not enter Żywiec until 5 April 1945.&lt;ref name="nsik.com.pl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsik.com.pl/archiwum/38/a1.html |title=Wyzwolenie ziemi żywieckiej i realizacja planu AK "Burza" |publisher=Nsik.com.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322102040/http://www.nsik.com.pl/archiwum/38/a1.html |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-World War II ===
Together with the Red Army, [[NKVD]] and Soviet authorities followed, whose purpose was to make Poland a Communist country, with a puppet government, formed as [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]]. Since 1 August 1944, the provisional government was officially headquartered in Lesser Poland's Lublin. Thousands of people took to the forests, to continue their fight for free Poland (see [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)]]). Lesser Poland again was one of the main centers of the resistance. Several skirmishes took place in the province, including [[Battle of Kuryłówka]]. The Communists did not hesitate to kill those rebels they captured ([[Public execution in Dębica (1946)]]), and by 1947, the resistance movement was crushed. The last Polish [[Cursed soldiers|cursed soldier]], [[Józef Franczak]], was killed in 1963 near [[Świdnik]] in northeastern Lesser Poland. Also, all victims of the [[1951 Mokotów Prison execution]] were members of Lesser Poland's branch of [[Freedom and Independence]]. Another well-known anti-Communist fighter from Lesser Poland is [[Józef Kuraś]], who was active in the southern region of [[Podhale]].

In early 1945, the lands of Lesser Poland were divided between three voivodeships – those of Kraków, Lublin, and Kielce. Since summer 1945, several counties were transferred to neighboring voivodeships – eastern Lesser Poland (Dębica, Jasło, Mielec) became part of [[Rzeszów Voivodeship]], while western counties of Będzin and Zawiercie were transferred to [[Katowice Voivodeship]]. In 1950, the city of Częstochowa became part of Katowice Voivodeship, and next year, the city of [[Bielsko-Biała]] was created out of Lesser Poland's Biala Krakowska, and Upper Silesia's Bielsko. The new city became part of Katowice Voivodeship. Lesser Poland was further divided in 1975, when territorial reform was carried out (see [[Voivodeships of Poland (1975–1988)]]). Counties were abolished, and several small voivodeships were created, in such Lesser Poland's towns and cities, as Tarnobrzeg, Tarnów, Nowy Sącz, Bielsko-Biała, Radom, Częstochowa, and Siedlce.

The government of Communist Poland invested in heavy industry, following the pre-1939 idea of Central Industrial Area. In Kraków, a new district of [[Nowa Huta]] was constructed in the 1950s. In Częstochowa and Zawiercie, the steelworks were significantly expanded, and in early 1970, the government initiated construction of Katowice Steelworks, which, despite its name, is located in Lesser Poland's [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]]. To connect Katowice Steelworks with Soviet plants, in late 1970s [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line]] was opened, which crossed Lesser Poland from west to east. Among other major factories, opened in Lesser Poland during Communist rule, there are:
* [[FSC Lublin]], opened in 1951,
* [[FSC Star]] in [[Starachowice]], opened in 1948, and based on earlier factory,
* [[PZL-Świdnik]], opened in 1951,
* Zaklady Azotowe [[Puławy]], opened in 1965,
* [[Połaniec Power Station]], opened in 1979,
* Skawina Power Station, opened in 1957,
* Nowiny Cement Plant, opened in 1960,
* [[Kozienice Power Station]], opened in 1973.

[[File:Star S2000PSP.JPG|thumb|A fire engine made by [[FSC Star]] in Lesser Poland's [[Starachowice]]]]

Other Lesser Poland's major plants were significantly expanded after 1945, including [[Żywiec Brewery]], [[Okocim Brewery]], [[Fablok]], [[Łucznik Arms Factory]], [[FŁT-Kraśnik]], [[Jaworzno Power Station]], Siersza Power Plant, [[Huta Stalowa Wola]], [[Janina Coal Mine]], [[Sobieski Coal Mine]], Zaklady Azotowe Tarnów-Mościce. Furthermore, in early 1950s significant [[sulfur]] resources were discovered in Tarnobrzeg, as a result of which Siarkopol company was founded, and the city of Tarnobrzeg quickly grew. In 1975, coal was discovered northeast of Lublin, and soon afterwards, [[Bogdanka Coal Mine]] and [[Piaski Coal Mine]] were opened.

Between 1971 and 1977, [[Central Rail Line (Poland)|Central Trunk Line]] was opened, which goes along western boundary of the province, and which connects Kraków and Katowice, with Warsaw. In the early 1980s, construction of a highway between Kraków and Katowice began. The 61-kilometer road is now run by Stalexport Autostrada Małopolska, and is part of [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 highway]].

Residents of Lesser Poland frequently protested against Communist government. Major centers of anti-Communist resistance were in Kraków, Nowa Huta, Radom, and Lublin. Among major protests that took place in the province were [[1968 Polish political crisis]] (with Kraków as one of major centers of protests), [[June 1976 protests]] (in Radom), [[Lublin 1980 strikes]], [[31 August 1982 demonstrations in Poland]] (in several locations), [[1988 Polish strikes]] (with Stalowa Wola as one of major centers). Several anti-Nazi, and anti-Communist leaders hailed from Lesser Poland: [[Jan Piwnik]], [[Emil August Fieldorf]], [[Leopold Okulicki]], [[Ryszard Siwiec]], [[Stanisław Pyjas]], [[Hieronim Dekutowski]], [[Andrzej Gwiazda]], [[Andrzej Czuma]].

A number of key personalities of Communist government were born in Lesser Poland, including [[Józef Cyrankiewicz]], [[Bolesław Bierut]], [[Edward Gierek]], [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], [[Czesław Kiszczak]], [[Stanisław Kania]], [[Hilary Minc]], [[Edward Ochab]], [[Michał Rola-Żymierski]], [[Józef Oleksy]].

Among prominent personalities of Polish cultural life of the 20th century, who were born in Lesser Poland, there are: [[Xawery Dunikowski]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Gustaw Herling-Grudziński]], [[Sławomir Mrożek]], [[Tadeusz Kantor]], [[Jan Kanty Pawluśkiewicz]], [[Marek Kondrat]], [[Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Zbigniew Preisner]], [[Leon Schiller]], [[Jerzy Stuhr]], [[Jan Sztaudynger]], [[Grzegorz Turnau]], [[Jerzy Turowicz]].

In 1998, the government of Poland carried out administrative reform of the country. For the first time in history, [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]] was created, with capital in Kraków, and area of 15,108 square kilometers. The new province covers only a small, southwestern part of historical Lesser Poland.

Today, Lesser Poland is divided between several voivodeships: whole Lesser Poland Voivodeship, whole [[Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship]], western half of [[Lublin Voivodeship]], western part of [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]], eastern half of [[Silesian Voivodeship]], southern part of [[Mazovian Voivodeship]] and southeastern corner of [[Łódź Voivodeship]] (around [[Opoczno]]).

There were suggestions that Lesser Poland voivodeship should stretch from [[Bielsko-Biała]], to [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]] and [[Sandomierz]]. Furthermore, creation of [[Old Poland Voivodeship]] was proposed, on the historical lands of northern Lesser Poland. Also, since about half of territory of current Silesian Voivodeship belongs to historical Lesser Poland, there are suggestions to rename it into ''Silesian – Lesser Poland Voivodeship''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zachodniamalopolska.republika.pl/ "Poprawna nazwa powinna więc brzmieć: Województwo Śląsko-Małopolskie"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616065127/http://zachodniamalopolska.republika.pl/ |date=16 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], several other locations used to be important urban centers of Lesser Poland, but in the course of the time, their significance declined. The main example is [[Sandomierz]], which for hundreds of years was one of the most important cities of Poland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staypoland.com/about_sandomierz.htm StayPoland page on Sandomierz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326090000/http://www.staypoland.com/about_sandomierz.htm |date=26 March 2016 }}"At one time it played a role of great importance in the life of the country, but nowadays it is simply a rural town of great beauty"&lt;/ref&gt; but now is a town of 25,000. Other examples of historically important places, which are now little towns or villages are:
* [[Biecz]], a town of 5,000, once the seat of a [[Biecz County|county]], incorporated in 1257,

== Economy and industry ==
History of industry in Lesser Poland goes back to prehistoric times, when in [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]], first [[bloomery|bloomeries]] were constructed. In the Middle Ages, first plants were opened in that area, and as a result, [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] was created, which was a major industrial region of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In the 17th century, first Polish [[blast furnace]]s were constructed in [[Samsonów]] by Italian engineer Hieronim Caccio. Apart from iron products, used for military purposes, Old-Polish Industrial Region also manufactured [[charcoal]] and glass. In 1782, in Poland there were 34 bloomeries, out of which 27 were located in Old-Polish Industrial Region. Another major industrial area of Lesser Poland is [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], where in the 16th century, lead, silver, and [[zinc]] were found. As early as in the 15th century, coal was exctracted in [[Trzebinia]] – Siersza, and in the following centuries, especially in the 19th century, several coal mines and steel mills were opened in Zagłębie and in Zagłębie Krakowskie (first coal mine in [[Jaworzno]] was opened in 1792). In nearby [[Olkusz]], the history of zinc mining dates to the 12th century when Casimir II the Just set up a mining settlement. Also, in the towns of [[Wieliczka]] and [[Bochnia]], salt mines were established in the 12th and 13th centuries (see [[Bochnia Salt Mine]], [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]]).

In the 20th century, natural resources were also discovered in central and eastern counties Lesser Poland.
In 1964, the world's largest open-pit sulfur mine was opened in Machów near [[Tarnobrzeg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kutney| first = Gerald| title = Sulfur: History, Technology, Applications and Industry| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O4rzzkUQyzIC&amp;pg=PA131| year = 2007| publisher = ChemTec Publishing| isbn = 978-1-895198-37-9| page = 131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sulfur deposits in the area of Tarnobrzeg are Jeziorko, Grzybów-Gacki, and Grębów-Wydza. The mine at Machów is now closed. In the late 1960s, eastern Lesser Poland became one of three coal basins of the country, when Lublin Basin was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1324649.html |title=Resources of hard coal in Polish coal basins |publisher=Cprm.gov.br |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930023819/http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1324649.html |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major coal mine in the area is [[Bogdanka Coal Mine|KWK Bogdanka]] near [[Łęczna]], which is the only coal mine in Poland which has continuously generated a profit. Other Polish coal mines located in Lesser Poland are those found in western part of the province, along the boundary with Upper Silesia – [[Janina Coal Mine|KWK Janina]] in Jaworzno, [[Sobieski Coal Mine|KWK Sobieski]], and also in Jaworzno. Copper and silver are extracted in [[Myszków]] (see [[Myszków mine]]).

In the late 1930s, the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] created [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], which was almost exclusively located in Lesser Poland. Currently, within borders of the province, there are following [[industrial region]]s:
* ''Bielsko Industrial Region'' (''Bielski Okręg Przemysłowy''), which includes both towns from Lesser Poland, and Upper Silesia ([[Andrychów]], [[Bielsko-Biała]], [[Cieszyn]], [[Kęty]], [[Pszczyna]], [[Skoczów]], Żywiec),
* ''Częstochowa Industrial Region'' (''Częstochowski Okręg Przemysłowy''), which includes Częstochowa, [[Myszków]], and [[Zawiercie]].
* [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region]] (''Górnośląski Okręg Przemysłowy''). Despite the name, it also includes cities from Lesser Poland's [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] – Sosnowiec, [[Będzin]], [[Czeladź]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Wojkowice]],
* ''Jaworzno – Chrzanów Industrial Region'' (''Jaworznicko-Chrzanowski Okręg Przemysłowy''), with the towns of Jaworzno, [[Chrzanów]], [[Trzebinia]], [[Libiąż]], [[Chełmek]], [[Bukowno]], [[Alwernia]], [[Krzeszowice]],
* ''Carpathian Industrial Region'' (''Karpacki Okręg Przemysłowy''), which stretches from [[Nowy Sącz]], through [[Jasło]] and [[Gorlice]], to [[Sanok]],
* ''Kraków Industrial Region'' (''Krakowski Okręg Przemysłowy'') – the city of Kraków and the towns of [[Wieliczka]], [[Skawina]], [[Myślenice]], [[Bochnia]],

In 2009, [[Polityka]] weekly made its own list of 500 biggest Polish companies. According to the list, second biggest company of the country was [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna]], which, as Polityka stated, is headquartered in Lublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lista500.polityka.pl/rankings/show |title=Lista 500 największych polskich firm – Lista 500 – Polityka.pl |publisher=Lista500.polityka.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020214628/http://www.lista500.polityka.pl/rankings/show |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third biggest company of Poland in 2009 was ''[[Fiat]] Auto Poland'' from Bielsko-Biała.

Since the lands of historical Lesser Poland belong now to different voivodeships, unemployment rate differs from one region to another. In January 2010, in Poland the unemployment rate was 12,7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gus.pl/wiadomosc/20100302/bezrobotni-oraz-stopa-bezrobocia-wg-wojewodztw-styczen-2010 |title=Bezrobotni oraz stopa bezrobocia wg województw, styczeń 2010 &amp;#124; GUS.PL – Wiadomości Ekonomiczne i Statystyczne |publisher=GUS.PL |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926033858/http://www.gus.pl/wiadomosc/20100302/bezrobotni-oraz-stopa-bezrobocia-wg-wojewodztw-styczen-2010 |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Silesian Voivodeship, eastern half of which is Lesser Poland, it was 9,9%, in Lesser Poland Voivodeship – 10,5%, in Subcarpathian Voivodeship – 16,3%, in Holy Cross Voivodeship – 15,5%, in Lublin Voivodeship – 13,6%, and in Mazovian Voivodeship (southern part of which is Lesser Poland) – 9,6%.

The worst situation on the job market (as for November 2009) was in Radom, where unemployment rate was 20,9% (it made Radom second worst city county of the nation, only after [[Grudziądz]]).

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Several European roads (see [[International E-road network]]) cross Lesser Poland. The most important one is the [[European route E40]], which goes from west to east, across whole Europe. In Lesser Poland, the E40 goes from Jaworzno, via Kraków and Tarnów, towards eastern border of the country. Another main European road in Lesser Poland is the [[European route E77|E77]], which goes from north to south, via Radom, Kielce and Kraków, to southern border of Poland at [[Chyżne]]. Third major European road in Lesser Poland is the [[European route E30|E30]], which crosses the territory of the province in its extreme northeast corner, in [[Siedlce]]. Apart from these roads, Lesser Poland is crossed by the following European routes:
* [[European route E371|E371]], which begins in Radom, and goes via Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski, Tarnobrzeg, and Rzeszów to the border crossing at [[Barwinek, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Barwinek]],
* [[European route E372|E372]], which begins in [[Warsaw]], and via northeastern Lesser Poland (Lublin, Świdnik), goes to Ukrainian border at [[Hrebenne, Tomaszów Lubelski County|Hrebenne]],
* [[European route E462|E462]], which goes through southwestern corner of the province, from Czech border and Bielsko-Biała, to [[John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice]],
* [[European route E75|E75]], which crosses western counties of Lesser Poland – from Częstochowa, through Dąbrowa Górnicza and Jaworzno, to Bielsko-Biała and Polish – Czech border.

=== Airports ===
Within borders of historical Lesser Poland, there are two airports – [[John Paul II International Airport]] Kraków – Balice, and [[Katowice International Airport]], which is located in the village of [[Pyrzowice]], on the border between Lesser Poland and Upper Silesia. Pyrzowice is part of [[Gmina Ożarowice]], which after [[Partitions of Poland]], and [[Congress of Vienna]] belonged to [[Będzin County]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. In the interbellum, the area of future airport belonged to Lesser Poland's [[Kielce Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kielce Voivodeship]], and in 1945, was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (initially ''Silesian-Dąbrowa Voivodeship''). In 1998, Ożarowice, together with the airport, was attached to [[Tarnowskie Góry County]], despite the fact that it is not located in Upper Silesia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starostwo.bedzin.pl/default.aspx?docId=2144 |title=History of Będzin County |publisher=Starostwo.bedzin.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003010804/http://www.starostwo.bedzin.pl/default.aspx?docId=2144 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Railroads ===
Railroad network of Lesser Poland is very unevenly distributed. It is very dense in the west, along the border with Upper Silesia, and sparse in the east, especially along the Vistula, and around Lublin. All major cities of the province are connected with each other, however traveling from Kraków to Lublin is time-consuming, as trains have to take an extended route, via Kielce, Radom, and Dęblin. Also, there is no direct connection between Tarnów and Kielce, as these cities belonged to different countries before 1918. Underdevelopment of the railroads in northern and eastern Lesser Poland is the result of the policy of the Russian Empire. For military reasons, the Russians were not interested in construction of a dense network of lines along the border with Germany and Austria-Hungary, allowing only the construction of narrow-gauge connections.{{sfn|Jezierski|Leszczyńska|2003|p=197}} Along the Vistula, between Kraków and Dęblin (the distance of some 320 kilometers), there are only four rail bridges – in Dęblin (rebuilt after the war, in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-deblin,226,.html |title=Most kolejowy |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011022039/http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-deblin,226,.html# |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), in Sandomierz (built in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-sandomierz,228,.html |title=Most kolejowy |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011022057/http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-sandomierz,228,.html# |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), in Tarnobrzeg-Nagnajów (built in 1961, together with a road bridge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-drogowy-nagnajow,231,.html |title=Most drogowy |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011022046/http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-drogowy-nagnajow,231,.html# |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in [[Zaduszniki, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Zaduszniki]] (built in 1979 for the [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-lhs-zaduszniki,230,.html |title=Most kolejowy LHS |publisher=Mostypolskie.pl |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011022051/http://www.mostypolskie.pl/most/most-kolejowy-lhs-zaduszniki,230,.html# |archivedate=11 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In Kraków itself, there are three rail bridges over the Vistula.

Among rail hubs of Lesser Poland, there are Bielsko-Biała, [[Chabówka]], Częstochowa, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Dębica, Dęblin, Jaworzno-[[Szczakowa]], [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona (PKP station)|Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona]], Kielce, [[Koniecpol]], [[Kozłów, Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Kozłów]], Kraków, Lublin, [[Łuków]], [[Muszyna]], Nowy Sącz, Oświęcim, Siedlce, [[Spytkowice, Wadowice County|Spytkowice]], [[Skarżysko-Kamienna]], Stalowa Wola, [[Stróże, Nowy Sącz County|Stróże]], [[Sucha Beskidzka]], Radom, Tarnów, [[Trzebinia]], [[Tunel (railroad station)|Tunel]], Zawiercie, and [[Żywiec]].

In the late 1970s, the Communist government built the broad-gauge [[Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line]], which crosses Lesser Poland from west to east along the Vistula.

== Tourism and nature ==
The historical capital of Lesser Poland – [[Kraków]] – is regarded as the cultural capital of Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lussiana |first=Mary |url=http://www.time.com/time/travel/article/0,31542,2061127,00.html |title=Museum Updates Make Krakow a Cultural Capital |work=TIME |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903051701/http://www.time.com/time/travel/article/0,31542,2061127,00.html |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Zakopane]] is considered the winter capital of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poland.travel/en-gb/cities/zakopane-the-winter-capital-of-poland/|title=Zakopane - the winter capital of Poland|first=Agnieszka|last=Bigaj|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330220357/http://www.poland.travel/en-gb/cities/zakopane-the-winter-capital-of-poland|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[UNESCO]] placed Kraków's Old Town on the list of [[World Heritage Sites]].

== Education ==

=== Universities ===
Lesser Poland is home to Poland's oldest university – Kraków's [[Jagiellonian University]], which was established in 1364. For centuries, it was the only college of the province, and of the whole country. In December 1918, [[John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin]] was opened, becoming second university of Lesser Poland. In 1944, also in Lublin, [[Maria Curie-Skłodowska University]] was established.

=== Technical universities ===
There are several technical universities in Lesser Poland – Kraków's [[AGH University of Science and Technology]], and [[Cracow University of Technology|University of Technology]], as well as [[University of Bielsko-Biała]], [[Częstochowa University of Technology]], [[Lublin University of Technology]], [[Kazimierz Pułaski Technical University of Radom]], and [[Kielce University of Technology]].

=== Other colleges ===
Future teachers may study at [[Pedagogical University of Cracow]], or [[Jan Długosz University]] in Częstochowa, and future physicians at [[Jagiellonian University Medical College]], and [[Medical University of Lublin]]. Other state colleges are [[Jan Kochanowski University]] in Kielce, [[Pontifical University of John Paul II]] in Kraków, [[Agricultural University of Cracow]], [[University of Life Sciences in Lublin]], and [[Cracow University of Economics]]. Unique in the country is the [[Polish Air Force Academy]], located in Dęblin. Among private colleges of Lesser Poland, there is [[Wyższa Szkoła Biznesu – National-Louis University]] in Nowy Sącz.

== Regional identity and culture ==
Since Lesser Poland ceased to exist as a unified region in the late 18th century, during the [[Partitions of Poland]], most of its inhabitants are not aware of their heritage. Even the residents of [[Jaworzno]], a city which for centuries belonged to Kraków Land and only in 1975 was transferred to Katowice Voivodeship (see [[Voivodeships of Poland (1975–98)]]), are not familiar with their Lesser Polish roots. In a poll in April 2011, 57% of Jaworzno's inhabitants stated that their city is historically tied with Lesser Poland, but as many as 36% said their city is tied with Upper Silesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jaworzno.naszemiasto.pl/artykul/850152,tozsamosc-jaworzna-miasto-slaskie-malopolskie-a-moze,id,t.html |title=Tożsamość Jaworzna.

Therefore, currently the notion of Lesser Poland most commonly applies to the two voivodeships which in the past belonged to Austrian Empire – Lesser Poland Voivodeship, and [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malopolskaturystyka.pl/miejscowosci/malopolska Lesser Poland Tourist Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323165836/http://www.malopolskaturystyka.pl/miejscowosci/malopolska |date=23 March 2012 }} "Tak więc dziś mówiąc o Małopolsce, mówimy w zasadzie o dwóch województwach, które swoje siedziby mają w Krakowie i Rzeszowie, choć nazwę „małopolskie” zarezerwowano dla tego pierwszego"&lt;/ref&gt;

Among several Lesser Poland's regional organizations, one of the most important is ''Stowarzyszenie Gmin i Powiatów Małopolski'' (''The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland''). It publishes a magazine called ''Wspólnota Małopolska'' (''Lesser Polish Community''), and every year it chooses a ''Lesser Polish Person of the Year'' (among winners are [[John Paul II]], [[Anna Dymna]], and [[Stanisław Dziwisz]]). ''The Association of Villages and Counties of Lesser Poland'' has over 120 members from four Polish voivodeships. Among members are cities of Kraków, Częstochowa, Bielsko-Biała, Tarnów, and Przemyśl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgpm.krakow.pl/sgpm/index.php|title=Stowarzyszenie|publisher=Stowarzyszenie Gmin i Powiatów Małopolski|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722045550/http://www.sgpm.krakow.pl/sgpm/index.php#|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lesser Polish dialect of the Polish language ==
{{Further information|Lesser Polish dialect}}
[[File:Polska-dialekty wg Urbańczyka.PNG|thumb|300px|A map of dialects of the Polish language. The area where Lesser Poland's dialect is spoken is marked in orange.]]

Lesser Polish dialect is spoken in southeastern corner of Poland, both in lands which belong to historical Lesser Poland, and in areas which are not part of the province (around [[Sieradz]] and [[Łęczyca]]). On the other hand, as seen on the map, Lesser Polish dialect is not spoken in extreme northeast of Lesser Poland, in [[Siedlce]] and vicinity, where people rather speak Masovian dialect. Descending from the language of the Vistulans, it is the most numerous dialectal group in modern Poland. According to [[Wincenty Pol]], it is divided into three subdivisions: Sandomierz dialect, Lublin dialect, and Sanok dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terazmalopolska.pl/dialekt-malopolski|title=Dialekt małopolski|publisher=Teraz Małopolska|date=30 March 2010|accessdate=19 April 2011|language=Polish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212093439/http://www.terazmalopolska.pl/dialekt-malopolski|archivedate=12 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], Lesser Polish dialect, together with Greater Polish dialect, contributed to creation of standard Polish, it also greatly influenced [[Silesian language]] (see [[Dialects of the Polish language]]), as well as dialects of Polish used in southern part of [[Kresy Wschodnie]]. Later on, however, its importance diminished and was replaced by [[Masovian dialect]], which became the leading dialect of Polish. After [[Partitions of Poland]], when Lesser Poland was divided between Austria and Russia, northern areas of the province took over many features of the Masovian dialect, while Lesser Polish dialect in Austrian province of Galicia was heavily influenced by German.

According to Multimedia Guide to Polish Dialects, a webpage maintained by [[University of Warsaw]], Lesser Polish dialect is divided into the following subdialects:
* Mazowsze Borderland (Pogranicze Mazowsza – around Radom and Dęblin),
* Łęczyca (around [[Łódź]], [[Kutno]], [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]] – this part of the country is not historical Lesser Poland),
* Kielce (around Kielce),
* Lasowiacy (north of Rzeszów),
* East Kraków,
* West Lublin,
* East Lublin (this area historically belongs to [[Red Ruthenia]]),

'''Martin Gunnar Nag''' (30 July 1927 &amp;ndash; 2 May 2015) was a Norwegian literary historian, literary critic, poet, essayist, translator and biographer. He was born in [[Stavanger]].

He was a specialist on Slavic literature, and has translated Russian, Bulgarian and Czech literature into Norwegian language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4319">'''Napoleon Săvescu''' (born June 24, 1946) is a [[Romanian-American]] physician known for being the supporter of some controversial theories regarding the origins and history of [[Dacians]] and [[Romanians]]. He is also the founder of the [[New York City]]-based "Dacia Revival International Society", which since 2000 is the organizer of the annually-held International Congress of Dacology.

==Theories==

His most famous theory says that the Romanians are not descendants of the Roman colonists and assimilated Dacians, as mainstream historians say, but that they are the descendants of only the Dacians, who spoke a language close to [[Latin]]. 

{{quote|"If the Harappa culture did not disappear after the Carpatho-Danubian invasion, how come the invaders themselves vanished, leaving no traces behind, or leaving, as Sir Wheeler put it, "nothing but a name?" How could the nomad Carpatho-Danubians, mainly a people of breeders, give birth not only to a new religion, but found splendid cities that outlived them to this day? How could the greatest and most complex literature in the world have come from these Carpatho-Danubian people? Actually, the whole Vedic literature is based on four texts (the oldest being Rig-Veda, Yajur-Veda and Sama-Veda, the later Athara-Veda and two poems resembling the Iliad and the Odyssey only two thousand years older; Ramnayana and Mahabharata have preserved a toponimy echoing that of the Aryan Carpatho-Danubians' homeland and share the same main theme - the enmity and rancor between two families fighting over the throne of Bahataral (according to some, today's Banat-Romania).|The Conquest of India by the Carpatho-Danubian People}}

Other controversial theories of his include the Dacians (or their ancestors) developing of the first alphabet in the world (see the [[Tărtăria tablets]]), the first set of laws or the Dacian conquest of [[Western Europe]], [[India]], [[Iraq]], [[Japan]] and the [[Americas]].

His theories are, however, disregarded by historical journals and most historians, e.g. Mircea Babeş, [[Lucian Boia]] and Alexandra Tomiţă,&lt;ref&gt;Irina-Maria Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/dacomania-cum-mai-falsificam-istoria Dacomania sau cum mai falsificãm istoria]&lt;/ref&gt; who label these theories as [[pseudoscience]] and [[Protochronism|protochronistic]] and consider that there is not enough scientific evidence to support them.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Corbea, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Attachment.-Herodot-si-Todoreh*articleID_8195-articles_details.html Herodot si „Todoreh”], Observator cultural, nr. 168, mai 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nationella dräkten''' ({{IPA-sv|natɧuˈnɛlːa ˈdrɛktɛn|lang}}, ''the national costume'') is a historic Swedish [[folk costume|costume]], designed by King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] and introduced in 1778. It was designed for the [[nobility]] and the middle class with the intention of limiting rising consumption and import of [[Luxury good|luxury]] within [[fashion]], which was considered a drain on the economy and detrimental to society because of ensuing poverty. A masculine and a feminine costume were designed. The woman's version of the costume was to have a lasting effect, modified several times later, as the official costume of the Royal Court.

==History==
[[File:Nationella dräkten, 1700-talets slut - Livrustkammaren - 73055.tif|thumb|The male version of the ''Nationella dräkten'', [[Livrustkammaren]].]]

Presented by Gustav III in 1778 without legislative action to make them mandatory, the costumes by royal recommendation were to be the official clothing of the [[nobility]] and the middle class ([[bourgeoisie|burghers]]). The clergy and peasant [[Estates of the realm|estate]]s were excluded from the recommendation.

In motivating the reform and the name of the costume, the king stressed the importance of getting his Swedish subjects to stop emulating expensive foreign fashions. The idea stirred interest abroad, and especially in France opinions varied. [[Voltaire]] had this to say about it:

:''Nations should be themselves. They should only imitate each other in what is good and never in what is capricious. The ruler of the Swedes, who doesn’t overlook anything, realizes this wholly and fully. And he is going to give his people the greatest of all possessions – manners. Give him my humble greetings and tell him, that I honor him as a benefactor of humanity, and an example for kings. I am dying, and I am taking that feeling to my grave as a comfort to me.''&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in a letter from [[Gustaf Philip Creutz]] to Gustav III 1778-03-29 published in 1992 by [[Swedish Academy]] Prof. [[Gunnar von Proschwitz]] {{ISBN|91-7119-079-1}} p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Both the female and male costumes had specific color requirements for court functionaries: black with red trim regularly, and light blue with white trim for formal occasions. Other persons were free to choose their own color combinations as long as they maintained the twotone design.

[[File:Pope Pius VI and Gustav III by Bénigne Gagneraux (1786).jpg|thumb|left|[[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] wears the National Costume when meeting the Pope in Rome.]]

===Female version===

The female costume followed the fashion of the era, except for its collar and sleeves which were inspired by the Renaissance. It never caught on with a broader feminine populace, at first only being used at the Royal Court in the presence of the monarch. 

After the death of Gustav III, it became the official uniform worn at court by [[ladies in waiting]] and a customary dress for women formally presented at Court.&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Tydén-Jordan : Kungligt klädd, kungligt mode (1987) Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of the dress subsequently continued to follow current fashions as time went on, but the basic look of the characteristic, vertically striped sleeves has been kept, and a specific color rule developed: black or very dark blue with white trim.  The dress was used for women being presented at Court until 1952, and is still in use by Swedish ladies-in-waiting on formal occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Astrid Tydén-Jordan : Kungligt klädd, kungligt mode (1987) Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male version===

The male costume was much more original and included details from the Renaissance and the [[Charles XII of Sweden|Caroline]] period of Swedish history. It was used at Court and by many officials during the reigns of Gustav III and his son [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolph]] and later also was in limited use as a sort of [[folk costume]] for townsmen in [[Stockholm]].

[[File:Treaty of Versailles, English version.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Treaty of Versailles]], signed at the conclusion of [[World War I]].]]
A '''peace treaty''' is an [[treaty|agreement]] between two or more hostile parties, usually countries or governments, which formally ends a state of war between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inclusivesecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/37_peace_negotiations.pdf|title=Peace Negotiations and Agreements|last=Naraghi-Anderlini|first=Sanan|date=2007|website=Inclusive Security|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is different from an [[armistice]], which is an agreement to stop hostilities, or a [[Surrender_(military)|surrender]], in which an army agrees to give up arms, or a [[ceasefire|ceasefire or truce]] in which the parties may agree to temporarily or permanently stop fighting.

==Elements of treaties==
A treaty's content usually depends on the nature of the conflict being concluded. In the case of large conflicts between numerous parties there may be one [[international]] treaty covering all issues or separate treaties signed between each party.

There are many possible issues which may be included in a peace treaty.  Some of these may be:
* Formal designation of [[border]]s.
* Processes for resolving future [[:disputed|disputes]]
* Access to and apportioning of [[resource]]s
* Status of [[refugee]]s
* Status of [[Prisoner of war|POW]]
* Settling of existing [[debt]]s
* Defining of unjust [[behavior]]
* The re-application of existing [[treaty|treaties]]

In modern times certain intractable conflict situations may first be brought to a [[ceasefire]] and are then dealt with via a [[conflict resolution|peace process]] where a number of discrete steps are taken on each side to eventually reach the mutually desired goal of peace and the signing of a treaty.  A peace treaty also is often not used to end a civil war, especially in cases of a failed [[secession]], as it implies mutual recognition of statehood. In cases such as the [[American Civil War]], it usually ends when the armies of the losing side surrender and the government collapse. By contrast, a successful [[secession]] or [[declaration of independence]] is often formalized by means of a peace treaty.

Treaties are often ratified in territories deemed [[Neutral country|neutral]] in the previous {{clarify|date=January 2013}} conflict and delegates from these neutral territories act as [[witness]]es to the [[signatory|signatories]].

==Role of the United Nations==
Since its founding  after [[World War II]] the [[United Nations]] has sought to act as a forum for resolution in matters of international conflict.
A  number of [[International treaty|international treaties]] and obligations  are involved in which member states seek to limit and control behavior during wartime. This has meant that the action of [[declaration of war|declaring war]] is very likely infrequent to be undertaken. 

===Peace treaty under the United Nations===
Since the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], which had been more shocking than the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[United Nations]] system has been established and Article 2, paragraph 4 - 9, of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], has banned the use of [[military]] force. &lt;ref&gt; Randall Lesaffer,“ Too Much History: from War as Sanction to the Sanctioning of War”,
in Marc Weller (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Use of Force in International Law (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 2015), p.37.  &lt;/ref&gt; The UN Charter allows only two exceptions: "military measures by UN [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] resolutions" and "exercise of [[self-defense]]" in countries subjected to armed attacks in relation to the use of force by States. Under the current UN system, war is only triggered by the [[ enforcement]] of military measures under UN Security Council resolutions, or the exercise of self-defense rights against illegal armed attacks. In other words, the use of the term 'war' itself is being abandoned in the current [[international law]] system. Therefore, if the use of military force arises, it is called 'international armed conflict' instead of '[[war]]'. The fact that the current [[international law]] system avoids the use of the term [[war]] also avoids the conclusion of a [[peace treaty]] based on the existence of [[war]]. &lt;ref&gt;  Mohammad Taghi Karoubi, Just or Unjust War?: International Law and Unilateral Use
of Armed Force by States at the Turn of the 20th Century (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004),
p.103. &lt;/ref&gt;   A peace treaty was not signed after the end of the Iraq war in 2003, and only the UN [[Security Council]] [[Resolution 1483]], adopted on May 22, 2003, stipulated the [[postwar]] [[Iraq]]i regime for the stability and security of Iraq exclusively.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asaninst.org/contents/%ED%95%9C%EB%B0%98%EB%8F%84-%ED%8F%89%ED%99%94%ED%98%91%EC%A0%95-%EC%B2%B4%EA%B2%B0-%EA%B3%BC%EC%97%B0-%ED%95%84%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C%EA%B0%80 |title=   ""Is it necessary to sign the "Peace Agreement" on the Korean peninsula? pdf version - page 2 ~ 3 " |publisher= asaninst.org/|date= |accessdate=2017-08-23 |language= Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-conflict elections===
One of the [[UN]] roles in peace processes is to conduct post-conflict elections. Post-conflict elections on the whole are thought to have no effect, or even a negative effect, on peace after civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=Wars, Guns, and Votes: Democracy in Dangerous Places3|date=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flores|first1=Thomas Edward|last2=Nooruddin|first2=Irfan|title=The Effect of Elections on Post-Conflict Peace and Reconstruction|journal=Journal of Politics|volume=74 |issue=2 |date=30 March 2012 |pages=558–570|jstor=10.1017/s0022381611001733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brancati|first1=Dawn|last2=Snyder|first2=Jack|title=Time to Kill: The Impact of Election Timing and Sequencing on Post-Conflict Stability|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=57 |issue=5 |date=October 2013 |pages=822-853|doi=10.1177/0022002712449328}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when peace agreements transform rebel groups into political parties, the effect on peace is positive, specifically if international interveners use these moments of power distribution to hold the former combatants to the terms of their peace agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matanock|first1=Aila M.|title=Bullets for Ballots: Electoral Participation Provisions and Enduring Peace after Civil Conflict|journal=International Security|date=Spring 2017|volume=41|issue=4|pages=93-132|doi=10.1162/ISEC_a_00275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matanock|first1=Aila M.|title=Electing Peace: From Civil Conflict to Political Participation|date=2017|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107189171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic peace treaties==

===Ancient history===
[[Image:Treaty of Kadesh.jpg|left|thumb|Tablet of one of the earliest recorded [[treaties]] in history, [[Egyptian-Hittite peace treaty|Treaty of Kadesh]], at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]].]]
&lt;br /&gt;
Probably the earliest recorded peace treaty, although rarely mentioned or remembered, was between the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] and the [[Hayasa-Azzi]] confederation, circa 1350 BC. More famously, one of the earliest recorded peace treaties was concluded between the [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] empires after the ca.[[1270sBC|1274 BC]] [[Battle of Kadesh]] (see [[Egyptian-Hittite peace treaty]]). The battle took place in what is modern-day [[Syria]], the entire [[Levant]] being at that time contested between the two empires. After an extremely costly four-day battle, in which neither side gained a substantial advantage, both sides claimed victory. The lack of resolution led to further conflict between Egypt and the Hittites, with [[Ramesses II]] capturing the city of Kadesh and Amurru in his 8th year as king.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books: 1992, pp.256-257&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prospect of further protracted conflict between the two states eventually persuaded both their rulers, [[Hatusiliš III]] and Ramesses, to end their dispute and sign a peace treaty. Neither side could afford the possibility of a longer conflict since they were threatened by other enemies: Egypt was faced with the task of defending her long western border with Libya against the incursion of Libyan tribesmen by building a chain of fortresses stretching from Mersa Matruh to Rakotis, while the Hittites faced a more formidable threat in the form of the Assyrian Empire, which "had conquered Hanigalbat, the heartland of Mitanni, between the Tigris and the Euphrates" rivers that had previously been a Hittite vassal state.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, op. cit., p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace treaty was recorded in two versions, one in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the other in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] using [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] script; both versions survive. Such dual-language recording is common to many subsequent treaties.  This treaty differs from others, however, in that the two language versions are worded differently. Although the majority of the text is identical, the Hittite version claims that the [[Egyptians]] came suing for peace, while the Egyptian version claims the reverse.  The treaty was given to the Egyptians in the form of a silver plaque, and this "pocket-book" version was taken back to Egypt and carved into the [[Temple of Karnak]].

The Treaty was concluded between [[Ramesses II]] and [[Hatusiliš III]] in Year 21 of Ramesses' reign&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, op. cit., p.257&lt;/ref&gt; (c.1258 BC). Its eighteen articles call for peace between Egypt and Hatti and then proceed to maintain that their respective gods also demand peace. It contains many elements found in more modern treaties, but is more far-reaching than later treaties' simple declaration of the end of hostilities. It also contains a mutual-assistance pact in the event that one of the empires should be attacked by a third party, or in the event of internal strife. There are articles pertaining to the forced [[repatriation]] of [[refugee]]s and provisions that they should not be harmed; this might be thought of as the first [[extradition]] treaty. There are also threats of retribution, should the treaty be broken.

This treaty is considered of such importance in the field of international relations that a reproduction of it hangs in the [[United Nations]] headquarters.

===Modern history===
Famous examples include the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)]], signed after [[Napoleon]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], formally ending the [[World War I|First World War]] conflict between Germany and the Western Allies. This is held to have ended World War I completely, but in fact that did not happen until the Allies concluded peace with the Ottoman Empire in 1920 through the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The Versailles treaty is possibly the most notorious of peace treaties, in that it is "blamed" by many historians for the rise of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] in Germany and the eventual outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939. The costly [[World War I reparations|reparations]] that Germany was forced to pay the victors, the fact that Germany had to accept sole responsibility for starting the war, and the harsh restrictions on German rearmament were all listed in the treaty and caused massive resentment in Germany. Whether the Treaty of Versailles can be blamed for starting another war or not, it shows the difficulties involved in making peace. It might be noted that no such conflict resulted from the more punitive settlement with the Ottomans.

Another famous example would be the series of peace treaties known as the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. It initiated modern diplomacy, involving the modern system of [[Nation-State|nation-states]]. Subsequent wars were no longer over religion, but rather revolved around issues of state. This allowed Catholic and Protestant powers to ally, leading to a number of major realignments.

The [[Korean War]] is an example of a war which was stopped by the 1953 [[s:Korean Armistice Agreement|Korean Armistice Agreement]] but it was not closed with a peace treaty. This means that the Korean War has never technically ended. 
Respecting the latest example of peace treaty, in order to end the [[Vietnam War]], on January 27, 1973, the [[United States]] declared the peace treaty among the USA, North Vietnam, South Vietnam. It was signed with the name as '[[Paris Peace Accords]]' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asaninst.org/contents/%ED%95%9C%EB%B0%98%EB%8F%84-%ED%8F%89%ED%99%94%ED%98%91%EC%A0%95-%EC%B2%B4%EA%B2%B0-%EA%B3%BC%EC%97%B0-%ED%95%84%EC%9A%94%ED%95%9C%EA%B0%80 |title=   ""Is it necessary to sign the "Peace Agreement" on the Korean peninsula? pdf version - page 8 ~ 9 " |publisher= asaninst.org/|date= |accessdate=2017-08-23 |language= Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Trotskyism}}
'''Revolutionary Integrationism''' is an analysis, philosophy, and program for resolving the "black question"—the problem of the superoppression of blacks, and their liberation—in the United States.

==Origins==
Revolutionary Integrationism has its origins in the fight against slavery by [[Frederick Douglass]] and other abolitionists before the Civil War, and in the "New Negro" movement in the 1900s-1910s around the ''Crisis'' journal's 1919 articles by NAACP field marshal [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] and other of his writings, [[Carrie Clifford]], [[Alfred Kreymborg]], and especially, the black Communist poet [[Claude McKay]], [[Max Eastman]]'s and [[Crystal Eastman]]'s ''Liberator'', as well as [[A. Philip Randolph]]'s and [[Chandler Owen]]'s ''Messenger.'' In the 1930s through 1960s, the ''RI'' doctrine was developed in the main by Trotskyists--[[Max Shachtman]], [[Oliver Cox]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Richard S. Fraser]], [[James Robertson (Trotskyist)|James Robertson]], as well as by non-Trotskyists such as [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]. These activists argued that the struggle for equality by blacks in the United States was the main current in black history, and that equality could only be accomplished via a socialist revolution by the entire working class. They disagreed with the opinion of socialist thinkers like [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[C.L.R. James]] in the 1930s, and with [[George Breitman]] and the majority of the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)]] in the late 1950s.  Such thinkers argued that [[Black nationalism]] was a [[transitional demand]] toward socialism. They also disagreed with [[Joseph Stalin]] and his followers in the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA), who initiated this adaptation to black nationalism within the U.S. Marxist movement.

Revolutionary integrationism disputes the assertion of these thinkers, and other Leftists and liberals, that blacks in America potentially constitute a "nation", that blacks require separate organizations from whites, and that such organizations might constitute a separate or autonomous second "vanguard", which would cooperate, but not be integrated into, a "white" Marxist American vanguard party.

Revolutionary Integrationists argue that equality rather than national liberation should be advocated by revolutionary socialists, that this equality can be accomplished through a class struggle of black and white workers and that such a revolution can be led by members of both races.  It was most strongly opposed during the 1960s to the ideas of [[Malcolm X]], the [[Black Panther Party]] and other [[Black Nationalist]] organizations.

== Negating the notion of a "Black Nation" ==
A central part of this idea is the rejection of the possibility of African Americans forming a distinct nation in the United States.
*The Southern "black belt" alleged basis for a black nation is a statistical-geographical fiction cobbled together by the Stalinists.
*by the criteria of nationhood put forward by Stalin, U.S. blacks do not constitute a nation, because they do not possess either a separate language or culture. Especially, despite the assertions of black nationalists that "white America" constitutes an oppressor nation, the alleged black "nation" lacks a separate or autonomous geographic territory on which there is or potentially might be created a separate capitalist market economy, which is "oppressed" by some foreign imperialist power.
*Black nationalism is not the essential thrust of U.S. black history: it is instead, like the Zionist movement in Europe among Jews, the product of the desires of a petit bourgeois stratum of blacks to elevating themselves politically and economically, to become capitalist politicians and capitalists, at the expense of their working class followers, by gaining their votes for political careers within the Democratic Party, and/or by exploiting them as a superoppressed labor force (much like, as in Chinatown, Chinese sweatshop owners exploit their own).
*Besides these cynical self-aggrandizing motives of the black petit bourgeoisie, the appeal and attraction of black nationalism only gains ground among black working class and poor people during times of desperation about the basic struggle for equality. For example, [[Martin Delany]]'s black nationalist novel ''Blake: or the Huts of America'' was written before the Civil War, when, ironically, Delany felt things were hopeless in the U.S. In the 1960s, black nationalism arose with the McCarthyite repression of trade union militants in the CIO, the CIO's fusion with the AFL and their turning firmly toward the Democratic Party, the growth in the power of anti-communist trade union bureaucrats, and their resort to racism to maintain a loyal following. The early industrial organizing days of the CIO, and the organizing efforts in Harlem and other places by the Communist Party, were radical, integrationist, inspiring hope among black workers that racial barriers would be overcome: thus the black nationalism of the [[Marcus Garvey]] movement and the [[Nation of Islam|Black Muslims]] was on the wane in the mid-1930s.

==Capitalism and racism==
The '''Revolutionary Integrationists''' argue that:
*White racism against blacks is not the product of some inner "imperialism", "urge for domination", "male sexual competition", "innate inability to accept the Other", etc. Such explanations are all products of liberal idealism, not [[historical materialism]].
*Racism arises with the rise of capitalism: it is not expressed in the ancient world, nor in much of the feudal era. It gains ground as the feudal mode of production begins to deteriorate. The Jews, losing their status as a feudal caste (See [[Abraham Leon]], ''The Jewish Question: A Marxist Interpretation'') become the scapegoats of choice for the developing capitalist class. Against the Irish, as Cox pointed out, British racism becomes a justification for the exploitation of the British working class. Against Africans, it becomes a rationale for their capture and enslavement in the U.S., and a means by which they are isolated from white farmers and workers, by the capitalist class. Today it is used by the capitalist class to divide the working class against itself, to privilege one sector of the working class, the whites (or to make them think they are privileged when day by day their own oppression actually grows), against the others (blacks, Latinos, Arabs, etc.), to prevent the working class from uniting. It also rationalizes the superexploitation of workers of color, and the forcing of them into the category of a permanent reserve army of labor of the chronically unemployed.
*The history of the southern United States is not a history of a "southern ruling class" maintaining [[Jim Crow]] out of motives purely or mainly of racism. Since the Civil War broke the old Southern planter class, the South and its politicians, such as [[Strom Thurmond]], etc. have been controlled by Northern corporations. [[U.S. Steel]], for example, with offices in the North, provided funding for demagogues like Thurmond, who, in 1948, ran on a platform of segregation and fierce resistance to anti-lynch laws in Congress.
*In the Civil Rights era of the 1950s and 60s, it is not the case that the Northern-based ruling capitalist class of the South as well as North switched sides and became firm liberal champions of racial integration. Instead, the U.S. capitalist class, particularly its multinational corporate wing which at the time supported the Democratic Party, realized that they could stave off a social revolution in the South by presenting themselves as the non-violent liberal movement's benefactors. "Sending federal troops to Mississippi", however, was not benevolent—the FBI and the federal troops were as much or more concerned with crushing revolutionary militancy among blacks as they were with stopping the Klan. The FBI, for example, gave details in advance of the Freedom Riders' plans to local police officials, whom the FBI knew would reveal such details to the Klan&lt;Kenneth O'Reilly&gt;.

== Integration and the transitional program==
Radical integrationism argues that it is impossible, contra the assertions of liberal assimilationists such as [[Gunnar Myrdal]] and the early [[Martin Luther King]], for blacks to be integrated into a ''capitalist'' U.S. society. Integration, it is argued, can only be achieved in a socialist society.  Revolutionary integrationism must not be confused with ''cultural'' assimilation, either.  Culturally, as [[Randolph Bourne]] and James Baldwin argued, the culture of America itself must change, for genuine ''integration'' to take place. Thus leading black workers must be educated to see the fight for socialism as integral to their own struggle for emancipation, and fully integrated into the rank and file and leadership of a future U.S. Bolshevik-Leninist party. In turn,this process of racial integration must be fully integrated into the transitional demands made by socialists. Such demands as worker control of hiring, organize the South, organize unions of the unemployed, organize the unorganized, full employment through public works, armed self-defense of black neighborhoods ("block patrols") must be fully taken up by Leninists.

==Shows==
While attending college, Frank began dancing in stage productions, and her first show was "Minnie's Boys," followed by "Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America."

The team's high point came when they toured fifty-one European cities as the dance act for the big band stage show ''In The Mood – A Tribute to Glenn Miller''.&lt;ref name="traditionintap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionintap.org/Faculty/Rusty_Frank/index.html|title=Rusty Frank: Faculty|accessdate=August 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728120917/http://www.traditionintap.org/Faculty/Rusty_Frank/index.html |archivedate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Frank has performed at such prestigious venues as Broadway's [[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]], at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], at [[Disneyland]] and at the world-famous Derby in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swinginhepcats.com/Swing_Dance/Videos/rusty_frank/rusty_frank_bio.html|title=Rusty Frank |accessdate=August 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705193659/http://swinginhepcats.com/Swing_Dance/Videos/rusty_frank/rusty_frank_bio.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Myra Kingsbury''' (October 18, 1870 – November 28, 1949) was an American professor of economics and a pioneer of social research.

Susan was born in [[San Pablo, California]] in 1870, the daughter of Willard Belmont Kingsbury, M.D., and Helen Shuler née DeLamater,&lt;ref name=Leonard1914/&gt; and was raised in [[Stockton, California]].&lt;ref name=Ohles1997/&gt; Her father died when she was six, leaving Helen to raise Susan and her brother. Helen was dean of women at the [[College of the Pacific]], where Susan would matriculate then graduate with honors in 1890.&lt;ref name=Dzuback1993/&gt; From 1892–1900 she was a history teacher at [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]] in [[San Francisco]], while tending to her ailing mother.&lt;ref name=Dzuback1993/&gt; She graduated with an A.M. in sociology from [[Stanford University]] in 1899, [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name=Leonard1914/&gt;

Following the death of her mother, she moved to New York to study colonial economic history at [[Columbia University]]. In 1904, she taught history for a year at [[Vassar College]].&lt;ref name=Vassar1920/&gt; She graduated from Columbia with a Ph.D. in 1905,&lt;ref name=Leonard1914/&gt; with a dissertation titled ''An Introduction to the Records of the Virginian Company of London.'' During her stay in London (1903–04),&lt;ref name=Marchione2013/&gt; her readings inspired a personal interest in social reform.&lt;ref name=Dzuback1993/&gt; In 1906 she published the first of what would become a four volume set titled ''Records of the Virginian Company of London'', with the final volume being completed in 1933.&lt;ref name=Diaz2017/&gt;

Dr. Kingsbury became director of investigation for the Massachusetts Commission on Industrial and Technical Education&lt;ref name=Dzuback1993/&gt; for a year beginning in 1905. The next year she accepted a position as instructor in history and economics at [[Simmons University]], becoming head of the department. She gained the rank of associate professor in 1907.&lt;ref name=Leonard1914/&gt; The same year she was also named director of research for the ''Women's Educational and Industrial Union'' in Boston. She served as president of the New England History Teachers Association in 1911.&lt;ref name=Leonard1914/&gt; From 1911–13, she directed a national study of the opportunities for women in social service.&lt;ref name=Marchione2013/&gt;

Her various publications, including ''Labor Laws and Their Enforcement'' (1911) and ''Economic Efficiency of College Women'' (1911) caught the attention of [[Martha Carey Thomas]], president of [[Bryn Mawr College]].&lt;ref name=Dzuback1993/&gt; After listening to an address by Dr. Kingsbury in 1912, Thomas invited her to come to work at the College.&lt;ref name=Ohles1997/&gt; In 1915 Dr. Kingsbury became director of the ''[[Carola Woerishoffer]] Graduate Department of Social Economy and Social Research'' at the college.&lt;ref name=Marchione2013/&gt; This was the first graduate department in the country to train students for careers in social service.&lt;ref name=Ohles1997/&gt;

In 1919 she helped found the American Association of Schools of Social Work in 1919, and served as vice president of the American Economic Association and the American Sociological Society.&lt;ref name=Ohles1997/&gt; She and Thomas founded the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in 1921.&lt;ref name=Ohles1997/&gt; Susan was chairman of Pennsylvania's first minimum wage board and for nearly a decade served as chairman for the American Association of University Women Committee on Economic and Legislative Status on Women.&lt;ref name=ssr1950/&gt; During 1921–22 she toured China and India, then the Soviet Union in 1929–30, 1932, and 1936 to research conditions for women and children.&lt;ref name=Thomson2007/&gt; She published her results of the Russia visits as co-author in 1935.&lt;ref name=ssr1950/&gt; She retired as professor emeritus of social economy at Bryn Mawr College in 1936.&lt;ref name=Marchione2013/&gt;

The object is a 6cm-long piece of [[quartzite]] rock dated to the Middle [[Acheulean]] period, between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago, which some have interpreted as a depiction of the human form, gender indeterminate and faceless.

The '''Walsall Anarchists''' were a group of [[anarchism|anarchists]] arrested on explosive charges in [[Walsall]] in 1892.&lt;ref name=fuse&gt;{{cite book |last=Quail |first=John |title=The Slow Burning Fuse |publisher=Paladin |location=London |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-586-08225-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research into police files has revealed that the bombings were instigated by Auguste Coulon, an ''[[agent provocateur]]'' of [[Special Branch]] Inspector [[William Melville]], who would go on to become an early official of what became [[MI5]].&lt;ref name=spymaster&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=Bernard |year=2005 |month= |title=M: MI5's First Spymaster |journal=The English Historical Review |volume=120 |issue=489 |pages=21459–1460 |doi=10.1093/ehr/cei460 |url=  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Initial arrests ==

On 6 January 1892, Joe Deakin, an anarchist from Walsall, was arrested on [[Tottenham Court Road]], [[London]] on his way to the Autonomie Club. He was remanded in custody at [[Great Marlborough Street Magistrates Court]] the next day on a charge of manufacturing bombs. Following this court appearance, Inspector Melville went to Walsall and that evening arrested Victor Cails, a [[France|Frenchman]], and Fred Charles at the Socialist Club in Goodall Street, Walsall. Later William Ditchfield and John Westley were arrested in Walsall and Jean Battola, an Italian, was arrested in London. Deakin and Battola were taken to Walsall to stand trial. They were all jointly charged with bomb making. At their first appearance at the Walsall police court, the prosecution asked for a week's remand on the grounds that "[t]he authorities both in Walsall and London had received very important information with reference to what he might call a widespread conspiracy throughout the country."

== Evidence ==

The evidence presented was as follows:

:In Charles' possession was plans for a bomb with instructions in French, a model of a bolt allegedly to fit the top of the bomb and a French manifesto written by Cails called ''The Means of Emancipation'' which included: '"Let us occupy ourselves with chemistry, and let us manufacture promptly bombs, dynamite and other explosive matters much more efficacious than guns and barricades to bring about the destruction of the actual state of things, and above all, to spare the precious blood of our comrades. Courage, companions! Long Live Anarchy! Walsall, 1 September 1891."'
:In Cails' possession was found a fuse and several French Anarchist publications, including issue number 7 of ''L'International'', which gave instructions on making bombs and how to use them for the demolition of public buildings.
:At Ditchfield's workshop 'a plaster cast of a bomb similar to the sketch produced' was found and at his home a bolt 'for the head of one of the missiles'. In the basement of the Socialist Club there was 'a quantity of clay mixed with hair, evidently for moulding purposes'.
All six were remanded in custody, although no explosives were actually found and there was no evidence as regards the other three defendants.

== Subsequent arrests and confessions ==
[[File:Walsall anarchists poster.jpg|thumb|Poster advertising a meeting on 25 March 1894 in support of the release of the Walsall Anarchists Charles, Deakin, Cails, and Battola. The poster attributes their convictions to "a Sham Dynamite Plot" concocted by "a [[police informant|spy]] in the pay of the Russian and British police.]]
Under the false belief that Charles was a police spy, Deakin made a confession. However, his confession also implicated Auguste Coulon, a French anarchist, who worked as an assistant in the school set up by [[Louise Michel]] for the education of the children of the foreign socialists in London. He was also involved in trying to organise chemistry classes and translating and circulating information about bomb making. The police also arrested a Swiss inventor called Cavargna, who had invented some small explosive shells for exterminating rabbits in Australia. He was released after two days. A further person named McCormack, who had been recently expelled from the socialist club in Walsall, offered his services to the police, who soon decided he was unreliable. He went to [[Birmingham]] where he sold his story to the newspaper and got drunk on the proceeds. Arrested for being drunk and disorderly, he promptly declared in court next day that he had been employed by the police to fabricate evidence against the Walsall Anarchists. Charles Mowbray and [[David Nicholl (anarchist)|David Nicholl]] were soon also arrested on conspiracy charges.

Following his release, Nicholl was raising money for the Walsall anarchists when, by chance, Coulon's brother let slip that Coulon himself was a police agent. The defence brought up the situation at the police court and gave Coulon's address asking why he had not been arrested as well. After Nicholl had set up an anarchist defence fund, [[Edward Carpenter]] set up one which raised money in socialist circles. Their different political outlook was especially noticeable as regards to what extent they felt the whole trial was a case of police provocation.

== Atmosphere of the trial and conviction ==
The case aroused media attention, particularly around two texts: the ''Means of Emancipation'' and ''The Anarchist Feast at The Opera''{{spaced ndash}}the latter was a detailed account of how to cause the maximum amount of carnage in an opera house by rupturing the gas supply and leaving incendiary devices in the seats, while the miscreant could make their escape. Following three bombings in [[Paris]], the correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' made the connection: 'Anarchists should not be regarded as members of a political party, and it should not be possible for an Anarchist to hurry away from Paris to find an asylum in Brussels, in Geneva or in London.' [[Ravachol]] was arrested for two of these bombings, and promptly made a confession.

The climate of the trial was not conducive to a sober consideration of the facts{{spaced ndash}}''The Anarchist Feast at The Opera'' was read out as if it were the views of the defendants. The defense did not argue that it was a police plot. Charles, Cails and Battola were found guilty; Deakin guilty but with a recommendation for mercy; and Westley and Ditchfield not guilty. Those found guilty were allowed to make a statement, whereupon the first three stated they thought it was a police plot. Charles, Battola and Cails were given ten years each, and Deakin five. Although the judge denied he was punishing them for being anarchists, ''The Times'' was more to the point:

:''The offence with which the prisoners were charged is one of the most dastardly and wicked which it is possible to conceive. Like treason it is aimed at the very heart of the State, but it is not designed to destroy the existing Government alone. It strikes at all Governments, and behind all Governments it strikes at those elementary social rights for the defence of which all forms and methods of civil rules exist. The crime of which the Walsall prisoners have been found guilty was no isolated act ( ... ) Hate, envy, the lust of plunder, and the lust of bloodshed are stamped on every line of the Anarchist literature read at Walsall and on every word of the confessions made by RAVACHOL.''

'Alas! Alas! Ten years for Charles, it is too bad. An evil conscience makes them cowards.' wrote Edward Carpenter following the trial.

'''William of Tyre''' ({{lang-la|Willelmus Tyrensis}}; {{circa|lk=no}} 1130 – 29 September 1186) was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[prelate]] and [[chronicler]]. As [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tyre|archbishop of Tyre]], he is sometimes known as '''William II''' to distinguish him from his predecessor, William I, the Englishman and former Prior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, who was Archbishop of Tyre from 1127 to 1135.&lt;ref&gt;In his history, William of Tyre writes, "in the fourth year after Tyre had been [captured] (that is, in 1127/28), the king, patriarch, and other leading men elected (as archbishop of Tyre) William, the venerable prior of the church of the Sepulchre of the Lord", adding that this William was "an Englishman by birth, and a man of most exemplary life and character". A few chapters later, William reports that when the Patriarch Stephen died (in 1130), "he was succeeded by William, prior of the church of the Sepulchre of the Lord…He was Flemish by birth, a native of Mesines." Two Williams were prior of the Holy Sepulchre at an early time then, with William of Mesines (Flanders) probably directly succeeding William the Englishman as Prior of the Holy Sepulchre.  This also means that William of Mesines could only have been prior from 1127 (the year of the election of William the Englishman to the archbishopric of Tyre) to 1130, the year of his own election as Patriarch. See William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea", Vol. 1, trans. Emily Babcock and A.C. Krey, Bk. XIII, Ch. 23 and Bk. XIII, Ch. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Jerusalem]] at the height of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which had been established in 1099 after the [[First Crusade]], and he spent twenty years studying the [[liberal arts]] and [[canon law]] in the [[Medieval university|universities of Europe]].

Following William's return to Jerusalem in 1165, King [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]] made him an ambassador to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. William became tutor to the king's son, the future King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], whom William discovered to be a [[leprosy|leper]]. After Amalric's death, William became [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|chancellor]] and archbishop of Tyre, two of the highest offices in the kingdom, and in 1179 William led the eastern delegation to the [[Third Council of the Lateran]]. As he was involved in the dynastic struggle that developed during Baldwin IV's reign, his importance waned when a rival faction gained control of royal affairs. He was passed over for the prestigious [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarchate of Jerusalem]], and died in obscurity, probably in 1186.

William wrote an account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of [[Muhammad]]. Neither work survives. He is famous today as the author of a history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William composed his [[chronicle]] in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from [[classical literature]]. The chronicle is sometimes given the title ''Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum'' ("History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea") or ''Historia Ierosolimitana'' ("History of Jerusalem"), or the ''Historia'' for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, and one of the best authors of the [[Middle Ages]].

==Early life==
[[File:Map Crusader states 1165-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|The Crusader states in 1165|alt=The Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Near East. To the southwest is the Fatimid Caliphate of Cairo. To the east is the Emirate of Damascus, and to the west is the Mediterranean Sea. To the north are the County of Tripoli, Principality of Antioch, County of Edessa, Principality of Armenian Cilicia, the Byzantine Empire, and the Sultanate of Rum.]]
The Kingdom of Jerusalem was founded in 1099 at the end of the First Crusade. It was the third of four [[Crusader states|Christian territories]] to be established by the crusaders, following the [[County of Edessa]] and the [[Principality of Antioch]], and followed by the [[County of Tripoli]]. Jerusalem's first three rulers, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] (1099–1100), his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]] (1100–1118), and their cousin [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] (1118–1131), expanded and secured the kingdom's borders, which encompassed roughly the same territory as modern-day [[Israel]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], and [[Lebanon]]. During the kingdom's early decades, the population was swelled by pilgrims visiting the holiest sites of Christendom. Merchants from the Mediterranean city-states of [[Italy]] and [[France]] were eager to exploit the rich trade markets of the east.&lt;ref&gt;The most up-to-date works about the First Crusade are [[Thomas Asbridge]], ''[[The First Crusade: A New History]]'' (Oxford: 2004) and Christopher Tyerman, ''God's War: A New History of the Crusades'' (Penguin: 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

William's family probably originated in either France or Italy, since he was very familiar with both countries.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Atwater Babcock and August C. Krey, trans., introduction to William of Tyre, ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea'' (Columbia University Press, 1943), vol. 1, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were likely merchants who had settled in the kingdom and were "apparently well-to-do",&lt;ref&gt;R. B. C. Huygens, "Editing William of Tyre", ''Sacris Erudiri'' 27 (1984), p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unknown whether they participated in the First Crusade or arrived later. William was born in Jerusalem around 1130. He had at least one brother, Ralph, who was one of the city's [[burgess (title)|burgesses]], a non-noble leader of the merchant community. Nothing more is known about his family, except that his mother died before 1165.&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Edbury and John G. Rowe, ''William of Tyre: Historian of the Latin East'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child William was educated in Jerusalem, at the [[cathedral school]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. The ''scholaster'', or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first introduced him to [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans E. Mayer, "Guillaume de Tyr à l'école" (Mémoires de l'Académie des sciences, arts et belles-lettres de Dijon 117, 1985–86), p. 264; repr. ''Kings and Lords in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, Variorum Collected Series Studies, 1994). John later became [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal priest]] of [[San Martino ai Monti|SS. Silvestri e Martino]], and supported [[Antipope Victor IV (1159–1164)|Antipope Victor IV]] over [[Pope Alexander III]].&lt;/ref&gt; From the ''Historia'' it is clear that he also knew [[French language|French]] and possibly [[Italian language|Italian]], but there is not enough evidence to determine whether he learned [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as is sometimes claimed.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. C. Huygens, ed., introduction to ''Willemi Tyrensis Archiepiscopi Chronicon'', [[Corpus Christianorum]], Continuatio Medievalis, vol. 38 (Turnhout: Brepols, 1986), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1145 William went to Europe to continue his education in the schools of France and Italy, especially in those of [[Paris]] and [[Bologna]], "the two most important intellectual centers of twelfth-century Christendom."&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Loud and J. W. Cox, "The 'Lost' Autobiographical Chapter of William of Tyre's Chronicle (Book XIX.12)", ''The Crusades: An Encyclopedia'', ed. Alan V. Murray (ABC-Clio, 2006), vol. 4, Appendix: Texts and Documents #4, p. 1306.&lt;/ref&gt; These schools were not yet the official [[medieval university|universities]] that they would become in the 13th century, but by the end of the 11th century both had numerous schools for the arts and sciences. They were separate from the cathedral schools, and were established by independent professors who were masters of their field of study. Students from all over Europe gathered there to hear lectures from these masters.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Verger, "The birth of the universities". ''A History of the University in Europe'', vol. 1: Universities in the Middle Ages, ed. Hilde de Ridder-Symoens (Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 47–50.&lt;/ref&gt; William studied [[liberal arts]] and [[theology]] in [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[Orléans]] for about ten years, with professors who had been students of [[Thierry of Chartres]] and [[Gilbert de la Porrée]]. He also spent time studying under [[Robert of Melun]] and [[Adam de Parvo Ponte]], among others. In Orléans, one of the pre-eminent centres of classical studies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Homer Haskins]], ''The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century'' (Harvard University Press, 1927; repr. Meridian Books, 1966), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; he read ancient Roman literature (known simply as "the Authors") with [[Hilarius (poet)|Hilary of Orléans]], and learned [[mathematics]] ("especially [[Euclid]]") with [[William of Soissons]]. For six years, he studied theology with [[Peter Lombard]] and [[Maurice de Sully]]. Afterwards, he studied [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[canon law]] in [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], with the "[[Four Doctors of Bologna|Four Doctors]]", [[Hugo de Porta Ravennate]], [[Bulgarus]], [[Martinus Gosia]], and [[Jacobus de Boragine]].&lt;ref&gt;The chapter of the ''Historia'' detailing his education in Europe was lost until Robert Huygens discovered it 1961, in a manuscript in the [[Vatican Library]] (ms. ''Vaticanus latinus'' 2002); Huygens, "Guillaume de Tyr étudiant: un chapître (XIX, 12) de son Histoire retrouvé" (''Latomus'' 21, 1962), p. 813. It is unknown why no other manuscript has this chapter, but Huygens suggests an early copyist considered it out of place within the rest of book nineteen and excised it, and thus all subsequent copies also lacked it (ibid., p. 820). It was included in Huygen's critical edition of the ''Historia'' (book 19, chapter 12, pp. 879–881.) As the chapter had not yet been discovered, it is not included in the 1943 English translation by Babcock and Krey.&lt;/ref&gt; William's list of professors "gives us almost a who's who of the grammarians, philosophers, theologians, and law teachers of the so-called [[Twelfth-Century Renaissance]]", and shows that he was as well-educated as any European cleric. His contemporary [[John of Salisbury]] had many of the same teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Loud and Cox, p. 1306. Loud and Cox also give an English translation of the chapter. It has also been translated online by Paul R. Hyams, "[http://prh3.arts.cornell.edu/447/texts/wteduc.htm William of Tyre's Education, 1145/65]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious and political life in Jerusalem==
The highest religious and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans who had arrived on pilgrimage or crusade. William was one of the few natives with a European education, and he quickly rose through the ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Alan V. Murray, "William of Tyre". ''The Crusades: An Encyclopedia'', vol. 4, p. 1281.&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to the Holy Land in 1165, he became [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral at [[Acre (city)|Acre]]. In 1167 he was appointed [[archdeacon]] of the cathedral of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] by [[Frederick de la Roche]], archbishop of Tyre, with the support of King [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]].&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amalric had come to power in 1164 and had made it his goal to [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|conquer Egypt]]. [[Egypt]] had been invaded by King Baldwin I fifty years earlier, and the weak [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was forced to pay yearly tribute to Jerusalem. Amalric turned towards Egypt because Muslim territory to the east of Jerusalem had fallen under the control of the powerful [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] sultan [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]. Nur ad-Din had taken control of [[Damascus]] in 1154, six years after the disastrous [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|siege of Damascus]] by the [[Second Crusade]] in 1148. Jerusalem could now expand only to the southwest, towards Egypt, and in 1153 [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], the last Fatimid outpost in Palestine, [[Siege of Ascalon|fell to the crusaders]]. Nur ad-Din, however, also wished to acquire Egypt, and sent his army to hinder Amalric's plans. This was the situation in the east when William returned from Europe. In 1167 Amalric married [[Maria Comnena, queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], grand-niece of [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], and in 1168 the king sent William to finalize a treaty for a joint Byzantine-crusader campaign against Egypt. The expedition, Amalric's fourth, was the first with support from the [[Byzantine navy]]. Amalric, however, did not wait for the fleet to arrive. He managed to capture [[Damietta]], but within a few years he was expelled from Egypt by one of Nur ad-Din's generals, [[Saladin]], who would later become Jerusalem's greatest threat.&lt;ref&gt;Hans E. Mayer, ''The Crusades'', 2nd ed., trans. John Gillingham (Oxford: 1988), pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, William continued his advancement in the kingdom. In 1169 he visited [[Rome]], possibly to answer accusations made against him by Archbishop Frederick, although if so, the charge is unknown. It is also possible that while Frederick was away on a diplomatic mission in Europe, a problem within the diocese forced William to seek the archbishop's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BaldwinIV.jpg|frame|William of Tyre discovers Baldwin's first symptoms of leprosy (MS of ''L'Estoire d'Eracles'' (French translation of William of Tyre's ''Historia''), painted in France, 1250s.

On the right panel, a man inspects the injuries on one of the boys' arms.]]
On his return from Rome in 1170 he may have been commissioned by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom. He also became the tutor of Amalric's son and heir, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]]. When Baldwin was thirteen years old, he was playing with some children, who were trying to cause each other pain by scratching each other's arms. "The other boys gave evidence of pain by their outcries," wrote William, "but Baldwin, although his comrades did not spare him, endured it altogether too patiently, as if he felt nothing&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;It is impossible to refrain from tears while speaking of this great misfortune."&lt;ref&gt;William of Tyre, trans. Babcock and Krey, vol. 2, book 21, chapter 1, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; William inspected Baldwin's arms and recognized the possible symptoms of [[leprosy]], which was confirmed as Baldwin grew older.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 17; Bernard Hamilton, ''The Leper King and His Heirs: Baldwin IV and the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amalric died in 1174, and Baldwin IV succeeded him as king. Nur ad-Din also died in 1174, and his general Saladin spent the rest of the decade consolidating his hold on both Egypt and Nur ad-Din's possessions in Syria, which allowed him to completely encircle Jerusalem. The subsequent events have often been interpreted as a struggle between two opposing factions, a "court party" and a "noble party." The "court party" was led by Baldwin's mother, Amalric's first wife [[Agnes of Courtenay]], and her [[House of Courtenay|immediate family]], as well as recent arrivals from Europe who were inexperienced in the affairs of the kingdom and were in favour of war with Saladin. The "noble party" was led by [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] and the native nobility of the kingdom, who favoured peaceful co-existence with the Muslims. This is the interpretation offered by William himself in the ''Historia'', and it was taken as fact by later historians. Peter W. Edbury, however, has more recently argued that William must be considered extremely partisan as he was naturally allied with Raymond, who was responsible for his later advancement in political and religious offices. The accounts of the 13th-century authors who continued the ''Historia'' in French must also be considered suspect, as they were allied to Raymond's supporters in the [[Ibelin family]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter W. Edbury, "Propaganda and faction in the Kingdom of Jerusalem: the background to Hattin", ''Crusaders and Moslems in Twelfth-Century Syria'' (ed. Maya Shatzmiller, Leiden: Brill, 1993), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; The general consensus among recent historians is that although there was a dynastic struggle, "the division was not between native barons and newcomers from the West, but between the king's maternal and paternal kin."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miles of Plancy]] briefly held the regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles was assassinated in October 1174, and Raymond III was soon appointed to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond named William [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|chancellor of Jerusalem]], as well as archdeacon of [[Nazareth]], and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, who had died in October 1174.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the [[chancery (medieval office)|chancery]] drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William of Montferrat]], husband of Baldwin IV's sister [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], when the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Amalric of Nesle]], was too sick to attend.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1179, William was one of the delegates from Jerusalem and the other crusader states at the [[Third Council of the Lateran|Third Lateran Council]]; among the others were [[Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem|Heraclius]], [[archbishop of Caesarea]], [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre|Joscius]], [[Latin Catholic Diocese of Acre|bishop of Acre]] and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastea]], [[Titular see of Bethlehem|Bethlehem]], [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], and [[Jabala]], and the abbot of [[Mount Zion|Mount Sion]]. Patriarch Amalric and [[Latin Patriarch of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch]] [[Aimery of Limoges]] were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade [[Pope Alexander III]] of the need for a new crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the [[Principality of Antioch]]. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a [[Greek Patriarch of Antioch|Greek patriarch]]. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 54–55, 146–47; Hamilton, pp. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patriarchal election of 1180==
During William's absence a crisis had developed in Jerusalem. King Baldwin had reached the [[age of majority]] in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could not be expected to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin's widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin [[Bohemond III of Antioch]] attempted to force Sibylla to marry [[Baldwin of Ibelin]]. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin's nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a [[Poitou|Poitevin]] newcomer, [[Guy of Lusignan]], whose older brother [[Aimery of Jerusalem|Aimery of Lusignan]] was already an established figure at court.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, pp. 150–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute affected William, since he had been appointed chancellor by Raymond and may have fallen out of favour after Raymond was removed from the regency. When Patriarch Amalric died on 6 October 1180, the two most obvious choices for his successor were William and Heraclius of Caesarea. They were fairly evenly matched in background and education, but politically they were allied with opposite parties, as Heraclius was one of Agnes of Courtenay's supporters. It seems that the canons of the Holy Sepulchre were unable to decide, and asked the king for advice; due to Agnes' influence, Heraclius was elected. There were rumours that Agnes and Heraclius were lovers, but this information comes from the partisan 13th-century continuations of the ''Historia'', and there is no other evidence to substantiate such a claim. William himself says almost nothing about the election and Heraclius' character or his subsequent patriarchate, probably reflecting his disappointment at the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, pp. 162–163; Edbury and Rowe, "William of Tyre and the Patriarchal election of 1180", ''[[The English Historical Review]]'' 93 (1978), repr. ''Kingdoms of the Crusaders: From Jerusalem to Cyprus'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, Variorum Collected Series Studies, 1999), pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:BNF, Mss fr 68, folio 359.jpg|thumb|left|Saladin burning a town, from a manuscript of the French translation of the ''Historia''|alt=A miniature painting from a medieval manuscript. A man on horseback, followed by men on foot, rides past a burning castle. The castle is on a shore, and there are ships in the water. There is text above and below the painting.]]
William remained archbishop of Tyre and chancellor of the kingdom, but the details of his life at this time are obscure. The 13th-century [[continuator]]s claim that Heraclius excommunicated William in 1183, but it is unknown why Heraclius would have done this. They also claim that William went to Rome to appeal to the Pope, where Heraclius had him poisoned. According to Peter Edbury and John Rowe, the obscurity of William's life during these years shows that he did not play a large political role, but concentrated on ecclesiastical affairs and the writing of his history. The story of his excommunication, and the unlikely detail that he was poisoned, were probably an invention of the Old French continuators.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; William remained in the kingdom and continued to write up until 1184, but by then Jerusalem was internally divided by political factions and externally surrounded by the forces of Saladin, and "the only subjects that present themselves are the disasters of a sorrowing country and its manifold misfortunes, themes which can serve only to draw forth lamentations and tears."&lt;ref&gt;William of Tyre, trans. Babcock and Krey, vol. 2, book 23, preface, p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

His importance had dwindled with the victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, there was a new chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans E. Mayer]] concluded that William died in 1186, and this is the year generally accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Mayer, "Zum Tod Wilhelms von Tyrus" (''Archiv für Diplomatik'' 5/6, 1959–1960; repr. ''Kreuzzüge und lateinischer Osten'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, Variorum Collected Studies Series, 1983)), p. 201. Huygens (''Chronicon'', introduction, p. 1), Susan M. Babbitt ("William of Tyre", ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'' (ed. [[Joseph Strayer]], (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1989), vol. 12, p. 643), Helen J. Nicholson ("William of Tyre", ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', ed. Kelly Boyd (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999), vol. 2, p. 1301), and Alan V. Murray ("William of Tyre", ''The Crusades: An Encyclopedia'', vol. 4, p. 1281), among others, accept Mayer's date.&lt;/ref&gt;

William's foresight about the misfortunes of his country was proven correct less than a year later. Saladin defeated King Guy at the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, and went on to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|capture Jerusalem]] and almost every other city of the kingdom, except the seat of William's archdiocese, Tyre. News of the fall of Jerusalem shocked Europe and plans were made to send assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, pp. 229–232.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger of Wendover]], William was present at [[Gisors]] in France in 1188 when [[Henry II of England]] and [[Philip II of France]] agreed to [[Third Crusade|go on crusade]]: "Thereupon the king of the English first took the sign of the cross at the hands of the [[Archbishop of Rheims]] and William of Tyre, the latter of whom had been entrusted by our lord the pope with the office of legate in the affairs of the crusade in the western part of Europe."&lt;ref&gt;''Roger of Wendover's Flowers of History'', trans. [[J. A. Giles]] (London, 1849), vol. II, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Roger was however mistaken; he knew that an unnamed archbishop of Tyre was present and assumed it must have been the William whose chronicle he possessed, although the archbishop in question was actually William's successor [[Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre|Joscius]].&lt;ref&gt;Babcock and Krey, introduction, p. 25, n. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
William reports that he wrote an account of the Third Council of the Lateran, which does not survive. He also wrote a history of the Holy Land from the time of [[Muhammad]] up to 1184, for which he used [[Eutychius of Alexandria]] as his main source. This work seems to have been known in Europe in the 13th century but it also does not survive.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August C. Krey]] thought William's Arabic sources may have come from the library of the Damascene diplomat [[Usama ibn Munqidh]], whose library was looted by Baldwin III from a shipwreck in 1154.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock and Krey, introduction, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan V. Murray, however, has argued that, at least for the accounts of Persia and the Turks in his chronicle, William relied on Biblical and earlier medieval legends rather than actual history, and his knowledge "may be less indicative of eastern ethnography than of western mythography."&lt;ref&gt;Alan V. Murray, "William of Tyre and the origin of the Turks: on the sources of the Gesta Orientalium Principum," in ''Dei gesta Per Francos: Études sur les crioisades dédiées à Jean Richard/Crusade Studies in Honour of Jean Richard'', edd. Michel Balard, Benjamin Z. Kedar and Jonathan Riley-Smith (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2001), pp. 228-229.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin chronicle===
{{quote|In the present work we seem to have fallen into manifold dangers and perplexities. For, as the series of events seemed to require, we have included in this study on which we are now engaged many details about the characters, lives, and personal traits of kings, regardless of whether these facts were commendable or open to criticism. Possibly descendants of these monarchs, while perusing this work, may find this treatment difficult to brook and be angry with the chronicler beyond his just deserts. They will regard him as either mendacious or jealous—both of which charges, as God lives, we have endeavored to avoid as we would a pestilence.&lt;ref&gt;William of Tyre, trans. Babcock and Krey, vol. 1, prologue, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;|William of Tyre, prologue to the ''Historia''}}

William's great work is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 and the beginning of 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquest of Syria]] by [[Umar]] in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals with the advent of the [[First Crusade]] and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the ''Historia'' was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized that European readers would also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

William had access to the chronicles of the First Crusade, including [[Fulcher of Chartres]], [[Albert of Aix]], [[Raymond of Aguilers]], [[Baldric of Dol]], and the ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'', as well as other documents located in the kingdom's archives. He used [[Walter the Chancellor]] and other now-lost works for the history of the [[Principality of Antioch]]. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William's own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which he was writing, and drew on his own memory.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

William's classical education allowed him to compose Latin superior to that of many medieval writers. He used numerous ancient Roman and early Christian authors, either for quotations or as inspiration for the framework and organization of the ''Historia''.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; His vocabulary is almost entirely classical, with only a few medieval constructions such as "loricator" (someone who makes armour, a [[calque]] of the Arabic "zarra") and "assellare" (to empty one's bowels).&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, ''Chronicon'', introduction, pp. 41–42. William himself translates the Arabic "zarra"; William of Tyre, trans. Babcock and Krey, vol. 1, book 5, chapter 11, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; He was capable of clever word-play and advanced [[rhetoric]]al devices, but he was prone to repetition of a number of words and phrases. His writing also shows phrasing and spelling which is unusual or unknown in purely classical Latin but not uncommon in [[medieval Latin]], such as:
* confusion between [[reflexive pronouns|reflexive]] and [[possessive pronouns]];
* confusion over the use of the [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[ablative case]]s, especially after the [[preposition]] ''in'';
* collapsed [[diphthong]]s (i.e. the Latin diphthongs ''ae'' and ''oe'' are spelled simply ''e'');
* the [[dative case|dative]] "mihi" ("to me") is spelled "michi";
* a single "s" is often doubled, for example in the adjectival place-name ending which he often spells "-enssis"; this spelling is also used to represent the Arabic "[[shin (letter)|sh]]", a sound which Latin lacks, for example in the name [[Shawar]] which he spells "Ssauar".&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, ''Chronicon'', introduction, pp. 40–47. Huygens continues with a lengthy discussion of William's style and language.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary themes and biases===
[[File:Gottfried von Bouillon (Hofkirche Innsbruck) 2006 0931C.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sixteenth-century bronze statue of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] from the group of heroes surrounding the memorial to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Hofkirche, Innsbruck]]. By William's time, Godfrey was seen as the heroic leader of the First Crusade, and his strength and virtue had become legendary.|alt=A statue of a knight with a long beard. He is wearing a crown of thorns and elaborate armour. He has a sword in his left hand, and a shield rests against his right leg.]]
Despite his quotations from Christian authors and from the [[Bible]], William did not place much emphasis on the intervention of God in human affairs, resulting in a somewhat "secular" history.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he included much information that is clearly legendary, especially when referring to the First Crusade, which even in his own day was already considered an age of great Christian heroes. Expanding on the accounts of Albert of Aix, [[Peter the Hermit]] is given prominence in the preaching of the First Crusade, to the point that it was he, not [[Pope Urban II]], who originally conceived the crusade.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Duncalf, "The First Crusade: Clermont to Constantinople", ''A History of the Crusades'' (gen. ed. Kenneth M. Setton), vol. 1: The First Hundred Years (ed. Marshall W. Baldwin, University of Wisconsin Press, 1969), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Godfrey of Bouillon, the first ruler of crusader Jerusalem, was also depicted as the leader of the crusade from the beginning, and William attributed to him legendary strength and virtue. This reflected the almost mythological status that Godfrey and the other first crusaders held for the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the late twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;John Carl Andressohn, ''The Ancestry and Life of Godfrey of Bouillon'' (Indiana University Publications, Social Science Series 5, 1947), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

William gave a more nuanced picture of the kings of his own day. He claimed to have been commissioned to write by King Amalric himself, but William did not allow himself to praise the king excessively; for example, Amalric did not respect the rights of the church, and although he was a good military commander, he could not stop the increasing threat from the neighbouring Muslim states. On a personal level, William admired the king's education and his interest in history and law, but also noted that Amalric had "breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist"&lt;ref&gt;William of Tyre, trans. Babcock and Krey, vol. 2, book 19, chapter 3, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; and was shocked when the king questioned the [[resurrection of the dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

About Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, "there was no ambiguity".&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Baldwin was nothing but heroic in the face of his debilitating leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; William's history can be seen as an ''[[apologia]]'', a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

William was famously biased against the [[Knights Templar]], whom he believed to be arrogant and disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they were not required to pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Barber, ''The Trial of the Templars'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; William accused them of hindering the [[Siege of Ascalon]] in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|invasion of Egypt]] in 1168; and of murdering [[Assassins (sect)|Assassin]] ambassadors in 1173.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other Latin authors of the twelfth century, William is surprisingly favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of [[Alexius I Comnenus]] that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical of some of the crusaders' dealings with Alexius.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; He was more impressed by Alexius' son [[John II Comnenus]]; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the ''Historia'' coincides with the [[massacre of the Latins]] in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of [[Andronicus I Comnenus]], and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek rhetoric that was often found in Western European sources.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 141–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a medieval Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, but as an educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or completely dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Schwinges, "William of Tyre, the Muslim enemy, and the problem of tolerance." ''Tolerance and Intolerance: Social Conflict in the Age of the Crusades'', ed. Michael Gervers and James M. Powell (Syracuse University Press, 2001), pp. 126–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], Nur ad-Din, [[Shirkuh]], and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Schwinges, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulation of the chronicle===
After William's death the ''Historia'' was copied and circulated in the [[crusader state]]s and was eventually brought to Europe. In the 13th century, [[James of Vitry]] had access to a copy while he was bishop of Acre, and it was used by [[Guy of Bazoches]], [[Matthew Paris]], and [[Roger of Wendover]] in their own chronicles. However, there are only ten known manuscripts that contain the Latin chronicle, all of which come from France and England, so William's work may not have been very widely read in its original form.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, however, the ''Historia'' was expanded in Latin, with additional information from the ''[[Itinerarium Regis Ricardi]]'', and the chronicle of [[Roger Hoveden]]; this version was written around 1220.&lt;ref&gt;Helen J. Nicholson, ed., ''The Chronicle of the Third Crusade: The Itinerarium Peregrinorum and the Gesta Regis Ricardi'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1997), introduction, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown what title William himself gave his chronicle, although one group of manuscripts uses ''Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum'' and another uses ''Historia Ierosolimitana''.&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, ''Chronicon'', introduction, pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin text was printed for the first time in Basel in 1549 by [[Nicholas Brylinger]]; it was also published in the ''Gesta Dei per Francos'' by [[Jacques Bongars]] in 1611 and the ''[[Recueil des historiens des croisades]]'' (RHC) by [[Auguste-Arthur Beugnot]] and [[Auguste Le Prévost]] in 1844, and Bongars' text was reprinted in the ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' by [[Jacques Paul Migne]] in 1855. The now-standard Latin critical edition, based on six of the surviving manuscripts, was published as ''Willelmi Tyrensis Archiepiscopi Chronicon'' in the ''[[Corpus Christianorum]]'' in 1986, by R. B. C. Huygens, with notes by [[Hans E. Mayer]] and [[Gerhard Rösch]].&lt;ref&gt;Huygens, ''Chronicon'', introduction, pp. 87–91. The manuscripts used by Huygens are from two related traditions; [[Bibliothèque nationale]] lat. 17801 ("N"), Bibliothèque de la faculté de médecine de Montpellier 91 ("M"), and Bibliothèque nationale lat. 6066 ("P") have a French provenance, and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] 95 ("C"), [[British Library]] Royal 14 C.X ("B"), and [[Magdalene College]] F.4.22 ("W") have an English provenance. The aforementioned Vatican lat. 2002 ("V") and a related fragment ("Fr") were also used. Two manuscripts, Bibliothèque nationale lat. 17153 ("L") and Vatican Reginensis lat. 690 ("R") were not used in Huygens' edition. Huygens, ''Chronicon'', introduction, pp. 3–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The RHC edition was translated into English by Emily A. Babcock and August C. Krey in 1943 as "A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea," although the translation is sometimes incomplete or inexact.&lt;ref&gt;Babcock and Krey, introduction, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old French translation===
A translation of the ''Historia'' into [[Old French language|Old French]], made around 1223, was particularly well-circulated and had many anonymous additions made to it in the 13th century. In contrast to the surviving Latin manuscripts, there are "at least fifty-nine manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts" containing the Old French translation.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 4; For a more updated and detailed historiographical analysis, see &lt;link&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/medieval_studies/french_of_outremer/sources_by_locale/levant/historical_narrative/william_of_tyres_his/&lt;/link&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There are also independent French continuations attributed to [[Ernoul]] and Bernard le Trésorier. The translation was sometimes called the ''Livre dou conqueste''; it was known by this name throughout Europe as well as in the crusader [[Kingdom of Cyprus]] and in [[Cilician Armenia]], and 14th-century Venetian geographer [[Marino Sanuto the Elder]] had a copy of it. The French was further translated into Spanish, as the ''Gran Conquista de Ultramar'', during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso the Wise of Castile]]&lt;ref&gt;González Cristina, La tercera crónica de Alfonso X: "La Gran Conquista de Ultramar", 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 13th century. The French version was so widespread that the [[Renaissance]] author [[Francesco Pipino]] translated it back into Latin, unaware that a Latin original already existed. A [[Middle English]] translation of the French was made by [[William Caxton]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern assessment==
William's neutrality as an historian was often taken for granted until the late twentieth century. August C. Krey, for example, believed that "his impartiality&amp;nbsp; ... &amp;nbsp;is scarcely less impressive than his critical skill."&lt;ref&gt;Babcock and Krey, introduction, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this excellent reputation, D. W. T. C. Vessey has shown that William was certainly not an impartial observer, especially when dealing with the events of the 1170s and 1180s. Vessey believes that William's claim to have been commissioned by Amalric is a typical ancient and medieval ''[[topos]]'', or literary theme, in which a wise ruler, a lover of history and literature, wishes to preserve for posterity the grand deeds of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. T. C. Vessey, "William of Tyre and the art of historiography." ''Mediaeval Studies'' 35 (1973), pp. 437–38.&lt;/ref&gt; William's claims of impartiality are also a typical ''topos'' in ancient and medieval historical writing.&lt;ref&gt;Vessey, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

His depiction of Baldwin IV as a hero is an attempt "to vindicate the politics of his own party and to blacken those of its opponents."&lt;ref&gt;Vessey, p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, William was opposed to Baldwin's mother Agnes of Courtenay, Patriarch Heraclius, and their supporters; his interpretation of events during Baldwin's reign was previously taken as fact almost without question. In the mid twentieth century, Marshall W. Baldwin,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall W. Baldwin, "The Decline and Fall of Jerusalem, 1174–1189", ''A History of the Crusades'', vol. 1, p. 592ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Runciman]],&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades'', vol. 2: The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Frankish East (Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans Eberhard Mayer]]&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, ''The Crusades'', pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt; were influential in perpetuating this point of view, although the more recent re-evaluations of this period by Vessey, [[Peter Edbury]] and [[Bernard Hamilton]] have undone much of William's influence.

An often-noted flaw in the ''Historia'' is William's poor memory for dates. "Chronology is sometimes confused, and dates are given wrongly", even for basic information such as the regnal dates of the kings of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Edbury and Rowe, 1988, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, William gives the date of Amalric's death as 11 July 1173, when it actually occurred in 1174.&lt;ref&gt;William of Tyre, trans. Babcock and Krey, vol. 2, book 20, ch. 31, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his biases and errors, William "has always been considered one of the greatest medieval writers."&lt;ref&gt;"Depuis toujours, Guillaume de Tyr a été considéré comme l'un des meilleurs écrivains du moyen âge." Huygens, ''Chronicon'', introduction, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Runciman wrote that "he had a broad vision; he understood the significance of the great events of his time and the sequence of cause and effect in history."&lt;ref&gt;Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades'', vol. 2, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tyerman calls him "the historian's historian",&lt;ref&gt;Tyerman, ''God's War'', p. 361.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the greatest crusade historian of all,"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Tyerman, ''The Invention of the Crusades'' (University of Toronto Press, 1998), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bernard Hamilton says he "is justly considered one of the finest historians of the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'' says, "William's achievements in assembling and evaluating sources, and in writing in excellent and original Latin a critical and judicious (if chronologically faulty) narrative, make him an outstanding historian, superior by medieval, and not inferior by modern, standards of scholarship."&lt;ref&gt;Babbitt, p. 643.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11904">'''Willy Cohn''' (12 December 1888 in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] – 29 November 1941 in [[Kaunas|Kaunas, Lithuania]]) was a German historian and teacher. During the [[Nazi era]], he documented the Jewish life in Breslau in his diaries, until he and his family were deported to German-occupied [[Lithuania]] and killed.

Cohn's diaries, translated into English and condensed, were published in 2012 as ''No Justice in Germany: The Breslau Diaries, 1933-1941'' by [[Stanford University Press]]. Along with [[Victor Klemperer]], Cohn was one of the most important chroniclers of the crimes of the Nazi regime against the Jewish people.

== Biography==
Willy Cohn came from a wealthy Jewish merchant family in Breslau.  Starting in 1906, he studied history in Breslau and [[Heidelberg]]. He completed his degree in 1909 with a dissertation about the Norman-Sicilian fleet, which was published in Breslau in 1910. Cohn took the examination to qualify as a gymnasium teacher, although he aspired to pursue an academic career at the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]]. He was unable to realize his plans because of discrimination against Jewish academics. Cohn became a teacher at Breslau's gymnasium in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Willy Cohn: ''Kein Recht, nirgends. Tagebuch vom Untergang des Breslauer Judentums 1933–1941'' (= ''Neue Forschungen zur schlesischen Geschichte.'' Bd. 13, 1). Herausgegeben von Norbert Conrads. Band 1. Böhlau, Köln u. a. 2006, {{ISBN|3-412-32905-3}}, S. X f.&lt;/ref&gt; One of those students was the historian [[Walter Laqueur]], who in 1996 called attention to Cohn's diaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Laqueur]]: ''Three Witnesses: The Legacy of Victor Klemperer, Willy Cohn and Richard Koch.'' In: ''Holocaust and Genocide Studies.'' Bd. 10, Nr. 3, {{ISSN|8756-6583}}, S. 252–266, {{doi|10.1093/hgs/10.3.252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: Willy-Cohn-Plakette am Rynek in Breslau.jpg|thumb|A Plaque on Wrocław's Market Square Commemorating Cohn]]
Despite increasing repression after the [[Nazis]] came to power, Cohn still felt connected to [[Germany]] and remained in Breslau with his second wife and two daughters. In his diaries, he documented life under Nazi rule and the subsequent destruction of Breslau's Jewish community, then the third largest in Germany. As the persecution of [[Jews]] in Germany grew worse, the Cohns considered emigration. Cohn and his wife visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1937, but it offered no employment prospects to Cohn, who was not healthy enough to perform physical labor. When they wanted to flee after the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, it was too late; after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the Nazi regime no longer allowed emigration. The Cohns endured the Nazi reign of terror in Breslau; they were arrested on November 21, 1941 and deported to German-occupied [[Lithuania]]. A few days later, on November 29, 1941, Cohn and his family were shot in the [[Ninth Fort]], together with 2000 other Jews from Breslau and [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfram Wette]]: ''Karl Jäger. Mörder der litauischen Juden'' (= ''Fischer'' 19064 ''Die Zeit des Nationalsozialismus''). Fischer-Taschenbuch-Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-596-19064-5}}, S. 124 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a plaque commemorating Cohn was unveiled on Wrocław's [[Market Square, Wrocław|Market Square]].

==''No Justice in Germany: The Breslau Diaries, 1933-1941''==
Cohn's diaries are preserved in the Central Archives for the History of the Jewish People in [[Jerusalem]] and were first published in December 2006. Cohn is considered along with [[Victor Klemperer]] as one of the most important chroniclers of the crimes of the Nazis against the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Perlentaucher|25412|b|Kein Recht, nirgends. Tagebuch vom Untergang des Breslauer Judentums 1933–1941.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cohn left a record of everyday Jewish life in Germany after 1933, under conditions of gradually increasing economic, social and cultural oppression. Acknowledging the threat from the Nazi regime in his diaries, he wrote in August 1935: "From now on, I plan to record our Jewish fate more intently; perhaps it will be of interest to later generations". His condensed diaries were published in English in 2012 by [[Stanford University Press]] as ''No Justice in Germany: The Breslau Diaries, 1933-1941''. The review at [[H-Net]] noted:&lt;ref&gt;[https://networks.h-net.org/node/35008/reviews/49785/walch-cohn-and-conrads-no-justice-germany-breslau-diaries-1933-1941 "Walch on Cohn and Conrads, 'No Justice in Germany: The Breslau Diaries, 1933-1941'"], ''[[H-Net]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is rare that such perceptive and comprehensive accounts of this time period survive, and Conrads and Kronenberg [the editor and the translator] help fulfill Cohn's desire to inform future generations about his experiences. Similar to Victor Klemperer's diary, Cohn's detailed account describes what it was like to be a Jew living in the Third Reich. (...) The condensed diaries and helpful background information should certainly encourage a wider readership and general audience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Yitzhak Ben-Zvi''' ({{lang-he-n|יצחק בן־צבי}}{{lrm}} ''Yitshak Ben-Tsvi''; 24 November 1884{{spaced ndash}}23 April 1963) was a historian, [[Labor Zionism|Labor Zionist]] leader and the [[List of Presidents of Israel|second]] and longest-serving [[President of Israel]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Poltava]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (today in [[Ukraine]]), Ben-Zvi was the eldest son of Zvi Shimshelevich, who later took the name Shimshi. Shimshi was a leading [[Zionist]] activist and one of the organizers of the first [[Zionist Congress]] in 1897, who, in 1952, was honored by the first Israeli [[Knesset]] with the title "Father of the State of Israel".

Ben-Zvi was active in the Jewish self-defense units organized in Ukraine to defend Jews during the [[pogrom]]s of 1905, and joined the [[Poale Zion]] Zionist political party. He immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1907, settling in [[Jaffa]], and later the same year was a representative in the [[Zionist Congress]] at The Hague.  It was there that he first met [[Israel Shochat]]. "[[Bar-Giora]]", the clandestine precursor to [[Hashomer]], was created in his apartment in 1907.  In 1909, he organized the [[Gymnasia Rehavia]] high school in the [[Bukharim quarter]] of [[Jerusalem]] together with [[Rachel Yanait Ben-Zvi|Rachel Yanait]].

[[File:Ben-Zvi, Yaacov Zrubavel, Ben-Gurion, Brenner, Aharon Reuveni.jpg|thumb|Left to right; seated – Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Yosef Haim Brenner]]; standing – A. Reuveni, [[Ya'akov Zerubavel]] (1912)]]

In 1910 Yanait, Ben-Zvi and Ze'ev Ashur founded the '' Ahdut'', the first Hebrew socialist periodical.
Following his studies at [[Galatasaray High School]] in [[Istanbul]], from 1912 to 1914 Ben-Zvi studied law at [[Istanbul University]], together with the future [[Israel]]i prime minister [[David Ben-Gurion]]. They returned to Palestine in August 1914, but were expelled by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities in 1915. The two of them moved to New York City, where they engaged in Zionist activities and founded the HeHalutz (Pioneer) movement there. Together, they also wrote the [[Yiddish]] book ''The Land of Israel Past and Present'' to promote the Zionist cause among American Jewry.

Upon returning to Palestine in 1918, Ben-Zvi married Yanait. They had two sons: Amram and Eli. Eli died in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab–Israeli War]], defending his [[kibbutz]], [[Beit Keshet]].

==Political career==
[[File:Chaim Arlosoroff.jpg|thumb|Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (standing, second from right) at a meeting with Arab leaders at the [[King David Hotel]], Jerusalem, 1933. Also pictured are [[Chaim Weizmann]] (sitting, second from left), [[Haim Arlosoroff]] (sitting, center), and [[Moshe Shertok]] (Sharett) (standing, right).]]
[[File:BenZviKroldedication934.jpg|thumb|Yitzhak Ben Zvi at [[Tel Hai]], 1934]]
Ben-Zvi served in the [[Jewish Legion]] (1st Judean battalion 'KADIMAH') together with Ben-Gurion. In 1919, he helped found the [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] party, and became increasingly active in the [[Haganah]]. He was later elected to the Jerusalem City Council and president of the National Council, the shadow government of the Jewish community in Mandatory Palestine.

==Murder of Jacob Israël de Haan==
According to [[Avraham Tehomi]], Ben-Zvi ordered the 1924 murder of [[Jacob Israël de Haan]].&lt;ref name="Nakdimon"&gt;{{cite book | author=Shlomo Nakdimon |author2=Shaul Mayzlish  | title = דה האן : הרצח הפוליטי הראשון בארץ ישראל Deh Han : ha-retsah ha-politi ha-rishon be-Erets Yisraʼel / De Haan: The first political assassination in Israel | year =1985 | editor = | language =Hebrew | publisher=Modan Press | location = [[Tel Aviv]] | edition=1st | oclc=21528172 | authorlink = :he:שלמה נקדימון }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Haan had come to Palestine as an ardent [[Zionism|Zionist]], but he had become increasingly critical of the Zionist organizations, preferring a negotiated solution to the armed struggle between the Jews and Arabs.  In Tehomi's opinion: "I have done what the Haganah decided had to be done. And nothing was done without the order of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. I have no regrets because he [de Haan] wanted to destroy our whole idea of Zionism."&lt;ref name="Nakdimon" /&gt;

==Presidency==
[[File:Ben-Zvi meets Americans.jpg|thumb|Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (standing, second from right) and a three-star general (standing, right) meets with [[Marvin Garfinkel]], a member of the United Jewish Appeal Young Leadership Mission to Israel, in his wooden cabin on June 13, 1961]]
When Israel gained its independence, Ben-Zvi was among the signers of its Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948. He served in the First and Second [[Knesset]] for the [[Mapai]] party. He was [[Israeli presidential election, 1952|elected]] President of Israel on 8 December 1952, assumed office on 16 December 1952, and continued to serve in the position until his death.

Ben-Zvi believed that the president should set an example for the public and his home should reflect the austerity of the times. For over 26 years, he and his family lived in a wooden hut in the [[Rehavia]] neighborhood of Jerusalem. The State of Israel took interest in the adjacent house, built and owned by Nissim and Esther Valero, and purchased it, after Nissim's death, to provide additional space for the President's residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eilat Gordin Levitan |url=http://www.eilatgordinlevitan.com/kurenets/k_pages/shimshelevitz.html |title=Shimshelevitz Family |publisher=Eilatgordinlevitan.com |accessdate=2013-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two larger wooden structures in the yard were used for official receptions.

==Research==
In 1948, Ben-Zvi headed the Institute for the Study of Oriental Jewish Communities in the Middle East, later named the Ben-Zvi Institute (Yad Ben-Zvi) in his honor. The Ben-Zvi Institute occupies Nissim Valero's house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ybz.org.il/?ArticleID=235 Ben Zvi Institute], 12 Abarbanel St., Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; His main field of research was the Jewish communities and sects of Asia and Africa, including the [[Samaritans]] and [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]].

==Commemoration and awards==
In 1953, Ben-Zvi was awarded the [[Bialik Prize]] for Jewish thought.&lt;ref name=bialik&gt;{{cite web| title = List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933–2004 (in Hebrew), Tel Aviv Municipality website| url = http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143811/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf| archivedate = 17 December 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben-Zvi's photo appears on 100 [[Israeli new sheqel|NIS]] bills.  Many streets and boulevards in Israel are named for him.  In 2008, Ben-Zvi's wooden hut was moved to Kibbutz Beit Keshet, which his son helped to found, and the interior was restored with its original furnishings.  The [[Haim Aharon Valero|Valero]] house in [[Rehavia]] neighbourhood was designated an historic building protected by law under municipal plan 2007 for the preservation of historic sites.&lt;ref name="SephardiEtrepreneurs"&gt;{{cite book | author=Joseph B. Glass |author2=Ruth Kark  | title = Sephardi entrepreneurs in Jerusalem : the Valero family 1800–1948 | year =2007 | publisher=[[Gefen Publishing House]] | location = [[Jerusalem]] | oclc=191048781 | isbn= 978-965-229-396-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Yitzhak Ben-Zvi's father, Zvi Shimshi (Shimshelevitch), was a leading [[Zionist]] activist in the 19th century. A member of the B'ne Moshe and Hoveve Zion movements in Ukraine, he was one of the organizers with Dr. [[Theodore Herzl]] of the first [[Zionist Congress]] in Basel, Switzerland in the fall of 1897. At this Congress, the [[World Zionist Organization]] was founded, and the intention to re-establish a Jewish state was announced. Shimshi was the only organizer of the first Zionist Congress to live to see the birth of the modern State of Israel in 1948. On 10 December 1952, Zvi Shimshi was honored by the first Israeli [[Knesset]] (parliament) with the title, "Father of the State of Israel".

Yitzhak Ben-Zvi's brother was the well known Jewish author, [[Aharon Reuveni]], and his brother-in-law was the Israeli archaeologist, Prof. [[Benjamin Mazar]].&lt;ref name="Dan Mazar 1994"&gt;Dan Mazar (1994) ''Jerusalem Christian Review''&lt;/ref&gt;
