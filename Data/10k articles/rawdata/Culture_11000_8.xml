{{Anthropology}}

The '''anthropology of development''' is a term applied to a body of [[Anthropology|anthropological]] work which views development from a ''critical'' perspective. The kind of issues addressed, and implications for the approach typically adopted can be gleaned from a list questions posed by Gow (1996). These questions involve anthropologists asking why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? Why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? Why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? Why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? In short why does so much planned development fail? 

This ''anthropology of development'' has been distinguished from ''[[development anthropology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gow, David D. (1996) Review: The Anthropology of Development: Discourse, Agency, and Culture Reviewed work: An Anthropological Critique of Development: The Growth of Ignorance by Mark Hobart and Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World by Arturo Escobar, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' Vol. 69, No. 3, Healing and the Body Politic: Dilemmas of Doctoring in Ethnographic Fieldwork, Jul., pp. 165-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). ''The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism''. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Development anthropology''' refers to the [[applied anthropology|application of anthropological]] perspectives to the [[multidisciplinary]] branch of [[development studies]]. It takes [[international development]] and international [[aid]] as primary objects. In this branch of [[anthropology]], the term development refers to the social action made by different agents ([[institutions]], [[business]], [[Organization|enterprise]], [[State (polity)|states]], independent [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s) who are trying to modify the economic, technical, political or/and social life of a given place in the world, especially in impoverished, formerly colonized regions.

Development anthropologists share a commitment to simultaneously critique and contribute to projects and institutions that create and administer Western projects that seek to improve the economic well-being of the most marginalized, and to eliminate poverty.  While some theorists distinguish between the 'anthropology of development' (in which development is the object of study) and development anthropology (as an applied practice), this distinction is increasingly thought of as obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marc, and Angelique Haugerud. (2005). ''The anthropology of development and globalization: from classical political economy to contemporary neoliberalism''. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Pub, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early approaches to development==

Some describe the anthropological critique of development as one that pits [[modernization]] and an eradication of the indigenous [[culture]], but this is too reductive and not the case with the majority of scholarly work.  In fact, most anthropologists who work in impoverished areas desire the same economic relief for the people they study as policymakers, however they are wary about the assumptions and models on which development interventions are based.  Anthropologists and others who critique development projects instead view Western development itself as a product of Western culture that must be refined in order to better help those it claims to aid.  The problem therefore is not that of markets driving out culture, but of the fundamental blind-spots of Western developmental culture itself.  Criticism often focuses therefore on the cultural bias and blind-spots of Western development institutions, or modernization models that:  systematically represent non-Western societies as more deficient than the West; erroneously assume that Western modes of production and historical processes are repeatable in all contexts; or that do not take into account hundreds of years of colonial exploitation by the West that has tended to destroy the resources of former colonial society. Most critically, anthropologists argue that sustainable development requires at the very least more inclusion of the people who the project aims to target to be involved in the creation, management and decision making process in the project creation in order to improve development.

===Pre-WWII: Rhodes-Livingstone Institute===
The British government established the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] in 1937 to conduct social science research in British Central Africa. It was part of the colonial establishment, although its head, anthropologist [[Max Gluckman]], was a critic of colonial rule. Gluckman refused to describe colonialism as a simple case of "culture contact" since it was not a case of cultures mutually influencing each other, but of the forced incorporation of Africans into a foreign social, political and economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=Expectations of modernity: myths and meanings of urban life on the Zambian Copperbelt|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologists of the Institute were core members of what came to be known as the "[[Manchester school (anthropology)|Manchester school]]" of anthropology noted for looking at issues of social justice such as apartheid and class conflict.

===Culture of poverty===
{{main|Culture of poverty}}
The term "subculture of poverty" (later shortened to "culture of poverty") made its first prominent appearance in the ethnography ''Five Families: Mexican Case Studies in the Culture of Poverty'' (1959) by anthropologist [[Oscar Lewis]]. Lewis struggled to render "the poor" as legitimate subjects whose lives were transformed by [[poverty]].  He argued that although the burdens of poverty were systemic and therefore imposed upon these members of society, they led to the formation of an autonomous subculture as children were socialized into behaviors and attitudes that perpetuated their inability to escape the underclass. In sociology and anthropology, the concept created a backlash, pushing scholars to abandon cultural justifications and negative descriptions of poverty, fearing such analysis may be read as "[[blaming-the-victim]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bourgois, Phillipe| year=2001 | title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences | chapter=Culture of Poverty| editor= | others= | pages= | publisher=Waveland Press | id= | url= | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernization Theory and its critics ===
The most influential modernization theorist in development was [[Walt Rostow]], whose ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'' (1960) concentrates on the [[economic system|economic]] side of the modernization, and especially the factors needed for a country to reach [[Rostovian take-off model|"take-off"]] to self-sustaining growth. He argued that today's underdeveloped areas are in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that therefore the task in helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Rostow's unilineal evolutionist model hypothesized all societies would progress through the same stages to a modernity defined by the West. The model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length:&lt;ref name=mth&gt;[http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), Chapter 2, "The Five Stages of Growth-A Summary," pp. 4-16&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223023302/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |date=February 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Traditional society
# Preconditions for take-off
# Take-off
# Drive to maturity
# Age of High mass consumption

As should be clear from the subtitle of his book, Rostow sought to provide a capitalist rebuttal to the unilinear Marxist growth models being pursued in the newly independent communist regimes in the second and third world; an effort that would lead to the "[[Green Revolution|Green revolution]]" to combat the "[[Communist revolution|Red revolution]]".

====George Dalton and the substantivists====
George Dalton applied the substantivist economic ideas of [[Karl Polanyi]] to economic anthropology, and to development issues. The substantivist approach demonstrated the ways in which economic activities in non-market societies were [[Embeddedness|embedded]] in other, non-economic social institutions such as kinship, religion and political relations. He therefore critiqued the formalist economic modelling of Rostow. He was the author of "Growth without development: An economic survey of Liberia" (1966, with [[Robert W. Clower]]) and "Economic Anthropology and Development: Essays on Tribal and Peasant Economies" (1971).

====Dependency theory====
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}

Dependency theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

===='Women in development' (WID)====
{{main|Women in development|Gender and development}}
Women in development (WID) is an approach to development projects that emerged in the 1970s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. Later, the [[Gender and development]] (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation.{{sfn|Van Marle|2006|pp=125}} The WID school grew out of the pioneering work of [[Esther Boserup]]. Boserup's most notable book is ''The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure''.&lt;ref&gt;(Chicago, Aldine, 1965, {{ISBN|0-415-31298-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; This book presents a "dynamic analysis embracing all types of primitive agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boserup|first=Esther|title=The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarian Change under Population Pressure|year=1965|publisher=Aldine|location=Chicago|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Boserup, the WID theorists pointed out that the division of labour in agriculture is frequently gendered, and that in societies practicing [[shifting cultivation]], it is women who conduct most of the agricultural work. Development projects, however, were skewed towards men on the assumption they were "heads of households."

==Development discourse and the creation of the 'underdeveloped' world==

A major critique of development from anthropologists came from [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar's]] seminal book ''Encountering Development'', which argued that Western development largely exploited non-Western peoples. Arturo Escobar views [[international development]] as a means for the [[Western world|Occident]] to keep control over the resources of its former colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], 1995, ''Encountering Development'' Princeton: Princeton University Press, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; Escobar shows that between 1945 and 1960, while the former colonies were going through [[decolonization]], development plans helped to maintain the third world's dependency on the old [[metropole]].  Development projects themselves flourished in the wake of WWII, and during the cold war,  when they were developed to 

1. stop the spread of Communism with the spread of capitalist markets; and 

2. create more prosperity for the West and its products by creating a global consumer demand for finished Western products abroad.   

Some scholars blame the different agents for having only considered a small aspect of the local people's lives without analyzing broader consequences, while others like [[dependency theory]] or Escobar argue that development projects are doomed to failure for the fundamental ways they privilege Western industry and corporations.   Escobar's argument echos the earlier work of [[dependency theory]] and follows a larger critique more recently posed by Foucault an other [[poststructuralists]].

==Governmentality: Development as 'anti-politics machine'==
{{main|The Anti-Politics Machine}}
[[File:Location Lesotho AU Africa.svg|thumbnail|Location of Lesotho in South Africa]]
At a critical juncture in the early nineteenth century the state began to connect itself to a series of groups “that in different ways had long tried to shape and administer the lives of individuals in pursuit of various goals” rather than simply extend the absolutist state’s repressive machinery of social control.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Nikolas, Pat O'Malley, &amp; Mariana Valverde. (2006). ''Governmentality''. Annual Review of Law and Social Science Vol. 2: 83-104.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]]’s work on the prison, the clinic, and the asylum – on the development of “[[bio-power]]” – analyzed the plurality of governing agencies and authorities who developed programs, strategies, and technologies that were deployed to optimize the health, welfare and life of populations. He referred to this process with the neologism, “[[governmentality]]” (governmental rationality). One of the last of these new applied sciences was the "development apparatus", the post-world war extension of colonial rule after the independence of third world states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Escobar|first=Arturo|title=Encountering Development: the making and unmaking of the third world|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]] utilized the governmentality framework in "The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho" (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the first in many similar explorations. Ferguson sought to explore how "development discourse" works. That is, how do the language and practices used by development specialists influence the ways in which development is delivered, and what [[unintended consequences]] does it foster. He found that development projects which failed in their own terms could be redefined as "successes" on which new projects were to be modelled. The net effect of development, he found, was to "de-politicize" questions of resource allocation, and to strengthen bureaucratic power. In his analysis of a development project in Lesotho (South Africa) between 1978 and 1982, he examined the following discursive maneuvers. 

Ferguson points out that a critical part of the development process is the way in which the object of development is defined. In defining this object, it is severed from its historical and geographic context, and isolated as a "Less-Developed Country."  In the case of Lesotho, its history as a grain exporting region was ignored, as was its current role as a labour reserve for the South African mines. Not wanting to deal with the apartheid South African regime, development agencies isolated the "independent" Lesotho from the regional economy in which it was entrapped in their project rationales and reports. Artificially taken out of this larger capitalist context, Lesotho's economy was described as "isolated," "non-market" and "traditional" and thus a proper target for aid intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=James|title=The Anti-Politics Machine: "Development," Depoliticization and Bureaucratic Power in Lesotho|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=25–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferguson underscores that these discourses are produced within institutional settings where they must provide a charter for governmental intervention. Any analysis which suggests the roots of poverty lie in areas outside the scope of government are quickly dismissed and discarded since they cannot provide a rationale for state action. And since the capitalist economy is one such area which has been ideologically set outside the scope of governmental action, the discursive creation of a deformed ‘native economy’ creates the required opening for that intervention.

Ferguson writes that it is not enough to note development's failures; even the project managers initially recognized it as a failure. If that was all Ferguson had done, his book would not have had the influence it did. Asking if development is a failure is asking the wrong question; it ignores the “instrument effects” of what the projects DO do. In other words, we should ask what NON-economic functions does development serve? His answer:
# It’s an “anti-politics machine”; it makes blatantly political decisions about the allocation of resources appear to be “technical solutions to technical problems”. Important questions such as the reallocation of land to a limited number (leaving them relatively wealthy, and others in poverty) are rephrased as a "necessity for the sustainable commercial management of livestock." A large proportion of men are deprived of their retirement savings.
# “Integrated development” served to strengthen the presence of a repressive government in an isolated and resistant area. Development projects are dependent upon local governments for implementation, and rarely challenge the nature of that government. The resources they supply frequently serve state needs more than local needs.
# It perpetuates the migrant labour system. The project neglected to look at Lesotho in the regional economy with South Africa. Lesotho was a labour reserve for Apartheid-era South African mines. The men of Lesotho were not farmers, but unemployed workers and retirees. Real commercial farming was never a possibility without large subsidies. The project thus served to preserve a pool of cheap labour for South Africa in a time when international sanctions against Apartheid were hitting its economy.

=== The Limits of Governmentality ===

===Ecogovernmentality===

{{main|Ecogovernmentality}}

Ecogovernmentality, (or Eco-governmentality), is the application of Foucault’s concepts of [[biopower]] and [[governmentality]] to the analysis of the regulation of [[Social relation|social interactions]] with the natural world. The concept of Ecogovernmentality expands on Foucault’s genealogical examination of the state to include ecological rationalities and technologies of government. Following [[Michel Foucault]], writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how [[government agencies]], in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct “The Environment.” This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government’s larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents.  This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and [[internalization]] of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Malette, Sebastien. (2009) "Foucault for the next century: eco−governmentality" in Binkley, S. and Capetillo J. eds. A Foucault for the 21st Century: Governmentality, Biopolitics and Discipline in the New Millennium. Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work done by Arun Agrawal on local forest governance in India, is an example of this method of analysis.  He illustrates how the production of specific types of expert knowledge (the economic productivity of forests) coupled with specific technologies of government (local Forest Stewardship Councils) can bring individual interest in line with those of the state.  This, not through the imposition of specific outcomes, but by creating frameworks that rationalizes [[behavior]] in particular ways and involve individuals in the process of problem definition and [[Interventionism (politics)|intervention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agrawal|first=Arjun|title=Environmentality: Technologies of Government and the Making of Subjects|year=2005|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural development: the "Green Revolution"==

The term "Green Revolution" was first used in 1968 by former [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) director [[William Gaud]], who noted the spread of the new technologies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"These and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a violent [[October Revolution|Red Revolution]] like that of the Soviets, nor is it a [[White Revolution]] like that of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. I call it the Green Revolution."&lt;ref name="agbio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/borlaug-green.html |title=The Green Revolution: Accomplishments and Apprehensions |last1= Gaud |first1=William S. |date=8 March 1968 |publisher=AgBioWorld |accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1951">'''Aricini''', the ancient inhabitants of [[Ariccia|Aricia]], the form of the name ranking them with the [[Sidicini]], [[Marrucini]], etc., as one of the communities belonging probably to the earlier or [[Volsci]]an stratum of population on the west side of [[Italy]], who were absorbed by the [[Sabine]] or Latin immigrants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Aricini|volume=2|page=490|first=Robert Seymour|last=Conway|authorlink=Robert Seymour Conway}} Footnote: On the anthropological aspect of the cult, see also [[Arthur Bernard Cook |A. B. Cook]], ''Class. Rev.'' vi., 1902, p.&amp;nbsp;365, where the whole evidence is very fully collected; and Frazer's ''Studies in the Early History of Kingship'', where he accepts Cook's criticism of his own earlier theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Special interest attaches to this trace of their earlier origin, because of the famous cult of [[Diana Nemorensis]], whose temple in the forest close by Aricia, beside the ''[[Lake Nemi|lacus Nemorensis]]'', was served by "the priest who slew the slayer, and shall himself be slain"; that is to say, the priest, who was called ''rex Nemorensis'', held office only so long as he could defend himself from any stronger rival. This cult, which is unique in Italy, is picturesquely described in the opening chapter of [[J. G. Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', where full references will be found. Of these references the most important are, perhaps, [[Strabo]] v.3.12; [[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', 263-272; and [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' 35, whose wording indicates that the old-world custom was dying out in the 1st century AD. It is a reasonable conjecture that this extraordinary relic of barbarism was characteristic of the earlier stratum of the population who presumably called themselves Arici.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

{{Expert needed|Sociology|ex2=Anthropology|talk=Limited cultural and temporal context|reason=the article discusses bedtime stories only in the context of contemporary Western culture|date=January 2018}}
A '''bedtime story''' is a traditional form of [[storytelling]], where a  [[Narrative|story]] is told to a [[child]] at [[bedtime]] to prepare the child for [[sleep]]. The bedtime story has long been considered "a definite institution in many families".&lt;ref name=institution&gt;Dickson, Marguerite Stockman (1919). ''Vocational Guidance for Girls''. p. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;Jones, Patti (2011). [http://www.parents.com/fun/entertainment/books/the-brainy-benefits-of-bedtime-stories/ "The Brainy Benefits of Bedtime Stories"]. ''Parents Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child.&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; Due to "the strength of the imitative instinct" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

Bedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as [[sympathy]], [[unselfishness]], and [[self-control]], as most children are said to be "naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt; Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as [[death]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref name=parents/&gt; As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child "will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others".&lt;ref name=institution/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4959">'''Bremermann's limit''', named after  [[Hans-Joachim Bremermann]], is the maximum [[computation]]al speed of a self-contained system in the material universe.  It is derived from [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[E = mc2|mass-energy equivalency]] and the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], and is ''[[speed of light|c]]''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''[[Planck's constant|h]]'' ≈ 1.36&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; [[bits per second]] per kilogram.&lt;ref&gt;Bremermann, H.J. (1962) [http://holtz.org/Library/Natural%20Science/Physics/Optimization%20Through%20Evolution%20and%20Recombination%20-%20Bremermann%201962.htm ''Optimization through evolution and recombination''] In: Self-Organizing systems 1962, edited M.C. Yovits et al., Spartan Books, Washington, D.C. pp. 93–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bremermann, H.J. (1965) [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bsmsp/1200513783 Quantum noise and information]. 5th Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability; Univ. of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; This value is important when designing [[cryptography|cryptographic]] algorithms, as it can be used to determine the minimum size of [[encryption key]]s or hash values required to create an algorithm that could never be cracked by a [[brute-force search]].

For example, a computer with the mass of the entire [[Earth]] operating at the Bremermann's limit could perform approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt; mathematical computations per second. If one assumes that a cryptographic key can be tested with only one operation, then a typical 128-bit key could be cracked in under 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds. However, a 256-bit key (which is already in use in some systems) would take about two minutes to crack. Using a 512-bit key would increase the cracking time to approaching 10&lt;sup&gt;72&lt;/sup&gt; years, without increasing the time for encryption by more than a constant factor (depending on the encryption algorithms used).

The limit has been further analysed in later literature as the maximum rate at which a system with energy spread &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&lt;/math&gt; can evolve into an orthogonal and hence distinguishable state to another, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = \pi \hbar / 2 \Delta E&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Aharonov1961"&gt;{{Cite journal

'''''Broadsides and Boarding Parties''''' is a [[board game]] published by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1984 as part of their [[Gamemaster (board game series)|Gamemaster]] series. It was the 3rd in the series of games that are all designed by [[Larry Harris (game designer)|Larry Harris]]. It is the only game of that series to feature a two player game (all of the games in the Gamemaster series were for two or more players), ''Broadsides and Boarding Parties'' is a duel between a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[galleon]] and a [[pirate]] ship.  Players take turns moving their ship and firing at the other ship to sink her.  If the ships collide then players may take [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] parties onto the other ship to try to win.

The original version of this game, published by The Citadel in 1982, used a paper map and cardboard pieces and did not have the plastic ships, cannons, and other playing pieces. When [[Hasbro]] bought the publishing rights, they added these components to bring the physical components in line with the other games in the series. However, many players found that the large ship models were difficult to disassemble, making the storage of this game awkward.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

A more serious problem was that the gameplay was not considered up to the level of the other games in the series.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} There was relatively little strategy and more luck involved than the other games. As part of a series, ''Broadsides and Boarding Parties'' was unfavorably compared to the other games and was less popular.

''Broadsides and Boarding Parties'' was discontinued several years after its introduction.

The '''Canadian Centre for Architecture''' ('''CCA'''; {{lang-fr|Centre canadien d'architecture}}) is a museum of architecture and research centre in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. It is located at 1920 Baile Street, between Fort Street and Saint-Marc Street in what was once part of the [[Golden Square Mile]]. Today it is considered to be located in the [[Shaughnessy Village]] neighbourhood of the borough of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]].&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Centre for Architecture/Centre Canadien d'Architecture|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/canadian-centre-for-architecturecentre-canadien-darchitecture/|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia / The Enclopaedia in Canada|accessdate=22 July 2011|last=Wagg|first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phyllis Lambert]] is the founding director emeritus, [[Bruce Kuwabara]] is chair of the board of trustees, [[Mirko Zardini]] is the director, and [[Giovanna Borasi]] is the chief curator. It was designed and built by [[Peter Rose (architect)|Peter Rose]].

The CCA contains a large library and archives, and is host to various exhibits throughout the year. It is also home to a study centre open to the general public. The CCA also provides educational programs and cultural activities.

The CCA also has an architectural garden located on the southern side of [[René-Lévesque Boulevard]]. The sculpture garden was realized by architect [[Melvin Charney]].

== History ==
The CCA was founded in 1979 by Montreal architect Phyllis Lambert.&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia" /&gt; The purpose of the centre was to promote public awareness of the role architecture plays in society, as well as to encourage scholarly architectural research and to foster innovative design practices.&lt;ref name=Institutional&gt;{{cite web|title=Institutional Overview|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/294-institutional-overview|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|accessdate=16 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201201054/http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/294-institutional-overview|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCA was designed and constructed between 1985 and 1989 by Montreal architect [[Peter Rose (architect)|Peter Rose]].&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclopedia" /&gt; The design of the museum incorporates the Shaughnessy House mansion, built for [[Thomas Shaughnessy]], a [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]]-style mansion that Lambert purchased in 1974 to prevent its demolition.&lt;ref name="klein"&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein|first=Julia M.|title=Joan of Architecture Speaks |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704407804575425913319466780|accessdate=21 August 2010|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCA received the ''Honor Awards for Architecture|Honor Award for Architecture'' from the [[American Institute of Architects]] and the [[Governor General's Medals in Architecture]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="Wagg2"&gt;{{cite book|last=WAGG|first=SUSAN|title=Rose, Peter Douglas|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
The current building, which opened in 1989, surrounds Shaughnessy House and was designed by [[Peter Rose (architect)|Peter Rose]], in collaboration with Phyllis Lambert and Erol Argun.

Shaughnessy House, located at 1923 Dorchester St. W (today [[René-Lévesque Boulevard]]) was at built in 1874 according to plans by [[William Tutin Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few nineteenth century residences that is accessible to the public.

The CCA building, with a surface area of roughly {{convert|12000|m2}}, is home to exhibit halls, Paul Desmarais Theatre, a bookstore, the library and a study centre in the Alcan Wing. It also contains restoration laboratories and conservation offices.&lt;ref name="CCA Building"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCA Building|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/336-cca-building|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|accessdate=16 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201201026/http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/collection/336-cca-building|archivedate=1 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of conservation and restoration of the Shaughnessy House, with a floor area of over {{convert|1900|m2}}, were carried out under the direction of Denis Saint-Louis. Also inside is the Devencore Conservatory and reception rooms.&lt;ref name="CCA Building" /&gt;

Due to its size, location and use of traditional and modern materials, combining structural aluminum with grey Montreal limestone, the CCA building's architecture blends past and present. Its landscapes, including the CCA sculpture Garden facing the building on the south side of René Lévesque Boulevard, were designed according to the ecology of each location.&lt;ref name="CCA Building" /&gt; Most of the rooms of the Shaughnessy House have been restored to their original 1874 state.

The mansion was a listed as a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1973 and a Historical Monument of Quebec on February 6, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Horne / Shaughnessy House|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0672&amp;oqeName=Van+Horne+%2F+Shaughnessy+House&amp;oqfName=Maison+Van-Horne+%2F+Shaughnessy|work=Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=23 August 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection and exhibits ==
The CCA has largest collections of books and artifacts touching on the built environment and certain aspects of [[industrial design]].  Within the general collections it has special collections such as those pertaining to architectural games for children, universal exhibitions and their architecture, and significant architects including [[Ernest Cormier]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Arthur Erickson]], [[John Hejduk]], [[Cedric Price]], [[Aldo Rossi]], [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], and the artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]].

The centre mounts regular shows made up of research on thematic subjects, different aspects of its collections, and hosts touring exhibits from other museums. The centre offers tours adapted to specific groups and educational programs for children. It also has a bookstore, a concert hall, and gardens. The [[sculpture garden]] which lies across René Lévesque Boulevard offers a full scale ghost-like lower shell of the bottom part of the Shaughnessy mansion, and assorted modernistic sculptures or constructs which are developed around the theme of architecture.

The Centre's research library is open to the public by appointment. It celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/arts-spectacles/PlusArts/2009/01/30/001-lambert-cca.asp|title=Où futur et passé s'embrassent|date=30 January 2009|work=Radio-Canada|language=French|accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lectures series ==
Over the years, CCA has organized a variety of lectures and presentations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cca.qc.ca/en/past List of CCA's past lectures and events]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture garden ==
The mansion faces a sculpture garden by [[Melvin Charney]] on the south side of [[René Lévesque Boulevard]]. Located in between René-Lévesque Boulevard and the [[Ville-Marie Expressway]], it is a park in an area of heavy traffic and is at the edge of a cliff. The park contains a set of sculptures that depict aspects of architecture, and include a reproduction of the base of the facade and size of Shaughnessy House. The vegetation is mixed with sections of open walls. Architectural fixtures and furniture items are placed on pedestals.

== Affiliations ==
The Museum is affiliated with: [[Canadian Museums Association|CMA]], [[Canadian Heritage Information Network|CHIN]], and [[Virtual Museum of Canada]].

'''Cartonnage''' is a type of material used in [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[funerary mask]]s from the [[First Intermediate Period]] to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era. It was made of layers of [[linen]] or [[papyrus]] covered with [[plaster]]. Some of the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] are also painted on panels made of cartonnage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-clues-illuminate-mysteries-ancient-egyptian-portraits New clues illuminate mysteries of ancient Egyptian portraits - &lt;small&gt;Same artist painted several lifelike paintings buried with mummies&lt;/small&gt;] by BRUCE BOWER, published by "Society for Science &amp; the Public" on Feb. 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In a technique similar to [[papier-mâché]], scraps of linen or papyrus were stuck together with plaster or resin and used to make mummy cases and masks.&lt;ref name=Hayman&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayman|first=written by James Putnam; photographed by Peter|title=Mummy|year=2004|publisher=DK Pub.|location=New York, NY|isbn=0756607078|pages=70|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be molded to the shape of the body, forming a type of shell. After the material dried it could be painted or gilded. The shell could be decorated with geometric shapes, [[ancient Egyptian deities|deities]], and inscriptions. During the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] era, the single shell method was altered to include four to six pieces of cartonnage. There would generally be a mask, pectoral, apron, and foot casing. In certain instances there were two additional pieces used to cover the ribcage and stomach.&lt;ref name=Papyri&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartonnage|url=http://papyri.tripod.com/texts/cartonnage.html|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
[[File:Cartonnage fragment REM.JPG|thumb|left|Fragment of cartonnage from a [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] coffin ([[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]])]]
The materials used to produce cartonnage changed over time. In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] it was common to use plastered linen, during the [[Third Intermediate Period]], linen and stucco, during the Ptolemaic period, old papyrus scrolls and during the Roman period, thicker fibrous materials.&lt;ref name="Burial customs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Burial customs:cartonnages|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/burialcustoms/cartonnage.html|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Reusing papyrus that was considered waste was a common practice during the Ptolemaic period. A lot of discarded documents from the government and archives were used for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Papyri"/&gt;

==Archeological significance==
The preparation of cartonnage preserved the sections of papyrus; therefore, it is a prominent source of well-preserved manuscript sections.&lt;ref name="Burial customs"/&gt; In 1993, the city of Helsinki received fourteen fragments of cartonnages from the Egyptian Museum in Berlin. Conservators were tasked with preserving the cartonnages and publishing all Greek papyrus texts derived from them.&lt;ref name=Cartonnage&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartonnage Papyri|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/hum/kla/papupetra/papyrus/cartonnage.html|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55869">{{Mainlist|List of heraldic charges}}

{{COA elements}}

In [[heraldry]], a '''charge''' is any emblem or device occupying the [[field (heraldry)|field]] of an ''[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]'' (shield). This may be a geometric design (sometimes called an ''[[Ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]]'') or a symbolic representation of a person, animal, plant, object or other device. In French [[blazon]], the ordinaries are called ''pièces'' while other charges are called ''meubles'' (''i.e.'' "[the] mobile [ones]").

The term ''charge'' can also be used as a verb; for example, if an escutcheon depicts three [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]]s, then it is said to be ''charged with three lions;'' similarly, a crest or even a charge itself may be "charged", such as a pair of eagle wings ''charged with trefoils'' (e.g. [[Coat of arms of Brandenburg]]). It is important to distinguish between the ordinaries and [[divisions of the field]], as these typically follow similar patterns, such as a shield ''divided'' "per chevron", as distinct from being ''charged with'' a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]].

While thousands of objects found in nature, mythology or technology have appeared in armory, there are several charges (such as the cross, the eagle and the lion) which have contributed to the distinctive flavour of heraldic design. Only these and a few other notable charges (crowns, stars, keys, etc.) are discussed in this article, but a more exhaustive list will be found at [[List of heraldic charges]].

In addition to being shown in the regular way charges may be ''umbrated'' (this is to be distinguished from them being blazoned as ''detailed''&lt;ref&gt;As in the coat of arms of the 432d Reconnaissance Group of the United States Air Force.  {{cite book |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II |page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; highly unusual description of them as being ''shaded''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and are rather irregularly sometimes stated to be ''in silhouette'' or are, more ambiguously, confusingly and unhelpfully, blazoned as ''futuristic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''stylized'' or ''simplified''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=10275&amp;grp=2&amp;menu=Uniformed Services&amp;from=recent&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also several units in the [[United States Air Force]] with charges blazoned as "mythical",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II |page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this conception is meaningless and irrelevant to the conception of heraldry; neither does it affect the appearance of these charges.

==Ordinaries and sub-ordinaries==
{{main article|Ordinary (heraldry)}}

Some heraldic writers&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Woodcock, himself apparently one such author, lists Leigh, Holme, Guillim and Edmondson among these, while other prominent authors such as Fox-Davies shun the distinction as an arbitrary and unuseful practice.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish, albeit arbitrarily, between ''honourable ordinaries'' and ''sub-ordinaries''. While some authors hold that only nine charges are "honourable" ordinaries, exactly which ones fit into this category is a subject of constant disagreement. The remainder are often termed ''sub-ordinaries'', and narrower or smaller versions of the ordinaries are called ''diminutives''. While the term ''ordinaries'' is generally recognised, so much dispute may be found among sources regarding which are "honourable" and which are relegated to the category of "sub-ordinaries" that indeed one of the leading authors in the field, [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] (1871–1928), wrote at length on what he calls the "utter absurdity of the necessity for any [such] classification at all," stating that the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are, in his mind, "no more than first charges."&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies107&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently ceding the point for the moment, Fox-Davies lists the generally agreed-upon "honourable ordinaries" as the bend, fess, pale, pile, chevron, cross, saltire and chief.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies107 /&gt; Woodcock sheds some light on the matter, stating that earlier writers such as Leigh, Holme and Guillim proposed that "honourable ordinaries" should occupy one-third of the field, while later writers such as Edmondson favoured one-fifth, "on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable."&lt;ref name=Woodcock58&gt;Woodcock (1988), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodcock goes so far as to enumerate the ordinaries thus: "The first Honourable Ordinary is the cross," the second is the chief, the third is the pale, the fourth is the bend, the fifth is the fess, the sixth is the inescutcheon, the seventh is the chevron, the eighth is the saltire, and the ninth is the bar, while stating that "some writers" prefer the bordure as the ninth ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock (1988), pp. 58-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Volborth, having decidedly less to say on the matter, agrees that the classifications are arbitrary and the subject of disagreement, and lists the "definite" ordinaries as the chief, pale, bend, fess, chevron, cross and saltire.&lt;ref&gt;Volborth (1981), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Boutell lists the chief, pale, bend, bend sinister, fess, bar, cross, saltire and chevron as the "honourable ordinaries".&lt;ref&gt;Boutell (1890), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the chief, bend, pale, fess, chevron, cross and saltire appear to be the undisputed ordinaries, while authors disagree over the status of the pile, bar, inescutcheon, bordure and others.

==="Honourable ordinaries"===
Several different figures are recognised as ''honourable ordinaries'', each normally occupying about one-fifth to one-third of the field.&lt;ref name=Woodcock58 /&gt; As discussed above, much disagreement exists among authors regarding which ordinary charges are "honourable", so only those generally agreed to be "honourable ordinaries" will be discussed here, while the remainder of ordinary charges will be discussed in the following section.

* The ''[[chief (heraldry)|chief]]'' is the upper portion of the field.
* The ''[[bend (heraldry)|bend]]'' runs from the upper left to the lower right, as '''\''', as seen by the viewer. The ''bend sinister'' runs from the upper right to the lower left, as '''/'''.
* The ''[[pale (heraldry)|pale]]'', a vertical stripe in the centre of the field.
* The ''[[fess]]'' is a broad horizontal stripe across the centre of the field.
* The ''[[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]'' is a construction shaped like an inverted letter '''V'''.
* The ''[[cross]]'' is a geometric construction of two perpendicular lines or bands. It has hundreds of variants, most of which are common charges rather than ordinaries; some of these will be discussed below.
* The ''[[saltire]]'' is a diagonal cross, often called ''Saint Andrew's cross''.

Most of the ordinaries have corresponding ''diminutives'', narrower versions, most often mentioned when two or more appear in parallel: ''bendlets, pallets, bars'' (multiples of the ''fess''), ''chevronels''.

&lt;/center&gt;

===Other ordinaries===
In addition to those mentioned in the above section, other ordinaries exist. Some of these are variously called "honourable ordinaries" by different authors, while others of these are often called ''sub-ordinaries''.

* The ''[[Pall (heraldry)|pall]]'' or ''pairle'' is shaped like the letter '''Y'''.
* The ''[[Pile (heraldry)|pile]]'' is a wedge issuing from the top of the field and tapering to a point near the bottom. Its length and width vary widely. Piles may occur in any orientation, e.g. ''pile reversed'', ''pile bendwise'' and so on.
* The ''[[Quarter (heraldry)|quarter]]'' is a rectangle occupying the top left quarter of the field, as seen by the viewer.
* The ''[[Canton (heraldry)|canton]]'' is a square occupying the left third of the chief (sometimes reckoned to be a diminutive of the quarter).
* The ''[[bordure]]'' is a border touching the edge of the field.
* The ''[[orle (heraldry)|orle]]'' may be considered an inner bordure: a reasonably wide band away from the edge of the shield, it is always shown following the shape of the shield, without touching the edges.
**The ''[[orle (heraldry)#Tressure|tressure]]'' is a narrower version of the orle, rarely seen except in the ''double tressure flory and counter-flory'', an element of the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]] and of many other Scots coats.
* The ''fret'' originally consisted of three bendlets interlaced with three bendlets sinister; other depictions form the outer bendlets into a mascle through which the two remaining bendlets are woven. This has also been called a Harington knot, as in the arms of Harington.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1892), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Flaunch]]es'', ''flanches'' or ''flasks'' are regions on the sides of the field, bounded by a pair of circular arcs whose centers are beyond the sides of the shield.
* A ''[[Label (heraldry)|label]]'' is a horizontal strap, with a number of pendants (usually called ''points'') suspended from it; the default is three, but any number may be specified. The label is nearly always a mark of [[cadency]] in British and French heraldry,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Marks of cadency differ from country to country, but are largely the same in Britain and France, and similar in other European countries outside of the German-speaking (and Nordic) countries, where brisures on the shield were less common and different crests were often adopted to indicate the difference.  Volborth (1981), p.&amp;nbsp;76.  It should also be noted that the English system of cadency, by which the use of the label to indicate the first son is best known, was not developed until the [[Tudor dynasty]]. Woodward (1892), p.&amp;nbsp;444.&lt;/ref&gt; but is occasionally found as a regular charge in early armory and even in the 20th century. It is sometimes called a ''file'', as in the canting arms of Belfile, a label with a bell hanging from each point. There are some examples in which the strap is omitted, the points issuing from the top of the shield.&lt;ref&gt;See the arms of William de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, pictured in fig. 120 in Fox-Davies (1909), for an example of this.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''gyron'' is a [[right triangle]] occupying the lower half of the first quarter: its edges follow per bend and per fess from the dexter side to the centre of the field. A ''gyron sinister'', much rarer, is a similar figure in the sinister chief. Gyrons are sometimes blazoned to be shown in other positions - as in 'the sun in his splendour ... along with in dexter base a sixth gyron voided' &lt;!-- what does 'sixth gyron' mean and what's the source? --&gt;

==Common charges==
So-called ''mobile charges'' are not tied to the size and shape of the shield, and so may be placed in any part of the field, although whenever a charge appears alone, it is placed with sufficient position and size to occupy the entire field. Common mobile charges include human figures, human parts, animals, animal parts, mythical creatures (or "monsters"), plants and floral designs, inanimate objects, and other devices. The heraldic animals need not exactly resemble the actual creatures.

A number of geometric charges are sometimes listed among the subordinaries (see above), but as their form is not related to the shape of the shield &amp;ndash; indeed they may appear independent of the shield (''i.e.'' in [[crest (heraldry)|crests]] and [[badge (heraldry)|badges]]) &amp;ndash; they are more usefully considered here. These include the escutcheon or inescutcheon, lozenge, fusil, mascle, rustre, billet, roundel, fountain, and annulet.
* The ''[[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]'' is a small shield. If borne singly in the centre of the main shield, it is sometimes called an ''inescutcheon'', and is usually employed to combine multiple coats. It is customarily the same shape as the shield it is on, though shields of specific shapes are rarely specified in the blazon.
* The ''[[Lozenge (heraldry)|lozenge]]'' is a [[rhombus]] generally resembling the [[diamonds (suit)|diamonds]] of playing cards. A more acute lozenge is called a ''fusil''. A lozenge voided (''i.e.'' with a lozenge-shaped hole) is a ''mascle''; a lozenge pierced (''i.e.'' with a round hole) is a ''rustre''.
* The ''billet'' is a rectangle, usually at least twice as tall as it is wide; it may represent a block of wood or a sheet of paper. Billets appear in the shield of the [[house of Nassau]], which was modified to become that of the [[kingdom of the Netherlands]].
* The ''[[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]]'' is a solid circle, frequently of gold (blazoned a ''[[bezant]]''). A ''[[fountain (heraldry)|fountain]]'' is depicted as ''a roundel barry wavy argent and azure''. An ''[[Annulet (ring)|annulet]]'' is a roundel voided (''i.e.'' a ring).

Several other simple charges occur with comparable frequency. These include the mullet or star, crescent and cross.
* The ''[[Star (heraldry)|mullet]]'' is a star of (usually five) straight rays, and may have originated as a representation of the ''rowel'' or ''revel'' of a ''[[spur]]'' (although "spur revels" do appear under that name).&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies296&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), pp. 295-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Mullets frequently appear pierced. An unpierced mullet is sometimes called a "star" in Scottish heraldry, and stars also appear in English and continental heraldry under that name (often with six points). The "spur revel" is also found in Scottish heraldry.
* A star with (usually six) wavy rays is called an ''estoile'' (the [[Old French]] word for 'star'; modern French ''étoile'').
* The ''[[crescent]]'', a symbol of the [[Moon]], normally appears with its horns upward; if its horns are ''to dexter'' it represents a waxing moon (''increscent''), and with horns ''to sinister'' it represents a waning moon (''decrescent'').

&lt;/center&gt;

One of the most frequently found charges in heraldry, if not ''the'' most, is the ''[[Cross#In heraldry|cross]]'', which has developed into, some say, 400 varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; When the cross does not reach the edges of the field, it becomes a mobile charge. The plain ''Greek cross'' (with equal limbs) and ''Latin cross'' (with the lower limb extended) are sometimes seen, but more often the tip of each limb is developed into some ornamental shape. The most commonly found crosses in heraldry include the ''cross botonny'', the ''cross flory'', the ''cross moline'', the ''cross potent'', the ''cross patée'' or ''formée'', the ''cross patonce'' and the ''cross crosslet''.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), pp. 128-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In English heraldry the [[crescent]], [[mullet (heraldry)|mullet]], [[martlet]], [[annulet (ring)|annulet]], [[fleur-de-lis]] and [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] may be added to a shield to distinguish [[cadency|cadet]] branches of a family from the senior line. It does not follow, however, that a shield containing such a charge necessarily belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic (''undifferenced'') coats of arms.

==Human or humanlike figures==
Humans, deities, angels and demons occur more often as crests and supporters than on the shield. When humans do appear on the shield, they almost always appear ''affronté'' (facing forward), rather than toward the left like beasts. The largest group of human charges consists of [[saint]]s, often as the patron of a town. Knights, bishops, monks and nuns, kings and queens also occur frequently. There are rare occurrences of a "child" (without further description, this is usually understood to be a very young boy, and young girls are extremely rare in heraldry), both the head and entire body. A famous example is the child swallowed by a dragon (the [[biscione]]) in the arms of [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] dukes of [[Milan]].

[[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythological figures typically appear in an allegorical or [[canting arms|canting]] role. [[Angel]]s very frequently appear, but angelic beings of higher rank, such as [[cherubim]] and [[seraphim]], are extremely rare. An [[archangel]] appears in the arms of [[Arkhangelsk]]. The [[Devil]] or a [[demon]] is occasionally seen, being defeated by the archangel [[Saint Michael]]. Though the taboo is not invariably respected, British heraldry in particular, and to a greater or lesser extent the heraldry of other countries, frowns on depictions of [[God]] or [[Christ]], though an exception may be in the not-uncommon Continental depictions of [[Madonna and Child]], including the [[Black Madonna]] in the arms of [[Marija Bistrica]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;The arms of Marija Bistrica, depicting the black Madonna, can be found [http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/descr/hr-kr2.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Moors—or more frequently their heads, often crowned—appear with some frequency in medieval European heraldry. The term ascribed to them in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] is ''maure'', though they are also sometimes called ''moore'', ''blackmoor'', ''negro'' or occasionally ''savage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Man | work= A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry | last=Parker | first=James | url=http://www.heraldsnet.org/saitou/parker/Jpglossm.htm#Man | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maure]]s appear in European heraldry from at least as early as the 13th century,&lt;ref name=VAM&gt;{{cite web | title=Africans in medieval &amp; Renaissance art: the Moor's head | url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/a/africans-in-medieval-and-renaissance-art-moors-head/ | publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some have been attested as early as the 11th century in [[Italy]],&lt;ref name=VAM /&gt; where they have persisted in the local heraldry and [[vexillology]] well into modern times in [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]]. Armigers bearing moors or moors' heads may have adopted them for any of several reasons, to include symbolizing military victories in the [[Crusades]], as a pun on the bearer's name in the [[canting arms]] of Morese, Negri, Saraceni, etc., or in the case of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], possibly to demonstrate the reach of his empire.&lt;ref name=VAM /&gt; Even the [[Coat_of_arms_of_Pope_Benedict_XVI|arms of Pope Benedict XVI]] feature a moor's head, crowned and collared red. Nevertheless, the use of moors (and particularly their heads) as a heraldic symbol has been deprecated in modern North America,&lt;ref&gt;In his July 15, 2005 blog article [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_13_132/ai_n27858944/ "Is that a Moor's head?"], Mathew N. Schmalz refers to a discussion on the American Heraldry Society's web site where at least one participant described the moor's head as a "potentially explosive image."&lt;/ref&gt; where racial stereotypes have been influenced by a history of [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] and racial segregation, and applicants to the College of Arms of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] are urged to use them delicately to avoid creating offensive images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Part IX: Offensive Armory | work=Rules for Submissions of the College of Arms of the Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. | url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/rfs.html#9 | date=2008-04-02 | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

===Human parts===
Parts of human bodies occur more often than the whole, particularly [[heads in heraldry|heads]] (occasionally of exotic nationality), hearts (always stylized), hands, torso and armored limbs. A famous heraldic hand is the [[Red Hand of Ulster]], alluding to an incident in the legendary [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]] invasion. Hands also appear in the coat of arms of [[Antwerp]]. [[Rib]]s occur in Iberian armory, canting for the Portuguese family ''da Costa''. According to Woodward &amp; Burnett, the Counts Colleoni of Milan bear arms blazoned: "Per pale argent and gules, three hearts reversed counterchanged;" but in less delicate times these were read as [[canting arms]]&lt;ref&gt;Woodward &amp; Burnett (1969), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; showing three pairs of testicles (''coglioni'' = "testicles" in Italian).&lt;ref&gt;Altieri, Ferdinando (1726). ''[http://openlibrary.org/details/dizionarioitali00altigoog Dizionario italiano ed inglese: A dictionary Italian and English]''.  See also [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Coats_of_arms_of_the_House_of_Colleoni Coats of arms of the House of Colleoni] at [[Wikimedia Commons]].&lt;/ref&gt; The community of [[Cölbe]] in [[Hesse]] has a coat of arms with a similar charge.

==Animals==
{{See also|:Category:Heraldic beasts|List of heraldic charges#Beasts}}
Animals, especially lions and eagles, feature prominently as heraldic charges. Some differences may be observed between an animal's natural form and the conventional [[Attitude (heraldry)|attitude]]s (positions) into which heraldic animals are contorted; additionally, various parts of an animal (claws, horns, tongue, etc.) may be differently coloured, each with its own terminology. Most animals are broadly classified, according to their natural form, into beasts, birds, sea creatures and others, and the attitudes that apply to them may be grouped accordingly. Beasts, particularly lions, most often appear in the ''rampant'' position; while birds, particularly the eagle, most often appear ''displayed''. While the lion, regarded as the king of beasts, is by far the most frequently occurring beast in heraldry, the eagle, equally regarded as the king of birds, is overwhelmingly the most frequently occurring bird, and the rivalry between these two is often noted to parallel with the political rivalry between the powers they came to represent in medieval Europe. Neubecker notes that "in the heroic poem by [[Heinrich von Veldeke]] based on the story of [[Aeneas]], the bearer of the arms of a lion is set against the bearer of the arms of an eagle. If one takes the latter to be the historical and geographical forerunner of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman emperor]], then the bearer of the lion represents the unruly feudal lords, to whom the emperor had to make more and more concessions, particularly to the powerful duke of Bavaria and Saxony, [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]]."&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker (1976), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beast most often portrayed in heraldry is the [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]]. When posed ''passant guardant'' (walking and facing the viewer), he is called a ''léopard'' in [[French heraldry|French blazon]]. Other beasts frequently seen include the [[Wolves in heraldry|wolf]], [[Bears in heraldry|bear]], [[Boars in heraldry|boar]], [[horse]], [[bull]] or [[ox]], and [[stag]] or hart. The ''tiger'' (unless blazoned as a ''Bengal [[tiger]]'') is a fanciful beast with a wolflike body, a mane and a pointed snout. [[Dog]]s of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur more often as crests or supporters than as charges. According to Neubecker, heraldry in the Middle Ages generally distinguished only between pointers, hounds and whippets, when any distinction was made.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker (1976), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[unicorn]] resembles a horse with a single horn, but its hooves are usually cloven like those of a deer. The [[griffin]] combines the head (but with ears), chest, wings and forelegs of the eagle with the hindquarters and legs of a lion. The ''male griffin'' lacks wings and his body is scattered with spikes.

The bird most frequently found in armory is, by far, the [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]]. Eagles in heraldry are predominantly presented with one or two heads, though triple-headed eagles are not unknown, and one eagle appearing in the [[Codex Manesse]] curiously has its wing bones fashioned into additional heads.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The town of [[Waiblingen]] was granted arms in 1957 displaying a triple-headed eagle said to represent the dukes of Swabia, seen [http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/kreis/waibling.htm here], and the arms of [[Reinmar von Zweter]], depicted in the Codex Manesse, can be seen [http://diglit.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg848/0641?sid=257363d1489314b86c924303d5110f79 here].&lt;/ref&gt; Eagles and their wings also feature prominently as crests. Eagles most frequently appear full-bodied, with one head, in numerous [[attitude (heraldry)|positions]] including ''displayed'', ''statant'', ''passant'' and ''rising''. The ''demi-eagle'', which is shown only from the waist up, occurs less frequently. [[Double-headed eagle]]s almost always appear ''displayed''. As a result of being the dominant charge on the imperial [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] coats of arms, the double eagle gained enduring renown throughout the Western world. Among the present day nations with an eagle charge on their coat of arms are: [[Coat of arms of Albania|Albania]], [[Coat of arms of Austria|Austria]], [[Coat of arms of Germany|Germany]], [[Coat of arms of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Coat of arms of Poland|Poland]], [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]], [[Coat of arms of Russia|Russia]], and [[Coat of arms of Serbia|Serbia]]. Additionally, the ''Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash'' is used as an emblem by the [[Scottish Rite]] of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottishritemasons-can.org/eagle.htm|title=ＦＸで儲けを得るための手段とは？|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many meanings attached to this symbol, and it was introduced in France in the early 1760s as the emblem of the [[Knight Kadosh]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Double-Headed Eagle: iconographic sources of the masonic symbol |url=http://pierre.mollier.perso.sfr.fr/articles/PM-12-Double-Headed-Eagle.pdf |author=Pierre Mollier |authorlink=Pierre Mollier |journal=The Chain of Union |issue= Special issue No.3 |year=2004 |pages=5–15|accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[martlet]], a stylized swallow without feet (sometimes incorrectly, at least in the Anglophone heraldries these days, said to have no beak), is a mark of [[cadency]] in English heraldry, but also appears as a simple charge in undifferenced arms. The pelican is notable as frequently occurring in a peculiar attitude described as ''[[Pelican in her piety|in her piety]]'' (''i.e.'' wings raised, piercing her own breast to feed her chicks in the nest, which is how it is actually often blazoned, 'in its piety' being a fairly modern conceit). This symbol carries a particular religious meaning, and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinction is however observed, between a pelican "vulning herself" (alone, piercing her breast) and "in her piety" (surrounded by and feeding her chicks).&lt;ref&gt;Cussans (2003, first published 1882), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[swan]] is also often seen, and the [[Peafowl|peacock]] in heraldry is described as being ''in its pride''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacqueline Fearn|title=Discovering Heraldry|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|pages=35–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other birds occur less frequently.

The category of sea creatures may be seen to include various fish, a highly stylized "dolphin", and various fanciful creatures, sea monsters, which are shown as half-fish and half-beast, as well as mermaids and the like. The "sea lion" and "sea horse", for example, do not appear as natural [[sea lion]]s and [[seahorse]]s, but rather as half-lion half-fish and half-horse half-fish, respectively. [[Fish]] of various species often appear in [[canting arms]], e.g.: [[pike (fish)|pike]], also called luce, for Pike or Lucy; [[Coryphaenidae|dolphin]] (a conventional kind of fish rather than the natural mammal) for the [[Dauphin de Viennois]]. The ''escallop'' ([[scallop]] shell) became popular as a token of pilgrimage to the shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. The ''sea-lion'' and ''sea-horse'', like the [[mermaid]], combine the foreparts of a mammal with the tail of a fish, and a dorsal fin in place of the mane. (When the natural [[seahorse]] is meant, it is blazoned as a ''hippocampus''.) The ''sea-dog'' and ''sea-wolf'' are quadrupeds but with scales, webbed feet, and often a flat tail resembling that of the [[beaver]].

Reptiles and invertebrates occurring in heraldry include serpents, lizards, salamanders and others, but the most frequently occurring of these are various forms of dragons. The "[[dragon]]", thus termed, is a large monstrous reptile with, often, a forked or barbed tongue, membraned wings like a bat's, and four legs. The ''[[wyvern]]'' and ''[[lindworm]]'' are dragons with only two legs. The [[Salamander (legendary creature)|salamander]] is typically shown as a simple lizard surrounded by flames. Also notably occurring (undoubtedly owing much of its fame to [[Napoleon]], though it also appears in much earlier heraldry) is the [[bee]].&lt;ref&gt;'Gyronny of eight ermine and gules - in each of the last four gyrons a bee volant en arriere argent' was recorded in the 1670s, well before Napoleon Bonaparte's time.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal parts===
Animals' [[heads in heraldry|heads]] are also very frequent charges, as are the paw or leg (''gamb'') of the lion, the wing (often paired) of the eagle, and the antlers (''attire'') of the stag. Sometimes only the top half of a beast is shown; for example, the ''demi-lion'' is among the most common forms occurring in heraldic crests.

Heads may appear ''cabossed'' (also ''caboshed'' or ''caboched''): with the head cleanly separated from the neck so that only the face shows; ''couped'': with the neck cleanly separated from the body so that the whole head and neck are present; or ''[[erasure (heraldry)|erased]]'': with the neck showing a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. While cabossed heads are shown facing forward (''affronté''), heads that are ''couped'' or ''erased'' face dexter unless otherwise specified for differencing. Heads of horned beasts are often shown cabossed to display the horns, but instances can be found in any of these circumstances. A lion's head cabossed is called simply a ''face'', and a fox's head cabossed, a ''mask''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles MacKinnon of Dunakin|title=The Observer's Book of Heraldry|publisher=Frederick Warne and Co|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitude of animals===
{{Main article|Attitude (heraldry)}}
The ''attitude'', or position, of the creature's body is usually explicitly stated in English blazon. When such description is omitted, a lion can be assumed to be ''rampant'', a leopard or herbivore ''passant''.

By default, the charge faces dexter (left as seen by the viewer); this would be forward on a shield worn on the left arm. In German armory, animate charges in the dexter half of a composite display are usually turned to face the center.

* An animal ''toward sinister'' or ''contourny'' is turned toward the right of the shield (as seen by the observer, i.e. the shield-bearer's left), the sinister.
* An animal ''affronté'' or ''full faced'' faces the viewer.
* An animal ''guardant'' faces dexter with its head turned to face the viewer.
* An animal ''regardant'' faces dexter with its head turned toward sinister, as if looking over its shoulder.

Certain features of an animal are often of a contrasting tincture. The charge is then said to be ''armed'' (claws and horns and tusks), ''langued'' (tongue), ''[[vilené]]''&lt;ref name="rietstap-1884"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rietstap |first=J.

Many attitudes have developed from the herald's imagination and ever-increasing need for differentiation, but only the principal attitudes found in heraldry need be discussed here. These, in the case of beasts, include the erect positions, the seated positions, and the prone positions. In the case of birds, these include the "displayed" positions, the flying positions, and the resting positions. Additionally, birds are frequently described by the position of their wings. A few other attitudes warrant discussion, including those particular to fish, serpents, griffins and dragons.

The principal attitude of beasts is ''rampant'' (''i.e.'' standing on one hind leg with forepaws raised as if to strike). Beasts also frequently appear walking, ''passant'' or, in the case of stags and the occasional unicorn, ''trippant'', and may appear ''statant'' (standing), ''salient'' or ''springing'' (leaping), ''sejant'' (seated), ''couchant'' or ''lodged'' (lying prone with head raised), or occasionally ''dormant'' (sleeping). The principal attitude of birds, namely the eagle, is ''displayed'' (''i.e.'' facing the viewer with the head turned toward dexter and wings raised and upturned to show the full underside of both wings). Birds also appear ''rising'' or ''rousant'' (''i.e.'' wings raised and head upturned as if about to take flight), ''volant'' (flying), ''statant'' (standing, with wings raised), ''close'' (at rest with wings folded), and waterfowl may appear ''naiant'' (swimming), while cranes may appear ''vigilant'' (standing on one leg). Fish often appear ''naiant'' (swimming horizontally) or ''hauriant'' (upwards) or ''urinant'' (downwards), but may also appear ''addorsed'' (two fish hauriant, back to back). Serpents may appear ''glissant'' (gliding in a wavy form) or ''nowed'' (as a [[figure-eight knot]]). Griffins and quadrupedal dragons constantly appear ''segreant'' (''i.e.'' rampant with wings addorsed and elevated) and, together with lions, may appear ''combatant'' (''i.e.'' two of them turned to face each other in the rampant position).

==Plants==
Plants are extremely common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. The [[turnip]], for instance, makes an early appearance, as does [[wheat]]. Trees also appear in heraldry; the most frequent tree by far is the [[oak]] (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the [[pine]]. [[Apple]]s and bunches of [[grape]]s occur very frequently, other fruits less so. When the fruit is mentioned, as to indicate a different tincture, the tree is said to be ''fructed'' of the tincture. If a tree is "eradicated" it is shown as if it has been ripped up from the ground, the roots being exposed. "Erased" is rarely used for a similar treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Find an example of a tree "erased" [http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=595&amp;ProjectElementID=2099 here].&lt;/ref&gt; In Portuguese heraldry, but rarely in other countries, trees are sometimes found [[Decortication|decorticated]].

The most famous heraldic flower (particularly in French heraldry) is the ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'', which is often stated to be a stylised lily, though despite the name there is considerable debate on this.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The "natural" [[lily]], somewhat stylised, also occurs, as (together with the fleur-de-lis) in the arms of [[Eton College]]. The [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] is perhaps even more widely seen in English heraldry than the fleur-de-lis. Its heraldic form is derived from the "wild" type with only five petals, and it is often ''barbed'' (the hull of the bud, its points showing between the petals) and ''seeded'' in contrasting tinctures. The [[thistle]] frequently appears as a symbol of [[Scotland]].

The [[trefoil]], [[quatrefoil]] and [[cinquefoil]] are abstract forms resembling flowers or leaves. The trefoil is always shown ''slipped'' (i.e. with a stem), unless blazoned otherwise. The cinquefoil is sometimes blazoned ''fraise'' (strawberry flower), most notably when [[canting arms|canting]] for Fraser. The [[trillium]] flower occurs occasionally in a Canadian context, and the [[protea]] flower constantly appears in South Africa, since it is the national flower symbol.

Wheat constantly occurs in the form of "garbs" or sheaves and in fields (e.g. in [[Coat of arms of Alberta|the arms of the province of Alberta]], Canada), though less often as ears, which are shown unwhiskered (though some varieties of wheat are naturally whiskered). Ears of [[rye]] are depicted exactly as wheat, except the ears droop down and are often whiskered. [[Barley]], [[cannabis]], [[maize]], and [[oat]]s also occur. The "garb" in the arms of [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] (and in the Coat of Arms of Sweden) is not a wheatsheaf, although it was pictured in that way from the 16th to 19th century; rather, this "vasa" is a bundle but of unknown sort.

==Inanimate objects==
Very few inanimate objects in heraldry carry a special significance distinct from that of the object itself, but among such objects are the ''escarbuncle'', the ''fasces'', and the ''key''. The escarbuncle developed from the radiating iron bands used to strengthen a round shield, eventually becoming a heraldic charge.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies291&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fasces]] (not to be confused with the French term for a ''bar'' or ''fess'') is emblematic of the Roman magisterial office and has often been granted to [[mayor]]s.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies291 /&gt; [[Key (lock)|Key]]s (taking a form similar to a "[[Key (lock)#Skeleton key|skeleton key]]") are emblematic of [[Saint Peter]] and, by extension, the [[Pope|papacy]], and thus frequently appear in ecclesiastical heraldry.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies291 /&gt; Because St. Peter is the patron saint of fishermen, keys also notably appear in the arms of the [[Worshipful Company of Fishmongers]].&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies291 /&gt;

The [[sun (heraldry)|sun]] is a disc with twelve or more wavy rays, or alternating wavy and straight rays, often represented "''in his splendour''" (''i.e.'' with a face). The [[moon]] "in her plenitude" (full) sometimes appears, distinguished from a ''roundel argent'' by having a face; but [[crescent]]s occur much more frequently. ''[[Star (heraldry)|Estoiles]]'' are stars with six wavy rays, while ''stars'' (when they occur under that name) have straight rays usually numbering five in British and North American heraldry and six in continental European heraldry. [[Cloud]]s often occur, though more frequently for people or animals to stand on or issue from than as isolated charges. The raindrop as such is unknown, though a drop of fluid (''[[goutte]]'') is known. These occasionally appear as a charge, but more frequently constitute a [[Variation of the field#Semé|field semé]] (known as ''goutté''). The [[snowflake]] occurs in modern heraldry, sometimes blazoned as a "snow crystal" or "ice crystal".

The oldest geological charge is the ''mount'', typically a green hilltop rising from the lower edge of the field, providing a place for a beast, building or tree to stand. This feature is exceedingly common in Hungarian arms. Natural mountains and boulders are not unknown, though ranges of mountains are differently shown. An example is the arms of [[Edinburgh]], portraying [[Edinburgh Castle]] atop [[Castle Rock, Edinburgh|Castle Rock]]. [[Volcano]]s are shown, almost without exception, as erupting, and the eruption is generally quite stylised. In the 18th century, ''landscapes'' began to appear in armory, often depicting the sites of battles. For example, Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]] received a chief of augmentation containing a landscape alluding to the [[Battle of the Nile]].

By far the most frequent building in heraldry is the ''[[tower]]'', a tapering cylinder of masonry topped with [[battlement]]s, usually having a door and a few windows. The canting arms of the [[Kingdom of Castile]] are ''Gules, a tower triple-turreted Or'' (''i.e.'' three small towers standing atop a larger one). A [[castle]] is generally shown as two towers joined by a wall, the doorway often shown secured by a [[portcullis]]. The portcullis was used as a canting badge by the [[House of Tudor]] ("two-doors"), and has since come to represent the British Parliament. The modern [[rook (chess)|chess-rook]] would be indistinguishable from a tower; the heraldic chess rook, based on the medieval form of the piece, instead of battlements, has two outward-splayed "horns". Civic and ecclesiastical armory sometimes shows a [[church (building)|church]] or a whole town, and cities, towns and Scots burghs often bear a [[mural crown]] (a crown in the form of a wall with battlements or turrets) in place of a crown over the shield. [[Ship]]s of various types often appear; the most frequent being the ancient galley often called, from the Gaelic, a [[lymphad]]. Also frequent are [[anchor]]s and [[oar]]s.

The ''maunch'' is a 12th-century lady's sleeve style. Its use in heraldry arose from the custom of the knights who attended tournaments wearing their ladies sleeves, as "gages d'amour" (tokens of love). This fashion of sleeve would later evolve into [[Tippet]]-style stoles. In French blazon this charge is sometimes informally referred to as ''manche mal taillée'' (a sleeve badly cut).&lt;ref&gt;Rietstap, ''Armorial Général'', page XXV.  John Woodward and Henry Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry, British and Foreign'', page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spur]]s also occur, sometimes "winged", but more frequently occurring is the ''spur-rowel'' or ''spur-revel'', which is said to more often termed a "[[Star (heraldry)|mullet]] of five points pierced" by English heralds.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909), p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crown (headgear)|Crown]]s and [[coronet]]s of various kinds are constantly seen. The ecclesiastical [[hat]] and bishop's [[mitre]] are nearly ubiquitous in [[ecclesiastical heraldry]]. The [[sword]] is sometimes a symbol of authority, as in the royal arms of the [[Netherlands]], but may also allude to [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], as the patron of a town (e.g. [[London]]) or dedicatee of a church. Sometimes it is shown with a key, owing to the fact that Saints Peter and Paul are paired together. Other weapons occur more often in modern than in earlier heraldry. The [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] also appears as a weapon, the war mace, in addition to its appearance as a symbol of authority, plain mace. The ''[[globus cruciger]]'', also variously called an ''orb'', a ''royal orb'', or a ''mound'' (from French ''monde'', Latin ''mundus'', the world) is a ball or globe surmounted by a cross, which is part of the regalia of an emperor or king, and is the emblem of sovereign authority and majesty.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1892), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Book]]s constantly occur, most frequently in the arms of [[college]]s and [[university|universities]], though the [[Gospel]] and [[Bible]] are sometimes distinguished. Books if open may be inscribed with words. Words and phrases are otherwise rare, except in Spanish and Portuguese armory. Letters of the various alphabets are also relatively rare. Arms of merchants in Poland and eastern Germany are often based on [[house mark]]s, abstract symbols resembling [[runes]], though they are almost never blazoned as runes, but as combinations of other heraldic charges. Musical instruments commonly seen are the [[harp]] (as in the [[coat of arms of Ireland]]), [[bell]] and [[trumpet]]. The [[drum]], almost without exception, is of the field drum type. Since musical notation is a comparatively recent invention, it is not found in early heraldry, though it does appear in 20th century heraldry.

Japanese [[Mon (emblem)|mon]] are sometimes used as heraldic charges. They are blazoned in traditional heraldic style rather than in the Japanese style.&lt;ref name="Tsubouchi"&gt;[http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1678&amp;ShowAll=1 ''Tsubouchi, David Hiroshi (Canadian register of arms)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Composition5r.jpg|thumb|Composition 1920x1080]]
'''Composition studies''' (also referred to as '''composition and [[rhetoric]]''', '''rhetoric and composition''', '''writing studies''', or simply '''composition''') is the professional field of [[writing]], research, and instruction, focusing especially on writing at the college level in the [[United States]]. In many American colleges and universities, undergraduate [[students]] must take [[freshman]]—sometimes even higher—composition courses. 

Over seventy American universities offer doctoral study in rhetoric and composition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccccdoctoralconsortium.org/members/ Doctoral Consortium in Rhetoric and Composition]&lt;/ref&gt; programs which usually include study of [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|composition pedagogical theory]], [[research methodologies in rhetoric and composition]], and [[Rhetoric|the history of rhetoric]]. Many composition [[scholars]] study not only the [[theory]] and practice of post-secondary [[writing]] instruction, but also the influence of different writing conventions and [[genres]] on writers' composing processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genreacrossborders.org/ Genre Across Borders]&lt;/ref&gt; Composition scholars also publish in the fields of teaching [[English as a second or foreign language]] (TESOL), [[writing center]]s, and [[new literacies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://compfaqs.org/CompFAQs/Home?from=Main.HomePage Comp FAQs from CompPile]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First-year composition==
{{Main|First-year composition}}
Most US universities have a required [[first-year composition]] course, also referred to as FYC. This is not the same as a [[literature]] course, which focuses on literary analysis and interpretation, although some colleges and universities do incorporate literature and other humanities into their composition courses; often, however, composition courses offer intensive instruction in writing [[non-fiction]], expository texts using academic discourse conventions. Writing curricula vary considerably from institution to institution, but it may emphasize many stages of different writing processes (invention or brainstorming, drafting, revision, editing, proofreading), different forms of writing (narration, exposition, description, argumentation, comparison and contrast), different portions of the written product (introductions, conclusions, thesis statements, presentation and documentation of forms of evidence, inclusion of quotations, etc.), along with different modalities of composing to expand the concept of 'writing'. Pedagogies or approaches to teaching writing are grounded in a range of different traditions and philosophies.

==Advanced composition==

Some universities require further instruction in writing and offer courses that expand upon the skills developed in First-year composition. Second level or advanced composition may emphasize forms of argumentation and persuasion, digital media, research and source documentation formats, and/or genres of writing across a range of disciplines and genres (see {{section link||Writing across the curriculum}} below). For example, the skills required to write business letters or annual reports will differ significantly from those required to write historical or scientific research or personal memoirs.

==Graduate studies==

Doctoral programs in Composition Studies are available at more than seventy universities and Masters's programs are available in over 170 universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdcwss.com Master's Degree Consortium of Writing Studies Specialists]&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs are commonly housed within English Studies or Education programs. However, recently there are an increasing number of departments specifically dedicated to this field of study (e.g. Composition Studies, Writing &amp; Rhetoric, Composition &amp; Linguistics, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/04/cccc|title=What Is a Composition and Rhetoric Doctorate?|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second-language writing==
{{Main|Second language writing}}
Second language writing is the practice of teaching English composition to non native speakers and writers of English. Teaching writing to ESL students does not receive much attention because even in ESL classes teachers focus on speaking, listening and reading, not just writing. [[Paul Kei Matsuda]] in his article "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context" stresses the importance of teaching writing specifically with understanding the needs of ESL students to help them improve their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, Paul K. "Situating ESL Writing in a Cross-Disciplinary Context." Written Communication, Sage Publications, 1998, 15 (1), pp 99-121.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching writing has progressed through several approaches during the history of education in the United States. ESL teachers might need to explore common methods which are the cognitive, social and expressive theories to create an approach that meets the needs of ESL writers and help them to overcome their difficulties.

The first one of these approaches is the cognitive view which says that writing is progressing from one stage to another in a series of single steps. That means "good" writing is a planned process, which includes planning, translating and reviewing. "Understanding Composing" by Sondra Perl explains in detail this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. "Understanding Composing" Handout, Composition Theories, University of Akron, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that the composition of writing occurs as a recursive process. She took this idea from her observation of different writers. She thinks that writers return to "backwards" parts of the process in order to move "forward" with the overall composition. ESL teachers may find this approach helpful at first in teaching beginning ESL students because at this level students do not have large amounts of vocabulary and grammar or knowledge of the style of essays which is the basis of writing English. Al-Buainain Haifa in her article "Student Writing Errors in EFL," points out that, when a researcher asked ESL students by using a survey what they would like to have learned or learned better in their writing classes, they found that the largest percentages expressed specific needs in vocabulary and grammar &lt;ref&gt;Al-Buainain, Haifa. "Student Writing Errors in EFL." Qatar University, 2006, pp 1 -37.&lt;/ref&gt;(17). Many kinds of grammar make ESL students confused, especially because there are many exceptions. Because writing styles are different in different languages, ESL students need time to master them. Therefore, ESL teachers should find an effective way to teach ESL students vocabulary, grammar and style because the writing of English requires them. The cognitive approach can meet these needs because it emphasizes the steps, organization and process of writing.

Another approach is the social view which shows the importance of teaching writing by making students learn the different languages of discourse communities. This is what David Bartholomae emphasizes in his article "Inventing the University".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David "Inventing the University," Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp. 523- 555.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses "Inventing the University" as a phrase that describes the writing process that a student will experience when writing teachers ask them to write about a topic that relates with a discourse community which is new for them. Discourse community can be thought of as members of an academic discipline or a select audience. When the ESL students have become good at grammar and style, they face a large problem when they enter their chosen academic field. Bartholomae in this article illustrates that each academic community has a particular language or vocabulary. The problem is that any academic field has its own language, even jargon, that differs from one to another. This problem is faced not only by ESL students, but all American students will struggle with this when they begin the first year of their academic life. The social approach can be used by ESL teachers as a second step but they should make sure that their students master the basics of English writing such as grammar and style.

Moreover, the expressive view which is represented in Donald Murray's article "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product", allows for wittier creating and freer movement.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald M. "Teach Writing as a Process Not Product." Cross-Talk in Comp Theory, A Reader, 3rd ed. Edited by Victor Villanueva and Kristin L. Arola, National Council of Teachers of English, 2011, pp 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests three elements for "good" writing which are integrity, originality, and spontaneity. However, it is difficult to evaluate them in a paper. Therefore, these standards cannot be relied upon to judge writing. In addition, these elements are not the important elements that help to assess "good" writing. ESL teachers might use this approach but it can only be used for highly advanced ESL students. It is difficult to ask ESL students to write freely if they possess limited vocabulary or grammar. They need examples to help them which they can find in the cognitive approach.

ESL teachers may use these common ways of teaching writing, but they need first to understand their student's difficulties. Learning writing is one of the essential difficulties that ESL students find in studying English, especially since writing is important in an academic community. Some ESL students may need to jump from being a student who does not speak English ever to a student who uses academic language in a short time which may put a large burden on their shoulders. Hence, teaching writing to ESL students is different than teaching native speakers. ESL teachers need to choose an effective way to meet the needs of ESL students. It would be helpful if ESL teachers look at these different ways of teaching writing to see which one addresses ESL students' difficulties in the best way or if a combination of these theories may be better.

=== Multicultural pedagogies ===

==== Basis in composition studies ====
While multicultural pedagogies are not specifically tied to second-language writing pedagogies, compositionists have often considered how students' cultural knowledge and use of idioms, dialects, and/or languages other than American Edited English (AEA) can enhance their instruction in English composition. For example, Maxine Hairston's "Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing" advocates for students' expressivist writing to be central in a composition course, and believes students "need to write to find out how much they know and to gain confidence in the ability to express themselves effectively" (186).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hairston|first=Maxine|year=1992|title=Diversity, Ideology, and Teaching Writing|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=43.3|pages=178–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hairston also believes that teachers can design writing assignments to encourage "cross-cultural awareness" (191).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Beth Daniell's approach in "Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture" describes how studies in "little narratives [that] almost all examine literacy in particular local settings" championed by scholars who "seldom make theoretical statements that claim to be valid for literate cultures in general or literate cultures in general," which would allow students to engage in cultural critique (403).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniell|first=Beth|year=1999|title=Narratives of Literacy: Connecting College Composition to Culture|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=50|pages=393–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Schutz and Anne Ruggles Gere's article for ''College English'', "Service Learning and English Studies," described how Schutz's course, while it was mainly focused in service learning and local activism, engaged students in collaborative research and writing surrounding campus-wide issues, such as an instance of racial discrimination that occurred in the local student union; this allowed students to engage in cultural awareness as well as cultural critique (129-39).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Aaron|last2=Anne|first2=Gere|year=1998|title=Service Learning and English Studies: Rethinking 'Public Service|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=129–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, In ''Empowering Education,'' Ira Shor delineates a pedagogy in which the teacher facilitates discussion of generative themes produced by the students, using the example of his basic writing course with working-class students at "a low-budget college in New York City" several decades ago (10).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Empowering Education: Critical Teaching for Social Change|last=Shor|first=Ira|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-226-14786-4|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|via=Google Play Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freirean approach for teaching literacy and writing that Shor reviews in ''Empowering Education'' demonstrates how the generative words manifested themselves "[through] researching local issues and language in the students' communities. From the many linguistic and sociological items…the educators selected some key concerns—generative themes expressed through generative words" (55).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this framework, teachers and students research these items collaboratively, and once students have presented their research on problems in their community, they may begin to decide how they might analyze and upend power structures or rhetorical situations that contribute to and exacerbate such issues. For Shor's classroom, "[t]he generative themes [that have] emerg[ed]…from student culture have most often related to sex, abortion, drugs, family, education, careers, work, and the economic crisis" (56).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Shor believes it is important to allow students to build a basis for problem-posing upon their prior knowledge and experiences to make it multicultural.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Shor also reviews Paolo Freire's literacy project in Brazil as described in Freire's ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'', which enforces the idea that all people are creators of culture through visuals, oral discussion, and creation of word lists that are the basis for which the people begin to use language to express how the dominant culture operates, how their home culture operates, and how these systemic actions impact themselves and the world (Freire 87-124).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed: 30th Anniversary Edition|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|translator-last=Ramos|translator-first=Myra|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, both Freire and Shor believe problem-posing education can be situated in multicultural practices as well as critical literacy practices. Shor insists "subject matter is best introduced as problems related to student experience, in language familiar to them" (63).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Critical reception ====
Overall, previous scholars' discussion of multiculturalism in the classroom seems to privilege "cross-cultural interactions" and valuing students' home languages as well as their cultural ideologies. However, in Donald Lazere's ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'', Lazere criticizes Hairston, Daniell, Schutz, Gere, and other scholars for their approaches because of their singular focus on localism in lieu of more "global" and critical approaches to the study of culture in the composition classroom (152-153).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric: Defending Academic Discourse Against Postmodern Pluralism|last=Lazere|first=Donald|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|year=2015|isbn=978-0-8093-3428-5|location=Carbondale|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lazere was critical of scholars' tendency to diminish the power of Edited American English (EAE) and misrepresent the power of the students' regional code (116).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While Lazere supports Shor's approach to multicultural critical pedagogy, he admits some level of discomfort with applying it in his own classroom especially with respect to how much responsibility and stock Shor places in students (39).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Current approaches ====
Lazere's critique of previous scholarship related to multiculturalism pedagogies, in ''Political Literacy in Composition and Rhetoric'' and elsewhere, has prompted current composition theorists, both in second-language writing and in the field of composition in general, to consider how multicultural pedagogies can embrace globalism as much as localism.

For example, Lisa Eck's "Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally" describes how Eck teaches world literature courses in which students read cultural narratives and problematize them—in the article, she references her use of Tsitsi Dangarembga's ''Nervous Conditions'' in her composition classroom.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eck|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Thinking Globally, Teaching Locally|url=|journal=College English|volume=60|pages=578–598|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her teaching, she is attempting to answer the question of how multicultural pedagogical practices could still be based in research, critical literacy, and problem-posing education. In her approach, she engages students in the kind of literary criticism that is necessary for analyzing and evaluating critical discourse: "I work to make hybrid postcolonial identities familiar, even analogous at times, to what we understand as the process of identity formation for the average postmodern college student….I [also] use the Otherness of the cultures reproduced in foreign texts to estrange the American familiar" (579).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The kinds of inquiry students are using to analyze the text are to show how the text is ''both'' "not about you" and "about you," and how these processes of identity formation are the kinds of processes necessary to critically evaluate public discourse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Furthermore, Jennifer S. Wilson's approach to critical pedagogy in second-language writing as she describes it in her article, "Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach," utilizes a perspective that provides opportunities for the types of writing necessary for students to critically analyze and evaluate ideologies entrenched in the dominant discourse, even as they are learning English as their second language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Jennifer|year=2010|title=Engaging Second Language Writers in Freshman Composition: A Critical Approach|url=|journal=Composition Forum|volume=22|pages=1–14|via=CompPile}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the four major elements of the course that Wilson describes, especially with respect to the ideas she offers for critical writing assignments, create alternative pathways for students to produce writing that has the potential to disrupt cultural and political ideologies represented in various avenues and niches of the dominant public discourse. For example, in addition to incorporating "local topics," Wilson provides options for students to "investigate language use in certain communities, societies, or cultures" as well as "investigating" the relationships between language and power (8-9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even more important, she insists that "[c]ritical pedagogy is concerned with minimizing the power differential between student and teacher; in composition classrooms one way for students to maximize their voices is to publish their work in authentic ways" (9).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Writing across the curriculum==
{{Main|Writing across the curriculum}}
Because academic discourse is not monolithic (in other words, there are curricula that address that the concept of academic discourse can be applied to specific parts of a writing curriculum), many compositionists have created a writing across the curriculum (WAC) movement that situates writing-intensive instruction in specific academic [[discourse]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/composing-a-community-a-history-of-writing-across-the-curriculum/oclc/318390431&amp;referer=brief_results|title=Composing a community: a history of writing across the curriculum|last=McLeod|first=Susan H|last2=Soven|first2=Margot Iris|date=2006|publisher=Parlor Press|isbn=1932559175|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing in the disciplines==

Many university writing programs include writing in the disciplines (WID) courses, which focus on the genres and writing procedures that occur within specific fields of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wac.colostate.edu/intro/pop2e.cfm|title=The WAC Clearinghouse|website=wac.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing center==
{{Main|Writing center}}
Many colleges and universities have a writing center, which offers supplementary tutorial support for writing specifically in English classes and/or across the curriculum. Many universities not in North America only offer writing instruction via writing centers. The European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eataw.eu/ |title=European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing |website=eataw.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, specifically concerns itself with the study and advancement of writing centers in Europe.

Since [[multimodality]] has resonated with Composition Studies, many writing centers have developed associated centers to support students' multimodal, multimedia composing. Some models for this work include the [[digital studio]] and the multiliteracy center.

'''Conflict management''' is the process of limiting the negative aspects of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] while increasing the positive aspects of conflict. The aim of conflict management is to enhance [[learning]] and group outcomes, including effectiveness or performance in an organizational setting.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"&gt;Rahim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; Properly managed conflict can improve group outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, Tjosvaldo, &amp; Law, 2000; Bodtker &amp; Jameson, 2001; Rahim &amp; Bonoma, 1979; Kuhn &amp; Poole, 2000; DeChurch &amp; Marks, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution==
[[Conflict resolution]] involves the reduction, elimination, or termination of all forms and types of conflict. Five styles for conflict management, as identified by Thomas and Kilmann, are: competing, compromising, collaborating, avoiding, and accommodating.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Brief for the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode, CPP Research Department, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses can benefit from appropriate types and levels of conflict. That is the aim of conflict management, and not the aim of conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conflict management does not imply conflict resolution.

Conflict management minimizes the negative outcomes of conflict and promotes the positive outcomes of conflict with the goal of improving learning in an organization.&lt;ref name="rahim 208"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muddaser.com/conflict-management-resolution-strategies-process-steps/|title=Conflict management|last=Altaf|first=Muddaser|date=|website=muddaser.com/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly managed conflict increases [[organizational learning]] by increasing the number of questions asked and encourages people to challenge the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, Rubach, &amp; Marsnik, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organizational conflict]] at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor-subordinate conflict. [[Party-directed mediation]] (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep-seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes. The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session. Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays. The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session. Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates. The Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/ucce50/ag-labor/7conflict/ Party-Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals''] (on-line 3rd Edition, 2014) by [[Gregorio Billikopf]], University of California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations to conflict==
There are three orientations to conflict: lose-lose, win-lose, and [[win-win]]. The lose-lose orientation is a type of conflict that tends to end negatively for all parties involved. A win-lose orientation results in one victorious party, usually at the expense of the other. The win-win orientation is one of the most essential concepts to conflict resolution. A win-win solution arrived at by integrative bargaining may be close to optimal for both parties. This approach engages in a [[Cooperation|cooperative]] approach rather than a competitive one.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson and Wood 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the win-win concept is the ideal orientation, the notion that there can only be one winner is constantly being reinforced in American culture:

"The win-lose orientation is manufactured in our society in athletic competition, admission to academic programs, industrial promotion systems, and so on. Individuals tend to generalize from their objective win-lose situations and apply these experiences to situations that are not objectively [[Lump of labour fallacy|fixed-pies]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spangle and Isenhart 14&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of mentality can be destructive when communicating with different cultural groups by creating barriers in negotiation, resolution and compromise; it can also lead the "loser" to feel mediocre. When the win-win orientation is absent in negotiation, different responses to conflict may be observed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Early conflict management models===
Blake and Mouton (1964) were among the first to present a conceptual scheme for classifying the modes (styles) for handling interpersonal conflicts in five types: forcing, withdrawing, smoothing, compromising, and problem solving.

In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began using the intentions of the parties involved to classify the styles of conflict management that they included in their models. Both Thomas (1976) and Pruitt (1983) put forth a model based on the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict. The combination of the parties' concern for their own interests (i.e. [[assertiveness]]) and their concern for the interests of those across the table (i.e. cooperativeness) yielded a particular conflict management style. Pruitt called these styles yielding (low assertiveness/high cooperativeness), problem solving (high assertiveness/high cooperativeness), inaction (low assertiveness/low cooperativeness), and contending (high assertiveness/low cooperativeness). Pruitt argues that problem-solving is the preferred method when seeking mutually beneficial options (win-win).

===Khun and Poole's model===
Khun and Poole (2000) established a similar system of group conflict management. In their system, they split Kozan's confrontational model into two sub models: distributive and integrative.
* Distributive – Here conflict is approached as a distribution of a fixed amount of positive outcomes or resources, where one side will end up winning and the other losing, even if they do win some concessions.
* Integrative – Groups utilizing the integrative model see conflict as a chance to integrate the needs and concerns of both groups and make the best outcome possible. This model has a heavier emphasis on compromise than the distributive model. Khun and Poole found that the integrative model resulted in consistently better task related outcomes than those using the distributive model.

===DeChurch and Marks's meta-taxonomy===
DeChurch and Marks (2001) examined the literature available on conflict management at the time and Ni established what they claimed was a "meta-taxonomy" that encompasses all other models.

They argued that all other styles have inherent in them into two dimensions:
* activeness ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a responsive and direct rather than inert and indirect impression"). High activeness is characterized by openly discussing differences of opinion while fully going after their own interest. 
* [[agreeableness]] ("the extent to which conflict behaviors make a pleasant and relaxed rather than unpleasant and strainful impression"). High agreeableness is characterized by attempting to satisfy all parties involved.

In the study DeChurch and Marks conducted to validate this division, activeness did not have a significant effect on the effectiveness of conflict resolution, but the agreeableness of the conflict management style, whatever it was, did have a positive impact on how groups felt about the way the conflict was managed, regardless of the outcome.

===Rahim's meta-model===

Rahim (2002) noted that there is agreement among management scholars that there is no one best approach to how to make decisions, lead or manage conflict.

In a similar vein, rather than creating a very specific model of conflict management, Rahim created a meta-model (in much the same way that DeChurch and Marks, 2001, created a meta-taxonomy) for conflict styles based on two dimensions, concern for self and concern for others.

Within this framework are five management approaches: integrating, obliging, dominating, avoiding, and compromising.
* Integration involves openness, exchanging information, looking for alternatives, and examining differences so solve the problem in a manner that is acceptable to both parties.
* Obliging is associated with attempting to minimize the differences and highlight the commonalities to satisfy the concern of the other party.
* Dominating in this style one party goes all out to win his or her objective and, as a result, often ignores the needs and expectations of the other party.
* Avoiding here a party fails to satisfy his or her own concern as well as the concern of the other party.
* Compromising involves give-and-take whereby both parties give up something to make a mutually acceptable decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rahim, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==International conflict management==

Special consideration should be paid to conflict management between two parties from distinct cultures. In addition to the everyday sources of conflict, "misunderstandings, and from this counterproductive, pseudo conflicts, arise when members of one culture are unable to understand culturally determined differences in communication practices, traditions, and thought processing".&lt;ref&gt;Borisoff &amp; Victor, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this has already been observed in the business research literature.

Renner (2007) recounted several episodes where managers from developed countries moved to less developed countries to resolve conflicts within the company and met with little success due to their failure to adapt to the conflict management styles of the local culture.

As an example, in Kozan's study noted above, he noted that Asian cultures are far more likely to use a harmony model of conflict management. If a party operating from a harmony model comes in conflict with a party using a more confrontational model, misunderstandings above and beyond those generated by the conflict itself will arise.

International conflict management, and the cultural issues associated with it, is one of the primary areas of research in the field at the time, as existing research is insufficient to deal with the ever-increasing contact occurring between international entities.

==Application==

===Higher education===
With only 14% of researched universities reporting mandatory courses in this subject, and with up to 25% of the manager day being spent on dealing with conflict, education needs to reconsider the importance of this subject. The subject warrants emphasis on enabling students to deal with conflict management.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;240&lt;/ref&gt;

"Providing more conflict management training in undergraduate business programs could help raise the emotional intelligence of future managers." The improvement of emotional intelligence found that employees were more likely to use problem-solving skills, instead of trying to bargain.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, p.&amp;nbsp;241&lt;/ref&gt;

Students need to have a good set of social skills. Good communication skills allow the manager to accomplish interpersonal situations and conflict. Instead of focusing on conflict as a behavior issue, focus on the communication of it.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;307&lt;/ref&gt;

With an understanding of the communications required, the student will gain the aptitude needed to differentiate between the nature and types of conflicts. These skills also teach that relational and procedural conflict needs a high degree of immediacy to resolution. If these two conflicts are not dealt with quickly, an employee will become dissatisfied or perform poorly.&lt;ref&gt;Myers &amp; Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;313&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the responsibility of companies to react. One option is to identify the skills needed in-house, but if the skills for creating workplace fairness are already lacking, it may be best to seek assistance from an outside organization, such as a developmental assessment center.

According to Rupp, Baldwin, and Bashur, these organizations "have become a popular means for providing coaching, feedback, and experiential learning opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;Rupp, Baldwin &amp; Bashshur, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; Their main focus is fairness and how it impacts employees' attitudes and performance.

These organizations teach competencies and what they mean.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;146&lt;/ref&gt; The students then participate in simulations. Multiple observers assess and record what skills are being used and then return this feedback to the participant. After this assessment, participants are then given another set of simulations to utilize the skills learned. Once again they receive additional feedback from observers, in hopes that the learning can be used in their workplace.

The feedback the participant receives is detailed, behaviorally specific, and high quality. This is needed for the participant to learn how to change their behavior.&lt;ref name="rupp 146"/&gt; In this regard, it is also important that the participant take time to self-reflect so that learning may occur.

Once an assessment program is utilized, action plans may be developed based on quantitative and qualitative data.&lt;ref&gt;Rupp et al., p.&amp;nbsp;159&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]], [[counseling]] may prove to be a helpful antidote. Although few [[organization]]s can afford the luxury of having professional counselors on the staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener —
something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |author=Henry P Knowles; Börje O Saxberg|title= Personality and leadership behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Pub. Co.|location=Reading, Mass.|year=1971|isbn=|oclc=118832|doi= |nopp=true |page=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the simple process of being able to vent one's feelings—that is; to express them to a concerned and understanding listener–is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for the frustrated individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind, better able to cope with a personal difficulty that is affecting his work adversely. The nondirective approach is one effective way for [[Management|managers]] to deal with frustrated subordinates and co-workers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other more direct and more diagnostic ways that might be used in appropriate circumstances. The great strength of the nondirective approach (nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]]), however, lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and the fact that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. No one has ever been harmed by being listened to sympathetically and understandingly. On the contrary, this approach has helped many people to cope with problems that were interfering with their effectiveness on the job.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13604">'''Creative writing''' is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal [[professional writing|professional]], [[journalistic]], [[Academic writing|academic]], or [[technical writing|technical]] forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] or with various traditions of [[poetry]] and [[poetics]]. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as [[feature story|feature stories]] to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both [[fiction]]al and [[non-fiction]]al works fall into this category, including such forms as [[novel]]s, [[biography|biographies]], [[short stories]], and [[poem]]s. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and [[poetry]] classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as [[crime fiction|crime]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]]. Writing for the screen and stage&amp;mdash;[[screenwriting]] and [[playwrighting]]&amp;mdash;are often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.

Creative writing can technically be considered any writing of [[Originality|original]] [[Composition (language)|composition]]. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called [[literature]], including the variety of its [[Literary genre|genre]]s. In her work, ''Foundations of Creativity'', Mary Lee Marksberry references Paul Witty and Lou LaBrant’s ''Teaching the People's Language'' to define creative writing. Marksberry notes:

{{cquote|Witty and LaBrant…[say creative writing] is a composition of any type of writing at any time primarily in the service of such needs as
#the need for keeping records of significant experience,
#the need for sharing experience with an interested group, and
#the need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.&lt;ref name="Marksberry"&gt;Marksberry, Mary Lee. ''Foundation of Creativity.'' Harper's Series on Teaching. (New York ; London: Harper &amp; Row, 1963), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In academia==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010|talk=y}}
Unlike its academic counterpart of writing classes that teach students to compose work based on the rules of the [[language]], creative writing is believed to focus on students’ self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Burges and [[Syracuse University]]. "Creative Writing", 3.&lt;/ref&gt; While creative writing as an educational subject is often available at some stages, if not throughout, [[K–12 education]], perhaps the most refined form of creative writing as an educational focus is in [[university|universities]]. Following a reworking of university education in the [[post-war]] era, creative writing has progressively gained prominence in the university setting. In the UK, the first formal creative writing program was established as a [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts degree]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1970 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|title=Creative Writing - UEA|author=|date=|website=www.uea.ac.uk|access-date=2014-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522210914/http://www.uea.ac.uk/literature/creative-writing|archive-date=2014-05-22|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the novelists [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Angus Wilson]]. With the beginning of formal creative writing programs:
{{cquote|For the first time in the sad and enchanting history of literature, for the first time in the glorious and dreadful history of the world, the writer was welcome in the academic place. If the mind could be honored there, why not the imagination?&lt;ref name="Engle"&gt;Engle, Paul. "The Writer and the Place." In ''A Community of Writers: Paul Engle and the Iowa Writers' Workshop,'' edited by Robert Dana, 2(Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Programs of study===
Creative Writing programs are typically available to writers from the high school level all the way through graduate school/university and adult education. Traditionally these programs are associated with the English departments in the respective schools, but this notion has been challenged in recent time as more creative writing programs have spun off into their own department. Most Creative Writing degrees for undergraduates in college are [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degrees (BFA).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Some continue to pursue a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Creative Writing, the terminal degree in the field. At one time rare, [[PhD.]] programs are becoming more prevalent in the field, as more writers attempt to bridge the gap between academic study and artistic pursuit.

Creative writers typically decide an emphasis in either fiction or poetry, and they usually start with short stories or simple poems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} They then make a schedule based on this emphasis including literature classes, education classes and workshop classes to strengthen their skills and techniques. Though they have their own programs of study in the fields of [[film]] and [[theatre]], [[screenwriting]] and playwriting have become more popular in creative writing programs, as creative writing programs attempt to work more closely with film and theatre programs as well as English programs. Creative writing students are encouraged to get involved in extracurricular writing-based activities, such as publishing clubs, school-based literary magazines or newspapers, writing contests, writing colonies or conventions, and extended education classes.

== In the classroom ==
Creative writing is usually taught in a [[workshop]] format rather than [[seminar]] style. In workshops students usually submit original work for peer critique. Students also format a writing method through the process of writing and re-writing. Some courses teach the means to exploit or access latent creativity or more technical issues such as [[editing]], [[Narrative structure|structural]] [[literary technique|techniques]], [[genre]]s, random [[plot generator|idea generating]] or unblocking [[writer's block]] . Some noted [[author]]s, such as [[Michael Chabon]], [[Kazuo Ishiguro]], [[Kevin Brockmeier]], [[Ian McEwan]], [[Karl Kirchwey]],&lt;ref name=twsOctBeqqq&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rose Tremain]] and reputed screenwriters, such as [[David Benioff]], [[Darren Star]] and [[Peter Farrelly]], have graduated from university creative writing programs.

===Controversy in academia===
Creative writing is considered by some academics (mostly in the USA) to be an extension of the [[English studies|English]] discipline, even though it is taught around the world in many languages. The English discipline is traditionally seen as the critical study of literary forms, not the creation of literary forms. Some academics see creative writing as a challenge to this tradition. In the UK and Australia, as well as increasingly in the USA and the rest of the world, creative writing is considered a discipline in its own right, not an offshoot of any other discipline.
{{cquote|To say that the creative has no part in education is to argue that a university is not universal.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Paul. "The Writer and the Place," 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Those who support creative writing programs either as part or separate from the English discipline, argue for the academic worth of the creative writing experience. They argue that creative writing hones the students’ abilities to clearly express their thoughts and that creative writing entails an in-depth study of literary terms and mechanisms so they can be applied to the writer’s own work to foster improvement. These critical analysis skills are further used in other literary study outside the creative writing sphere. Indeed, the process of creative writing, the crafting of a thought-out and original piece, is considered by some to be experience in creative [[problem solving]].

Despite the large number of academic creative writing programs throughout the world, many people argue that creative writing cannot be taught.  [[Louis Menand]] explores the issue in an article for the New Yorker in which he quotes [[Kay Boyle]], the director of creative writing program at San Francisco State for sixteen years, who said, “all creative-writing programs ought to be abolished by law.” &lt;ref&gt;"Show or Tell - Should Creative Writing be Taught?" by Louis Menand - The New Yorker, June 8, 2009, [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand Newyorker.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830182154/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/06/08/090608crat_atlarge_menand |date=2009-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary discussions of creative writing at the university level vary widely; some people value MFA programs and regard them with great respect, whereas many MFA candidates and hopefuls lament their chosen programs' lack of both diversity and genre awareness.

[[File:Johannes Weyer.JPG|thumb|right|Engraving of [[Johann Weyer]] by [[Pieter Holsteyn II]] from 1660]]

'''''De praestigiis daemonum''''', translated as '''''On the Tricks of Demons''''',&lt;ref name=pav&gt;{{cite book|last=Pavlac|first=Brian|year=2009|page=60|title=Witch Hunts in the Western World: Persecution and Punishment from the ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book that was a best seller&lt;ref name=pav /&gt; by [[Doctor of Medicine|medical doctor]] [[Johann Weyer]], also known as Wier, first published in [[Basel]] in 1563.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mora|first=George|date= November 1963|title=On the 400th anniversary of Johann Weyer's "De praestigiis daemonum"--Its significance for today's psychiatry|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|volume=120|issue=5|pages=417–428|doi=10.1176/ajp.120.5.417|pmid=14051232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Johann Weyer]], ''De Praestigiis daemonum'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=TgQ6AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22De+praestigiis+daemonum%22&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false (Basel: Oporinus, 1563)]&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that [[witchcraft]] does not exist and that those who claim that practice it are suffering from delusions, which should be treated as mental illnesses, rather than punished as witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Clark, ''Thinking with demons: the idea of witchcraft in early modern Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-19-820808-1}}), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8a758cCSKY0C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=%22De+praestigiis+daemonum%22+weyer&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22De%20praestigiis%20daemonum%22%20weyer&amp;f=false 198 - 202]&lt;/ref&gt; It was influential in the abolishment of [[witchcraft trials]] in the Netherlands.

== Synopsis ==
Weyer disagreed with certain contemporaries about the justification of [[witch-hunt]]ing. Weyer believed that most, probably all, cases of alleged witchcraft resulted from delusions of the alleged witch, rather than actual, voluntary cooperation with spiritual evil. In brief, Weyer claimed that cases of alleged witchcraft were psychological rather than supernatural in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Clark, ''Thinking with demons: the idea of witchcraft in early modern Europe'' (Oxford University Press, 1999; {{ISBN|0-19-820808-1}}), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8a758cCSKY0C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;dq=%22De+praestigiis+daemonum%22+weyer&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22De%20praestigiis%20daemonum%22%20weyer&amp;f=false 198 - 202]&lt;/ref&gt;\

The book contains a famous appendix also circulated independently as the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'', a listing of the names and titles of infernal spirits, and the powers alleged to be wielded by each of them.  Weyer relates that his source for this intelligence was a book called ''Liber officiorum spirituum, seu liber dictus Empto Salomonis, de principibus et regibus demoniorum'' ("The book of the offices of spirits, or the book called Empto, by Solomon, about the princes and kings of demons).&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph H. Peterson]], ''The lesser key of Solomon: lemegeton clavicula Salomonis'' (Weiser, 2001; {{ISBN|1-57863-220-X}}), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfIrE3QtmFEC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22Pseudomonarchia+daemonum%22&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pseudomonarchia%20daemonum%22&amp;f=false xiii - xiv]&lt;/ref&gt; Weyer's reason for presenting this material was not to instruct his readers in diabolism, but rather to "expose to all men" the pretensions of those who claimed to be able to work magic, men who "are not embarrassed to boast that they are mages, and their oddness, deceptions, vanity, folly, fakery, madness, absence of mind, and obvious lies, to put their hallucinations into the bright light of day."&lt;ref&gt;''qui se magos jactitare non erubescunt, curiositas, præstigiæ, vanitas, dolus, imposturæ, deliria, mens elusa, &amp; manifesta mendacia, quinimo non ferendæ blasphemiæ, omnium mortalium, qui in mediæ lucis splendore hallucinari nolint....''&lt;/ref&gt; Weyer's source claimed that [[Hell]] arranged itself hierarchically in an infernal court which is divided into princes, ministries and ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Johann Weyer, ''[http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/weyer.htm Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]'', ed. by Joseph H. Peterson&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception and Legacy ===
''De Praestigiis'' has been translated into English, French, and German; it was one of the principal sources of [[Reginald Scot]]'s sceptical account of witchcraft, ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, supra&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deterritorialization''' ({{lang-fr|déterritorialisation}}) is a [[concept]] created by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972). The term "deterritorialization" first occurs in French [[psychoanalytic]] theory to refer, broadly, to the fluid, dissipated and schizophrenic nature of human subjectivity in contemporary capitalist cultures ([[Deleuze]] &amp; [[Guattari]] 1972).

Its most common use, however, has been in relation to the process of [[cultural globalization]]. Though there are different inflections involved, the general implication that [[globalization]] needs to be understood in cultural-spatial terms as much as in institutional or political-economic ones is common to all accounts&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 &lt;/ref&gt;. In this broad sense, deterritorialization has affinities with the idea of the "disembedding" of social relations in, for example, [[Anthony Giddens]]'s (1990) analysis of the globalizing properties of [[modernity]].

==Overview==
''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) distinguishes between  [[wikt:relative|relative]] and an [[wikt:absolute|absolute]] deterritorialization. Relative deterritorialization is always accompanied by reterritorialization, while positive absolute deterritorialization is more akin to the construction of a "[[plane of immanence]]", akin to [[Spinoza]]'s [[ontological]] constitution of the world.{{Ref|Negri}} There is also a negative sort of absolute deterritorialization, for example in the [[subjectivation]] process (''the face''). 

The function of deterritorialization is defined as "the movement by which one leaves a territory", also known as a "line of flight"&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;. Still, deterritorialization "constitutes and extends" the territory itself&lt;ref&gt;Papastergiadis, N., 2018. The turbulence of migration: Globalization, deterritorialization and hybridity. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In anthropology==
When referring to culture, anthropologists use the term '''deterritorialized''' to refer to a weakening of ties between culture and place. This means the removal of cultural subjects and objects from a certain location in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,{{cite book|last1=Roy|first1=Olivier|title=Holy Ignorance:  When Religion and Culture Part Ways|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-932802-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies that certain cultural aspects tend to transcend specific territorial boundaries in a world that consists of things fundamentally in motion.

==In the context of cultural globalization==
In the context of [[cultural globalization]], some{{Weasel inline|date=September 2016}} argue deterritorialization is a cultural feature developed by the "[[mediatization]], migration, and [[commodification]] which characterize globalized [[modernity]]". This implies that by people working towards closer involvement with the whole of the world, and works towards lessening the gap with one another, one may be widening the gap with what is physically close to them.

According to the works of [[Arjun Appadurai]], this cultural distancing from the locality, is intensified when people are able to expand and alter their imagination through the mediatization of alien cultural conditions, making this culture of remote origin one of a familiar material. This makes it difficult for a local entity to sustain and retain its own local cultural identity, which also affects the national identity of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, G. M. (2002). ''The deterritorialization of cultural heritage'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun. (1990). ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Appadurai's 1990 essay "Disjuncture and Difference": "Deterritorialization, in general, is one of the central forces of the modern world because it brings laboring populations in to the lower-class sectors and spaces of relatively wealthy societies, while sometimes creating exaggerated and intensified senses of criticism or attachment to politics in the home state. Deterritorialization, whether of Hindus, Sikhs, Palestinians, or Ukrainians, is now at the core of a variety of global [[fundamentalism]]s, including [[Islamic]] and [[Hindu]] fundamentalism. In the Hindu case, for example, it is clear that the overseas movement of Indians has been exploited by a variety of interests both within and outside India to create a complicated network of finances and religious identifications, by which the problem of cultural reproduction for Hindus abroad has become tied to the politics of Hindu fundamentalism at home.

At the same time, deterritorialization creates new markets for film companies, art impressions, and travel agencies, which thrive on the end of the deterritorialized population for contact with its homeland. Naturally, these invented homelands, which constitute the [[mediascape]]s of deterritorialized groups, can often become sufficiently fantastic and one-sided that they provide the material for new ideoscapes in which ethnic conflicts can begin to erupt."  (Appadurai 1990:11–12)

===Deterritorialization and reterritorialization===
Deterritorialization and [[reterritorialization]] exist simultaneously. In [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]]'s follow-up to [[Anti-Oedipus]], [[A Thousand Plateaus]], they distinguish between relative deterritorialization, which is always accompanied by reterritorialization, and absolute deterritorialization, which gives rise to a plane of immanence. In both forms of deterritorialization, however, the idea of physical territory remains just that, an idea and reference point.

Mediatization works as a preferential source of deterritorialization, while it becomes a catalyser of other sources of deterritorialization (migrations, tourism, vast shopping centres, and economical transformations). As [[Tomlinson]] points out,&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, J. (1999): Globalization and Culture, Chicago. University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mediatization is absolutely omnipresent in everyday contemporary cultural experiences, it therefore appears as clearly decisive in deterritorialized cultural experience. The aforementioned experience implies opening up to the world and amplifying cultural horizons through the globalized mass media. This means that globalization transforms the relation between the places where we live and our cultural activities, experiences and identities. Paradoxically, deterritorialization also includes reterritorialized manifestations, which García Canclini defines as "certain relative, partial territorial relocalizations of old and new symbolic productions".&lt;ref&gt;García Canclini, N. (1990): Culturas híbridas: estrategias para entrar y salir de la modernidad, Mexico. Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes/Grijalbo.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the concept of glocalization proposed by Robertson, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute both sides of the same coin of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, R. (1992): Globalization: Social Theory and Global Culture, London. Sage. – (2000): "Globalización: tiempo-espacio y homogeneidad-heterogeneidad", Zona Abierta, 92/93, pp. 213-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Deterritorialization speaks of the loss of the "natural" relation between culture and the social and geographic territories, and describes a deep transformation of the link between our everyday cultural experiences and our configuration as preferably local beings. As [[Giddens]] argues, "the very tissue of spatial experience alters, conjoining proximity and distance in ways that have few close parallels in prior ages". Nevertheless, it is very important not to interpret the deterritorialization of localized cultural experiences as an impoverishment of cultural interaction, but as a transformation produced by the impact the growing cultural transnational connections have on the local realm, which means that deterritorialization generates a [[relativization]] and a transformation of local cultural experiences, whether it is from the local event itself or by the projection of symbolical shapes from the local event.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1990) The Consequences of Modernity, Cambridge. Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement===
Although the process of across-boundaries flow was imbalanced, it cannot be denied that it has profound influence on politics, economics, and culture from every dimension. Although there were imbalanced power presences in different nations, it is undeniable that people will gradually realize that in addition to their own lives around are mutually implicated in the distant shore, but also to reconcile the impact between their lives around and the distant side. That is, the flow process of beyond the boundaries not only the representatives of strengthening interdependence, but also representatives that they both have the cognitive of [[globalization]]. It formed an easily comprehensive characteristics about "superterritorial" and "transworld". In other words, the original divide in the territorial boundaries between them have lost some authority, what is the main phenomenon of deterritorialization.&lt;ref&gt;Scholte, Jan Aart. 2005. Globalization: A Critical Introduction. Basingstoke/New York: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, no matter from what angle to explore globalization, deterritorialization has been a general consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Larner, Wendy and William Walters. 2004. "Globalization as Governmentality," Alternatives. Vol.29, pp. 495-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "deterritorialization" may have different meanings. [[Tomlinson]] had pointed out that many scholars use the vocabulary of deterritorialization to explain the process of globalization, however, there are still some scholars who prefer the use of related words, such as "[[delocalization]]" or "[[Forced migration|displacement]]".&lt;ref&gt;John Tomlinson. 1999. Globalization and Culture. pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized different point in the use of different terms, but basically we can understand the meaning of these words that is to understand the transformation between local and cultures of the global modernity. In the text of Tomlinson, however, we found that he uses "deterritorialization" to explain the phenomenon instead of using "delocalization". But we can unearth that "deterritorialization" was more focused on liberating the people from the "local", is a process which no longer just only affected by neighborhood and familiar local, but also deeply influenced by the distant place.

As sociologist [[Anthony Giddens]] indicated, the most immediate experience of global modernity, in fact, is we stay in our own familiar environment but feel the feeling of living in different places because of globalization. Say in other words, the local has hardly affected by the distance place, however, under the impact of globalization, distant events made its influence reach into your daily life in the environment, which is the concept of "displacement". Due to the space experiences which were combined with neighboring and distant in people's daily life, it can be said that globalization has fundamentally changed our concept of the space.

===Disjunctive relationships===
However, communication technology may act not only to fill the field of local cultural significance and identity which corroded by deterritorialization, but also to establish global cultural politics. Politics of deterritorialization and the displacement of [[sociological]] will lead the struggle between state and nation.  One important new feature of global cultural politics, tied to the [[disjunctive population|disjunctive]] relationships among the various landscapes which proposed by Appadurai, is that state and nation are at each other's throats, and the hyphen that links them is now less an icon of conjuncture than an index of disjuncture.

[[File:Ming Dynasty empress attire.jpg|thumb|170px|Diyi (翟衣) worn with fengguan ([[phoenix crown]])]]
'''Huidi-yi''' (褘翟衣) is the historical Chinese attire worn by empresses and crown princesses (wife of crown prince) in the [[Ming Dynasty]]. It is a formal wear meant only for ceremonial purposes. It is a form of [[shenyi]], and is embroidered with long-tail pheasants (翟, ''Di'') and circular flowers (小輪花). It is worn with [[phoenix crown]] (without the dangling string of pearls by the sides). Diyi has been worn by empresses and other royal noblewomen (differs according to different dynasties) since the [[Zhou Dynasty]] under various names like huiyi (褘衣) in [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] and [[Song Dynasty]], and miaofu (庙服) in [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xici.net/b723831/d43171792.htm 历代皇后最典型的翟衣] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716121208/http://www.xici.net/b723831/d43171792.htm |date=2011-07-16 }}, XICI.net, Retrieved 2009-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean Version==
2 variations of the diyi had been developed in Korea during the [[Joseon Dynasty]], &amp; later in the [[Korean Empire]]. The developments were as follows:
* During the Joseon Dynasty, the diyi was known as "''Chijeok-ui''" (雉翟衣 치적의), and is characterized as a predominant red outfit with a similarity to the ''wonsam''.
* During the Korean Empire, the ''chijeok-ui'' was later changed into the (original) blue with red trim similar to its Chinese model.

Diyi were worn by:
* Princesses Consort on their marriage to the Crown Prince and on major ceremonies (大禮服 대례복 ''daeryebok'').
* Queens Consort on their coronation ceremony and on major ceremonies (大禮服 대례복 ''daeryebok'').
* The King's subsequent Queens Consort&lt;ref&gt;In the event that the first Queen Consort had died.&lt;/ref&gt; on their marriage to the King.

'''Domestic noir''' is a literary [[subgenre]] within [[crime fiction]]. Though used earlier in discussion of the [[film noir]] subgenre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mardecortesbaja.com/2007/10/14/what-is-domestic-noir/|title=WHAT IS DOMESTIC NOIR?|date=14 October 2007|website=mardecortesbaja.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term was applied to fiction in 2013 by the novelist [[Julia Crouch]], who has been described by the crime writer, [[Elizabeth Haynes (crime writer)|Elizabeth Haynes]], as "the queen of domestic noir".&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://awaines.blogspot.com/2014/08/suburban-domestic-and-chick-noir-new.html|title=AJ Waines' Blog: Suburban, Domestic and Chick-Noir - New Genres in Psychological Thrillers|first=Aj|last=Waines|date=19 August 2014|website=awaines.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crouch defined the subgenre in her blog:

{{quotation|In a nutshell, Domestic Noir takes place primarily in homes and workplaces, concerns itself largely (but not exclusively) with the female experience, is based around relationships and takes as its base a broadly feminist view that the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] is a challenging and sometimes dangerous prospect for its inhabitants. That’s pretty much all of my work described there.&lt;ref name="Genre Bender"&gt;[http://juliacrouch.co.uk/blog/genre-bender Julia Crouch, ‘Genre Bender’, Julia Crouch's blog, 25 August 2012],&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crouch's novels, ''Cuckoo'', ''The Long Fall'', ''Tarnished'' and ''Every Vow You Break'', had previously been categorized as [[psychological thriller]]s, a label she felt inadequate: 'The engine driving my work is more an unravelling than the high octane roller coaster suggested by the word 'thriller'.'&lt;ref name="Genre Bender"/&gt;

The term was embraced by fellow novelists, including Rebecca Whitney in an article in the [[Independent newspaper]],&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/domestic-noir-is-bigger-than-ever-top-ten-releases-for-2015-9975488.html Rebecca Whitney, ''‘Domestic Noir is bigger than ever’'', The Independent, 13 January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; where she describes her own subject as 'the toxic marriage and its fall-out.' Whitney quotes Sophie Orme, Senior Editor at Mantle, on the appeal of Domestic Noir:

{{quotation|'Readers have a constant thirst for dark realism in novels; for books in which they can identify with the principal characters yet find themselves taken out of their day to day experiences. Marriage seems to me to be the ultimate setting to explore here – the culmination of a journey of love, a partnership, a relationship in which a couple places themselves in one another's hands entirely, where really the stakes could not be higher.’&lt;ref name="Whitney"/&gt;}}

Another crime novelist, A.J.Waines, describes domestic noir in her blog:

{{quotation|'The Family...is a cauldron for crime, bringing with it abductions, incarcerations, issues with infertility, infidelity and missing children. The home is rife with buried family secrets that come back to haunt us. This subgenre plays on the idea that the home is the safest place to be – OR IS IT..?' &lt;ref name="Waines"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://awaines.blogspot.com/2014/08/suburban-domestic-and-chick-noir-new.html|title=AJ Waines' Blog: Suburban, Domestic and Chick-Noir - New Genres in Psychological Thrillers|first=Aj|last=Waines|date=19 August 2014|website=awaines.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The subgenre has also been labelled 'chick noir', though the novelist Luana Lewis has written that this term was 'viewed as offensive and degrading by many....The word “chick” inevitably implies female; or synonym for ‘not to be taken seriously'.'&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;[http://londonwritersclub.com/2014/06/trends-in-crime-fiction-from-psychological-thrillers-to-domestic-noir/ Luana Lewis, London Writers' Club website, 27 June 2014],&lt;/ref&gt;

Other women writing domestic noir include [[Erin Kelly (author)|Erin Kelly]], Araminta Hall, Paula Hawkins, [[Gillian Flynn]], [[Elizabeth Haynes (crime writer)|Elizabeth Haynes]], Sabine Durrant, Natalie Young, Louise Millar, [[Paula Daly]], Samantha Hayes, [[Louise Doughty]], [[Julie Myerson]], [[Jean Hanff Korelitz]], [[A. S. A. Harrison]] and [[Lionel Shriver]]. There are also male writers of the subgenre, such as S. J. Watson and Tom Vowler.

An '''ethnic group''' or an '''ethnicity''' is a category of people who [[identity (social science)|identify]] with each other based on similarities such as common [[ancestry]], [[language]], history, [[society]], [[culture]] or [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ethnicity: definition of ethnicity |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnicity?q=ethnicity |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Humanity: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology |last=People |first=James |first2=Garrick |last2=Bailey |year=2010 |edition=9th |page=389 |publisher=Wadsworth Cengage learning |quote="In essence, an ethnic group is a named social category of people based on perceptions of shared social experience or one's ancestors' experiences. Members of the ethnic group see themselves as sharing cultural traditions and history that distinguish them from other groups. Ethnic group identity has a strong psychological or emotional component that divides the people of the world into opposing categories of “us” and “them.” In contrast to social stratification, which divides and unifies people along a series of horizontal axes on the basis of socioeconomic factors, ethnic identities divide and unify people along a series of vertical axes. Thus, ethnic groups, at least theoretically, cut across socioeconomic class differences, drawing members from all strata of the population."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives. Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared [[cultural heritage]], [[ancestor|ancestry]], [[origin myth]], [[history]], [[homeland]], [[language]] or [[dialect]], symbolic systems such as [[religion]], [[mythology]] and [[ritual]], [[cuisine]], dressing style, [[art]] or [[human physical appearance|physical appearance]].

Ethnic groups, derived from the same historical [[founder effect|founder population]], often continue to speak [[language family|related languages]] and share a similar [[gene pool]]. By way of [[language shift]], [[acculturation]], [[adoption]] and [[religious conversion]], it is sometimes possible for individuals or groups to [[passing (sociology)|leave one ethnic group and become part of another]] (except for ethnic groups emphasizing [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneity]]
or [[racial hygiene|racial purity]] as a key membership criterion).

Ethnicity is often used synonymously with terms such as [[nation]] or [[people]]. In English, it can also have the connotation of [[exoticism|something exotic]] (cf. "ethnic restaurant", etc.), generally related to cultures of more recent immigrants, who arrived after the dominant population of an area was established.

The largest ethnic groups in modern times comprise hundreds of millions of individuals ([[Han Chinese]] being the largest), while the smallest are limited to a few dozen individuals (numerous [[indigenous peoples]] worldwide). Larger ethnic groups may be subdivided into smaller sub-groups known variously as [[tribe]]s or [[clans]], which over time may become separate ethnic groups themselves due to [[endogamy]] or [[Geographical segregation|physical isolation]] from the parent group. Conversely, formerly separate ethnicities can merge to form a [[pan-ethnicity]], and may eventually [[Melting pot|merge into one single ethnicity]]. Whether through division or amalgamation, the formation of a separate ethnic identity is referred to as [[ethnogenesis]].

==Terminology==
[[File:Nileshwar 22.jpg|thumb|Ethnic [[sari]]s in [[Kerala]]]]
The term ''[[wikt:ethnic|ethnic]]'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word [[wikt:ἔθνος|ἔθνος]] ''ethnos''  (more precisely, from the adjective ἐθνικός ''ethnikos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29qniko%2Fs ἐθνικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which was loaned into [[Latin]] as ''ethnicus''). The inherited English language term for this concept is ''[[People|folk]]'', used alongside the latinate ''[[wikt:people|people]]'' since the [[late Middle English]] period.

In [[Early Modern English]] and until the mid-19th century, ''ethnic'' was used to mean [[wikt:heathen|heathen]] or [[wikt:pagan|pagan]] (in the sense of disparate "nations" which did not yet participate in the [[Christendom|Christian]] [[oikumene]]), as the [[Septuagint]] used ''ta ethne'' ("the nations") to translate the Hebrew ''[[goyim]]'' "the nations, non-Hebrews, non-Jews".&lt;ref&gt;ThiE. Tonkin, M. McDonald and M. Chapman, ''History and Ethnicity'' (London 1989), pp.{{nbsp}}11–17 (quoted in J. Hutchinson &amp; A.D. Smith (eds.), ''Oxford readers: Ethnicity'' (Oxford 1996), pp.{{nbsp}}18–24)&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek term in  [[Archaic Greece|early antiquity]] ([[Homeric Greek]]) could refer to any large group, a ''host'' of men, a ''band'' of comrades as well as a ''swarm'' or ''flock'' of animals. In [[Classical Greek]], the term took on a meaning comparable to the concept now expressed by "ethnic group", mostly translated as "[[:wikt:nation|nation]], people"; only in [[Hellenistic Greek]] did the term tend to become further narrowed to refer to "foreign" or "[[barbarians|barbarous]]" nations in particular (whence the later meaning "heathen, pagan").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fqnos ἔθνος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the term came to be used in the sense of "peculiar to a race, people or nation", in a return to the original Greek meaning.  The sense of "different cultural groups", and in American English "racial, cultural or national minority group" arises in the 1930s to 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second edition, online version as of 2008-01-12, "ethnic, a. and n.". Cites Sir [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]], ''The archæology and prehistoric annals of Scotland 1851'' (1863) and  [[Julian Sorell Huxley|Huxley]] &amp; [[Alfred Cort Haddon|Haddon]] (1935), ''We Europeans'', pp. 136,181&lt;/ref&gt; serving as a replacement of the term [[race (human classification)|race]] which had earlier taken this sense but was now becoming deprecated due to its association with ideological [[racism]]. 
The abstract ''ethnicity'' had been used for "paganism" in the 18th century, but now came to express the meaning of an "ethnic character" (first recorded 1953).
The term ''ethnic group'' was first recorded in 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Ronald. (1978) "Ethnicity: Problem and Focus in Anthropology", ''Annu. Rev. Anthropol.'' 1978. 7:379-403; Glazer, Nathan and [[Daniel P. Moynihan]] (1975) ''Ethnicity{{nbsp}}– Theory and Experience'', Cambridge, Massachusetts [[Harvard University Press]].
The modern usage definition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is:
{{quote|
''a[djective]''
:...
:2.a. Pertaining to race; peculiar to a race or nation; ethnological. Also, pertaining to or having common racial, cultural, religious, or linguistic characteristics, esp. designating a racial or other group within a larger system; hence (U.S. colloq.), foreign, exotic.
:b ''ethnic minority (group)'', a group of people differentiated from the rest of the community by racial origins or cultural background, and usu. claiming or enjoying official recognition of their group identity. Also ''attrib''.
''n[oun]''
:...
:3 A member of an ethnic group or minority. ''Equatorians''}}
(Oxford English Dictionary Second edition, online version as of 2008-01-12, s.v. "ethnic, a. and n.")
&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the context that is used, the term [[nationality]] may either be used synonymously with ethnicity, or synonymously with [[citizenship]] (in a sovereign state). The process that results in the emergence of an ethnicity is called [[ethnogenesis]], a term in use in [[ethnology|ethnological]] literature since about 1950.

Depending on which source of [[group identity]] is emphasized to define membership, the following types of (often mutually overlapping) groups can be identified:
* [[Ethnolinguistic group|Ethno-linguistic]], emphasizing shared [[language]], [[dialect]] (and possibly [[Writing system|script)]]{{nbsp}}– example: [[French Canadians]]
* [[Nation state|Ethno-national]], emphasizing a shared [[polity]] or sense of [[national identity]]{{nbsp}}– example: [[Armenians]]
* [[Racial group|Ethno-racial]], emphasizing shared physical appearance based on genetic origins{{nbsp}}– example: [[African Americans]]
* [[Regionalism (politics)|Ethno-regional]], emphasizing a distinct local sense of belonging stemming from relative geographic isolation{{nbsp}}– example: [[South Island nationalism|South Islanders]]
* [[Ethnoreligious group|Ethno-religious]], emphasizing shared affiliation with a particular religion, denomination or sect{{nbsp}}– example: [[Jews]]

In many cases – for instance, the sense of [[Jewish peoplehood]]{{nbsp}}– more than one aspect determines membership.

==Definitions and conceptual history==
[[Greco-Roman ethnography|Ethnography]] begins in [[classical antiquity]]; after early authors like [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], [[Herodotus]] in c. 480 BC laid the foundation of both [[historiography]] and [[ethnography]] of the ancient world. The Greeks at this time did not describe foreign nations but had also developed a concept of their own "ethnicity", which they grouped under the name of [[Hellenes]]. Herodotus (8.144.2) gave a famous account of what defined Greek (Hellenic) ethnic identity in his day, enumerating
# shared [[kinship and descent|descent]] (ὅμαιμον - ''homaimon'', "of the same blood"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%28%2Fmaimos ὅμαιμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;
# shared [[language]] (ὁμόγλωσσον - ''homoglōsson'', "speaking the same language")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%28mo%2Fglwssos ὁμόγλωσσος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

Sluiter (eds.), ''Valuing others in Classical Antiquity'' (LEiden: Brill, 2010), 43-70.&lt;/ref&gt;
# shared [[Mores|customs]] (Greek: ἤθεα ὁμότροπα - ''ēthea homotropa'', "customs of like fashion").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%28mo%2Ftropos ὁμότροπος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 8.144.2: ''"The kinship of all Greeks in blood and speech, and the shrines of gods and the sacrifices that we have in common, and the likeness of our way of life."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Athena S. Leoussi, Steven Grosby, ''Nationalism and Ethnosymbolism: History, Culture and Ethnicity in the Formation of Nations'', Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether ethnicity qualifies as a [[cultural universal]] is to some extent dependent on the exact definition used. According to "Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, politics, and reality", in Challenges of Measuring an Ethnic World: Science, Politics and Reality : Proceedings of the Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, April 1–3, 1992, Joint Canada-United States Conference on the Measurement of Ethnicity, Department of Commerce, Statistics Canada, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/81217/publication.html|title=Challenges of measuring an ethnic world|website=Publications.gc.ca|publisher=The Government of Canada|quote=Ethnicity is a fundamental factor in human life: it is a phenomenon inherent in human experience|date=April 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; a conference organised by [[Statistics Canada]] and the [[United States Census Bureau]] (April 1–3, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.ca/english/concepts/definitions/e-race.htm Statistics Canada]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many social scientists, such as [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Fredrik Barth]] and [[Eric Wolf]], do not consider ethnic identity to be universal. They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.&lt;ref name="FredrikBarth" /&gt;{{irrelevant citation|date=July 2017|reason=this book has only 153 pages... and the topic is quite different.}}

According to [[Thomas Hylland Eriksen]], the study of ethnicity was dominated by two distinct debates until recently.
* One is between "[[primordialism]]" and "[[instrumentalism]]". In the [[primordialism|primordialist]] view, the participant perceives ethnic ties collectively, as an externally given, even coercive, social bond.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Clifford, ed. (1967) ''Old Societies and New States: The Quest for Modernity in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]]''. New York: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] approach, on the other hand, treats ethnicity primarily as an ad-hoc element of a political strategy, used as a resource for interest groups for achieving secondary goals such as, for instance, an increase in wealth, power, or status.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Abner (1969) ''Custom and Politics in Urban Africa: A Study of Hausa Migrants in a Yoruba Town.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abner Cohen (1974) ''Two-Dimensional Man: An essay on power and symbolism in complex society''. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is still an important point of reference in [[Political science]], although most scholars' approaches fall between the two poles.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hutchinson &amp; A.D. Smith (eds.), ''Oxford readers: Ethnicity'' (Oxford 1996), "Introduction", 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second debate is between "[[constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]]" and "[[essentialism]]". Constructivists view national and ethnic identities as the product of historical forces, often recent, even when the identities are presented as old.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1983) ''Nations and Nationalism''. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Gellner (1997) Nationalism. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentialists view such identities as [[ontological]] categories defining social actors, and not the result of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Anthony D. (1986) ''The Ethnic Origins of Nations.'' Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Smith (1991) ''[[National Identity]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Hylland Eriksen|Eriksen]], these debates have been superseded, especially in [[anthropology]], by scholars' attempts to respond to increasingly politicised forms of self-representation by members of different ethnic groups and nations. This is in the context of debates over multiculturalism in countries, such as the United States and Canada, which have large immigrant populations from many different cultures, and post-colonialism in the [[Caribbean]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;T.H. Eriksen "Ethnic identity, national identity and intergroup conflict: The significance of personal experiences" in Ashmore, Jussim, Wilder (eds.): ''Social identity, intergroup conflict, and conflict reduction'', pp. 42–70. Oxford: Oxford University Press'. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]]  maintained that ethnic groups were ''künstlich'' (artificial, i.e. a [[social construct]]) because they were based on a subjective belief in shared ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (community). Secondly, this belief in shared Gemeinschaft did not create the group; the group created the belief. Third, group formation resulted from the drive to monopolise power and status. This was contrary to the prevailing naturalist belief of the time, which held that socio-cultural and behavioral differences between peoples stemmed from inherited traits and tendencies derived from common descent, then called "race".&lt;ref&gt;Banton, Michael. (2007) "Weber on Ethnic Communities: A critique", ''Nations and Nationalism 13'' (1), 2007, 19–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influential theoretician of ethnicity was [[Fredrik Barth]], whose "Ethnic Groups and Boundaries" from 1969 has been described as instrumental in spreading the usage of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt; Barth went further than Weber in stressing the constructed nature of ethnicity. To Barth, ethnicity was perpetually negotiated and renegotiated by both external ascription and internal self-identification. Barth's view is that ethnic groups are not discontinuous cultural isolates, or logical ''a prioris'' to which people naturally belong. He wanted to part with anthropological notions of cultures as bounded entities, and ethnicity as primordialist bonds, replacing it with a focus on the interface between groups. "Ethnic Groups and Boundaries", therefore, is a focus on the interconnectedness of ethnic identities. Barth writes: "...{{nbsp}}categorical ethnic distinctions do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact and information, but do entail social processes of exclusion and incorporation whereby discrete categories are maintained despite changing participation and membership in the course of individual life histories."

In 1978, anthropologist [[Ronald Cohen (anthropologist)|Ronald Cohen]] claimed that the identification of "ethnic groups" in the usage of social scientists often reflected inaccurate labels more than indigenous realities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...{{nbsp}}the named ethnic identities we accept, often unthinkingly, as basic givens in the literature are often arbitrarily, or even worse inaccurately, imposed.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this way, he pointed to the fact that identification of an ethnic group by outsiders, e.g. anthropologists, may not coincide with the self-identification of the members of that group. He also described that in the first decades of usage, the term ethnicity had often been used in lieu of older terms such as "cultural" or "tribal" when referring to smaller groups with shared cultural systems and shared heritage, but that "ethnicity" had the added value of being able to describe the commonalities between systems of group identity in both tribal and modern societies. Cohen also suggested that claims concerning "ethnic" identity (like earlier claims concerning "tribal" identity) are often colonialist practices and effects of the relations between colonized peoples and nation-states.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;Ronald Cohen 1978 "Ethnicity: Problem and Focus in Anthropology", ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 7: 383-384 Palo Alto: Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], formations of identity were often changed and distorted by colonization, but identities are not made out of nothing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[C]ategorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2015 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url= https://www.academia.edu/11768378/_Despite_the_Terrors_of_Typologies_The_Importance_of_Understanding_Categories_of_Difference_and_Identity_ | journal= Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume=  17 | issue=  2 | pages= 174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social scientists have thus focused on how, when, and why different markers of ethnic identity become salient. Thus, anthropologist Joan Vincent observed that ethnic boundaries often have a mercurial character.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Vincent 1974, "The Structure of Ethnicity" in ''Human Organization'' 33(4): 375-379&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Cohen concluded that ethnicity is "a series of nesting dichotomizations of inclusiveness and exclusiveness".&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt; He agrees with Joan Vincent's observation that (in Cohen's paraphrase) "Ethnicity{{nbsp}}... can be narrowed or broadened in boundary terms in relation to the specific needs of political mobilization.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt; This may be why descent is sometimes a marker of ethnicity, and sometimes not: which diacritic of ethnicity is salient depends on whether people are scaling ethnic boundaries up or down, and whether they are scaling them up or down depends generally on the political situation.

===Approaches to understanding ethnicity===
Different approaches to understanding ethnicity have been used by different social scientists when trying to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society. As [[Jonathan M. Hall]] observes, World War II was a turning point in the ethnic studies. The consequences of Nazi racism discouraged essentianlist interpretations of ethnic groups and race. Ethnic groups came to be defined as social rather than as biological entities. Their coherence was attributed to shared myths, descent, kinship, a common place of origin, language, religion, customs and national character. So, ethnic groups are conceived as mutable rather than stable, constructed in discursive practices rather than written in the genes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commonweb.unifr.ch/artsdean/pub/gestens/f/as/files/3610/33969_110704.pdf David Konstan, "Defining Ancient Greek Ethnicity", Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies, vol. 6, 1 (1997), pp. 97–98. Overview of J.M. Hall's book "Ethnic Identity in Greek Antiquity", Cambridge University Press, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of various approaches are: primordialism, essentialism, perennialism, constructivism, modernism and instrumentalism.
* "''Primordialism''", holds that ethnicity has existed at all times of human history and that modern ethnic groups have historical continuity into the far past. For them, the idea of ethnicity is closely linked to the idea of nations and is rooted in the pre-Weber understanding of humanity as being divided into primordially existing groups rooted by [[kinship]] and biological heritage.
** "''Essentialist primordialism''" further holds that ethnicity is an ''a priori'' fact of human existence, that ethnicity precedes any human social interaction and that it is basically unchanged by it. This theory sees ethnic groups as natural, not just as historical. It also has problems dealing with the consequences of intermarriage, migration and colonization for the composition of modern day multi-ethnic [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="smith13"&gt;{{Harv|Smith|1999|loc=p. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** "''Kinship primordialism''" holds that ethnic communities are extensions of kinship units, basically being derived by kinship or clan ties where the choices of cultural signs (language, religion, traditions) are made exactly to show this biological affinity. In this way, the myths of common biological ancestry that are a defining feature of ethnic communities are to be understood as representing actual biological history. A problem with this view on ethnicity is that it is more often than not the case that mythic origins of specific ethnic groups directly contradict the known biological history of an ethnic community.&lt;ref name="smith13" /&gt;
** "''Geertz's primordialism''", notably espoused by anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], argues that humans in general attribute an overwhelming power to primordial human "givens" such as blood ties, language, territory, and cultural differences. In Geertz' opinion, ethnicity is not in itself primordial but humans perceive it as such because it is embedded in their experience of the world.&lt;ref name="smith13" /&gt;
* "''Perennialism''", an approach that is primarily concerned with nationhood but tends to see nations and ethnic communities as basically the same phenomenon, holds that the nation, as a type of social and political organisation, is of an immemorial or "perennial" character.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1998), 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith (1999) distinguishes two variants: "continuous perennialism", which claims that particular nations have existed for very long spans of time, and "recurrent perennialism", which focuses on the emergence, dissolution and reappearance of nations as a recurring aspect of human history.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1999), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
** "''Perpetual perennialism''" holds that specific ethnic groups have existed continuously throughout history.
** "''Situational perennialism''" holds that nations and ethnic groups emerge, change and vanish through the course of history. This view holds that the concept of ethnicity is basically a tool used by political groups to manipulate resources such as wealth, power, territory or status in their particular groups' interests. Accordingly, ethnicity emerges when it is relevant as means of furthering emergent collective interests and changes according to political changes in the society. Examples of a perennialist interpretation of ethnicity are also found in Barth, and Seidner who see ethnicity as ever-changing boundaries between groups of people established through ongoing social negotiation and interaction.
** "''Instrumentalist perennialism''", while seeing ethnicity primarily as a versatile tool that identified different ethnics groups and limits through time, explains ethnicity as a mechanism of [[social stratification]], meaning that ethnicity is the basis for a hierarchical arrangement of individuals. According to Donald Noel, a sociologist who developed a theory on the origin of ethnic stratification, ethnic stratification is a "system of stratification wherein some relatively fixed group membership (e.g., race, religion, or nationality) is utilized as a major criterion for assigning social positions".&lt;ref name=Noel1968&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic stratification is one of many different types of social stratification, including stratification based on [[socio-economic status]], race, or [[gender]]. According to Donald Noel, ethnic stratification will emerge only when specific ethnic groups are brought into contact with one another, and only when those groups are characterized by a high degree of ethnocentrism, competition, and differential power. [[Ethnocentrism]] is the tendency to look at the world primarily from the perspective of one's own culture, and to downgrade all other groups outside one's own culture. Some sociologists, such as Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings, say the origin of ethnic stratification lies in individual dispositions of ethnic prejudice, which relates to the theory of ethnocentrism.&lt;ref name=Bobo1996&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing with Noel's theory, some degree of differential power must be present for the emergence of ethnic stratification. In other words, an inequality of power among ethnic groups means "they are of such unequal power that one is able to impose its will upon another".&lt;ref name=Noel1968/&gt; In addition to differential power, a degree of competition structured along ethnic lines is a prerequisite to ethnic stratification as well. The different ethnic groups must be competing for some common goal, such as power or influence, or a material interest, such as wealth or territory. Lawrence Bobo and Vincent Hutchings propose that competition is driven by self-interest and hostility, and results in inevitable stratification and [[Group conflict|conflict]].&lt;ref name=Bobo1996/&gt;
* "''Constructivism''" sees both primordialist and perennialist views as basically flawed,&lt;ref name=Bobo1996/&gt; and rejects the notion of ethnicity as a basic human condition. It holds that ethnic groups are only products of human social interaction, maintained only in so far as they are maintained as valid social constructs in societies.
** "''Modernist constructivism''" correlates the emergence of ethnicity with the movement towards [[nation state]]s beginning in the early modern period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Smith|1999|loc=pp. 4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this theory, such as [[Eric Hobsbawm]], argue that ethnicity and notions of ethnic pride, such as nationalism, are purely modern inventions, appearing only in the modern period of world history. They hold that prior to this, ethnic homogeneity was not considered an ideal or necessary factor in the forging of large-scale societies.

Ethnicity is an important means by which people may identify with a larger group. Many social scientists, such as [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Fredrik Barth]] and [[Eric Wolf]], do not consider ethnic identity to be universal.  They regard ethnicity as a product of specific kinds of inter-group interactions, rather than an essential quality inherent to human groups.&lt;ref name="FredrikBarth"&gt;Fredrik Barth, ed. 1969 ''Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Cultural Difference''; Eric Wolf 1982 ''Europe and the People Without History'' p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;
Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are called ethnogenesis. Members of an ethnic group, on the whole, claim cultural continuities over time, although [[historian]]s and [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have documented that many of the values, practices, and norms that imply continuity with the past are of relatively recent invention.&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983), ''The Invention of Tradition'', Sider 1993 ''Lumbee Indian Histories''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic groups differ from other social groups, such as [[subculture]]s, [[interest group]]s or [[social class]]es, because they emerge and change over historical periods (centuries) in a process known as ethnogenesis, a period of several generations of [[endogamy]] resulting in common ancestry (which is then sometimes cast in terms of a [[national myth|mythological]] narrative of a [[Eponymous ancestor|founding figure]]); ethnic identity is reinforced by reference to "boundary markers" - characteristics said to be unique to the group which set it apart from other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Camoroff, John L. and Jean Camoroff 2009: Ethnicity Inc..

===Ethnicity theory===
''Ethnicity theory'' says that race is a social category and is but one of several factors in determining ethnicity. Some other criteria include: "religion, language, 'customs,' nationality, and political identification".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Omi|Winant|1986|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was put forth by sociologist [[Robert E. Park]] in the 1920s. It is based on the notion of “culture”.

This theory was preceded by over a century where [[biological essentialism]] was the dominant paradigm on race. Biological essentialism is the belief that white European races are biologically superior and other non-white races are inherently inferior. This view arose as a way to justify slavery of Africans and genocide of the Native Americans in a society which was supposedly founded on freedom for all. This was a notion that developed slowly and came to be a preoccupation of scientists, theologians, and the public. Religious institutions asked questions about whether there had been multiple genesis's (polygenesis) and whether God had created lesser races of men. Many of the foremost scientists of the time took up idea of racial difference. They would inadvertently find that white Europeans were superior. One method that was used was the measurement of cranial capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Omi|Winant|1986|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnicity theory was based on the assimilation model. Park outlined his four steps to assimilation: contact, conflict, accommodation, and assimilation. Instead of explaining the marginalized status of people of color in the United States with an inherent biological inferiority, he instead said that it was a failure to assimilate into American culture that held people back. They could be equal as long as they dropped their culture which was deficient compared to white culture.

[[Michael Omi]] and [[Howard Winant]]'s theory of racial formation directly confronts both ethnicity theory's premises and practices. They argue in Racial Formation in the United States that ethnicity theory was exclusively based on the immigration patterns of a white ethnic population and did not account for the unique experiences of non-whites in this country.&lt;ref name="Omi-Winant-p17"&gt;{{harvnb|Omi|Winant|1986|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this theory identities different stages in an immigration process{{nbsp}}– contact, conflict, struggle, and as the last and best response, assimilation{{nbsp}}– it did so only for white ethnic communities.&lt;ref name="Omi-Winant-p17"/&gt; The ethnicity paradigm neglects the ways that race can complicate a community's interactions with basic social and political structures, especially upon contact.

And assimilation{{nbsp}}– shedding the particular qualities of a native culture for the purpose of blending in with a host culture{{nbsp}}– did not work for some groups as a response to racism and discrimination as it did for others.&lt;ref name="Omi-Winant-p17"/&gt; Moreover, once the legal barriers to achieving equality had been dismantled, the problem of racism became the sole responsibility of already disadvantaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Omi|Winant|1986|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was assumed that if a Black or Latino community was not 'making it' by the standards that had been set by white ethnics, it was because that community did not hold the right values or beliefs. Or they must be stubbornly resisting dominant norms because they did not want to fit in. Omi and Winant's critique of ethnicity theory explains how looking towards a cultural defect for the source of inequality ignores the "concrete sociopolitical dynamics within which racial phenomena operate in the U.S."&lt;ref name="Omi-Winant-p21"&gt;{{harvnb|Omi|Winant|1986|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, buying into this approach effectively strips us of our ability to critically examine the more structural components of racism and encourages, instead, a “benign neglect” of social inequality.&lt;ref name="Omi-Winant-p21"/&gt;

==Ethnicity and nationality==
{{Further|Nation state|minority group}}
{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}
In some cases, especially involving transnational migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is linked to nationality. Anthropologists and historians, following the modernist understanding of ethnicity as proposed by Ernest Gellner&lt;ref&gt;Gellner 2006 ''Nations and Nationalism'' Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; and Benedict Anderson&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2006 ''Imagined Communities'' Version&lt;/ref&gt; see nations and nationalism as developing with the rise of the modern state system in the 17th century. They culminated in the rise of "nation-states" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation coincided (or ideally coincided) with state boundaries.
Thus, in the West, the notion of ethnicity, like race and [[nation]], developed in the context of European colonial expansion, when [[mercantilism]] and [[capitalism]] were promoting global movements of populations at the same time that [[Sovereign state|state]] boundaries were being more clearly and rigidly defined.

In the 19th century, modern states generally sought legitimacy through their claim to represent "nations." [[Nation-state]]s, however, invariably include populations that have been excluded from national life for one reason or another. Members of excluded groups, consequently, will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or seek autonomy, sometimes even to the extent of complete political separation in their own nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Pohl, [http://www.kroraina.com/bulgar/pohl_etnicity.html "Conceptions of Ethnicity in Early Medieval Studies"], ''Debating the Middle Ages: Issues and Readings'', ed. Lester K. Little and Barbara H. Rosenwein, (Blackwell), 1998, pp{{nbsp}}13–24, notes that historians have projected the 19th-century conceptions of the nation-state backwards in time, employing biological metaphors of birth and growth: "that the peoples in the [[Migration Period]] had little to do with those heroic (or sometimes brutish) clichés is now generally accepted among historians," he remarked. Early medieval peoples were far less homogeneous than often thought, and Pohl follows Reinhard Wenskus, ''Stammesbildung und Verfassung''. (Cologne and Graz) 1961, whose researches into the "ethnogenesis" of the [[Germanic people|German]] peoples convinced him that the idea of common origin, as expressed by [[Isidore of Seville]] ''Gens est multitudo ab uno principio orta'' ("a people is a multitude stemming from one origin") which continues in the original ''Etymologiae'' IX.2.i) ''"sive ab alia natione secundum propriam collectionem distincta'' ("or distinguished from another people by its proper ties") was a myth.&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions{{nbsp}}– when people moved from one state to another,&lt;ref&gt;Aihway Ong 1996 "Cultural Citizenship in the Making" in ''Current Anthropology'' 37(5)&lt;/ref&gt; or one state conquered or colonized peoples beyond its national boundaries{{nbsp}}– ethnic groups were formed by people who identified with one nation, but lived in another state.

[[Multi-ethnic state]]s can be the result of two opposite events, either the recent creation of state borders at variance with traditional tribal territories, or the recent immigration of ethnic minorities into a former nation state.
Examples for the first case are found throughout [[Africa]], where countries created during [[decolonisation]] inherited arbitrary colonial borders, but also in European countries such as [[Belgium]] or [[United Kingdom]]. Examples for the second case are countries such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]], which were relatively ethnically homogeneous when they attained statehood but have received significant immigration during the second half of the 20th century. States such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Switzerland]] comprised distinct ethnic groups from their formation and have likewise experienced substantial immigration, resulting in what has been termed "[[multicultural]]" societies especially in large cities.

The states of the [[New World]] were multi-ethnic from the onset, as they were formed as colonies imposed on existing indigenous populations.

In recent decades feminist scholars (most notably [[Nira Yuval-Davis]])&lt;ref&gt;Nira Yuval-Davis, "Gender &amp; Nation" (London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; have drawn attention to the fundamental ways in which women participate in the creation and reproduction of ethnic and national categories. Though these categories are usually discussed as belonging to the public, political sphere, they are upheld within the private, family sphere to a great extent.&lt;ref&gt;Nira Yuval-Davis, "Gender &amp; Nation" (London: SAGE Publications Ltd, 1997) pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; It is here that women act not just as biological reproducers but also as 'cultural carriers', transmitting knowledge and enforcing behaviours that belong to a specific collectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Floya Anthias and Nira Yuval-Davis "Woman–Nation–State" (London: Macmillan, 1989), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Women also often play a significant symbolic role in conceptions of nation or ethnicity, for example in the notion that 'women and children' constitute the kernel of a nation which must be defended in times of conflict, or in iconic figures such as [[Britannia]] or [[Marianne]].

==Ethnicity and race==
[[File:Asiatiska folk, Nordisk familjebok.jpg|thumb|The racial diversity of [[Asia]]'s ethnic groups, [[Nordisk familjebok]] (1904)]]
[[Race (human categorization)|Race]] and ethnicity are considered as{{by whom|date=April 2018}} related concepts. Ethnicity is used as a matter of cultural identity of a group, often based on shared ancestry, language and cultural traditions, while race is applied as a pseudoscientific grouping, based on physical similarities within groups. Race is a more controversial subject than ethnicity, due to common political use of the term. It is assumed{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that, based on power relations, there exist "racialized ethnicities" and "ethnicized races". Ramón Grosfoguel (University of California, Berkeley) argues that 'racial/ethnic identity' is one concept and that concepts of race and ethnicity cannot be used as separate and autonomous categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Grosfoguel|first= Ramán|title= Race and Ethnicity or Racialized Ethnicities? Identities within Global Coloniality|journal= Ethnicities|date= September 2004|volume= 4|series = 315-336|issue= 3|doi= 10.1177/1468796804045237|url= http://etn.sagepub.com/content/4/3/315.short|accessdate= 2012-08-06|pages= 315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Weber (1864-1920), race and ethnicity were primarily seen as two aspects of the same thing. Around 1900 and before, the essentialist primordialist understanding of ethnicity  predominated: cultural differences between peoples were seen as being the result of inherited traits and tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Banton, Michael. (2007) "Weber on Ethnic Communities: A critique", ''Nations and Nationalism'' 13 (1), 2007, 19–35.&lt;/ref&gt; With Weber's introduction of the idea of ethnicity as a social construct, race and ethnicity became more divided from each other.

In 1950 the [[UNESCO]] statement, "[[The Race Question]]", signed by some of the internationally renowned scholars of the time (including [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Julian Huxley]], etc.), stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;"National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of 'ethnic groups'."&lt;ref&gt;A. Metraux (1950) "United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race", ''American Anthropologist'' 53(1): 142-145)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1982 anthropologist David Craig Griffith summed up forty years of ethnographic research, arguing that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic markers for different ways that people from different parts of the world have been incorporated into a global economy:
{{quote|The opposing interests that divide the working classes are further reinforced through appeals to "racial" and "ethnic" distinctions. Such appeals serve to allocate different categories of workers to rungs on the scale of labor markets, relegating stigmatized populations to the lower levels and insulating the higher echelons from competition from below. Capitalism did not create all the distinctions of ethnicity and race that function to set off categories of workers from one another. It is, nevertheless, the process of labor mobilization under capitalism that imparts to these distinctions their effective values.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, David Craig, ''Jones's minimal: low-wage labor in the United States'', State University of New York Press, Albany, 1993, p.222&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Wolf, racial categories were constructed and incorporated during the period of [[mercantilism|European mercantile expansion]], and ethnic groupings during the period of [[capitalism|capitalist expansion]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf, 1982, ''Europe and the People Without History'', Berkeley: University of California Press. 380-381&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1977 about the usage of the term "ethnic" in the ordinary language of [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]], Wallman noted that
{{quote|The term 'ethnic' popularly connotes '[race]' in Britain, only less precisely, and with a lighter value load. In North America, by contrast, '[race]' most commonly means color, and 'ethnics' are the descendants of relatively recent immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. '[Ethnic]' is not a noun in Britain. In effect there are no 'ethnics'; there are only 'ethnic relations'.&lt;ref&gt;Wallman, S. "Ethnicity research in Britain", ''Current Anthropology'', v. 18, n. 3, 1977, pp. 531–532.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the U.S., the [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] defines the concept of race as outlined for the US Census as not "scientific or anthropological" and takes into account "social and cultural characteristics as well as ancestry", using "appropriate scientific methodologies" that are not "primarily biological or genetic in reference".&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethno-national conflict==
{{Further|Ethnic conflict}}
Sometimes ethnic groups are subject to prejudicial attitudes and actions by the state or its constituents. In the 20th century, people began to argue that conflicts among ethnic groups or between members of an ethnic group and the state can and should be resolved in one of two ways. Some, like [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Bruce Barry]], have argued that the legitimacy of modern states must be based on a notion of political rights of autonomous individual subjects. According to this view, the state should not acknowledge ethnic, national or racial identity but rather instead enforce political and legal equality of all individuals. Others, like [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[Will Kymlicka]], argue that the notion of the autonomous individual is itself a cultural construct. According to this view, states must recognize ethnic identity and develop processes through which the particular needs of ethnic groups can be accommodated within the boundaries of the nation-state.

The 19th century saw the development of the political ideology of [[ethnic nationalism]], when the concept of race was tied to [[nationalism]], first by German theorists including [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]]. Instances of societies focusing on ethnic ties, arguably to the exclusion of history or historical context, have resulted in the justification of nationalist goals. Two periods frequently cited as examples of this are the 19th century consolidation and expansion of the [[German Empire]] and the 20th century [[Nazi Germany]]. Each promoted the pan-ethnic idea that these governments were only acquiring lands that had always been inhabited by ethnic Germans. The history of late-comers to the nation-state model, such as those arising in the Near East and south-eastern Europe out of the dissolution of the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, as well as those arising out of the former USSR, is marked by [[ethnic war|inter-ethnic conflicts]]. Such conflicts usually occur within multi-ethnic states, as opposed to between them, as in other regions of the world. Thus, the conflicts are often misleadingly labelled and characterized as [[civil war]]s when they are inter-ethnic conflicts in a multi-ethnic state.

==Ethnic groups by continent==

===Africa===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Africa}}
Ethnic groups in Africa number in the hundreds, each generally having its own [[Languages of Africa|language]] (or [[dialect]] of a language) and [[culture]].

Many ethnic groups and nations of [[Africa]] qualify, although some groups are of a size larger than a tribal society. These mostly originate with the [[Sahelian kingdom]]s of the medieval period, such as that of the [[Akan people|Akan]], deriving from [[Bonoman]] (11th century) then the [[Kingdom of Ashanti]] (17th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Survey of World Migration |first=Robin|last=Cohen |authorlink=Robin Cohen |year= 1995 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 0-521-44405-5 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YbzsBPuhyggC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=Akan+migration#v=onepage&amp;q=Akan%20migration&amp;f=false |quote= }} Wickens, Gerald E; Lowe, Pat (2008). {{cite book |title= The Baobabs: Pachycauls of Africa, Madagascar and Australia|year= 2008 |publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn= 978-1-4020-6431-9 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vu9ZX3NWPYIC&amp;pg=PA360&amp;lpg=PA360&amp;dq=Akan+migration+10th+century#v=onepage&amp;q=Akan%20migration%2010th%20century&amp;f=false |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Asia}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[File:Assyriankhigga.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] are the indigenous peoples of [[Northern Iraq]].]]
There is an abundance of ethnic groups throughout [[Asia]], with adaptations to the climate zones of Asia, which can be Arctic, subarctic, temperate, subtropical or tropical. The ethnic groups have adapted to mountains, deserts, grasslands, and forests.

On the coasts of Asia, the ethnic groups have adopted various methods of harvest and transport. Some groups are primarily [[hunter-gatherer]]s, some practice [[transhumance]] (nomadic lifestyle), others have been agrarian/rural for millennia and others becoming industrial/urban. Some groups/countries of Asia are completely urban (Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore). The colonization of Asia was largely ended in the 20th century, with national drives for independence and self-determination across the continent.

===Europe===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Europe}}
[[File:Olentzero, Beasain.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Basques|Basque people]] constitute an indigenous ethnic minority in both France and Spain.]]
[[File:Irish dancers in team costume, Davis Academy, USA.jpg|thumb|The Irish are an ethnic group indigenous to [[Ireland]] who total 70-80 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Scottish Diaspora and Diaspora Strategy: Insights and Lessons from Ireland |url=https://www2.gov.scot/Publications/2009/05/28141101/6 |website=www2.gov.scot |language=en-gb |date=29 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Europe]] has a large number of ethnic groups; Pan and Pfeil (2004) count 87 distinct "peoples of Europe", of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] within every state they inhabit (although they may form local regional majorities within a sub-national entity). The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Pan, Beate Sibylle Pfeil,''Minderheitenrechte in Europa. Handbuch der europäischen Volksgruppen'' (2002)., English translation 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European countries, including [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''article 8 de la [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006068624&amp;dateTexte=20080129 loi Informatique et libertés], 1978: "Il est interdit de collecter ou de traiter des données à caractère personnel qui font apparaître, directement ou indirectement, les origines raciales ou ethniques, les opinions politiques, philosophiques ou religieuses ou l'appartenance syndicale des personnes, ou qui sont relatives à la santé ou à la vie sexuelle de celles-ci."''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Switzerland]] do not collect information on the ethnicity of their resident population.

[[Russia]] has over 185 [[Ethnic groups in Russia|recognized ethnic groups]] besides the 80% [[Russians|ethnic Russian]] majority. The largest group are the [[Tatars]] 3.8%.
Many of the smaller groups are found in the Asian part of Russia (see [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia]]).

An example of a largely [[nomadic]] ethnic group in Europe is the [[Romani people|Roma]], pejoratively known as Gypsies. They originated from India and speak the [[Romani language]].

== Contemporary usage ==
[[File:'Hapa Haole' (No. 206) by Grace Hudson, 1901.jpg|thumb|''Hapa Haole'' (No. 206) by Grace Hudson, 1901]]

Contemporarily, Hapa has also come to mean a person of mixed Asian and other racial heritage.&lt;ref name="Japanese American National Museum 2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=About - hapa.me – 15 years of the hapa project |website=Japanese American National Museum |date=2018-10-28 |url=http://www.janm.org/exhibits/hapa-me/ |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kip Fulbeck"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Hapa Project |first=Kip |last=Fulbeck |website=kipfulbeck.com |url=https://kipfulbeck.com/the-hapa-project/hapa-about/ |access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical &amp; Hawaiian usage == 
In Hawaii, the term can be used in conjunction with other Hawaiian racial and ethnic descriptors to specify a particular racial or ethnic mixture.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} An example of this is ''hapa haole'' ([[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|part European/White]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Easley|1995|p=76}}: "'Hapa haole' is a commonly used phrase in Hawaii, employed by all Asian subgroups, but Hawaiian in origin. The phrase literally translates into "of part-white ancestry or origin.""&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hapa%20haole |title = Hapa Haole |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pukui states that the original meaning of the word ''haole'' was "foreigner".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Therefore, all non-Hawaiians can be called ''haole''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In practical terms, however, the term is used as a racial description for [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]s (whites), with the specific exclusion of Portuguese. Portuguese were traditionally considered to be a separate race in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Judd 1961"&gt;{{cite web |last=Judd |first=Gerrit Parmele, |title=Hawaii : an informal history |publisher=Collier-Macmillan |year=1961 |oclc=1035087443 |url=https://archive.org/details/hawaiiinformalhi00judd |access-date=2018-11-19 |page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hapa-haole'' also is the name of a type of [[Hawaiian music]] in which the tune, styling, and/or subject matter is Hawaiian, but the lyrics are partly, mostly, or entirely in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kanahele |editor1-first=George S. |editor1-link=George Kanahele |editor2-last=Berger |editor2-first=John |title = Hawaiian Music &amp; Musicians |edition=2nd |origyear=1979 |year=2012 |publisher=Mutual Publishing, LLC |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |ISBN = 9781566479677 |oclc = 808415079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''hapa-haole'' songs had their musical roots in the Western tradition, and the lyrics were in some combination of English and Hawaiian; these songs first gained popularity outside the [[Territory of Hawaii]] beginning in 1912–1915,&lt;ref name="Haas 2011 p. 152"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haas |first=Michael |title=Barack Obama, the Aloha Zen President: How a Son of the 50th State May Revitalize America Based on 12 Multicultural Principles |publisher=Praeger |year=2011 |isbn=9780313394027 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ni2wjBLn_OoC&amp;pg=PA152 |access-date=2018-11-19 |page=152 |oclc=714891924}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include titles such as "[[My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii|My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua]]" and "[[Sweet Leilani]]".&lt;ref name="Shepherd 2003 p. 450"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shepherd |first=John |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic  |volume=Volume II: Performance and Production  |year=2003 |isbn=9780826463227 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA450 |access-date=2018-11-19 |page=450 |oclc=50235133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hapa haole'' is also used for  Hawaiian-language [[hula]] songs that are partly in English, thus disqualifying them as "authentic" Hawaiian hula in some venues such as the [[Merrie Monarch Festival]].

== Controversy ==
Some see the use of the term as a misappropriation of [[Hawaiian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taniguchi|Heidenreich|2006|p=38}}: "Prominent figures in the [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]], such as the Trask sisters, have spoken out against the co-optation of the Hawaiian language by Hapa organizations and other 'inappropriate' uses of the term."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dariotis|2007}} Others take a stronger stand in discouraging its usage and misuse as they consider the term to be vulgar and racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Asakawa |first1=Gil |title = Being Japanese American |origyear=2004 |year=2015 |publisher = Stone Bridge Press |ISBN = 978-1611720228 |page = preface page 2 |edition=2nd |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w-1HCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=hapa+racist+term&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-4eXPw4M4X&amp;sig=0K7ILMXBVPr0hOP0kBxM5FkGfkM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLiN-0v8jLAhUISyYKHYawBn84FBDoAQg1MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hapa%20racist%20term&amp;f=false |accessdate = 17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term, unlike other words referring to mixed race people, is not and has never been a derogatory term when used in its original Hawaiian context, although it was later degraded by non-Hawaiians such as Japanese-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Johnson |first1 = Akemi |title = Who Gets To Be Hapa? |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/08/08/487821049/who-gets-to-be-hapa |website = npr.org |publisher = [[National Public Radio]] |accessdate = 1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wei Ming Dariotis states,  {{"'}}Hapa' was chosen because it was the only word we could find that did not really cause us pain. It is not any of the Asian words for mixed Asian people that contain negative connotations either literally (e.g. 'children of the dust', 'mixed animal') or by association (Eurasian)."{{sfn|Dariotis|2007}}
== In Popular Culture == 
In 2010, a film called [[One_Big_Hapa_Family | One Big Hapa Family]] was released about Japanese-Canadians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588374/|title= One Big Hapa Family|website=imbd.com|accessdate=13 November 2018}}

== Plot ==
Theresa "Tree" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of her classmate Carter Davis after drunken partying the previous evening. Tree ignores phone calls from her widowed father David. She dismisses Carter while leaving his room, and throws away a birthday cupcake given to her by her roommate Lori Spengler. Tree also meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot.

Tree wakes up the next morning in Carter's bed. She is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she nonetheless relives the day and uses this second chance to avoid the tunnel and reach the party. However, the masked killer follows her to the party and murders her again. Tree awakens in Carter's bed, realizes that she is in a [[time loop]] and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, however, is already hiding there and slays her a third time.

Upon waking up, Tree relays her story to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing suspected classmates and getting killed each time. After a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. Her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple traumatic injuries, indicating that she has retained physical damage from her previous deaths. Shortly after escaping from the hospital, Tree is pursued and killed again.

Waking up in Carter's bed again, Tree convinces Carter of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. Tree admits to having a tremendous case of self-loathing, particularly for pushing away her father after the death of her mother years ago. Later, Tree sees a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she ends the loop, Tree hangs herself.

Believing she has solved her murder, Tree is happier and more relaxed during the next loop. Tree ends her affair with Professor Butler. She meets her father for lunch, and the two patch things up between themselves. That night she goes to the hospital, where she traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake given to her by Lori.

Tree wakes up still in the loop; confused and angered by her predicament, she returns to her room, where Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes this was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake, dying in her sleep. Tree deduces that Lori, not Tombs, is her killer; Lori had poisoned the cupcake, which Tree declined to eat. So Lori utilized her job as a nurse at the hospital to drug and frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Tree invites Lori to eat the cupcake herself; when Lori will not, Tree proposes taking the cupcake to the police. Lori locks the door to prevent Tree from leaving, and admits to having an affair with Professor Butler herself. The jealous Lori attacks Tree, who stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth. She then kicks Lori through a window to her death.

Tree and Carter muse over the day's events in a restaurant. He offers her his room for the night, and Tree wakes up the next day believing herself to still be in the loop. Carter reveals it to be the next day at last; he was playing a prank on her. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him and the two kiss.

The film was originally titled ''Half to Death'', produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Rogue Pictures]], and directed by [[Antti Jokinen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/megan-fox-joins-half-to-death/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Megan Fox Joins Half to Death |work=Beyond Hollywood |date=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 27, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928060314/http://www.beyondhollywood.com/megan-fox-joins-half-to-death/ |archivedate=September 28, 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Landon (filmmaker)|Christopher Landon]] was hired to rewrite the [[Scott Lobdell]] screenplay, and while he liked the reworked script the studio decided to not move on with it. The project was only revived years later, as original producer Angela Mancuso had lunch with Landon and remembered about ''Half to Death''. Landon decided to send the script to [[Jason Blum]] of [[Blumhouse Productions]], with whom he had worked in the ''[[Paranormal Activity (film series)|Paranormal Activity]]'' sequels, and he approved it, leading to a [[green-light]] by [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;  Blumhouse announced the project on October 11, 2016, with Landon directing and [[Jessica Rothe]] cast in the lead role of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/jessica-rothe-horror-movie-half-to-death-1201885408/ |title=Jessica Rothe Starring in Horror Movie 'Half to Death' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Dave |last=McNary |date=October 11, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2016, it was announced that [[Ruby Modine]], Charles Aitken and Rachel Matthews had joined the cast, alongside Rothe and [[Israel Broussard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/ruby-modine-blumhouse-horro-movie-half-to-death-1201912627/ |title=Ruby Modine Joins Horror Movie 'Half to Death' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Dave |last=McNary |date=November 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film got eventually retitled ''Happy Death Day'' in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2017/06/half-to-death-retitled-happy-death-day-release-date-1202111656/ Universal, Blumhouse Retitle Film 'Half To Death' To 'Happy Death Day']&lt;/ref&gt;

The mask was constructed by Tony Gardner, the same man who built the "[[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]]" mask from every ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' film, and  its design was personal. Landon explains, "During preproduction ... I was expecting my first son. I don't know if I just had babies on the brain, or if I was subconsciously scared to become a father, but that baby image was floating around in my head. Tony made us a pig mask, too, but when I wore the baby mask in the office, I scared a co-worker, and we thought ... yeah, this is it. This is the one."&lt;ref name=nw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/happy-death-day-baby-mask-tree-683717?amp=1 |title=THE STORY BEHIND 'HAPPY DEATH DAY''S CREEPY BABY MASK AND TREE'S BEST LINES |date=October 12, 2017|access-date=October 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Scream'' itself was listed among the influences Christopher Landon took for the film, along with ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Groundhog Day]]'' and comedies of the 1980s such as ''[[Sixteen Candles (film)|Sixteen Candles]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/happy-death-day-influences/ |title=Happy Death Day Influences: 10 Movies That Inspired the Director}}&lt;/ref&gt; given he aimed to make a "fun, silly horror movie".

=== Writing ===
Comic book writer Scott Lobdell said he wanted to play with the tropes of the slasher genre, as according to him "every slasher film opens up with the mean girl getting killed and the good girl living till the end. And I thought, 'How can I make the mean girl and the good girl the same person?'" &lt;ref name=thrillist&gt;Fitz-Gerald, Sean.

Landon says, "They were a psycho couple murdering Tree together. That ultimately didn't work for me. I thought Gregory was a great opportunity to be a suspect.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place at and around [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=20625 Production Notes for ''Happy Death Day'']&lt;/ref&gt; and it lasted 5 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/happy-death-day-jessica-rothe-scream-queen-2017 |title=Happy Death Day's Jessica Rothe On What It Means To Be A Scream Queen in 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes where Tree awakens in Carter's bed after her death were filmed back to back in a span of two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gq.com/story/happy-death-day-jessica-rothe |title=Happy Death Day Star Jessica Rothe Explains What It's Like to Die a Dozen Times in the Same Movie |first=Tom |last=Philip |date=October 18, 2017 |accessdate=October 19, 2017 |work=[[GQ]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene after Lori dies was supposed to be at the sorority house, but the filming permit was over before production was able to shoot there, forcing the location to be changed into a Los Angeles diner also featured in another Blumhouse production, ''[[Split (2016 American film)|Split]]''.&lt;ref name=ti/&gt;

=== Alternate ending ===
In the original ending of the film, Tree is taken to the hospital after her encounter with Lori. The doctor instructs her to stay away from pain medication for at least a day due to the extent of her injuries. After he leaves, a nurse comes in and tells Tree she is giving Tree something for the pain and Tree informs the nurse of the doctor's orders. The nurse reveals herself to be Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie, who says it is for her pain and then murders Tree in revenge for the affair between her and Dr. Butler.

This version was shown in the test screenings for the film, and was received negatively by the audience, forcing the writers to come up with the theatrical ending. Director Christopher Landon also revealed Lori and Dr. Butler were the killers in the rough drafts, which later inspired the idea of the poisoned cupcake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1714429/happy-death-day-shot-an-original-ending-that-made-test-audiences-furious |title=Happy Death Day Shot An Original Ending That Made Test Audiences Furious |work=Cinema Blend |date=2017-10-16 |accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear McCreary composed the score of ''Happy Death Day''. Reflecting the film's blend of horror and comedy, McCreary stated that he wanted "a schizophrenic, dual personality, with light-hearted comedic scoring on one end, and genuinely terrifying soundscapes on the other." This approach is highlighted by the two main [[leitmotif]]s, an energetic theme for Tree evoking contemporary pop music, and one for the killer that consists of distorted vocals provided by McCreary's young daughter Sonatin. The percussion in the score are mostly sampled from  college [[marching band]] drum lines to evoke the collegiate setting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bearmccreary.com/#blog/blog/films/happy-death-day/ Bear Blog: Happy Death Day], Bear McCreary&lt;/ref&gt; While the film's trailer featured [[50 Cent]]'s "[[In Da Club]]" as Tree's ringtone, Landon said the film could not afford to use the track, but still preferred the eventual song music supervisor Andrea von Foerster improvised, the comedic "Busy Day Birthday".&lt;ref name=nw/&gt;

=== Critical response ===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 71% based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Happy Death Day'' puts a darkly humorous sci-fi spin on slasher conventions, with added edge courtesy of a starmaking performance from Jessica Rothe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/happy_death_day |title=Happy Death Day (2017) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/happy-death-day |title=Happy Death Day Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it a 52% "definite recommend".&lt;ref name=opening /&gt;

[[File:Harkness-method.jpg|thumbnail|Instructor and students at Techie Youth, engaged in the Harkness discussion-based teaching method]]
[[File:College Prep Harkness Table.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Students and instructor seated around a Harkness table at [[The College Preparatory School]] in Oakland, California]]
The '''Harkness table''', '''Harkness method''', or '''Harkness discussion''' is a teaching and learning method involving students seated in a large, oval configuration to discuss ideas in an encouraging, open-minded environment with only occasional or minimal teacher intervention.

==Overview==
Harkness method is in use at many American [[boarding school]]s and colleges and encourages classes to be held in a discursive manner. The style is related to the [[Socratic method]]. Developed at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazing Harkness Philosophy|url=http://www.exeter.edu/admissions/109_1220.aspx|work=Phillips Exeter Academy|accessdate=2011-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method's name comes from the oil magnate and [[philanthropist]] [[Edward Harkness]], a graduate of [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], who presented the school with a monetary gift in 1930. It has been adopted in numerous schools, where small class-size makes it effective, but it remains impractical for larger classes.  There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom.   Harkness described its use as follows:

:''What I have in mind is [a classroom] where [students] could sit around a table with a teacher who would talk with them and instruct them by a sort of tutorial or conference method, where [each student] would feel encouraged to speak up. This would be a real revolution in methods.''&lt;ref&gt;Christophe G. Courchesne, [http://lawrecord.typepad.com/rutgers_law_record/files/29rlr21.pdf "'A Suggestion of a Fundamental Nature': Imagining a Legal Education of Solely Electives Taught as Discussions"], ''Rutgers Law Record'' 29, no. 21 (2005): 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harkness learning can vary, most notably between humanities subjects such as English and history and technical subjects such as math or physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.exeter.edu/exeter-difference/how-youll-learn|title=How You'll Learn|website=Phillips Exeter Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are general principles and goals, however, that go along with that method regardless of subject matter. The main goal is to encourage students to come up with ideas of their own and learn good reasoning and discussion skills. Depending on style, the teacher may interact very little, interjecting only to guide the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/progressive-education-how-children-learn-today-2774713|title=Progressive Education - How Children Learn|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whole Group Discussion Method ===
The Whole Group Discussion Technique follows the Harkness Method. It involves interaction throughout the class instead of the teacher simply delivering a lecture with students listening.  Many teachers today prefer this approach because of heightened communication between the mentor and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/whole-group-discussion-pros-and-cons-8036|title=The Pros and Cons of Whole Group Discussion|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are advantages and disadvantages in using this method. Auditory learners find this style more interesting. They are able to keep information completely since sounds reinforce the information. This process includes use of musical notes, memorization of lists, voice recordings, and chants for memorizing history terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/auditory-learning-style-1857081|title=Understanding the Auditory Learning Style|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers are able to check what students retain through questioning. Students can concentrate on their lessons and feel more at ease in asking questions during discussions.

However, the Whole Group Discussion approach calls for effective classroom management by teachers. Otherwise, it may be too disturbing for them to implement ground rules for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edglossary.org/classroom-management/|title=Classroom Management Definition|last=Partnership|first=Great Schools|date=2013-05-15|work=The Glossary of Education Reform|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also downsides for students who are not good in taking notes. They must first learn the strategies in proper note-taking in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oxfordlearning.com/5-effective-note-taking-methods/|title=How To Take Study Notes: 5 Effective Note Taking Methods|date=2017-05-03|work=Oxford Learning|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are strategies in effective implementation of Whole Group Discussions. The Think-Pair-Share is commonly used for lower elementary pupils to persuade the children in acquiring listening and speaking skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adlit.org/strategies/23277/|title=Think-Pair-Share {{!}} Classroom Strategies {{!}} AdLit.org|website=www.adlit.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical Chairs is another strategy wherein teachers read sentences or topics with only two likely responses. It is either agree or disagree. Each group of students defends the position it adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scholastic.com/teachers/lesson-plans/teaching-content/philosophical-chairs-discussion/|title=Philosophical Chairs Discussion {{!}} Scholastic|website=www.scholastic.com|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fishbowl is one of the most popular classroom discussion techniques. A group of two up to four students sit facing one another at the center of the classroom. The other students sit around their peers.

'''Helsinki Challenge''' is a science-based competition and idea accelerator which brings together the academic community and society at large to solve the world’s grand challenges in cooperation. The competition goal is not only to create new scientific information, but to influence society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/blog/prepare-for-the-unexpected |title=Prepare for the unexpected - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2015-02-11 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams consisting of experts from the academic and artistic communities, the business world, the public and third sectors, media and other actors of the society are welcome to take part in the competition. Participating teams are evaluated by the jury using the following criteria: originality, creativity, impact, focus on solutions and use of science-based methods. The competition prize is 375,000 euros and it is meant for the implementation of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |title=How to participate? - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626135757/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/how-to-participate |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/qa |title=Questions &amp; Answers - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Helsinki Challenge was held for the first time in 2015. In 2017, the competition is organised by the [[University of Helsinki]] in collaboration with [[Aalto University]], [[Hanken School of Economics]], [[University of Eastern Finland]], [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[University of Oulu]], [[University of the Arts Helsinki]], [[University of Turku]], [[University of Vaasa]] and [[Åbo Akademi University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2014–2015==

The first ever Helsinki Challenge was organised by the University of Helsinki and celebrated the University’s 375th anniversary in 2015. The first Helsinki Challenge competition themes were: environmental change, health and wellbeing, future learning, global Helsinki and new world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |title=About - Helsinki University Challenge |publisher=Challenge.helsinki.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626134954/http://challenge.helsinki.fi/about |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifinal 2014–2015===
Out of 80 proposals, a list of 20 semifinalists were announced in December 2014. Teams’ competition ideas ranged from developing tools to analyze [[big data]] on the Finnish discussion forum [[Suomi24]] to studying our expectations of robot morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/a1417410726435 |title=Tiederyhmä selvittää syyllisyyttä robottien tekemissä virheissä - Tiede - Kotimaa - Helsingin Sanomat |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mika Pantzar |url=http://wau.fi/artikkelit/big-dataa-riittaa-mutta-riittaako-suomessa-kykya-hyodyntaa-sita |title=Big dataa riittää, mutta riittääkö Suomessa kykyä hyödyntää sitä? |publisher=Wau.fi |date=2015-05-29 |accessdate=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final 2014–2015===

In October 2015, the five finalist teams were chosen:  Moralities of Intelligent Machines, Biodiversity Now, Helsinki Sleep Factory, SafePreg – Health into Next Generation and NEMO - Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction.  The jury for the final included Chancellor Thomas Wilhelmsson (chair), Pro-Vice Chancellor of Education [[Sally Mapstone]] from the [[University of Oxford]], Professor of Practice Pasi Sahlberg from [[Harvard University]]’s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]], Director Ulrich Weinberg from the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] School of Design Thinking and President Mikko Kosonen of the Finnish Innovation Fund [[SITRA]].

====Winner teams====

The €375,000 prize for the science-based idea competition Helsinki Challenge was divided between two teams. The winner was NEMO – Natural Emotionality in Digital Interaction, which received €250,000, while the runner-up, Biodiversity Now, received €125,000.The prize money is intended for realising the team’s idea.

NEMO is developing new ways to digitise and transmit emotion online.The team is planning small add-ons for digital interaction platforms that would consider emotions.This way participants in online discussions could see or even experience the emotions of others in a new way that would be equivalent to natural interaction.The team wants to create an open protocol for emotion transmission for any coder to use for building new empathy-enabling applications.

Biodiversity Now team wants to establish a Finnish habitat bank so that, for example, companies reducing biodiversity through a construction project could offset this by increasing biodiversity elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sttinfo.fi/tiedote/the-internet-of-empathy-receives-the-helsinki-challenge-prize-of-250000?publisherId=1807796&amp;releaseId=36507619&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helsinki Challenge 2016–2017==

The second Helsinki Challenge was kicked off in August 2016. The winner will be announced in conjunction with the centennial of [[Finland]]'s independence in 2017. The new Helsinki Challenge themes: Sustainable Plant, Urban Future and People in Change are linked to the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The intention is to create solutions for future wellbeing through cooperation with a range of different institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://challenge.helsinki.fi/articles/helsinki-challenge-to-return-bigger-and-better&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural heritage tourism''' (or just '''heritage tourism''' or '''diaspora tourism''') is a branch of [[tourism]] oriented towards the [[cultural heritage]] of the location where tourism is occurring. 

The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the United States defines heritage tourism as "traveling to experience the places, artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past",&lt;ref name="nthp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Tourism|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/information-center/economics-of-revitalization/heritage-tourism/#.Uz7tU1flvqE|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "heritage tourism can include cultural, historic and natural resources".&lt;ref name="nthp"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[Culture]] has always been a major object of travel, as the development of the [[Grand Tour]] from the 16th century onwards attests. In the 20th century, some people have claimed, culture ceased to be the objective of tourism: tourism is now culture. Cultural attractions play an important role in tourism at all levels, from the global highlights of world culture to attractions that underpin local identities. (Richards, 1996)&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first= Greg |title= Production and consumption of European Cultural Tourism. Annals of Tourism Research | page = |year= 1996 |publisher= Tillburg University Press |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Weiler and Hall, culture, heritage and the arts have long contributed to appeal of tourist destination. However, in recent years 'culture' has been rediscovered as an important marketing tool to attract those travellers with special interests in heritage and arts. 

According to the Hollinshead, cultural heritage tourism defines as cultural heritage tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry because there is a trend toward an increase specialization among tourists. This trend is evident in the rise in the volume of tourists who seek adventure, culture, history, [[archaeology]] and interaction with local people.

Cultural heritage tourism is important for various reasons; it has a positive economic and social impact, it establishes and reinforces identity, it helps preserve the cultural heritage, with culture as an instrument it facilitates harmony and understanding among people, it supports culture and helps renew tourism (Richards, 1996). As Benjamin 
Porter and [[Noel B. Salazar]] have ethnographically documented, however, cultural heritage tourism can also create tensions and even conflict between the different stakeholders involved (Porter and Salazar 2005).&lt;ref name="Porter and Salazar"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Porter, Benjamin W. and Noel B. Salazar
 |year=2005
 |title=Heritage tourism, conflict, and the public interest
 |journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies
 |volume=11
 |issue=5
 |doi=10.1080/13527250500337397
 |pages=361–370
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural heritage tourism has a number of objectives that must be met within the context of [[sustainable development]] such as; the conservation of cultural resources, accurate  interpretation of resources, authentic visitors experience, and the stimulation of the earned revenues of cultural resources. We can see, therefore, that cultural heritage tourism is not only concerned with identification, management and protection of the heritage values but it must also be involved in understanding the impact of tourism on communities and regions, achieving economic and social benefits, providing financial resources for protection, as well as marketing and promotion. ([[J. M. Fladmark]], 1994)

Heritage tourism involves visiting historical or industrial sites that may include old [[canal]]s, [[railway]]s, battlegrounds, etc. The overall purpose is to gain an appreciation of the past. It also refers to the marketing of a location to members of a [[diaspora]] who have distant family roots there.

==Immigration==
[[Decolonization]] and [[immigration]] form the major background of much contemporary heritage tourism. Falling travel costs have also made heritage tourism possible for more people.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, T. (2007). ''Post-Conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism: Tourism, Politics and Development at Angkor''. Routledge. {{ISBN|041543095X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible form involves religious travel or [[pilgrimage]]s. Many [[Catholics]] from around the world come to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and other sites such as [[Lourdes]] or [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]]. [[Islam]] commands its followers to take the ''[[hajj]]'' to [[Mecca]], thus differentiating it somewhat from tourism in the usual sense, though the trip can also be a culturally important event for the pilgrim.&lt;ref&gt;Basu, P. (2007). ''Highland homecomings: Genealogy and heritage tourism in the Scottish diaspora''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage tourism can also be attributed to historical events that have been dramatised to make them more entertaining. For example, a historical tour of a town or city using a theme such as ghosts or Vikings. Heritage tourism focuses on certain historical events, rather than presenting a balanced view of that historical period. Its aim may not always be the presentation of accurate historical facts, as opposed to economically developing the site and surrounding area. As a result, heritage tourism can be seen as a blend of education, entertainment, preservation and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy, D., &amp; Olsen, D. (Eds.). (2006). ''Tourism, religion and spiritual journeys''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous peoples==
[[Anthropology]] and [[Ethnology]] were two major disciplines interested by the life of aborigines, their customs and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, M. (2001). The rise of anthropological theory: A history of theories of culture. AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the firsts fieldworkers were not interested in expanding the colonization of main European powers, the fact was that their notes, books and field-work notes were employed by colonial officials to understand the aboriginal mind.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, E., &amp; Escobar, A. (2005). ‘Other Anthropologies and Anthropology Otherwise’Steps to a World Anthropologies Framework. ''[[Critique of Anthropology]]'', 25(2), 99-129.&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment on, anthropology developed a strange fascination for the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]'s culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, J., Dombrowski, K., Graburn, N., LeiteGoldberg, N., Phillips, R., Watkins, J., &amp; Clifford, J. (2004). Looking several ways: Anthropology and native heritage in Alaska. ''[[Current anthropology]]'', 45(1), 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of heritage and colonization were inextricably intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Starzmann, M. T. (2008). Cultural imperialism and heritage politics in the event of armed conflict: prospects for an ‘activist archaeology’. ''Archaeologies'', 4(3), 368-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb|Community tourism in Sierra Leone: The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a socially responsible manner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Tourism - Number2 River Association, Sierra Leone|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D|work=The Vrinda Project|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another problem with heritage tourism is the effect on indigenous peoples whose land and culture is being visited by tourists. If the indigenous people are not a part of the majority, or ruling power in the country, they may not benefit from the tourism as greatly as they should. For example, in Mexico tourism has increased because of the predicted [[end of the Maya Calendar]]. However, the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] are not benefitting from the increased traffic through the ruins and other cultural landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayans Demand Inclusion in 'Doomsday Tourism' |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/01/21/mayans-demand-inclusion-doomsday-tourism-73721|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion and facilitation ==
Heritage tourism is supported by municipalities through promotion and tourist information in many countries and their administrative units, e.g. cities as Polish [[Bydgoszcz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit Bydgoszcz|url=http://www.visitbydgoszcz.pl/en/|work= |publisher=Bydgoszcz Information Centre (Bydgoskie Centrum Informacji)|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WarsawTour|url=http://www.warsawtour.pl/en|work= |publisher=Warsaw Tourist Office|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also many forms of presenting selected tourist topics in a harmonized way, for instance [[European Route of Brick Gothic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik|url=http://www.eurob.org/|work= |publisher=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik e.V.|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others ([[Cultural Route of the Council of Europe]]).

The '''Kansas Sampler Foundation''' is a public [[non-profit]] [[501(c)]] organization. The Foundation is located at the Kansas Sampler Center near [[Inman, Kansas]]. According to the organization's web site [http://kansassampler.org/] and publications, the mission is to preserve and sustain [[rural]] [[culture]] by educating Kansans about [[Kansas]] by networking and ''encouraging the support of rural communities.'' The support is generally in the form of encouraging awareness of, and commerce with, rural businesses. Methods include positive messages of motivation encouraging people to celebrate the sunflower state. Founded in 1993 by Mil and Marci Penner, the '''Kansas Sampler Foundation''' is based at the Penner family [[farm]].

The Foundation stresses keeping rural Kansas vigorous. Accentuating ''rural culture elements'' like [[architecture]], [[art]], [[commerce]], [[cuisine]], customs, geography, history, and people &amp;mdash; the goal is to get more Kansans to realize (and visit) the treasures in their state. Any one of these elements puts a person, place or thing on the list of places to see. They are reasons to celebrate towns. There is also a checklist to help communities catalog what they have to offer. Small rural towns are seen as critical to the continued character of [[Kansas]].

==Kansas Sampler Festival==


Supporters sample rural Kansas culture elements by attending the Kansas Sampler Festival.&lt;ref&gt;"Kansas City, Mo., Businesses to Offer Discounts, Giveaways during Tourism Week," Rick Alm. The Kansas City Star, Mo. Distributed by Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. Washington: May 4, 2002. pg. 1."Statewide events in Kansas kick off today with the annual Kansas Sampler Festival.."&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place annually, roving to different Kansas communities every two years. About eight thousand people attended the 2006 festival in [[Garden City, Kansas]]. Approximately four hundred volunteers worked together to help put it on. It returned to the [[List of zoos#Kansas|Lee Richardson Zoo]] in the spring of 2007. It has taken place in [[Inman, Kansas]], [[Pratt, Kansas]], [[Independence, Kansas]] and [[Ottawa, Kansas]] and in [[Concordia, Kansas]], in the years since. 

Much of the work of the Foundation matches the grass-roots, forward-thinking example of businesses and attractions featured at the Kansas Sampler Festival. The currency of awareness is spread in [[newsletters]], and attitudes among member-supporters are tilted towards accentuating positive, mutual success and common survival &amp;mdash; indeed a core value of the Foundation. There are group outings, and campaigns by members to trek across Kansas, finding out-of-the-way attractions, people and stories.   

There several areas of interest under the umbrella of the foundation, and many ways to participate. Principal among them is the Kansas Explorers Club. Foundation director Marci Penner said, "The club helps people know what there is to see and do in the nooks and crannies of the state."  The Foundation's goal is to get 5,000 Kansas Explorer Club members.

Organizers believe that "with that number of explorers driving around the state and spending money in small town cafes and specialty shops and appreciating the historic sites and natural landmarks it will help keep our towns alive and thriving."

==Kansas Explorer's Club==


Simply put, The Kansas Explorers Club is a group of people bound by the common interest of exploring Kansas.

The Explorers Club newsletter comes out six times a year. In the pages, there are examples of places where the membership might go to explore, to find locally owned businesses, and to experience lesser-known aspects of the state. Suggested day-trips often lead the Explorer on a themed trip, such as visiting suriviving examples of the Old West in Kansas, a western-themed local eatery, and a bed and breakfast that dates back to frontier days. 

One of the guiding principals is that Explorers 'dare to do dirt' - that is, they will seek out elusive best-kept secrets, and don't mind coming home tired, sunburned and with muddy boots for the experience. The stories, cautions, and recommendations from the trips appear in the newsletter. One motto is "It's About the Journey" which speaks to exploring.

Celebrated explorers have taken it upon themselves to venture across Kansas for a certain purpose; Explorers might wish to eat lunch in as many towns as possible, or try to drink a beer in every Kansas county. The list of such Explorer accomplishments grew significantly after one explorer in particular gathered nationwide media attention for his crusade.

There is a secret, ritual greeting among members, and there is an annual 'Happening', specifically for the purpose of lots of Explorers trekking to one spot en masse. 

The Kansas Explorers Club was founded in 1994&lt;ref&gt;"Traveler finds simple pleasures along back alleys of Kansas," Eric Weslander. Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan. Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. Washington: Jul 16, 2006. pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; already has 1,800 members and is growing every day.  The club also plans Group Adventures to places not normally accessible to the public and once a year they have a Grand Expedition.  The Grand Expedition is a bus tour designed to help the public see common sights of Kansas with new eyes. Individual membership to the club is $18.61 (the year Kansas became a state).  Members receive a membership card, the regular newsletters and information about trips, but they also learn the secret explorer greeting ritual. The club web site is [http://explorekansas.net] or http://www.explorekansas.org/ .  Address and contact information for the Kansas Sampler Foundation is &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;978 Arapaho Road, Inman, KS 67546 &lt;/span&gt; or call (620)585-2374.

==We Kan!==


The We Kan! section of the Sampler Foundation's on-line information calls the We Kan! network and newsletter "a support group and information flow among rural communities to help develop the unique identity of each town and to attract visitors in a way that will help keep towns alive and thriving." Furthermore, it states  "It is a group of community leaders, volunteers, and supporters striving to make their communities better.  Whatever the focus, We Kan! members enjoy the camaraderie of each other, the sharing of ideas, and a one-for-all, all-for-one attitude." according to the Sampler Foundation website [http://kansassampler.org]. We Kan! awards are presented to distinguished Explorers annually.

The We Kan! newsletter is published to motivate, and to educate about strategies to help sustain rural Kansas culture. Articles outline the importance of spending in favor of small businesses, in order to keep them alive. The pages often bring tactics for making a difference, however small, in the life of a small town, and explains in some depth how and why rural commerce struggles to survive. There are also pointers as to changes in businesses around the state, and simple inexpensive steps for the individual to take to make a difference. An example is buying postage stamps at smaller post offices, so small towns can keep their U.S. Post Office open, and take a step back from the brink of disappearing.

=== Lizard Lips ===



In the tiny Woodson County town of [[Toronto, Kansas]] - population less than 300 in 2003, there is Lizard Lips Grill and Deli. "The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers" &lt;ref&gt;''The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers'' 2005,  By Marci Penner {{ISBN|0-9765408-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
http://kansasguidebook.com/ says the "combination deli, convenience store, and bait shop" is a good source for area information. But is also a part of We Kan! lore. Lizard Lips is an example of a small, private business - vital to a community and on the cusp of bankruptcy, until We Kan! came along. They were challenged to go to the store and spend five dollars to keep it vital. The plan worked. The business stands out as a practical example of grass roots success in rural cultural commerce.

==Marci Penner==

Marci Penner founded the Kansas Sampler Foundation with her father, Mil Penner in 1993. The two had seen much of what the state of Kansas had to offer in their travels co-authoring a series of guidebooks, and found themselves championing small town survival not long after. She is the editor and publisher of the foundations newsletters, and her most recent book &amp;mdash;"The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers"  &lt;ref&gt;''The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers'' 2005,  By Marci Penner {{ISBN|0-9765408-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
http://kansasguidebook.com/ &amp;mdash; came out in 2005. Marci Penner serves on the state government Rural Kansas Task Force,&lt;ref&gt;"Governor Meets with Rural Task Force near Salina, Kan., to Discuss Incentives." Tim Unruh. The Salina Journal, Kan. Distributed by KnightRidder/Tribune Business News. Washington: Apr 13, 2004. pg. 1. (Penner cochaired the task force)&lt;/ref&gt; and is the recipient of the Kansan of the Year award. Penner organized the first Valley Falls Retreat to promote the western heritage of rural Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;"Rural Kansans Talk about Tourism and Economic Development," Stan Finger. The Wichita Eagle, Kan. Distributed by Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. Washington: Jan 24, 2002. pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''Lingua Ignota''''' (Latin for "unknown language") was  described by the 12th century [[abbess]] of Rupertsberg, [[Hildegard of Bingen|St. Hildegard of Bingen, OSB]], who apparently used it for mystical purposes. To write it, she used an alphabet of 23 letters denominated ''litterae ignotae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bingensis|first1=Hildegardis|title=Riesencodex|date=1175-1190|pages=934, 464v|url=http://dfg-viewer.de/show/?tx_dlf%5Bid%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fdokumentserver.hlb-wiesbaden.de%2FHS_2%2Fmets17.xml&amp;tx_dlf%5Bpage%5D=934&amp;tx_dlf%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;cHash=16dea2091d5605fe4f100c3fd07fdab5|accessdate=2014-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

She partially described the language in a work titled ''Lingua Ignota per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata'', which survived in two manuscripts, both dating to ca. 1200, the [[Wiesbaden Codex]] and a Berlin MS (Lat. Quart. 4º 674), previously Codex Cheltenhamensis 9303, collected by Sir [[Thomas Phillipps]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinmayer E; Sievers, E. (1895). [https://archive.org/stream/diealthochdeutsc03steiuoft#page/390/mode/2up ''Sachlich geordnete Glossare''].  Die Althochdeutschen Glossen, Vol. III. pp. 390-404.&lt;/ref&gt; The text is a [[glossary]] of 1011 words in Lingua Ignota, with [[Gloss (transliteration)|gloss]]es mostly in [[Latin]], sometimes in [[Middle High German|German]]; the words appear to be [[A priori (Languages)|a priori]] [[Neologism|coinages]], mostly nouns with a few adjectives. Grammatically it appears to be a partial [[relexification]] of Latin, that is, a language formed by substituting new vocabulary into an existing grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jean Jeskalian, ''Hildegard of Bingen: the creative dimensions of a Medieval personality."  Graduate Theological Union&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Lingua Ignota is unknown, and it is not known who, besides its creator, was familiar with it. In the 19th century some{{who?|date=July 2018}} believed that Hildegard intended her language to be an ideal, [[universal language]]. However, nowadays{{when?|reason= starting when?|date=July 2018}} it is generally{{whom?|reason=If you don't mean that in the implausible sense of "by everyone", then by whom?|date=July 2018}} assumed that Lingua Ignota was devised as a secret language; like Hildegard's "unheard music", she would have attributed it to [[divine inspiration]]. Inasmuch as {{vague|reason= is this supposed mean "To the degree that" or "Since (as all readers will agree)"?|date=July 2018}}  the language was constructed by Hildegard, it may be considered one of the earliest known [[constructed language]]s.

In a letter to Hildegard, her friend and provost Wolmarus, fearing that Hildegard would soon die, asks ''[[ubi sunt|ubi]] tunc vox inauditae melodiae? et vox inauditae linguae?'' (Descemet, p.&amp;nbsp;346; "where, then, the voice of the unheard melody? And the voice of the unheard language?"), suggesting that the existence of Hildegard's language was known, but there were no initiates who would have preserved its knowledge after her death.

==Sample text==
The only extant text in the language is the following short passage:
:''O '''orzchis''' Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es '''caldemia''' stigmatum '''loifolum''' et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam '''crizanta''' in alto sono, et es '''chorzta''' gemma.''
These two sentences are written mostly in Latin with five key words in Lingua Ignota; as only one of these is unambiguously found in the glossary (''loifol'' "people"), it is clear that the vocabulary was larger than 1011 words.  (Higley 2007 finds probable correspondences for two other words.)

:"O ''orzchis'' [[Ecclesia (Church)|Ecclesia]], girded with divine arms, and adorned with hyacinth, you are the ''caldemia'' of the wounds of the ''loifol'', and the city of sciences. O, o, and you are the ''crizanta'' in high sound, and you are the ''chorzta'' gem."
''loifol'' "people" apparently is inflected in Latin, yielding ''loifol-um''.

Newman (1987) conjectures the translation
:"O ''measureless'' Church, / girded with divine arms / and adorned with jacinth, / you are the ''fragrance'' of the wounds of ''nations'' / and the city of sciences. / O, o, and you are ''anointed'' / amid noble sound, / and you are a ''sparkling'' gem."

==The glossary==
The glossary is in a hierarchical order, first giving terms for God and angels, followed by terms for human beings and terms for family relationships, followed by terms for body-parts, illnesses, religious and worldly ranks, craftsmen, days, months, clothing, household implements, plants, and a few birds and insects. Terms for mammals are lacking (except for the [[bat]], Ualueria, listed among birds, and the [[Griffin|gryphon]], Argumzio, a half-mammal, also listed among the birds).

The first 30 entries are (after Roth 1880):
* Aigonz: ''deus'' (God)
* Aieganz: ''angelus'' (angel)
* Zuuenz: ''sanctus'' (saint)
* Liuionz: ''salvator'' (saviour)
* Diueliz: ''diabolus'' (devil)
* Ispariz: ''spiritus''
* Inimois: ''homo'' (human being)
* Jur: ''vir'' (man)
* Vanix: ''femina'' (woman)
* Peuearrez: ''patriarcha''
* Korzinthio: ''propheta''
* Falschin: ''[[vates]]''
* Sonziz: ''apostolus''
* Linschiol: ''martir''
* Zanziuer: ''confessor''
* Vrizoil: ''virgo'' (virgin)
* Jugiza: ''vidua'' (widow)
* Pangizo: ''penitens''
* Kulzphazur: ''attavus'' (great-great-great-grandfather)
* Phazur: ''avus'' (grandfather)
* Peueriz: ''pater'' (father)
* Maiz: ''maler'' (sic, for ''mater'', mother)
* Hilzpeueriz: ''nutricus'' (stepfather)
* Hilzmaiz: ''noverca'' (stepmother)
* Scirizin: ''filius (son)
* Hilzscifriz: ''privignus'' (stepson)
* Limzkil: ''infans'' (infant)
* Zains: ''puer'' (boy)
* Zunzial: ''iuvenis'' (youth)
* Bischiniz: ''adolescens'' (adolescent)

Nominal composition may be observed in ''peueriz'' "father" : ''hilz-peueriz'' "stepfather", ''maiz'' "mother" : ''hilz-maiz'' "stepmother", and ''scirizin'' "son" : ''hilz-scifriz'' "stepson", as well as ''phazur'' : ''kulz-phazur''. Suffixal derivation in ''peueriz'' "father", ''peuearrez'' "patriarch".

A '''[[landscape architect]]''' is someone who practices [[landscape architecture]]. Regulations of the profession vary by country and state. The terminology has evolved to include those once known as [[List of professional gardeners|landscape gardeners]], [[garden designer|landscape designers]], architects, [[Surveying|surveyor]]s, or [[civil engineer]]s. In particular, this includes people from the 19th century who'd practiced before the term "landscape architect" was coined. Landscape architecture was also differentiated as a profession in the United States earlier than other parts of the world, but this ambiguity has persisted to the present day. In much of Europe, for example, landscape architecture is not a distinct profession; but there are many significant historical and contemporary examples of [[:Category:Landscape design history|"landscape architectural design"]] projects.  Though their influence on landscape architecture may be great, this list precludes gardeners, botanists, writers, theoreticians, ecologists, artists, and others who did not practice [[landscape design]] at a site scale and were not trained as a historical 'landscape gardener' or contemporary 'landscape architect.'&lt;!---both terms used to address examples/practitioners below of pre-1890s l.arch. nomenclature establishment---&gt;

The practice of '''releasing [[video game soundtrack]]s on''' [[gramophone record|'''vinyl''' record]]s began in the 1980s, fell out of favor in the 1990s and 2000s as vinyl records were replaced by other storage media, and experienced a resurgence of interest in the 2010s due in part to a [[vinyl revival]].&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;

==History==
Vinyl recordings of video game music find their origins in the 1970s with early experiments by [[Kraftwerk]]&lt;ref name=dreamboum/&gt; and [[album]]s such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s [[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|self-titled 1978 release]] sampling electronic music from the games ''[[Circus (video game)|Circus]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and ''[[Gun Fight]]''.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; In 1984, [[Haruomi Hosono]] released the first generally recognized video game soundtrack album, ''Video Game Music'',&lt;ref name=dreamboum/&gt;&lt;ref name=savorelli/&gt; and the practice experienced its "golden age" in the mid-to-late 1980s with hundreds of releases including [[Buckner &amp; Garcia]]'s ''[[Pac-Man Fever (album)|Pac-Man Fever]]'', [[Namco]]'s ''Video Game Graffiti'', and [[Koichi Sugiyama]]'s orchestral covers of the [[Dragon Quest|''Dragon Quest'' series]].&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; The 1990s saw many fewer commercial releases and a shift to [[Promo (media)|promo releases]] with increasing use of video game [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in rap&lt;ref name=spin/&gt; and hip hop.&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;

The trend away from vinyl discs continued in the 2000s as fan-made remixes also began to be produced, however by the 2010s the trend reversed and the practice of producing video game soundtracks on vinyl experienced a revival.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt; The vinyl revival of the 2010s has itself been attributed to inspiration in younger music buyers from video games,&lt;ref name=mcgeehan/&gt; and it has led to the establishment of video game soundtrack oriented vinyl record labels like [[Black Screen Records]],&lt;ref name=diver/&gt; [[Data Discs]],&lt;ref name=parish/&gt; [[Brave Wave]], and [[iam8bit]],&lt;ref name=beaumontthomas/&gt; and shifts toward similar releases for labels like [[Ghost Ramp]],&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=tomer/&gt; [[Ship To Shore Phonograph Co.]],&lt;ref name=eckhardt/&gt; and [[Mondo Tees]].&lt;ref name=greenwald/&gt; In a 2015 article, music journalist [[Mike Diver]] suggested that "this scene within a scene is experiencing boom times", however he noted that some in the music industry, including [[Invada Records|Invada]] manager Redg Weeks, were concerned by the risk of [[Market saturation|over-saturation of the market]].&lt;ref name=diver/&gt; These concerns were later repeated by Jamie Crook of Data Discs,&lt;ref name=parish/&gt; and although he has joined Mondo's Mo Shafeek in arguing that the vinyl medium itself and the related revival is in no way a fad or bubble,&lt;ref name=gach/&gt; in 2017 ''Kotaku'' reported concerns from dedicated video game soundtrack labels that pressing plants were scheduling their manufacturing runs last in order to favor traditional labels.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

The 2000s-2010s revival of interest in this medium has been characterized by releases [[Limited edition (music)|in limited numbers]] and promotional albums only available at special events or as pre-order bonuses.&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; In addition, the practice has been adopted by the [[Cult video game|cult]]&lt;ref name=greenwald/&gt; and [[Indie game]] scenes, with its proponents citing audio quality,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt; interactivity,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt; artwork,&lt;ref name=napolitano/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; nostalgia,&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; unique content,&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt;&lt;ref name=troper/&gt; and the fact that vinyl albums represent tangible aspects of intangible ([[Digital distribution|digitally distributed]]) products&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt; as key elements to what makes vinyl soundtrack albums attractive. Additional considerations for collectors include archival and preservation aspects for older games,&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt; examination and recontextualization of the music as a means to expand or further explore the game,&lt;ref name=eckhardt/&gt;&lt;ref name=troper/&gt; and curiosity among audiophiles unfamiliar with video gaming music as a genre.&lt;ref name=roberts/&gt; Due to the limited nature of modern releases, many albums are considered highly collectible, with some regularly selling in excess of $100 USD. For Western collectors, additional difficulty is imposed by the cost of importing albums from Japan where the majority were produced during the "golden age" of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=diver/&gt;&lt;ref name=eldred/&gt;

== Vinyl data ==
The use of grooved vinyl discs as a [[Sequencer (musical instrument)|sequenced/encoded]] rather than [[Analog recording|recorded]] data storage medium enabled the code of [[full motion video|full motion videos (FMVs)]] and even simple video games to be stored in an [[Analog recording|analog format]] along with the soundtrack and sound effects. These vinyl data discs took two forms: the FMV-only [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|Capacitance Electronic Disc (CED)]], and the program sheet. Uncommon even in the early 1980s when the practice was at its height, program sheet game data required that users [[Sound recording and reproduction|record]] from the disc (typically a [[flexi disc]] like the ''Interface Age'' "[[Floppy ROM]]") onto an [[audio cassette tape]] which could then be used via the cassette port with microcomputers such as the [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore PET]], [[Commodore VIC-20]], [[Dragon 32/64]], [[ZX81]], or [[ZX Spectrum]].&lt;ref name=arendt/&gt; The use of CEDs to store video game FMV data was even less common, and required the game console (typically an [[arcade machine]]) to select a section of the grooved track to read with its [[record needle|stylus]] at just the right time for the video to be displayed. The numerous limitations of these techniques ([[background noise]], [[Abrasion (mechanical)|scratches]], and [[Broken record|other audio-fidelity problems]])&lt;ref name=arendt/&gt;&lt;ref name="bennett82-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; contributed to their failure to receive widespread acceptance and video game data stored in this manner remains some of the most difficult to archive and preserve.&lt;ref name=off/&gt;

'''Moral relativism''' may be any of several [[philosophical]] positions concerned with the differences in [[morality|moral]] judgments across different [[people]] and [[culture]]s. ''[[Descriptive ethics|Descriptive]]'' moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral; ''[[Meta-ethics|meta-ethical]]'' moral relativism holds that in such disagreements, nobody is [[Moral universalism|objectively]] right or wrong; and ''[[Normative ethics|normative]]'' moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong, we ought to [[tolerate]] the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it.

Not all descriptive relativists adopt meta-ethical relativism, and moreover, not all meta-ethical relativists adopt normative relativism. [[Richard Rorty]], for example, argued that relativist philosophers believe "that the grounds for choosing between such opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought", but not that any belief is as valid as any other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rorty |first=Richard |title=Consequences of Pragmatism |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=0-8166-1064-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral relativism has been debated for thousands of years, from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[India]] to the present day, in diverse fields including art, philosophy, [[science]], and [[religion]].

==Variations==
===Descriptive===
Descriptive moral relativism is merely the [[positive science|positive]] or descriptive position that there exist, in fact, fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts hold true and the same consequences seem likely to arise.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{Cite web
  | last = Swoyer
  | first = Chris
  | date = February 22, 2003
  | title = Relativism
  | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#1.2
  | accessdate = May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the observation that different cultures have different moral standards.

Descriptive relativists do not necessarily advocate the tolerance of all behavior in light of such disagreement; that is to say, they are not necessarily normative relativists. Likewise, they do not necessarily make any commitments to the semantics, [[ontology]], or [[epistemology]] of moral judgement; that is, not all descriptive relativists are meta-ethical relativists.

Descriptive relativism is a widespread position in academic fields such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], which simply admit that it is incorrect to assume that the same moral or ethical frameworks are always in play in all historical and cultural circumstances.

===Meta-ethical===
[[Metaethics|Meta-ethical]] moral relativism is unpopular among philosophers; many are quite critical of it,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} though there are several [[contemporary philosophers]] who support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/ |title=Moral Relativism |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-ethical moral relativists believe not only that people disagree about moral issues, but that terms such as "good", "bad", "right" and "wrong" do not stand subject to [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[truth]] conditions at all; rather, they are relative to the traditions, convictions, or practices of an individual or a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Gowans]], "Moral Relativism" [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-relativism/#ForArg article link at Stanford Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The American anthropologist [[William Graham Sumner]] was an influential advocate of this view.  He argues in his 1906 work ''Folkways'' that what people consider right and wrong is shaped entirely - not primarily - by the traditions, customs, and practices of their culture.  Moreover, since in his analysis of human understanding there cannot be any higher moral standard than that provided by the local morals of a culture, no trans-cultural judgement about the rightness or wrongness of a culture's morals could possibly be justified.

Meta-ethical relativists are, first, descriptive relativists: they believe that, given the same set of facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what a person ''ought'' to do or prefer (based on societal or individual [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s). What's more, they argue that one cannot adjudicate these disagreements using any available independent standard of evaluation—any appeal to a relevant standard would always be merely personal or at best societal.

This view contrasts with [[moral universalism]], which argues that, even though well-intentioned persons disagree, and some may even remain unpersuadable (e.g. someone who is closed-minded), there is still a meaningful sense in which an action could be more "moral" (morally preferable) than another; that is, they believe there ''are'' objective standards of evaluation that seem worth calling "moral facts"—regardless of whether they are universally accepted.

===Normative===
Normative moral relativists believe not only the meta-ethical thesis, but that it has normative implications on what we ought to do. Normative moral relativists argue that meta-ethical relativism implies that we ''ought'' to tolerate the behavior of others even when it runs counter to our personal or cultural moral standards. Most philosophers do not agree, partially because of the challenges of arriving at an "ought" from relativistic premises.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/moral-relativism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Chris|last=Gowans|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=15 October 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-ethical relativism seems to eliminate the normative relativist's ability to make prescriptive claims. In other words, normative relativism may find it difficult to make a statement like "we think it is moral to tolerate behaviour" without always adding "other people think ''intolerance'' of certain behaviours is moral". Philosophers like [[Russell Blackford]] even argue that intolerance is, to some degree, important. As he puts it, "we need not adopt a quietism about moral traditions that cause hardship and suffering. Nor need we passively accept the moral norms of our own respective societies, to the extent that they are ineffective or counterproductive or simply unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;at the end of his review at http://jetpress.org/v21/blackford3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it is perfectly reasonable (and practical) for a person or group to defend their subjective values against others, even if there is no universal prescription or morality. We can also criticize other cultures for failing to pursue even ''their own goals'' effectively.

The moral relativists may also still try to make sense of non-universal statements like "in this country, it is wrong to do X" or even "to me, it is right to do Y".&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

[[Moral universalist]]s argue further that their system often ''does'' justify tolerance, and that disagreement with moral systems does not always demand interference, and certainly not aggressive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; For example, the [[utilitarian]] might call another society's practice 'ignorant' or 'less moral', but there would still be much debate about courses of action (e.g. whether to focus on providing better education, or technology, etc.).

==History==
Moral relativism encompasses views and arguments that people in various [[culture]]s have held over several thousand years. For example, the ancient [[Jainism|Jaina]] [[Anekantavada]] principle of [[Mahavira]] (c. 599–527 BC) states that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth;&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp. 400–07&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Protagoras]] (c. 481–420 BC) famously asserted that "man is the measure of all things". The Greek [[historian]] [[Herodotus]] (c. 484–420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as better than all others. Various other ancient [[philosopher]]s also questioned the idea of an objective standard of morality.

In the early modern era [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 18th-century [[the enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern [[emotivism]] and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) believed that we have to assess the value of our values since values are relative to one's goals and one's self. He emphasized the need to analyze our moral values and how much impact they may have on us. The problem with morality, according to Nietzsche, is that those who were considered "good" were the powerful nobles who had more education, and considered themselves better than anyone below their rank. Thus, what is considered good is relative. A "good man" is not questioned on whether or not there is a "bad", such as temptations, lingering inside him and he is considered to be more important than a man who is considered "bad" who is considered useless to making the human race better because of the morals we have subjected ourselves to. But since what is considered good and bad is relative, the importance and value we place on them should also be relative. He proposed that morality itself could be a danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Douglas|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=362–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that morals should be constructed actively, making them relative to who we are and what we, as individuals, consider to be true, equal, good and bad, etc. instead of reacting to moral laws made by a certain group of individuals in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spinks|first=Lee|title=Friedrich Nietzsche|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=Florence, KY|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar, supporting an anti-realist interpretation, concludes that "Nietzsche's central argument for anti-realism about value is explanatory: moral facts don't figure in the 'best explanation' of experience, and so are not real constituents of the objective world.  [[Moral value]]s, in short, can be 'explained away.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], "Nietzsche's Moral and Political Philosophy" [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche-moral-political/ article link at Stanford Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is certain that Nietzsche criticizes Plato's prioritization of [[transcendentalism|transcendence]] as the [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. The Platonist view holds that what is 'true', or most real, is something which is other-worldly while the (real) world of experience is like a mere 'shadow' of the Forms, most famously expressed in Plato's [[allegory of the cave]]. Nietzsche believes that this transcendence also had a parallel growth in [[Christianity]], which prioritized life-denying moral qualities such as humility and obedience through the [[Christianity|church]].  (See ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', ''[[The Twilight of the Idols]]'', ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', etc.)

Anthropologists such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) have cautioned observers against [[ethnocentricism]]—using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that transcendent morals do not exist—only socially constructed customs do (''see'' [[cultural relativism]]); and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist "insofar as he remains an anthropologist ... is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other". To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both [[Social sciences|social scientists]] and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist [[Edward Westermarck]] (1862–1939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one's upbringing. He rejected [[G.E. Moore]]'s (1873–1958) [[ethical intuitionism]]—in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition—because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical===

====R. M. Hare====
{{See also|Universal prescriptivism}}
Some philosophers, for example [[R. M. Hare]] (1919–2002), argue that moral propositions remain subject to human logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral [[discourse]] with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or [[truth condition]]s of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that human logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, human logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare's ''Sorting out Ethics''). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as ''less'' or ''more'', which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, "this is a ''good'' wrench" or "this is a ''bad'' wheel". This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain "facts".

====Walter Terence Stace====
"Ethical Relativity" is the topic of the first two chapters in ''The Concept of Morals'', in which [[Walter Terence Stace]] argues against [[moral absolutism]], but for [[moral universalism]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Philosophical poverty====
Critics propose that moral relativism fails because it rejects basic premises of discussions on morality, or because it cannot arbitrate disagreement.  Many critics, including [[Ibn Warraq]] and [[Eddie Tabash]], have suggested that meta-ethical relativists essentially take themselves out of any discussion of normative morality, since they seem to be rejecting an assumption of such discussions: the premise that there are right and wrong answers that can be discovered through reason. Practically speaking, such critics will argue that meta-ethical relativism may amount to [[moral nihilism]], or else incoherence.

These critics argue specifically that the moral relativists reduce the extent of their input in normative moral discussions to either rejecting the very having of the discussion, or else deeming both disagreeing parties to be correct. For instance, the moral relativist can only appeal to preference to object to the practice of murder or torture by individuals for [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.podcast.tv/video-podcasts/reasonable-doubts-podcast-121147.html|title=Reasonable Doubts Podcast, Ibn Warraq interviews "Defending the West" and "What the Koran Really Says"|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118155705/http://www.podcast.tv/video-podcasts/reasonable-doubts-podcast-121147.html|archivedate=2009-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accusation that relativists reject widely held terms of discourse is similar to arguments used against other "discussion-stoppers" like some forms of [[solipsism]] or the rejection of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]].

Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] made a similar criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/08/simon-blackburn.html|title=Simon Blackburn on Moral Relativism|website=philosophy bites}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explains that moral relativism fails as a ''moral system'' simply because it cannot arbitrate disagreements.

The moral relativist might respond that their conception of morality is more accurate given the provided cross cultural data and that it seems to hold true regardless of the counter arguments of the position's objectors.  They also might argue that most moral arguments are a form of the logical fallacy "Begging the Question" because it assumed that the moral position being argued is already good and moral and people who argue to "prove" their moral position are assuming that the cultural moral norms that they already have are already true.  The critics, however, maintain that their conception of morality is, for that exact reason, inadequate. Ultimately critics can do little more than to ''invite'' moral-relativists to re-define "morality" in practical or [[Moral realist|morally realistic]] terms.

====Other criticism====
Some arguments come when people question which moral justifications or truths are said to be relative. Because people belong to many groups based on culture, race, religion, etc., it is difficult to claim that the values of the group have authority for the members.  A part of meta-ethical relativism is identifying which group of people those truths are relative to. Another component is that many people belong to more than one group. The beliefs of the groups that a person belongs to may be fundamentally different, and so it is hard to decide which are relative and which win out. A person practicing meta-ethical relativism would not necessarily object to either view, but develop an opinion and argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Fall 2015|title = Moral Relativism|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/moral-relativism/|date = 2015-01-01|first = Chris|last = Gowans|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===

====Roman Catholicism====
{{See also|Relativism#Catholic Church and relativism}}
Catholic and some secular intellectuals attribute the perceived post-[[World War II|war]] decadence of Europe to the displacement of absolute values by moral relativism. [[Pope Benedict XVI]], [[Marcello Pera]] and others have argued that after about 1960, Europeans massively abandoned many traditional norms rooted in [[Christianity]] and replaced them with continuously evolving relative moral rules. In this view, [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] has become separated from procreation, which led to a decline in the importance of [[family|families]] and to [[Sub-replacement fertility|depopulation]]. As a result, currently the population vacuum in Europe is filled by immigrants, often from [[Islam]]ic countries, who attempt to reestablish absolute values which stand at odds with moral relativism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XVI|Josef Cardinal Ratzinger]], [[Marcello Pera]], ''Without Roots: The West, Relativism, Christianity, Islam'' (Basic Books, 2006. {{ISBN|0-465-00634-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The most authoritative response to moral relativism from the Roman Catholic perspective can be found in ''[[Veritatis Splendor]]'', an [[encyclical]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. Many of the main criticisms of moral relativism by the Catholic Church relate largely to modern controversies, such as elective abortion.

====Buddhism====
[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], an American [[Buddhist]] monk, has written: "By assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity, the materialistic [[world view]] ... threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality. The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today. To counter this tendency, mere moral exhortation is insufficient. If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct, it cannot be propounded as a self-justifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order. Religion must affirm, in the clearest terms, that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion, not subjective superstructure, but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], "A Buddhist Response to Contemporary Dilemmas of Human Existence" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/response.html article link at Access to Insight]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary===
The literary perspectivism begins at the different versions of the Greek myths. Symbolism created multiple suggestions for a vers. Structuralism teaches us the polysemy of the poems.

'''''Mu kratha''''' ({{lang-th|หมูกระทะ}}, {{IPA-th|mǔː krā.tʰáʔ|pron}}) is a combination of a [[Korean barbecue]] and a Chinese [[hot pot]].&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word ''mu kratha'' literally means ''pan pork'' in Thai ("mu" translates to “pig” or “pork” and “kratha” to “pan” or “skillet”). ''Mu kratha'' resembles a combination of a [[Korean barbecue]] and a Chinese [[hot pot]]. It is believed to have originated from the Korean barbecue grill. It is usually used with a gas stove whereas the Thai version uses charcoal. The dining concept spread throughout Thailand and into Malaysia and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makansutra.com/stories/3/1227/NewUdonIsMookataKoreaninspired New Udon: Is Mookata Korean inspired], makansutra, 2014-08-28. Retrieved 2015-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation and serving==
Sliced meat (most often pork) is grilled on the dome in the centre while the vegetables and other ingredients, such as fish balls, cook in the soup (also called [[Thai suki]]). The hot pot sits on a trough burning charcoal which [[Grilling|grills]] or [[Steaming|steams]] the ingredients. The best foods for this cooking method are pork, chicken, mutton, lamb, seafood, vegetables and mushrooms. The local traditional Thai mu kratha is usually served with “nam chim suki”. Nam chim suki is one of the popular dipping sauces in Thailand.  It's well known for using chili sauce as the main ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siamsizzles.com/suki-dipping-sauce-nam-jim-suki/]. Retrieved 2018-03-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the restaurants may serve "nam chim seafood" for eating with seafood. 
Before eating "mu kratha" a lard has to grilled at the center of the pan so the fat from a lard can cover the surface of the pan. Because of this, the meat won't stick to the pan while being grilled.

==In popular culture==
Since about 25 years Thailand has a lot of places offering ''mu kratha'' steamboat as it is easy to prepare and suits with a variety of foods. In the past it lost on popularity due to hygiene concerns but experienced a comeback in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makansutra.com/stories/3/1227/NewUdonIsMookataKoreaninspired New Udon: Is Mookata Korean inspired], makansutra, 2014-08-28.

==Conception and origins==
In the days, weeks and years following the atomic bombing of Japan, trained and untrained artists who survived the bombings began documenting their experiences in artworks.&lt;ref name="MIT Ground Zero"&gt;{{cite web

Photographer [[Yōsuke Yamahata]] began taking photographs of Nagasaki on August 10, 1945 (the day after the bombing), however his photographs were not released to the public until 1952 when the magazine ''[[Asahi Gurafu]]'' published them.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire" &gt;{{cite book

===Historical nuclear art in Italy===
In 1948, the artistic movement of [[Eaismo]], published a manifesto illustrating some aspects of the [[atomic age]] and, at the same time, criticizing the industrial use of [[nuclear power]].&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a movement of poetry and painting, founded by the Italian artist [[Voltolino Fontani]], aiming to balance the role of men in a society upset by  the danger  of [[nuclear radiation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |first=Maria  |last=Grandinetti

  |accessdate=1 April 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic group was strengthened by the poet [[Marcello Landi]] and by the literary critic Guido Favati. In 1948 Voltolino Fontani depicted the disintegration and fragmentation of an [[atom]] on canvas, by creating the artwork: ''Dinamica di assestamento e mancata stasi''.

In 1951 the painters [[Enrico Baj]] and Sergio Dangelo created the {{illm|Arte nucleare movement|it}},  criticizing and putting the repetitiveness of painting (as an artistic and commercial phenomenon) in discussion.&lt;ref &gt;Luciano Caramel, Arte in Italia, 1945-1960, Vita e Pensiero, [[Milano]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
Plenty of Italian artists, in [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and foreigners like [[Yves Klein]], [[Asger Jorn]], [[Arman]], [[Antonio Saura]] joined the movement. The main representative of the arte nucleare movement was [[Piero Manzoni]], who in this context, for the first time in his life, put  his talent in evidence.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.pieromanzoni.org/biografia_1933-57.htm, ''link read in April 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Eaismo, recommending artists to pursue painting values (and poetry),&lt;ref &gt;G.Favati, V.Fontani, M.Landi, A.Neri, A.S.Pellegrini, Manifesto dell'Eaismo, Società Editrice Italiana, [[Livorno]], 1948&lt;/ref&gt; the arte nucleare movement tried to promote a new form of art in which painting was marginalized.&lt;ref &gt;[http://digilander.libero.it/contemporarea/AAI/ant38, Arman, Baj, Bemporad, Bertini, Colonne, Chapmans, Colucci, Dangelo, De Miceli, D'Haese, Hoeboer, Hundertwasser, Klein, Koenig, Manzoni, Nando, Noiret, A. e G.

===Historical nuclear art in Spain=== 
In the meantime, Spanish painter [[Salvador Dalì]] published the [[Mystical manifesto]] (1951), putting catholic mysticism and nuclear themes together.
In this period Dalì created artworks like [[Idillio atomico]] (1945) and [[Leda Atomica]] (1949).

===Historical nuclear art in France===

In 1949  the French artist [[Bernard Lorjou]] started to paint his monumental artwork “l’age atomique”  (The atomic age). The painting was concluded after one year and is now located in the [[Centre Pompidou]].

===Historical nuclear art in the United States===

The painter and photographer [[Eugene Von Bruenchenhein]] painted the artwork “Atomic age” in 1955,&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.ktfineart.com/past/?object_id=86&amp;show=project_images&amp;heading_id=&amp;project_id=90&amp;detail_id=602, link read in 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and other apocalyptical and post apocalyptical paintings up to 1965.

The British sculptor, [[Henry Moore]], created a bronze public sculpture, entitled, [[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)]] (1967) that depicted both the fatality of nuclear weapons as well as celebrated the invention of nuclear energy for use as electrical power. The sculpture is located on the grounds of the University of Chicago, where the first self-sustaining nuclear reaction was produced at the [[Chicago Pile-1]], under the oversight of the Manhattan Project and Enrico Fermi. The sculpture is in the form of a hybrid [[mushroom cloud]] and human skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Contemporary approaches to nuclear art==

===Japan===
After the March 2011 accident that caused three nuclear reactors to melt down at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in Japan, there have been numerous responses by contemporary Japanese artists, including Shigenobu Yoshida, [[Tatsuo Miyajima]], [[Shimpei Takeda]], [[Fuyuki Yamakawa]], Iri and Toshi Maruki, and Hiroshima bomb survivor, Tadasi Tonoshiki.&lt;ref name="WEAD Atomic Legacy Art"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Palace of Haji Zeynalabdin Tagiev.jpg|thumb|right|Palace of Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]]
Zeynalabdin Taghiyev's palace – [[Baku]], H.Z. Taghiyev Street 4 (former Gorkogovskaya Street 6), previously owned by Baku millionaire [[Zeynalabdin Taghiyev]], and now the palace building houses the [[National Museum of History of Azerbaijan]]. The building was constructed in 1893–1902 by civil engineer [[Józef Gosławski (architect)|Józef Gosławski]]. The [[palace]] was Taghiyev's gift for his wife Sona khanim. The building covers a whole quarter in the central part of the city and has an ancient planning structure. The main symmetrical facade has been built in the forms of [[Italian Renaissance]]. 
During the construction of the palace, Goslawski used classic order, but some elements of the composition and interiors of the halls were inspired by [[Architecture of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] architectural traditions. Various architectural styles were used during the construction of the palace.&lt;ref name="BakMem193"&gt;{{Harvnb|Baku architects between XIX-XX centuries|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev.jpg|thumb|left|Zeynalabdin Taghiyev in early years of 20th century]]
[[File:Tagiyev's house.jpg|thumb|left|Taghiyev's palace in 1950]]
H.Z. Taghiyev was the customer of Goslawski's architectural works. Examples of these works are Taghiyev's palace, the Muslim girls' school, Taghiyev's villa in Mardakan, Taghiyev's Caucasian-made textile factory building. Goslawski also took part in designing a dwelling house built on the corner of [[Zarifa Aliyeva]] Street (former Mercuryev Street), where H.Z.Taghiyev's theater was built. Thus, according to the scale of [[Baku]], a small complex consisting of the architect's works appeared in one of the central areas.&lt;ref name="BakMem193"/&gt;

Construction works were started in 1895 on the streets of Gorkovskaya and Mercuryevskaya. It was assumed from the words inscribed on the building facade. According to some sources, after the completion of the first part of the building, this part was given to Volzhko-Kamsky (Volzhsko-Kamsky) bank. The construction materials used for the building, as well as equipment, furniture, chandeliers and interior were brought from Russia and Western Europe and foreign craftsmen and artists were invited. It was reported that 270 people were employed as engineers, architects, carpenters and other masters at the construction of Taghiyev's palace.&lt;ref name="BakMem193"/&gt;

All equipment inside the palace was imported from Russia, France, America, Germany. In the house heat and cooling systems were installed. 40 thousand rubles of gold were worked out by the masters on the ceiling patterns. The pillars of the palace decorated with diamond and colored mirror bottles, and the floor was covered with natural birch planks from Russia. Furniture from America, pictures and curtains were brought from Germany. Only 1.2&amp;nbsp;million rubles were spent on construction of the building (without imports of furniture and equipment from abroad).&lt;ref name="HM"&gt;[http://www.azhistorymuseum.az/index.php?mod=5&amp;item=85&amp;id=25 History of the palace], www.azhistorymuseum.az&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1914, the Baku Treasury Bank headed by H.Z.Taghiyev was also in the palace. In April 1920, the Bolsheviks, who had taken power in [[Azerbaijan]], confiscated the Taghiyev palace, and a part of the State History Museum had begun to operate. In 1941–1954, the Museum of History was transferred to the Shirvanshahs palace. In 1954, the second floor of the building was returned to the History Museum. On the first floor, the Technical and Medical Documents Archive was placed. All Tagiyev's property was handed over to the Azerbaijani History Museum in just 2000. Taghiyev palace has been reconstructed several times.&lt;ref name="HM"/&gt;

[[File:Pestival logo.jpg|alt=Pestival, logo, design, insect, festival, punk, yellow, pink|thumb|Pestival Logo ]]
'''Pestival''' is an international arts festival dedicated to ‘the art of being an insect'. Pestival won the 2010 Observer Ethical Award in Conservation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/13/lucy-siegle-observer-ethical-awards-pestival-conservation-project-year Observer Ethical Awards: Pestival, Conservation Project of the Year] 2010-06-13&lt;/ref&gt; and had a three year residency at [[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]] [[London Zoo]].

It has attracted world-renowned insect experts as well as artists, such as [[Bob and Roberta Smith]], and comedians, most notably [[Robyn Hitchcock]], [[Robin Ince]] and [[Stewart Lee]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9inMwR0qgY Stewart Lee - Performance at Pestival] 2010-25-08&lt;/ref&gt; (who mentions his involvement in his stand-up act "41st Best Stand-up Ever").

==Background==
Pestival is the brainchild of Bridget Nicholls. She came up with the idea in 2004 after going to a now defunct insect film festival called FIFI in the Pyrenees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii_3Pvt9nZk Pestival "The Movie" Trailer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protest cycles''' (also known as ''cycles of contention'' or ''waves of collective action'') refers to the cyclical rise and fall in the [[social movement]] activity. [[Sidney Tarrow]] (1998) defines them as "a phase of heightened [[Social conflict|conflict]] across the [[social system]]", with "intensified interactions between challengers and authorities which can end in [[reform]], [[Political repression|repression]] and sometimes [[revolution]]".

Tarrow argues that cyclical openings in [[political opportunity]] create incentives for [[collective action]]. Those cycles begin when the authority (like the [[government]]) becomes seen as vulnerable to [[social change]], in a time when demands for [[social change]] are increasing. He defines the political opportunity as "consistent [[dimension]] of the [[political environment]] that provides [[incentive]]s for people to undertake [[collective action]] by affecting their expectations of success or failure". When the political opportunity disappears, for example because of a change in the [[public opinion]] caused by a rise in insecurity and violence, the movement dissolves.

Tarrow lists the qualities of a cycle of contention:
* a rapid [[diffusion]] of [[collective action]] and [[mobilization]] as existing social movements create political opportunities for others to act or join in;
* innovation in the forms of [[wikt:contention|contention]];
* the creation or major change in collective [[action frame]]s, [[discourse]]s and [[frame of meaning|frames of meaning]];
* coexistence of organized and unorganized activists;
* increased interaction between challengers and authorities.

Tarrow (1998) notes that "such widespread contention produces externalities that give challengers at least a temporary advantage and allows them to overcome the weaknesses in their resource base. It demands that states devise broad strategies of response that are either repressive or facilitative, or a combination of the two."

He writes that even defeated or suppressed movements leave some kind of residue behind them, and that effect of social movements, successful or failed, is cumulative in the long term, leading to new protest cycles. This is visible especially when those cycles are analysed in the historical frame. Prior to the 18th century, rebellions were usually aimed at local targets in response to local grievances, usually without many preparations and without allies in different social or ethnic groups. This has however changed in the 18th century, when [[social movements]] evolved in [[West Europe]] and [[North America]] (see also works by [[Charles Tilly]]).

'''[[Rugby union]] and [[apartheid]]''' had a complex relationship. From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non-integrated nature of [[rugby within South Africa]] drew frequent controversy. [[South African Rugby Board|South Africa]] remained a member of the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) throughout the apartheid era.

[[Halt All Racist Tours]] was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. South Africa toured [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|New Zealand in 1981]]. [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] were excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]]. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour allowed [[Māori people|Māori]] to go under the status of '[[honorary whites]]'.

No other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with [[rugby league]] over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world.

The issue affected not only black South Africans, but also [[Māori people|indigenous New Zealanders]] and to a lesser extent [[indigenous Australians]]. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as {{nrut|Fiji}} would be frowned upon.

The famous Scottish rugby commentator, [[Bill McLaren]], devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, ''Talking of Rugby'', called "Barred from the International Feast". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's "''unacceptable racist policy''", but adds "''it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.''"&lt;ref name=mclaren&gt;McLaren, p145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]], documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outwith the rugby fraternity:

{{quote|The Springboks had fulfilled all of their touring commitments through the Fifties and Sixties but the oppressive, claustrophobic political pressures overwhelmed them during the Seventies. They have not been able to play in Britain, Ireland, France or Australia since 1974, and their only major tour abroad in the last ten years to New Zealand in 1981, was full of controversy, and mass demonstrations. There is no doubt that giant steps have been taken to make Rugby totally integrated in South Africa in recent years, and their supporters feel that no sooner have they fulfilled the conditions required of them by world opinion than the goalposts are moved.

Their opponents, who are against having any sporting links with a country which practises apartheid, accept that sport in South Africa has become increasingly integrated but claim it is impossible to have normal sport in an abnormal society.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby a way of life, p112-3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|to New Zealand in 1981]].

==Governing bodies==
Like most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines:

* The [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB) for whites,&lt;ref name=Hopkins20&gt;Hopkins, p20&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[South African Rugby Football Federation|South African Rugby Federation]] (SARF) for "coloureds" i.e. people considered to be of mixed race.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;
* The [[South African African Rugby Board|South African Rugby Association]] (SARA) (originally the South African African Rugby Board) for blacks.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;

There was also the [[South African Rugby Union (SACOS)|South African Rugby Union]] (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt; However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team.

At the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;

==British and Irish Lions==
The [[British and Irish Lions]] were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. Their fondness for South Africa no doubt stemmed from the fact that the first tour they made was to South Africa. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand.

In the years 1948-1980, the Lions made no less than five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in this period was in [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]], [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]] and one final one in [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|1980]]. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions would not go back there until their [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|1997 tour]] when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed.

The Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to but in December 1985 the [[South African Rugby Board]] announced they would not be inviting the Lions side to tour South Africa the following year. Political objections to South Africa's [[apartheid]] policies including a potential boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for this International Rugby Board centenary was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by [[Clive Rowlands]] and coached by [[Mick Doyle (rugby union)|Mick Doyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffiths|first=John|title=The Lions tour that never was, Cecil Afrika's Sevens' career and Shane Williams' try-scoring rate|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/155605.html#|work=espnscrum.com|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the British and Irish Lions|year=2005|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1-84596-030-0|pages=202|author=Clem Thomas|author-link=Clem Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Māori and apartheid==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:NoMaorisNoTour.jpg|thumb|left|Early activism over the issue of sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa]] --&gt;
New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with [[South Africa]], especially through [[rugby union]]. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against [[Māori people|Māori]] players, since the [[apartheid]] political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that Māori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being Māori, this was agreed to, and Māori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some Māori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at Māori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group [[Halt All Racist Tours]] was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which Māori were central, and Māori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by [[Pākehā]] (white New Zealanders).

In 1973 a proposed [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race [[All Black]] team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and [[civil disobedience]]. Although Pākehā continued to dominate the movement, Māori were prominent within it, and in [[Auckland]] formed the [[patu]] squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.

During and after the Tour, many Māori protesters questioned Pākehā protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of Pākehā protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly Pākehā prejudice and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

==1950s==
South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.

In April 2010 it was revealed by [[Muru Walters]] that in 1956 [[Ernest Corbett]], [[Minister of Māori Affairs]], had told the [[New Zealand Māori rugby union team|Māori All Blacks]] to deliberately lose to the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] "for the future of rugby". The Māori team lost 37-0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated Māori rugby players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10638078|title=Rugby: Maori told to throw match against Boks|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s==
Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd|Verwoerd]] barred a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Rugby union|rugby]] player from touring South Africa with the [[All Blacks]], and the tour was cancelled. [[New Zealand]] made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again.

In 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, signifying a break with many of the major rugby playing nations.

In 1963, [[Lloyd McDermott]], the first Australian aborigine on the {{nrut|Australia}} team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to [[rugby league]] as a result.

[[B. J. Vorster]] took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a [[Cape Coloured|Coloured]] South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, "Dolly" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.

[[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]] describes the scene at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1969:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a huge police presence at the ground, with the terraces behind both sets of goalposts reserved exclusively for officers of the law with standing spectators restricted to just the East Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby a way of life, p112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==1970s==
[[Image:Danie Craven statue.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Statue of [[Danie Craven]] in [[Stellenbosch]].]]
[[File:Chris Laidlaw (422399075).jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Chris Laidlaw]], former All Black, politician and fierce critic of apartheid.]]

In March 1973, the Argentine government and the [[Union Argentina de Rugby]] had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to [[San Isidro Club]] to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to [[South Africa]] by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.

South Africa was the indirect cause of the [[1976 Olympic boycott]]. A [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa]] prompted African countries to demand that the [[New Zealand at the 1976 Summer Olympics|New Zealand Olympic team]] be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that [[rugby union]] was not an [[Olympic sport]] and the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] was not affiliated to the [[New Zealand Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Espy 181, pp.157–8&lt;/ref&gt; Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana.

In February, 1977, [[Danie Craven]] flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the [[British and Irish Lions]] tour of South Africa in 1980.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long last look everybody in the face. It is really a disgrace that we in South Africa have tolerated putting the Blacks and Coloured in a place, perhaps the worst place imaginable in our rugby grounds. We are now closing a book and entering a new era. South Africa will never be the same again. You know we must make changes towards a multi-racial deal not to placate or pander to overseas opinion but because it is the right and just thing.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, some, such as [[Chris Laidlaw]], later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Times have changed, however. Youth has begun to write its own rules and by the 1970s the conventions of the rugby community had begun to look a little creaky, its formalities became a bore. The cleavage was brought into sharp relief by the tragic failure of rugby to come to grips with the problem of racism in Southern Africa. The emerging reputation of the rugby player throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as an outdated, boorish oaf – a reputation derived as much from the insensitivities of the rugby community as from the intolerance of the younger generation - was given a new dimension by the quarrels over apartheid in sport. Rightly or wrongly, it has dealt the image of rugby a vicious blow, one from which it may never really recover. South Africa has now been exposed for what it really is, a malignant cancer in the corpus of rugby which has long called for the surgeon's knife. Yet the rugby community - most notably in New Zealand - still remains fatally hesitant when it comes to acting as doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Laidlaw|Laidlaw, Chris]] ''From Twickers with Love: Rugby's Universal Message'' in Hopkins, John (ed) ''Rugby'' (1979 {{ISBN|0-304-30299-6}}), p54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there were criticisms of the behaviour of some of the protesters too. [[Bill McLaren]] thought apartheid was "unacceptable", but:

{{quote|...some of the actions adopted by those aiming to stop tours were despicable.

Bette [Bill McLaren's wife] and I were referred to as 'racist scum' on our way down to Mansfield Park to see the South African Barbarians play in 1979 – a tour party comprising equal numbers of coloureds, blacks and whites. That, said the protesters, was just window dressing. When the Springboks last toured the UK, I was asked to provide commentary on their match against the Midland Counties (East) at Welford Road, [[Leicester]]. I remember having to walk the gauntlet up a narrow channel lined on each side by policemen holding back the mob. Those policemen were covered in spittle, had hats knocked off, were kicked in places where no man should be kicked, and yet took it all with stoic calm. I couldn't believe that people in the British Isles would behaved in that manner.... Constant noise outside the South Africans' hotels to try and prevent them sleeping was another unbelievable ploy that sickened decent people.&lt;ref name=Mclaren2&gt;McLaren, p137-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==1980s==
Though contacts were restricted after the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches [[Rest of the World XV|in Cardiff]] and [[Overseas Unions rugby union team|in London]] marking the IRB centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starmer-Smith|first=Nigel|authorlink=Nigel Starmer-Smith|title=Rugby - A Way of Life, An Illustrated History of Rugby|year=1986 |publisher=Lennard Books|isbn=0-7126-2662-X|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Africa was excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]].

In 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the [[Falklands War]].

The {{nrut|Soviet Union}} supposedly turned down its invitation to the [[1987 Rugby World Cup]], because of its distaste for the ''[[apartheid]]'' regime of [[South Africa]]. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa.&lt;ref name=GSE1&gt;Sorokin, px&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited.&lt;ref name=ThauSovRug2&gt;Thau, ''Soviet Rugby'', p 47&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose ''apartheid'' in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and arenas.&lt;ref name=Cambridge494&gt;Cambridge, p494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the years, [[Albert Ferasse|Ferasse]] has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with South Africa. At one point Moscow threatened to set up a rival Federation, but the Rumanians, with whom the French have long had good relationships, stood by France. Moscow tried again later by threatening to call off the {{nrut|France}} v. {{nrut|USSR}} match in [[Toulouse]] in November 1978. Once again Ferasse held firm and the Russians went to France, where they were beaten 29-7&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, P24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1981, {{nrut|South Africa}} was due to play the Mid-West in [[Chicago]]. To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46-12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.&lt;ref name=RugbyDis1&gt;Cotton, p29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 a [[World XV]], sanctioned by the IRB and funded by [[South African Breweries]], played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20-19 at [[Newlands Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]] and the second test 22-16 on September 2 at Ellis Park in [[Johannesburg]] .

====South Africa in New Zealand, 1981====
{{main|1981 South Africa rugby union tour}}
[[File:1981-springbok-tour-auckland-kingsland-station.jpg|thumb|right|Police officers guarding a barbed wire perimeter around [[Eden Park]] near [[Kingsland railway station, New Zealand|Kingsland railway station]] in New Zealand.]]

The 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260&gt;Griffiths, p260-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Two games had to be cancelled.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at [[Timaru]] was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;

The final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the "Crazy [[Biggles]] Test". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; All-Black prop [[Gary Knight (rugby player)|Gary Knight]] was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;

Musician [[Bruce Russell (musician)|Bruce Russell]] received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Luke|title=The Aesthetics of Distribution: a conversation with Bruce Russell|url=http://www.audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|work=The National Grid|accessdate=28 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209182453/http://audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|archive-date=9 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the [[University of Otago]] at the time.

It was a tight game, with [[Allan Hewson]], the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25–22.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The role of the [[NZ police]] also became more controversial as a result of the tour.

The [[NZRFU]] constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. [[Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union|Two lawyers successfully sued it]], claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.

====New Zealand Cavaliers====
A "rebel tour" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour The 1981 Springbok rugby tour – A country divided]. New Zealand History Online.&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended.

The All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the [[apartheid]] régime (1990–1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the [[New Zealand Cavaliers]] but often advertised in [[South Africa]] as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.

Of the 30 players who had been selected for the [[All Blacks|All Black]] tour, only [[David Kirk]] and [[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments&amp;mdash;a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/cavaliers-rugby-tour-1985]

On their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the "Baby Blacks". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.

====[[South American Jaguars]]====
The Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.

While many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognized by [[Union Argentina de Rugby]], a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and [[Rhodesia]]n ones, due to the politics of those countries.  This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the ''Pumas'' to play a match in Rhodesia during the [[1971 Argentina rugby union tour of South Africa|tour in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uar.com.ar/pdf/memorias/1971.pdf Union Argentina dr Rugby Memorias 1971] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101073132/http://uar.com.ar/pdf/memorias/1971.pdf |date=2012-11-01 }} pag.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-apartheid era==

===[[1995 Rugby World Cup]]===
{{see also|Presidency of Nelson Mandela}}
After his election in 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the [[South African national rugby union team|Springboks]], as South Africa hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]].

Prior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.

During the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]] and [[France national rugby union team|France]]. They then met [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Final|1995 Rugby World Cup Final]] at [[Ellis Park Stadium]]. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a [[drop goal]] from [[Joel Stransky]].

During the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the [[Webb Ellis Cup]] while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.

This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as [[F.W. de Klerk]] later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=525–527}}; {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|title=Mandela rallies Springboks|date=6 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 October 2008|archivedate=25 February 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EhlM6rLh?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}; {{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/portal/2007/10/19/ftmandela119.xml |title=How Nelson Mandela won the rugby World Cup |date=19 October 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=28 October 2008 |first=John |last=Carlin |archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EhlMWoPg?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3634426/How-Nelson-Mandela-won-the-rugby-World-Cup.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, [[Winnie Mandela|Winnie]], accused the [[ANC]] of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=491, 496, 524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=517, 536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, ''Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation'', that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid South Africa]].

'''Saint Ursula''' ([[Latin]] for 'little female bear') is a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] [[Celtic Christianity|Christian]] [[saint]], died on October 21, 383. Her [[feast day]] in the pre-1970 [[General Roman Calendar]] is October 21. There is little definite information about her and the anonymous group of holy virgins who accompanied her and on some uncertain date were killed at [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; They remain in the [[Roman Martyrology]],&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2004), p. 582&lt;/ref&gt; although their commemoration does not appear in the simplified Calendarium Romanum Generale ([[General Roman Calendar]]) of the 1970 Missale Romanum.&lt;ref&gt;''Missale Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis, 1970), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence of her is a 4th- or 5th-century inscription from the [[Basilica of St. Ursula, Cologne|Church of St. Ursula]], located on Ursulaplatz in Cologne which states that the ancient basilica had been restored on the site where some holy virgins were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074498/Saint-Ursula Saint Ursula – Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her legendary status comes from a medieval story&lt;ref name=poncelet&gt;Poncelet, Albert. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15225d.htm "St. Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins"]. ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. Accessed 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; that she was a princess who, at the request of her father King [[Dionotus]] of [[Dumnonia]] in south-west Britain, set sail along with 11,000 virginal handmaidens to join her future husband, the pagan governor [[Conan Meriadoc]] of [[Armorica]]. After a miraculous storm brought them over the sea in a single day to a Gaulish port, Ursula declared that before her marriage she would undertake a pan-European [[pilgrimage]]. She headed for Rome with her followers and persuaded the Pope, [[Cyriacus (disambiguation)|Cyriacus]] (unknown in the pontifical records, though from late 384 AD there was a [[Pope Siricius]]), and Sulpicius, [[bishop of Ravenna]], to join them. After setting out for Cologne, which was being besieged by [[Huns]], all the virgins were beheaded in a massacre. The Huns' leader fatally shot Ursula with a bow and arrow in about 383 AD (the date varies).

==Legend of the Eleven Thousand Companions==
[[Image:Hans Memling 074.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Hans Memling]], ''[[St. Ursula Shrine|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]'']]

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1911) states that "this legend, with its countless variants and increasingly fabulous developments, would fill more than a hundred pages. Various characteristics of it were already regarded with suspicion by certain medieval writers, and since [[Baronius]] have been universally rejected."&lt;ref name=poncelet/&gt; Neither [[Jerome]] nor [[Gregory of Tours]] refers to Ursula in his writings.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|title=Ursula, St |volume=27 |pages=803-804 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/803/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory of Tours mentions the legend of the [[Theban Legion]], to whom a church that once stood in Cologne was dedicated.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt; The most important hagiographers ([[Bede]], [[Ado (archbishop)|Ado]], [[Usuard]], [[Notker the Stammerer]], [[Rabanus Maurus|Hrabanus Maurus]]) of the early [[Middle Ages]] also do not enter Ursula under October 21, her feast day.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt;

A legend resembling Ursula's appeared in the first half of the tenth century; it does not mention the name ''Ursula'', but rather gives the leader of the martyred group as ''Pinnosa'' or ''Vinnosa''. Pinnosa's relics were transferred about 947 from Cologne to Essen,&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=ZzurV89qYvgC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=pinnosa+essen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KG8AbEfmHz&amp;sig=BVrMc-TTGkyLNoNYG5B6n30faqE&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRyqPe0tXQAhXJWRQKHbmgAp0Q6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=pinnosa%20essen&amp;f=false|title=St. Ursula and the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne: Relics, Reliquaries and the Visual Culture of Group Sanctity in Late Medieval Europe|last=Montgomery|first=Scott B.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783039118526|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from this point forward Ursula's role was emphasized.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Levison, 'Das Werden der Ursula Legende', in: ''Bonner Jahrbücher'' 132 (1927), 1-164.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 970, for example, the first ''Passio Ursulae'' was written, naming Ursula rather than Pinnosa as the group's leader (although Pinnosa is mentioned as one of the group's members). This change might also be due in part to the discovery at this time of an epitaph speaking of Ursula, the "innocent virgin".&lt;ref name="Montgomery"/&gt;

According to [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], a 12th-century British cleric and writer, Ursula was the daughter of [[Dionotus]], ruler of Cornwall. However, this may have been based on his misreading of the words ''Deo notus'' in the second ''Passio Ursulae'', written about 1105. The plot may have been influenced by a story told by the 6th-century writer [[Procopius]] about a British queen sailing with 100,000 soldiers to the mouth of the Rhine in order to compel her unwilling groom Radigis, king of the [[Warini|Varni]], to marry her.

While there was a tradition of virgin martyrs in Cologne by the fifth century, their number may have been limited to between two and eleven, according to different sources. Yet the cleric [[Wandelbert]] of the [[Abbey of Prüm]] stated in his [[martyrology]] in 848 that the number of martyrs counted "thousands of saints" who were slaughtered on the boards of the River Rhine.&lt;ref&gt;Levison, ''Das Werden der Ursula Legende''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 11,000 were first mentioned in the late 9th century; suggestions as to where this number came from have included the reading of the name ''Undecimillia'' or ''Ximillia'' as a number, or reading the abbreviation ''XI. M. V.'' as 'eleven thousand [in Roman numerals] virgins' rather than 'eleven martyred virgins'. One scholar has suggested that in the eighth or ninth century, when the relics of virgin martyrs were found, they included those of a girl named Ursula, who was eleven years old—in [[Latin]], ''undecimilia''. This was subsequently misread or misinterpreted as ''undicimila'' ('eleven thousand'), thus producing the legend of the 11,000 virgins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/74550 Santi Beati: Sant'Orsola e compagne]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, however, the stone bearing the virgin Ursula's name states that she lived eight years and two months. Another theory is that there was only one virgin martyr, named Undecimilla, "which by some blundering monk was changed into eleven thousand".&lt;ref name="rochester1"&gt;[http://www.history.rochester.edu/pennymag/212/cologne.htm ''The Penny Magazine'': Cologne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103013103/http://www.history.rochester.edu/pennymag/212/cologne.htm |date=2011-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that ''cum [...] militibus'', 'with [...] soldiers', was misread as ''cum [...] millibus'', 'with [...] thousands'.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1" /&gt; Most contemporary sources, however, cling to the number 11,000. The ''Passio'' from the 970s tries to bridge conflicting traditions by stating that the eleven maidens each commanded a ship containing one thousand virgins. Implicitly, the legend also refers to the twelve heavenly legions, mentioned in Matthew 23:53.

[[File:StaUrsulaCepleanu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (German school, 16th century)]]

The Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne holds the alleged [[relics]] of Ursula and her 11,000 companions.&lt;ref name="rochester1"/&gt; It contains what has been described as a "veritable tsunami of ribs, shoulder blades, and femurs ... arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words."&lt;ref name="autogenerated169"&gt;Quigley, Christine (2001) ''Skulls and Skeletons: Human Bone Collections and Accumulations'', Jefferson, N.C.; London: McFarland; p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, "some of the heads encased in silver, others covered with stuff of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls."&lt;ref name="rochester1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated169"/&gt; The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens. When skeletons of little children ranging in age from two months to seven years were found buried with one of the sacred virgins in 1183, Hermann Joseph, a [[Praemonstratensian]] [[canon (priest)|canon]] at Steinfeld, explained that they were distant relatives of the eleven thousand.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt; A surgeon of eminence was once banished from Cologne for suggesting that, among the collection of bones which are said to pertain to the heads, there were several belonging to full-grown [[English Mastiff|mastiff]]s.&lt;ref name="rochester1"/&gt; The relics may have come from a forgotten burial ground.&lt;ref name=ecole&gt;[http://ecole.evansville.edu/glossary/ursula.html The Ecole Glossary: Ursula] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204143340/http://ecole.evansville.edu/glossary/ursula.html |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been theorized that Ursula is a Christianized form of the goddess [[Freya]], who welcomed the souls of dead maidens.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"/&gt; Other 19th-century scholars have referred to the goddesses [[Nehalennia]], [[Nerthus]] and [[Holda]].

Nothing reliable is known about the girls said to have been martyred at the spot. A [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] of Saint Ursula and her companions in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of Saint [[Hilarion]], formerly in the [[General Roman Calendar]] on October 21, was removed in 1969, because "their ''Passio'' is entirely fabulous: nothing, not even their names, is known about the virgin saints who were killed at Cologne at some uncertain time".&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum''. Città del Vaticano: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969; p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are still mentioned in the [[Roman Martyrology]], the official but professedly incomplete list of saints recognized by the Catholic Church, which speaks of them as follows: "At Cologne in Germany, commemoration of virgin saints who ended their life in martyrdom for Christ in the place where afterwards the city's basilica was built, dedicated in honour of the innocent young girl Ursula who is looked on as their leader."&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum''. Città del Vaticano: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

* The town of [[Binangonan]] in the province of Rizal in the Philippines also has a church dedicated to St. Ursula. Her feast is still celebrated by the parish every October 21. A fluvial procession at Laguna Lake is carried out to commemorate Ursula's journey. Her fluvial parade is made up of a group of men and women in colorful, traditional Filipino costumes dancing in the streets with the image of Ursula and chanting joyfully. Prior to her feast day, a nine-day [[novena]] is held at the 224-year-old Sta. Ursula Church. During this novena, a woman is assigned as cantor to sing a chant in honor of Ursula.

* The [[Order of Ursulines]], founded in 1535 by [[Angela Merici]], and devoted to the [[education of young girls]], has also helped to spread Ursula's name throughout the world. St. Ursula was named the patron saint of school girls.
* [[Whitelands College]], the oldest educational institution of the [[Church of England]], has been under the patronage of St. Ursula since its formation. She is the patron saint of the College's chapel.
* [[Michael Haydn]] wrote the [[Missa in honorem Sanctae Ursulae]] to commemorate the day Ursula Oswald joined a Benedictine Abbey.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Cordula==
Cordula was, according to a legend in an edition of the [[Roman Martyrology]] presented in an English translation on a [[traditionalist Catholic]] website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breviary.net/martyrology/mart10/mart1022.htm |title=Martyrology; Oct 22 |accessdate=2009-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031025716/http://breviary.net/martyrology/mart10/mart1022.htm |archivedate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Ursula's companions: "Being terrified by the punishments and slaughter of the others, Cordula hid herself, but repenting her deed, on the next day she declared herself to the Huns of her own accord, and thus was the last of them all to receive the crown of martyrdom". In his ''Albert the Great'',&lt;ref&gt;R. Washbourne, 1876, 360–362&lt;/ref&gt; Joachim Sighart recounts that, on February 14, 1277, while work was being done at the church of St John the Baptist (''Johanniterkirche'') in Cologne, Cordula's body was discovered; it was fragrant and on her forehead was written: ''Cordula, Queen and Virgin''. When [[Albert the Great]] heard of the finding, he sang mass and [[translation (relics)|transferred]] the relics. Later, Cordula's supposed remains were moved to [[Königswinter]] and [[Rimini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cordula.ws/quotes/stcordula.html|title= Cordula's Web – St Cordula's Day. |last=Cordula's Web Editors|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cordula's head was claimed by the Cathedral of [[Palencia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.asp?id=49&amp;venue=7|title=Artwork highlights, Liverpool museums|website=www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is listed in the Roman Martyrology on October 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boston-catholic-journal.com/roman-martrylogy-in-english/roman-martyrology-october-in-english.htm#October_22nd|title=Roman Martyrology October, in English|last=Editor|website=www.boston-catholic-journal.com|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sunniva==
There are striking parallels between the 11th-century legend of Ursula and the story of [[Sunniva|Sunniva of Selje]]. Their names were sometimes confused by contemporaries. Both saints were considered to be Christian princesses who fled their homeland by ship in order to postpone or avert an undesired marriage with a pagan king. Both were accompanied by a large group of associates, both became victims of hostile foes. The development of their legends may have been interdependent. The martyrdom of Sunniva, however, took place after the first draft of the ''Passio Ursulae''.

'''''Sao Mi Zhou''''' ({{zh|t=掃迷帚|s=扫迷帚|p=sǎo mí zhǒu|l=The broom that sweeps away superstition}}) is a Chinese [[serial novel]] in 24 installments published in 1903 under the pseudonym Zhuàngzhě (壯者; lit. "strong man"). The word "superstition" ({{zh|c=迷信|p=míxìn}}) had just been introduced in the Chinese language (from [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) a few years earlier by [[Liang Qichao]].&lt;ref&gt;Goossaert, Vincent, and David Palmer, ''The Religious Question in Modern China'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The novel attempted to convince people to oppose traditional Chinese religious ideas, which the author saw as backward and an obstacle to progress. Most of the novel is built around a discussion on the topic between two brothers.

'''Sascha-Film''', in full '''Sascha-Filmindustrie AG''' and from 1933 '''Tobis-Sascha-Filmindustrie AG''', was the largest [[Austria]]n film production company of the [[silent film]] and early [[sound film]] period.

==History==
The business was established in 1910 by [[Alexander Kolowrat|Alexander Joseph "Sascha", Count Kolowrat-Krakowsky]] as the ''Sascha-Filmfabrik'' ("Sascha Film Factory") in [[Pfraumberg - Přimda]] in [[Bohemia]], and relocated in 1912 to [[Vienna]]. On 10 September 1918, after the merger with the [[film distributor]]s Philipp &amp; Pressburger, the business became the ''Sascha-Filmindustrie AG''.

With [[epic film]]s such as [[Alexander Korda]]'s ''[[Prinz und Bettelknabe]]'' ("Prince and Beggar") (1920) and [[Michael Curtiz]]'s ''[[Sodom und Gomorrha]]'' (1922) as well as ''[[Die Sklavenkönigin]]'' ("The Slave Queen") (1924), the company rose to be one of the most successful European film producers.

In 1933 the German enterprise '''Tobis-Tonbild-Syndikat''' was amalgamated with the company, known formally from then on as the '''Tobis-Sascha-Filmindustrie AG'''.

In 1938, in the context of the [[Anschluss]], by which Austria was annexed to the [[Third Reich]], the concern passed into the ownership of the [[National Socialist]] government and was re-founded as [[Wien-Film|Wien-Film GmbH]]. Its best-known director of the period to the end of the war was [[Gustav Ucicky]].

After the end of the [[World War II|war]] the name Sascha-Film was re-established for a couple of decades, and in the 1950s and 1960s produced light entertainment films.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9066">'''Sovereignty goddess''' is a scholarly term, almost exclusively used in [[Celtic Studies]] (though parallels for the idea have been claimed in other traditions, usually under the label ''[[hieros gamos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop, ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), s.v. ''Sovereignty, Lady''.&lt;/ref&gt; The term denotes a goddess who, personifying a territory, confers [[sovereignty]] upon a king by marrying or having sex with him. Some narratives of this type correspond to folk-tale motif D732, ''the [[Loathly Lady]]'', in [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Stith Thompson's ''Motif-Index'']]. This trope has been identified as 'one of the most well-known and often studied thematic elements of Celtic myth'.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Simmons, 'Sovereignty Myth', in &lt;i&gt;Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Proinsias Mac Cana, ‘Aspects of the theme of king and goddess in Irish literature’, ''Études Celtiques'', 7 (1955-56), 76-114, 356-413 and 8 (1958-9), 59-65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. J. Doan, 'Sovereignty Aspects in the Roles of Women in Medieval Irish and Welsh Society', ''Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium'', 5 (1985), 87-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. R. A. Breatnach, 'The Lady and the King: A Theme of Irish Literature', ''Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review'', Vol. 42, No. 167 (Autumn, 1953), 321-36; https://www.jstor.org/stable/30098456.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also, however, been criticised in recent research for leading to 'an attempt to prove that every strong female character in medieval Welsh and Irish tales is a souvenir of a Celtic sovereignty goddess'.&lt;ref&gt;Erica J. Sessle, 'Exploring the Limitations of the Sovereignty Goddess through the Role of Rhiannon', ''Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium'', 14 (1994), 9-13 (p. 9), https://www.jstor.org/stable/20557270.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical evidence==

There is some evidence in Greek and Roman accounts of historical Celtic women that leading women such as [[Camma]] and [[Cartimandua]] might in antiquity actually have been associated with goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Simmons, 'Sovereignty Myth', in &lt;i&gt;Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), s.v.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that medieval Irish rituals inaugurating a new king sometimes took the form of a ''banais ríghe'' ('wedding-feast of kingship'), because the king was imagined symbolically to be marrying his dominion,&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop, ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), s.v. ''Sovereignty, Lady''; http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095444376.&lt;/ref&gt; and that similar rituals known by the term ''[[feis]]'' might involve both sexual activity, and horses (in turn evoking the idea, prominent in modern scholarship, of Celtic [[Horse goddess (disambiguation)|horse-goddesses]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;). Most luridly, [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], in his 1188 ''[[Topographia Hibernica]]'', claimed that at the inauguration of the king of the [[Cenél Conaill]], the successor to the kingship publicly sexually embraced a white mare. This would then be slaughtered and cooked into a broth in which the king bathed, before he and his people drank it.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Seán Duffy (New York: Routledge, 2005), s.v. ''Feis''&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the type-text for the idea of the sovereignty goddess is the medieval Irish ''[[Echtra Mac nEchach]]'' ('the adventures of the sons of Eochaid'), in which a hideously ugly woman offers the young men water in return for a kiss. Only Niall kisses her with conviction, and moreover has sex with her, whereupon the woman becomes beautiful and utters the verse&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Simmons, 'Sovereignty Myth', in &lt;i&gt;Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Verse translation|
|
[[King of Tara]], I am the sovereignty [Old Irish: ''in flaithes''];
I will tell you its great benefit.
[It will belong] to your descendants forever, above every kindred;
that is the true reason for which I speak.&lt;ref&gt;''Echtra Mac nEchach'', trans. by John Carey, in ''The Celtic Heroic Age: Literary Sources for Ancient Celtic Europe &amp; Early Ireland &amp; Wales'', ed. by John T. Koch and John Carey, Celtic Studies Publications, 1, 4th edn (Aberystwyth: Celtic Studies Publications, 2003), pp. 203-8 (at pp. 206-7).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The story is transparently a pseudo-history composed in support of the claim of the [[Uí Néill]] dynasty to dominance in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop, ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), s.v. ''Sovereignty, Lady''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The fairly strong evidence for a tradition of sovereignty goddesses in early Ireland has led to a fashion in Celtic scholarship for interpreting other female characters as [[Euhemerisation|euhemerised]] sovereignty goddesses, or for arguing that the portrayals of women have been influenced by traditions of sovereignty goddesses.

This way of reading medieval Celtic female characters goes back to the 1920s, and is related to the [[myth and ritual school]] of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Erica J. Sessle, 'Exploring the Limitations of the Sovereignty Goddess through the Role of Rhiannon', ''Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium'', 14 (1994), 9-13, https://www.jstor.org/stable/20557270, citing Tomas Ó Máille, 'Medb Chruachna', ''Zeitschrfit für celtische Philologie'', 17 (1928), 129-63.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the protagonist of the Welsh ''[[Canu Heledd]]'' is sometimes read in this way,&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Rowland, ''A Selection of Early Welsh Saga Poems'' (London: The Modern Humanities Research Association, 2014),  p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; and figures as diverse as [[Guenevere]];&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sherman Loomis, ''The Grail, from Celtic Myth to Christian Symbol'' (Cardiff: Wales University Press, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flint F. Johnson, ''Origins of Arthurian Romances'' (Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cailleach Bhéirre]];&lt;ref&gt;Jo Radner, 'The Hag of Beare: The Folklore of a Sovereignty Goddess', ''Tennessee Folklore Society Bulletin, 40 (1970), 75-81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medb]];&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Ó Máille, 'Medb Chruachna', ''Zeitschrfit für celtische Philologie'', 17 (1928), 129-63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhiannon]];&lt;ref&gt;Catherine A. McKenna, 'The Theme of Sovereignty in ''Pwyll''’, ''Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies'', 29 (1980), 35-52.&lt;/ref&gt; warrior women such as the [[Morrígan]], [[Macha]] and [[Badb]];&lt;ref&gt;Francoise Le Roux and Christian-J. Guyonvarc'h, ''La Souveraineté guerriére de l'Irlande: Mórrígan, Bodb, Macha'' (Rennes, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; and the loathly lady of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Wife of Bath's Tale]]''&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Eisner, ''Tale of Wonder: Source Study for the Wife of Bath's Tale'' (Wexford, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt; have been viewed in the same light.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Simmons, 'Sovereignty Myth', in &lt;i&gt;Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by John T. Koch (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2005), s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent scholarship has tended to criticise these assumptions, in both medieval Irish and related material.&lt;ref&gt;Roberta Frank, ‘The Lay of the Land in Skaldic Poetry’, in &lt;i&gt;Myth in Early Northwest Europe&lt;/i&gt;, ed. by Stephen O. Glosecki, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 320/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 21 (Tempe, AZ: Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2007), pp. 175–96.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the portrayals of [[Gormflaith ingen Donncadha]] (d. 861), [[Gormflaith ingen Flann Sinna]] (c. 870–948), and [[Gormflaith ingen Murchada]] (960–1030) have all been read as showing influence from the idea of the sovereignty goddess, but this has been shown to rest on little evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Máire Ní Mhaonaigh, 'Tales of Three Gormlaiths in Medieval Irish Literature', ''Ériu'', 52 (2002), 1-24 (2-4). https://www.jstor.org/stable/30008176.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the role of the Empress of Constantinople, who appears in the Middle Welsh ''[[Peredur]]'' but not in its French source, has been found to be open to other readings.&lt;ref&gt;Natalia I. Petrovskaia, 'Dating ''Peredur'': New Light on Old Problems', ''Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium'', 29 (2009), 223-43 (pp. 224-25); https://www.jstor.org/stable/41219642.&lt;/ref&gt; Even where female characters might historically owe something to traditions of sovereignty goddesses, reading them primarily through this lens has been argued to be limiting and reductive.&lt;ref&gt;Erica J. Sessle, 'Exploring the Limitations of the Sovereignty Goddess through the Role of Rhiannon', ''Proceedings of the Harvard Celtic Colloquium'', 14 (1994), 9-13 (p. 9), https://www.jstor.org/stable/20557270.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8299">The '''Staggered truss system''' is a type of structural steel framing used in high-rise buildings. The system consists of a series of story-high trusses spanning the total width between two rows of exterior columns and arranged in a staggered pattern on adjacent column lines.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;http://aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Documents/Engineering_Journal4/263_EJ_scalzi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[William LeMessurier]], the founder [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] engineering firm [[LeMessurier Consultants]] has been credited in developing this award winning system&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Modern_Steel_Construction3/March_1999_Issue/9903_news.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

==History==
The staggered truss system came about due to sponsored research at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Departments of Architecture and Civil Engineering&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; in the 1960s by U.S. Steel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The research attempted to achieve the same floor-to-floor height with steel as you could with flat plate concrete.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  The system was presented at the 1966 AISC Conference (the predecessor to the current [[North American Steel Construction Conference]]).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Additional benefits  discovered were&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; high resistance to wind loads and versatility of floor layout with large column-free areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

It has been used with on a number of [[LeMessurier Consultants]] work in hotels including Lafayette Place Hotel in Boston and the [[Aladdin Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Other locations that use this system include the Resorts International
Hotel in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Documents/Engineering_Journal4/266_EJ_hassler.pdf Erecting the Staggered- truss System: A View from the Field&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Embassy Suites hotel in New York City,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/resources/conteduc/archives/0202aisc-1.asp Architectural Record |Benefits of Staggered Truss Systems in Multi-Story Residential and Other Applications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baruch College]] Academic Center in New York City,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Trump Taj-Mahal in Atlantic City NJ,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and the Renaissance Hotel in Nashville TN&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Description==
The staggered truss system for steel framing is an efficient structural system for high-rise apartments, hotels, motels, dormitories, and hospitals. The arrangement of story-high
trusses in a staggered pattern at alternate column lines provide large column-free areas for room layouts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; These column free areas can be utilized for ballrooms, concourses, and other large areas.

The staggered truss structural system consists of story-high steel trusses placed on alternating column lines on each floor so that the long axis of one truss is always between the trusses on the floor below.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The system staggers trusses on a 12’ module, meaning that on any given floor the trusses were 24’ apart.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The interaction of the floors, trusses, and columns makes the structure perform as a single unit, thereby taking maximum advantage of the strength and rigidity of all the
components simultaneously. Each component performs its particular function, totally dependent upon the others for its performance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The total frame behaves as a [[cantilever beam]] when subjected to lateral loads. All columns are placed on the exterior wall of the building and function as the [[flanges]] of the beam, while the trusses which span the total transverse width between columns function as the web of the [[cantilever]] beam.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

While earlier staggered truss systems utilized channels for web diagonals and verticals, today most of the trusses are designed with hollow structural sections (HSS) for vertical and diagonal members because they are more structurally efficient and easier to fabricate. The trusses are fabricated with camber to compensate for dead load and are transported to the site, stored and then erected—generally in one piece.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Fabrication of this type of structure requires certified welders and overhead cranes capable of lifting 10 to 15-ton trusses and columns for projects up to 20 stories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Fabrication involves the following components: Columns, Spandrel Beams, Trusses, Secondary Columns &amp; Beams and the Floor System.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Advantages==
*Large clear span open areas for ballrooms, or other wide concourse are possible at the first floor level, because columns are located only on the exterior faces of the building. This allows for spaces as much as 60 feet in each direction with columns often only appearing on the perimeter of a structure. This also increases design flexibility especially for atrium placement and open space floor plans. 
* Floor spans may be short bay lengths, while providing two column bay spacing for room arrangements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; This results in low floor-to-floor heights. Typically, an 8'-8" floor-to-floor height is achieved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  
* Columns have minimum bending moments due to gravity and wind loads, because of the cantilever action of the double-planar system of framing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
* Columns are oriented with their strong axis resisting lateral forces in the longitudinal direction of the building.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
* Maximum live load reductions may be realized because tributary areas may be adjusted to suit code requirements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
* Foundations are on column lines only and may consist of two strip footings.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Because the vertical loads are concentrated at a few column points, less foundation formwork is required.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 
* Drift is small, because the total frame is acting as a stiff truss with direct axial loads only acting in most structural members. Secondary bending occurs only in the chords of the trusses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
* High strength steels may be used to advantage, because all truss members and columns are subjected, for all practical purposes, to axial loads only.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; 
* A lightweight steel structure is achieved by the use of high strength steels and an efficient framing system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Since this reduces the weight of the superstructure, there is a substantial cost savings in foundation work.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 
* Faster to erect than comparable concrete structures. Once two floors are erected, window installation can start and stay right behind the steel and floor erection. No time is lost in waiting for other trades, such as bricklayers, to start work. Except for foundations, topping slab, and grouting, all "wet" trades are eliminated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 
* Fire resistance; steel is localized to the trusses, which only occur at every 58-to-70-feet on a floor, so the fireproofing operation can be completed efficiently. Furthermore, the trusses are typically placed within [[demising wall]]s and it is possible that the necessary fire rating can be entirely by enclosing the trusses with gypsum wallboard. Finally, if spray-on protection is desired, the applied thickness can be kept to a minimum due to the compact nature of the truss elements.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

[[Image:Systems thinking about the society.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Impression of systems thinking about society]]

'''Systems science''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that studies the nature of [[system]]s—from simple to complex—in [[nature]], [[society]], [[cognition]], [[engineering]], [[technology]] and [[science]] itself. To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems.&lt;ref&gt; G. E. Mobus &amp; M. C. Kalton, ''Principles of Systems Science'', 2015, New York:Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; The field aims to develop interdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business management, engineering,  and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip M'Pherson]] (1974, p. 229); as cited by: Hieronymi, A. (2013), Understanding Systems Science: A Visual and Integrative Approach. ''Syst. Res.''. {{doi|10.1002/sres.2215}}. He defined systems science as "the ordered arrangement of knowledge acquired from the study of systems in the observable world, together with the application of this knowledge to the design of man-made systems."&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems science covers [[formal sciences]] such as [[complex systems]], [[cybernetics]], [[dynamical systems theory]], [[information theory]], [[linguistics]] or [[systems theory]]. It has applications in the field of the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as [[control theory]], [[operations research]], social systems theory, [[systems biology]], [[system dynamics]], [[human factors]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems engineering]] and [[systems psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Francis Heylighen]] in "What are Cybernetics and Systems Science?" on ''Principia Cybernetica Web'' (1999) systems science is an "[[Fields of science|academic domain]], that touches virtually all traditional disciplines, from [[mathematics]], [[technology]] and [[biology]] to [[philosophy]] and the [[social sciences]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various '[[boundary conditions]]' can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.

== Theories ==
Since the emergence of [[Systems theory|general systems research]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Flood]] (1993) ''Dealing with Complexity: : An Introduction to the Theory and Application of Systems Science.'' p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Systems theory|systems thinking]] and systems science have developed into many [[theoretical]] frameworks.

:Systems design is the process of "establishing and specifying the optimum system component configuration for achieving specific goal or objective."&lt;ref name="AD 1971"/&gt; For example in computing, systems design can define the [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[systems architecture]]  which includes many sub-architectures including [[software]] architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and [[data]], as well as security, information, and others,  for a [[computer system]] to satisfy specified [[requirement]]s.
;System dynamics
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behavior of [[complex system]]s over time. It offers "simulation technique for modeling business and social systems,"&lt;ref&gt;Center for Complex Adaptive Agent Systems Simulation Argonne National Laboratory (2007) ''Managing Business Complexity : Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation: Discovering Strategic Solutions with Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation.'' Oxford University Press. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behavior of the entire system.  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying complex systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].
;Systems engineering
:[[Systems engineering]] (SE) is an interdisciplinary field of [[engineering]], that focuses on the development and organization of complex [[system]]s. It is the "art and science of creating whole solutions to complex problems,"&lt;ref&gt;Derek K. Hitchins (2008) ''Systems Engineering: A 21st Century Systems Methodology.'' p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  for example: [[signal processing]] systems, [[control system]]s and [[communication system]], or other forms of high-level modelling and design in specific fields of engineering.
;Systems methodologies
:There are several types of Systems Methodologies, that is, disciplines for analysis of systems. For example:
:* [[Soft systems methodology]] (SSM) : in the field of organizational studies is an approach to organisational process modelling, and it can be used both for general [[problem]] solving and in the management of change. It was developed in [[England]] by academics at the [[University of Lancaster]] Systems Department through a ten-year Action Research programme.
:* [[System development methodology]] (SDM) in the field of IT development is a variety of structured, organized processes for developing information technology and embedded software systems.
:* [[Viable systems approach]] (vSa) is a methodology useful for the understanding and governance of complex phenomena; it has been successfully proposed in the field of management, decision making, marketing and service.
;Systems theories
:[[Systems theory]] is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[complex system]]s in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]].  More specifically, it is a conceptual framework by which one can analyze and/or describe any group of objects that work in concert to produce some result.
;Systems science
:Systems sciences are scientific disciplines partly based on systems thinking such as [[chaos theory]], [[complex systems]], [[control theory]], [[cybernetics]], [[sociotechnical systems theory]], [[systems biology]], [[systems chemistry]], [[systems ecology]], [[systems psychology]] and the already mentioned systems dynamics, systems engineering, and systems theory.

== Fields ==
Systems sciences cover [[formal sciences]] like [[dynamical systems theory]] and applications in the natural and social sciences and engineering, such as social systems theory and [[system dynamics]].

{{Main|List of systems scientists}}
General systems scientists can be divided into different generations. The founders of the systems movement like [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], [[James Grier Miller]], [[George J. Klir]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]] were all born between 1900 and 1920. They all came from different natural and social science disciplines and joined forces in the 1950s to establish the general systems theory [[paradigm]]. Along with the organization of their efforts a first generation of systems scientists rose.

Among them were other scientists like Ackoff, Ashby, Margaret Mead and Churchman, who popularized the systems concept in the 1950s and 1960s. These scientists inspired and educated a second generation with more notable scientists like [[Ervin Laszlo]] (1932) and [[Fritjof Capra]] (1939), who wrote about systems theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Others got acquainted and started studying these works in the 1980s and started writing about it since the 1990s. [[Debora Hammond]] can be seen as a typical representative of these third generation of general systems scientists.

== Organizations ==
{{Main|List of systems sciences organizations}}

The [[International Society for the Systems Sciences]] (ISSS) is an organisation for interdisciplinary collaboration and synthesis of systems sciences. The ISSS is unique among systems-oriented institutions in terms of the breadth of its scope, bringing together scholars and practitioners from academic, business, government, and non-profit organizations. Based on fifty years of tremendous interdisciplinary research from the scientific study of complex systems to interactive approaches in management and community development. This society was initially conceived in 1954 at the Stanford [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Ralph Gerard]], and [[Anatol Rapoport]].

In the field of systems science the [[International Federation for Systems Research]] (IFSR) is an international federation for global and local societies in the field of systems science. This federation is a non-profit, scientific and educational [[non-profit organization|agency]] founded in 1981, and constituted of some thirty member organizations from various countries. The overall purpose of this Federation is to advance [[cybernetic]] and [[systems research]] and systems applications and to serve the international systems community.

The best known research institute in the field is the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI) located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States, dedicated to the study of [[complex systems]]. This institute was founded in 1984 by [[George Cowan]], [[David Pines]], [[Stirling Colgate]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]], [[Nick Metropolis]], Herb Anderson, Peter A. Carruthers, and Richard Slansky. All but Pines and Gell-Mann were scientists with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. SFI's original mission was to disseminate the notion of a separate [[interdisciplinary]] research area, [[complex adaptive system|complexity theory]] referred to at SFI as [[complexity science]]. Recently, [[IIT Jodhpur]] in Rajasthan, India started inculcating system science and engineering to its students through Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate programs. This makes it the first institution to offer [[system science]] education to students in India.

The first three novels in the series, ''[[Griffin and Sabine]]'', ''[[Sabine's Notebook]]'' and ''[[The Golden Mean (novel)|The Golden Mean]]'', form the original ''Griffin and Sabine Trilogy'' and were first published in 1991, 1992 and 1993 respectively. Each story is told through a series of letters and postcards between the two main characters, Griffin Moss and Sabine Strohem.  Every page features a facsimile of a postcard or a letter actually enclosed in an envelope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bluerectangle.com/book_reviews/view_one_review/2009 |title= ''The Griffin and Sabine Series'' |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial ''Griffin and Sabine Trilogy'' was followed up with another trilogy, the ''Morning Star Trilogy'', consisting of ''The Gryphon'', ''Alexandria'', and ''The Morning Star''.  The second trilogy begins an unspecified number of years after ''The Golden Mean'' and introduces two new correspondents, Matthew Sedon (the recipient of the last postcard in ''The Golden Mean'') and Isabella de Reims.  The final book in the series, ''The Pharos Gate'', was published in 2016, the 25th anniversary of the first publication of ''Griffin and Sabine''.

[[Contemporary Authors Online]] has a lengthy entry on Nick Bantock and ''The Griffin and Sabine Trilogy''.

==Characters==
* '''Griffin Moss''' - An artist residing in London, England who illustrates and creates postcards from his own studio, Gryphon Cards.  A solitary young man who lived a rigid existence, his life abruptly changes when he receives a postcard from Sabine, a complete stranger to him.  They begin to correspond and Griffin realizes they are soulmates, but becomes frightened at the true nature of their relationship.
* '''Sabine Strohem''' - A young woman from the Sicmon Islands, located in the South Pacific, who begins the correspondence by sending a postcard to Griffin Moss.  Like Griffin, she is an artist - she illustrates postage stamps - but possesses a fluid and assured sense of self in contrast to Griffin.  Eventually, Sabine reveals that she has been able to [[Clairvoyance|see]] Griffin create his artwork for years, but had not been able to identify him as the artist until she encountered an article about Gryphon Cards, after which she chose to write to him.  As an infant, she was adopted by Gust Strohem, a European naturalist, and his wife, Tahi, a midwife from the Sicmons.
* '''Victor Frolatti''' - Introduced in ''The Golden Mean'', Frolatti becomes an interloper in Griffin and Sabine's relationship, beginning with postcards addressed to Griffin and appearing on the Sicmon Islands by insinuating himself with Sabine's family.  He becomes a malevolent presence in Sabine and Griffin's lives, seeking to stop them from meeting.  When the pair manage to escape his grasp, Frolatti turns his attention on Isabella and Matthew, attempting to prevent the events that were put into motion when Sabine and Griffin were finally united in Alexandria.
* '''Minnaloushe''' - Griffin's cat, who comes and goes as he pleases, first introduced in ''Sabine's Notebook''.  Originally belonging to Griffin's Aunt Vereker, the cat seems to be connected the samurai spirit who first appears to Griffin in Alexandria, and they appear to be guardian spirits of sorts to Griffin.  The cat is left with Griffin's friend Maud when he departs to meet Sabine in ''The Pharos Gate''.  The same cat later apparently reappears in Paris, residing with Isabella and watching over her.
* '''Matthew Sedon''' - A young archaeologist specializing in [[Egyptology]], Matthew is working in Africa when Sabine writes to him at the conclusion of ''The Golden Mean'' and becomes a new correspondent beginning in ''The Morning Star Trilogy''.  He is revealed to have been born on the Sicmon Islands, when Sabine had assisted her mother during Matthew's birth, and Sabine approaches him through correspondence in order to stop Frolatti's plans once and for all.  Possessing a rational mind, Matthew is sceptical of the nature of Sabine and Griffin's existence, but finds he cannot escape from the forces that begin to threaten him and Isabella as a result of their connection to Sabine and Griffin.
* '''Isabella de Reims''' - Introduced in ''The Gryphon'', Isabella is Matthew's strong-willed girlfriend from Montreal, currently residing in Paris as a graduate student completing a thesis on archaic zoology and assisting Professor Lacourt, a kind older professor writing a thesis on the origin of sphinxes.  Unlike Griffin and Sabine, Isabella and Matthew are lovers who already know one another as they begin correspond while they are apart.  In contrast to Matthew, she is more open to the less rational aspects of Griffin and Sabine's relationship.  She is guided by Griffin, who corresponds to her and assists her with interpreting the strange waking dreams she has that seem to be connected to the danger that she and Matthew have become involved in.
* '''Vereker''' - First mentioned in ''Griffin and Sabine'', Vereker was Griffin's aunt, the stepsister of his mother, and one of the few positive influences in his life.  Following the death of his parents, Griffin lived with Vereker, an artist who became his mentor, until her sudden death, which devastated Griffin.  She inspired him to become an artist and he established Gryphon Cards with the inheritance she left him.
* '''Tahi and Gust Strohem''' - Sabine's parents, who adopted her when she was discovered as an orphaned infant on the Sicmon Islands.  Gust is a naturalist from Europe who moved to the Sicmons and has worked for years to complete an illustrated work of the fauna and flora found on the Sicmons called ''The Catalogue'', with Sabine as his assistant.  Despite his gentle and open-minded nature, Gust is more perceptive than he appears, even when it seems that he fooled into welcoming Frolatti into his company.  Tahi is an experienced  midwife originally from the Sicmons, a perceptive and tactful woman whose sensitivity and resourcefulness are instrumental in ensuring Sabine is able to escape from Frolatti and join Griffin in Alexandria. 
* '''Maud Greig''' - Introduced in ''The Golden Mean'', Maud is Vereker's best friend, a wise and gentle woman somewhat older than Vereker was.  She welcomes Griffin to reside with her in [[Dartington]] when he finds his neighbours in London have begun to pay him too much attention after his abrupt disappearance during ''Sabine's Notebook''.  As one of the correspondents in ''The Pharos Gate'', Maud facilitates Griffin's journey to Alexandria to meet Sabine by contacting Francesca and diverting Frolatti's attempts to locate Griffin.
* '''Francesca Savent''' - Introduced in ''The Pharos Gate'', Francesca is Maud's friend in Alexandria, where Griffin and Sabine intend to meet.  A professor who has resided in Alexandria for a number of years, she agrees to Maud's request to watch over Griffin upon his arrival to Alexandria and provides the account of the meeting of Griffin and Sabine at the Pharos Gate.

==Other media==
The books were adapted into a 1997 [[CD-ROM]] game ''[[Ceremony of Innocence]]'' by [[Peter Gabriel|Peter Gabriel's]] company [[Real World Records|RealWorld]]. Bantock also adapted the story into a play.

In January 2015, it was announced that Bantock and Bound Press would collaborate on a new interactive version of the trilogy. The apps would be developed for iOS and Android.
A kickstarter campaign was launched to support the development of three new interactive apps based on ''Griffin and Sabine'' for iOS and Android.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/03/prweb12574897.htm   Kickstarter campaign Announced for Nick Bantock, Griffin &amp; Sabine App Trilogy Nick Bantock and Bound Press have launched a Kickstarter campaign in support of the development of three new interactive apps for iOS and Android based on the best-selling book trilogy 'Griffin &amp; Sabine'  SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150311/180941]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kck.st/1wWo6zt  LIVE LINK to Kickstarter Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Long Loud Silence''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel written by [[Wilson Tucker|Wilson A. Tucker]]. It was first published in hardback edition by [[Rinehart &amp; Company|Rinehart &amp; Co.]] in 1952, followed by [[Dell Publishing|Dell]] paperback editions in 1952 and 1954.

At the [[Hugo Award|Hugo Awards in 1953]], The Long Loud Silence placed second to [[The Demolished Man]] for the inaugural [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fanac.org/fanzines/Philcon/Philcon2r4-03.html|title=Philcon Progress Report Number 4|last=|first=|date=August 1, 1953|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story takes place following a [[nuclear holocaust]] which wipes out every major city east of the Mississippi and leaves the survivors permanently infected with [[pneumonic plague|plague]]. To prevent the plague from spreading, the army sets up a [[cordon sanitaire]] along the Mississippi. The story follows one survivor, Russell Gary, as he attempts to get back across the river.

== Synopsis ==

Gary, an army corporal, wakes up in a hotel room in Illinois following a drunken binge. He discovers that the town is deserted except for a handful of corpses and comes to the realization that the country has been subjected to an attack. He discovers one other survivor, a girl of 19.  They take a car and, after filling it with supplies, drive toward Chicago, which they find to be in flames.  They drive west, only to discover that almost all bridges over the Mississippi have been disabled; the one remaining bridge is guarded by army troops on the western side, who shoot anyone attempting to cross over.  The girl abandons him; as he travels further, Gary learns that the nuclear attack was combined with [[bacteriological warfare]] which infected the entire population with pneumonic plague. Only those rare individuals with natural resistance have survived, but since they are carriers of the disease, the entire eastern third of the country has been quarantined.

Gary is nevertheless determined to cross over. He joins up with a former school teacher, Jay Oliver; they make camp in the hills outside an intact bridge in Kentucky, waiting for the army to allow people across. A woman joins them, trading sex for food.  After realizing that the quarantine is permanent, the three decide to go to Florida for the winter where they find a fisherman's cabin on the Gulf coast.  After a few months the woman becomes pregnant and expresses her preference for Oliver; Gary decides to leave.

The following winter he finds himself near the Canada–US border. He awakes one night in an abandoned car and sees a young girl running toward him, pursued by men with guns.  Gary shoots the men and saves the girl, who tells him that the men have killed her brother. She leads Gary back to the scene of the murder; he discovers that the body has been partially dismembered and concludes that the men were cannibals. He takes the girl to her home, a farmhouse where both mother and father are still alive. Out of gratitude, the father offers to provide lodging if Gary will guard the farm. Gary agrees and spends the winter there.

The following spring he sets off toward Washington DC, hoping to find remnants of the government.  While passing through Ohio he chances upon a convoy of army trucks under attack. He joins the attack and saves the convoy. The commanding officer thanks him, but makes it clear that he can not join them; they have come from the west, with orders to deliver gold from Fort Knox, and have not been exposed to the virus. Gary offers to fix a tire, but does so in such a way that it slowly loses air; he catches up with the convoy and through a combination of stealth and boldness, kills most of the men and takes one of the trucks.  He drives to the bridge on the Mississippi where the men had been planning to cross over. Masquerading as one of them, he is allowed to cross. From there he escapes into the country side; he is labeled an "enemy agent" and a manhunt is initiated but he evades capture. However, everyone he comes in close contact with succumbs to the plague. He finally realizes that he has no future in the west and returns over the river, to survive for a number of years until he encounters the girl he had met in Illinois.

==Critical reception==
[[Damon Knight]]&lt;ref name="DK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Knight|year=1967|title=[[In Search of Wonder]]|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  wrote that ''The Long Loud Silence'' is&lt;blockquote&gt; a phenomenally good book ... The plotting is close-knit without being contrived; the style is compact and eloquent; the characters, in Faulkner's words, "stand up on their hind legs and cast a shadow." ... The book is honest, courageous, deeply felt.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his "Books" column for ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', he selected Tucker's novel as one of the 10 best sf books of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;"Books", ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', April 1960, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas|McComas]] praised Tucker's writing for its "strikingly effective simplicity."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', January 1953, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]]&lt;ref name=CMK/&gt; also praised the novel, writing that it was "a book of social criticism which might have had the effect of an ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' or Upton Sinclair's ''The Jungle''".  He suggested that the novel was overlooked because publishers chose to market it as science fiction rather than as mainstream fiction.

[[Groff Conklin]], although describing the novel as "easily readable," faulted its lack of "imaginative richness" when compared to similar stories.&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', February 1953, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wien NHM Venus von Willendorf.jpg|thumb|[[Venus of Willendorf]]]]
A '''Venus figurine''' is any [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[Figurine|statuette]] portraying a woman,&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740"&gt;Fagan, 740&lt;/ref&gt; with fewer images depicting men or figures of uncertain sex,&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 203&lt;/ref&gt; and those in [[relief]] or engraved on rock or stones are often discussed together.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"&gt;Fagan, 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; Most have been unearthed in [[Europe]], but others have been found as far away as [[Siberia]], extending their distribution across much of [[Eurasia]], although with many gaps, such as the [[Mediterranean]] outside Italy.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203"&gt;Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of them date from the [[Gravettian]] period (26,000–21,000 years ago),&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt; but examples exist as early as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], which dates back at least 35,000 years to the [[Aurignacian]], and as late as the [[Venus of Monruz]], from about 11,000 years ago in the [[Magdalenian]].  These [[figurine]]s were carved from soft stone (such as [[steatite]], [[calcite]] or [[limestone]]), bone or ivory, or formed of [[clay]] and fired. The latter are among the oldest [[ceramic]]s known. In total, some 144 such figurines are known;&lt;ref&gt;Cook&lt;/ref&gt; virtually all of modest size, between 3&amp;nbsp;cm and 40&amp;nbsp;cm or more in height.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740"/&gt;  They are some of the earliest works of [[prehistoric art]].

Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva, although many do not, and the concentration in popular accounts on those that do reflects modern preoccupations rather than the range of actual artefacts. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.  Depictions of hairstyles can be detailed, and especially in Siberian examples, clothing or tattoos may be indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, 740-741; Isabella, Jude, interview with April Nowell.

The original cultural meaning and purpose of these artifacts is not known. It has frequently been suggested that they may have served a ritual or symbolic function.  There are widely varying and speculative interpretations of their use or meaning: they have been seen as religious figures,&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 207-208&lt;/ref&gt; as [[erotic art]] or sex aids,&lt;ref&gt;Rudgley, Richard, ''The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age'', 2000, Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|0684862700}}, 9780684862705194-198, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vhSHn-B89A0C&amp;pg=PA194 google books]; Fagan, 740-741&lt;/ref&gt; grandmother goddesses or as self-depictions by female artists.&lt;ref&gt;William Haviland, Harald Prins, Dana Walrath, Bunny McBride, ''Anthropology: The Human Challenge'', 13th edition, 2010, Cengage Learning, {{ISBN|0495810843}}, 9780495810841,[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fm2RY5ZKmDIC&amp;pg=PA220 google books]; Cook; Beck, 205-208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lawson |first1=Alex |url=https://www.metafilter.com/177818/The-Talk-for-45-year-old-women#7569728 |website=MetaFilter |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Venus impudique (1907 drawing).jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Vénus impudique]]'', 1907 drawing]]
The expression 'Venus' was first used in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye|Marquis de Vibraye]], who discovered an important ivory figurine and named it ''[[Vénus impudique|La Vénus impudique]]'' or ''Venus Impudica'' ("immodest Venus"), contrasting it to the ''[[Venus Pudica]]'', [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]] sculpture by [[Praxiteles]] showing [[Aphrodite]] covering her naked pubis with her right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 202-203&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the name is metaphorical as there is no link between the figurines and the [[Venus (mythology)|Roman goddess Venus]], although they have been interpreted as representations of a primordial female goddess. The term has been criticised for being more a reflection of modern western ideas than reflecting the beliefs of the sculptures' original owners, but the name has persisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Beth Harris &amp; Dr. Steven Zucker|date=27 May 2012|title= Nude Woman (Venus of Willendorf), c. 28,000-25,000 B.C.E.|trans-title= |medium= youtube video|language= English|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENAZqOoOVaI&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player|access-date= 1 June 2015|archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= 0:21|location= |publisher= Smarthistory, Art History at Khan Academy|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of discovery ==
''[[Vénus impudique]]'', the figurine that gave the whole class its name, was the very first Paleolithic sculptural representation of a woman discovered in modern times. It was found in about 1864 by [[Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye]] at the famous archaeological site of [[Laugerie-Basse]] in the [[Vézère]] valley (one of the many important Stone Age sites in and around the commune of [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] in [[Dordogne]], southwestern [[France]]). The [[Magdalenian]] "Venus" from Laugerie-Basse is headless, footless, armless but with a strongly incised vaginal opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Four years later, Salomon Reinach published an article about a group of [[steatite]] figurines from the caves of Balzi Rossi. The famous [[Venus of Willendorf]] was excavated in 1908 in a [[loess]] deposit in the [[Danube]] valley, [[Austria]]. Since then, hundreds of similar figurines have been discovered from the [[Pyrenees]] to the plains of [[Siberia]]. They are collectively described as "Venus figurines" in reference to the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess of beauty, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], since the [[prehistory|prehistorians]] of the early 20th century assumed they represented an ancient ideal of beauty. Early discourse on "Venus figurines" was preoccupied with identifying the race being represented and the [[steatopygous]] fascination of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the "Hottentot Venus" exhibited as a living ethnographic curiosity to connoisseurs in Paris early in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Of the mammoth-ivory figurine fragment known as ''La Poire'' ("the pear") from her massive thighs, Randall White (White 2006:263, caption to fig. 6) observed the connection.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, archaeologists from the [[University of Tübingen]] discovered a 6&amp;nbsp;cm figurine woman carved from a [[mammoth]]'s tusk, the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]],  dated to at least 35,000 years ago, representing the earliest known sculpture of this type, and the earliest known work of [[figurative art]] altogether.  The ivory carving, found in six fragments in Germany's [[Hohle Fels]] cave, represents the typical features of Venus figurines, including the swollen belly, wide-set thighs, and large breasts.&lt;ref name=Conard2009&gt;{{cite journal | last= Conard | first= Nicholas J | title= A female figurine from the basal Aurignacian of Hohle Fels Cave in southwestern Germany | journal= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=459 | issue=  7244| pages= 248–252 | date=14 May 2009 | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/pdf/nature07995.pdf | issn= | doi= 10.1038/nature07995 | accessdate= 27 July 2010  | pmid= 19444215|bibcode = 2009Natur.459..248C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cressey2009&gt;{{Cite journal |date=13 May 2009 |author=Cressey, Daniel |title=Ancient Venus rewrites history books |journal=Nature |series=News |doi=10.1038/news.2009.473 |postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[Image:Vestonicka venuse edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], the earliest discovered use of ceramics&lt;ref&gt;The body used is the local [[loess]], with only traces of clay; there is no trace of surface burnishing or applied pigment. Pamela B. Vandiver, Olga Soffer, Bohuslav Klima and Jiři Svoboda, "The Origins of Ceramic Technology at Dolni Věstonice, Czechoslovakia", ''Science'', New Series, '''246''', No. 4933 (November 24, 1989:1002-1008).&lt;/ref&gt; (29,000 BCE – 25,000 BCE)]]

The majority of the Venus figurines appear to be depictions of women, many of which follow certain artistic conventions, on the lines of schematisation and stylisation. Most of them are roughly [[lozenge]]-shaped, with two tapering terminals at top (head) and bottom (legs) and the widest point in the middle (hips/belly). In some examples, certain parts of the human anatomy are exaggerated: [[abdomen]], [[hip (anatomy)|hips]], [[breast]]s, [[thigh]]s, [[vulva]]. In contrast, other anatomical details are neglected or absent, especially arms and feet. The heads are often of relatively small size and devoid of detail. Some may represent pregnant women, while others show no such signs.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 29; Fagan, 740-741; Cook; Beck, 203-213, who analyses attempts to classify the figures.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that aspects of the typical depiction and perspective, such as the large and often pendulous breasts, emphasis on the upper rather than lower buttocks, and lack of feet and faces, support the theory that these are self-portraits by women without access to mirrors, looking at their own bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Cook; McDermott, LeRoy. 1996. "Self-representation in Upper Paleolithic Female Figurines". ''Current Anthropology'' 37 (2). [University of Chicago Press, Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]: 227–75. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2744349 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence of feet has led to suggestions that the figures might have been made to stand upright by inserting the legs into the ground like a peg.

The high amount of fat around the buttocks of some of the figurines has led to numerous interpretations. The issue was first raised by Édouard Piette, excavator of the [[Brassempouy]] figure and of several other examples from the Pyrenees. Some authors saw this feature as the depiction of an actual physical property, resembling (but ''not'' depicting) the [[Khoisan]] tribe of southern [[Africa]], while others interpreted it as a symbol of fertility and abundance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Recently, similar figurines with protruding buttocks from the prehistoric [[Jōmon period]] Japan were also interpreted as [[steatopygia]] of local women, possibly under nutritional stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hudson MJ, etal |title=Possible steatopygia in prehistoric central Japan: evidence from clay figurines |journal=Anthropological Science  |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=87–92 |year=2008| doi=10.1537/ase.060317 |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/116/1/116_87/_html}}&lt;/ref&gt; (c.f.[[Jōmon Venus]])

The [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the [[Venus of Laussel]] bear traces of having been externally covered in [[red ochre]]. The significance of this is not clear, but is normally assumed to be religious or ritual in nature—perhaps symbolic of the blood of menstruation or childbirth.  Some buried human bodies were similarly covered, and the colour may just represent life.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

All generally accepted Paleolithic female figurines are from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]]. Although they were originally mostly considered [[Aurignacian]], the majority are now associated with the [[Gravettian]] and [[Solutrean]].&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741; Beck, 203"/&gt; In these periods, the more rotund figurines are predominant. During the [[Magdalenian]], the forms become finer with more detail; conventional stylization also develops.

==Classification==
A number of attempts to subdivide or classify the figurines have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, 208-213 analyses several&lt;/ref&gt; One of the less controversial is that by Henri Delporte, simply based on geographic provenance.&lt;ref&gt;H. Delporte : ''L’image de la femme dans l’art préhistorique'', Éd. Picard (1993) {{ISBN|2-7084-0440-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes:
* the Venus figurines of the [[Pyrenees]]-[[Aquitaine]] group ([[Venus of Lespugue]], of [[Venus of Laussel|Laussel]] and of [[Venus of Brassempouy|Brassempouy]])
* the Venus figurines of the Italian  group ([[Venus of Savignano]] and of Balzi Rossi)
* the Venus figurines of the [[Rhine]]-[[Danube]] group ([[Venus of Willendorf]] and of [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice|Dolní Věstonice]])
* the Venus figurines of the [[Russia]]n group ([[Kostienki]] and [[Zaraysk]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/082/ant0820862.htm Hizri Amirkhanov and Sergey Lev. New finds of art objects from the Upper Palaeolithic site of Zaraysk, Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.membrana.ru/lenta/?8913 Membrana.ru], Венеры каменного века найдены под Зарайском&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Russia]] and [[Gagarino]] in [[Ukraine]])
* the Venus figurines of the [[Siberia]]n group ([[Mal'ta Venus]], Bouret' Venus).

According to [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], there are cultural connections between all these groups. He states that certain anatomical details suggest a shared Oriental origin, followed by a westward diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;Leroi-Gourhan, A., ''Cronología del arte paleolítico'', 1966, Actas de VI Congreso internacional de Ciencias prehistóricas y protohistóricas, Roma.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
There are many interpretations of the figurines, often based on little argument or fact.&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt;

Like many prehistoric artifacts, the cultural meaning of these figures may never be known.  Archaeologists speculate, however, that they may be emblems of security and success, [[fertility]] icons, or direct representations of a [[mother goddess]]. The female figures, as part of Upper Palaeolithic portable art, appear to have no practical use in the context of [[subsistence]]. They are mostly discovered in settlement contexts, both in open-air sites and caves;&lt;ref name="Fagan, 740-741"/&gt; burial contexts are much rarer.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

At Gagarino in Russia, seven Venus figurines were found in a hut of 5 m diameter; they have been interpreted as [[apotropaic]] [[amulets]], connected with the occupants of the dwelling. [[Venus figurines of Mal'ta|At Mal'ta]], near [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia, figurines are only known from the left sides of huts. The figurines were probably not hidden or secret amulets, but rather were displayed to be seen by all (a factor that may explain their wide geographic spread). An image of excess weight may have symbolized a yearning for  plenty and security.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Helen Benigni argues in ''The Emergence of the Goddess'' that the consistency in design of these featureless, large-breasted, often pregnant figures throughout a wide region and over a long period of time suggests they represent an archetype of a female Supreme Creator. Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age people likely connected the female as a creator innately tied to the cycles of nature: women were commonly believed to give birth and their menstrual cycles aligned with lunar cycles and tides.&lt;ref&gt;Benigni, Helen, ed.  2013.  ''The Mythology of Venus: Ancient Calendars and Archaeoastronomy''.  Lanham, Maryland : University Press Of America.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later female figurines and continuity ==
[[File:Statuette Mehrgarh.jpg|thumb|right|This figurine, c. 5500 – 2400 BCE, from [[Mehrgarh]] (in present-day Pakistan) has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine]]
Some scholars and popular theorists suggest a direct continuity between the Palaeolithic female figurines and later examples of female depictions from the [[Neolithic]] or even the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Burkert, ''Homo Necans'' (1972) 1983:78, with extensive bibliography, including [[Peter Ucko|P.J. Ucko]], who contested the identification with mother goddesses and argues for a plurality of meanings, in ''Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete with Comparative Material from the Prehistoric Near East and Mainland Greece'' (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Such views have been contested on numerous grounds, not least the general absence of such depictions during the intervening [[Mesolithic]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A female figurine which has 'no practical use and is portable' and has the common elements of a Venus figurine (a strong accent or exaggeration of female sex linked traits, and the lack of complete lower limbs) may be considered to be a Venus figurine, even if from after the main Palaeolithic period. Figurines which match this definition, apart from date, have been found in the  [[Neolithic]] and into the [[Bronze Age]]. The period and location that a figurine came from will contribute to the opinion of a given archeologist, such that ceramic figurines from the late ceramic Neolithic may be accepted as Venus figurines, while stone figurines from later periods are not.  This is a matter of ongoing debate given the strong similarity between many figurines from the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and beyond. A reworked [[endocast]] of a [[brachiopod]] from around 6000 BC in Norway has been identified as a late Venus figurine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tidemann|first1=Grethe|title=Venus fra Svinesund|url=http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2001/08/venus-fra-svinesund.html|website=Uniforum|publisher=[[University of Oslo]]|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This means that a given female figurine may or may not be classified as a Venus figure by any given archeologist, regardless of its date, though most archaeologists disqualify figurines which date from after the Paleolithic, even though their purpose could have been the same. For instance, the [[Mehrgarh]] figurine has all of the common characteristics of a venus stone figurine, including large breasts and incomplete legs, however it came from what is now [[Pakistan]] and also dates to 3000 BCE, which lies after the beginning of the Bronze Age.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The '''Wimsener Höhle''' (or Wimsen Cave) is Germany´s only water cave, which can be visited by boat. It is located in the municipal area of [[Hayingen]] on the [[Swabian Alb]], about three kilometers north of [[Zwiefalten]].

==Description==
The Wimsener Höhle or Wimsen Cave is Germany´s only [[water cave]], which can be visited by boat. It is located in Wimsen, part of the municipal area of [[Hayingen]], about three kilometers north of [[Zwiefalten]] a small hamlet on the [[Swabian Alb]]. Wimsen consists of a mill, a barn, an inn and the Wimsener cave, all of which is privately owned belonging to Ehrenfels Castle. 

Of the cave´s 723 meters in length only 70 meters are accessible to a visitor in a boat. About 70 meters behind the entrance the cave ceiling drops down to the water surface, so the rest of the cave can only be explored with diving equipment.&lt;ref name="wim"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.germancavediving.de/wimsener-hoehle.html |title=Die Wimsener Höhle |date=n.d. |website=germancavediving.de |publisher=Rainer Straub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zwiefalter Aach]] arises from the cave with an average flow of 590 l/s, a minimum of 60 l/s, and a maximum of 6240 l/s.
Water and air temperature in the cave are between 7 and 8 °C representing the annual mean temperature of the region.&lt;ref name="wim" /&gt;

==History==
In 1803, Duke Friedrich II, the later King [[Frederick I of Württemberg]] visited the cave, after which the cave was also named "Friedrichshöhle" in his honor.&lt;ref name="wim" /&gt;

In 1910, the limestone cave was partly surveyed. It was not until 1959, when divers were able to penetrate a [[Sump (cave)|siphon]], that further explorations and measurements could be made.&lt;ref name="wim" /&gt; 

From 1961 to 1975, Jochen Hasenmayer, among others, played an important role, as he reached 400 meters far and 40 meters deep into the cave.&lt;ref name="wim" /&gt;

==Geology==
The Wimsener Höhle is located in limestone rocks of the [[Weißjura Formation]], which were deposited in the [[Jurassic]] ocean some 150 million years ago. The Wimsen cave is estimated to be about one million years old and was created as is typical for a [[solutional cave]] by the spring water of the Zwiefalter Aach, which when rainwater absorbed carbonic acid, seeped through the soil layers in the catchment area and penetrated deeply into the white jura.&lt;ref name="wim" /&gt;
