      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10532">'''Abortion in Japan''' is available to women in limited circumstances, including endangerment of their health or economic hardship. Chapter XXIX of the [[Penal Code of Japan]] makes [[abortion]] ''[[de jure]]'' illegal in the country, but exceptions to the law are broad enough that it is widely accepted and practiced. Meanwhile, the [[:ja:母体保護法|Maternal Health Protection Law]] allows [[:ja:母体保護法指定医師|approved doctors]] to practice abortion with the consent of the mother and her spouse, if the pregnancy has [[Pregnancy from rape|resulted from rape]], or if the continuation of the pregnancy may severely endanger the maternal health because of physical reasons or economic reasons. Anyone trying to practice abortion without the consent of the woman will be punished, including the doctors.

No [[abortifacient]] has been [[Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (Japan)|approved]] in Japan. Approved doctors, however, can choose to use imported abortifacient under the same terms above. Any other people who abort the fetus using abortifacient will be punished.

[[Emergency contraceptive pills]] were approved by the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sosei-receives-approval-from-japan-mhlw-for-norlevor-tablets-075mg-emergency-contraceptive-pill-116715299.html “Sosei Receives Approval From Japan MHLW for NorLevo(R) TABLETS 0.75mg Emergency Contraceptive Pill”, Sosei Group Corporation press release, 23 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
In 1842, the Shogunate in [[Japan]] banned induced abortion in [[Edo]], but the law did not affect the rest of the country until 1869, when abortion was banned nationwide.&lt;ref name="Norgren"&gt;Norgren, Tiana. ''Abortion before Birth Control: The Politics of Reproduction in Postwar Japan'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obayashi, M. 1982"&gt;Obayashi, M. (1982). Historical background of the acceptance of induced abortion. Josanpu Zasshi 36(12), 1011-6. Retrieved April 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the crime was rarely punished unless the conception was a result of adultery or the woman died as a result of the abortion procedure.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt;

According to the scholar Tiana Norgern, the abortion policy under the [[Meiji government]] was similar to that of the [[Edo period]], and was fueled by the belief that a large population would yield more military and political influence on the international stage.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; In 1868, the emperor banned midwives from performing abortions, and in 1880, Japan's first penal code declared abortion a crime.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; The punishments for abortion grew more severe in 1907 when the penal code revised: women could be incarcerated for up to a year for having an abortion; practitioners could be jailed for up to seven.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; The Criminal Abortion Law of 1907 is still technically in effect today, but other legislation has overridden its effects.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt;

In 1923, doctors were granted legal permission to perform emergency abortions to save the mother's life; abortions performed under different, less life-threatening circumstances were still prosecuted.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; In 1931, the Alliance for Reform of the Anti-Abortion Law (''Datai Hō Kaisei Kiseikai'') was formed by [[Abe Isoo]] and argued that "it is a woman's right not to bear a child she does not want, and abortion is an exercise of this right".&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; This organization believed that abortion should be made legal in circumstances in which there was a high chance of genetic disorder; in which a woman was poor, on public assistance, or divorced; in which it endangered the woman's health; and in which the pregnancy was a result of rape.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; In 1934, the Fifth All-Japan Women's Suffrage Congress wrote up resolutions calling for the legalization of abortion as well as contraception.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; This did not result in any immediate reaction from the government at the time, but after the war, these resolutions were consulted when drafting legislation legalizing abortion.

In 1940, the National Eugenic Law stopped short of explicitly calling abortion legal by outlining a set of procedures a doctor had to follow in order to perform an abortion; these procedures included getting second opinions and submitting reports, though these could be ignored when it was an emergency.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; This was a daunting and complicated process that many physicians did not want to deal with, and some sources attribute the fall in abortion rate between 1941 and 1944 from 18,000 to 1,800 to this legislation.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt;

After World War II, Japan found itself in a population crisis. In 1946, 10 million people were declared at risk of starvation, and between the years 1945 and 1950, the population increased by 11 million.&lt;ref name="Norgren"/&gt; In 1948, Japan legalized abortion under special circumstances.&lt;ref name="National Diet Library"&gt;{{cite web |author= |script-title=ja:第１４７回国会　国民福祉委員会　第１０号 |language=Japanese|publisher=[[National Diet Library]] |url=http://kokkai.ndl.go.jp/SENTAKU/sangiin/147/0008/14703150008010a.html |date=2000-03-15 |accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 made Japan one of the first countries to legalize induced abortion. This law was revised as the Maternal Body Protection Law in 1996.&lt;ref name="Kato, Mariko 2009"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kato |first=Mariko |date=October 20, 2009 |title=FYI: Abortion and the Pill: Abortion Still Key Birth Control |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/10/20/news/abortion-still-key-birth-control/ |department=FYI (column) |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, abortion is widely accepted in Japan. According to a 1998 survey, 79 percent of unmarried and 85 percent of married women approved of abortion.&lt;ref name="Mainichi Newspapers 1996"&gt;Population Problems Research Council of the Mainichi Newspapers. 1996. Report on the 23rd National Survey on Family Planning. Tokyo; Mainichi Newspapers.&lt;/ref&gt; According to researchers at [[Osaka University]] in 2001, 341,588 legal abortions were carried out in Japan, a 2.5 percent increase from 1998 to 2001.&lt;ref name="jstage.jst.go.jp"&gt;[http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ehpm/10/1/10_9/_article J Stage Environmental Health and Preventative Medicine vol. 10 2005]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007 the figure had decreased to around 256,000.&lt;ref name="Kato, Mariko 2009"/&gt;

== Statistics ==
Abortion statistics showed that the abortion rate (the number of cases of induced abortions per 1,000 women per year) increased for women younger than 20 from 1975 to 1995. The abortion ratio (number of cases per 1,000 live births) remained the highest amongst women aged 40–44. An increase in the abortion ratio was seen in the two youngest groups (younger than 20 and 20-24), especially among those who were born after 1955. The proportion of abortions that were experienced by women younger than 25 increased from 18 percent between 1976 and 1980 to 30 percent between 1991 and 1995, and a slight increase was also observed among women aged 40–44.&lt;ref name="Goto 2000 pp 301-308"&gt;Goto, A., Fujiyama-Koriyama, C., Fukao, A., &amp; Reich, M. "Abortion Trends in Japan, 1975–95". ''Studies in Family Planning'', Vol. 31, No. 4 (December 2000), pp. 301–308. Population Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, in 1995, the total number of abortions reported was 343,024, representing a 49 percent decrease from the number reported for 1975. The overall abortion rate changed from 22 to 11 abortions per 1,000 women in 1975 and 1995, respectively; and the overall abortion ratio changed from 353 to 289 abortions per 1,000 live births in the same 20-year period. In more than 99 percent of cases, the reason [[report]]ed for performing an abortion was to protect the woman's health; this percentage remained constant during 1975-1995.&lt;ref name="Goto 2000 pp 301-308" /&gt;

The official Japanese government statistics on abortion, however, cannot be considered as very accurate, since physicians tend to under-report the number of abortions they perform as a way of avoiding [[income tax]] payments (Coleman 1991), and because of [[social pressure]]s to protect women's confidentiality, especially that of young women who are [[junior high]] or [[high school]] students.

== Contraceptive use ==
A scenario study was conducted to assess the extent to which the [[unintended pregnancy]] rate in Japan, where [[oral contraceptive]]s (OC) have not been legalized for family planning purposes and couples rely mainly on [[condom]]s, might change if more women were to use OC. Because current rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion in Japan are not known, data provided by the 1994 Japanese National Survey on Family Planning were used to construct scenarios for national contraceptive use. Annual failure rates of contraceptive methods and nonuse were applied to the contraceptive use scenarios, to obtain estimates of the annual number of contraceptive failure-related pregnancies. Subsequently, contraceptive practice situations assuming higher OC use rates were defined, and the associated change in the number of contraceptive failure-related pregnancies was estimated for each situation. It emerged that OC use rates of 15% decreased the expected number of unintended pregnancies by 13-17%, whereas use rates of 25% resulted in decreases of 22-29% and use rates of 50% in decreases of 45-58%. The findings were reasonably robust to variation in the assumptions that were made. In conclusion, each theoretical percentage increase in the OC use rate in Japan was found to lead to a roughly equivalent percentage decrease in the number of unintended pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;Oddens B.J. &amp; Lolkema, A. "A scenario study of oral contraceptive use in Japan: Toward fewer unintended pregnancies". ''Contraception'', Volume 58, Issue 1, July 1998, pages 13–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agency for Care and Health''' (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Agentschap Zorg en Gezondheid'') is an [[Government agency|agency]] of the [[Flemish Government]]. The Flemish Government is the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of the [[Flemish Community]] of [[Belgium]]. In Belgium, the [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|Communities]] are responsible for certain aspects of [[social care]], [[Healthcare in Belgium|health care]] and [[public health]] policy. The Agency for Care and Health is responsible for the [[Legal recognition|recognition]], [[License|licensing]] and [[Subsidy|subsidising]] of various providers and services for health care, [[elderly care]], [[home care]], [[residential care]], and other forms of care, for facilitating the cooperation and [[data sharing]] between these services, for the organisation of [[Preventive healthcare|preventive health services]] such as [[Vaccine|vaccinations]] and [[Screening (medicine)|screening programs]], for the control of [[Infection|infectious diseases]], for [[environmental health]] monitoring, and for the organisation of the Flemish [[social protection]] programs. The Agency for Care and Health relies on the [[Care Inspectorate (Flanders)|Flemish Care Inspectorate]] for the [[inspection]] of any of the services it is responsible for.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be/over-ons|title=Over ons|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be|publisher=Agency for Care and Health|language=Dutch|trans-title=About us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency has a yearly budget of around 3,850,000,000 euros, of which about half goes to the financing of elderly care. As of 2018, the agency has 285 employees, to which 12 employees will be added in 2019. These employees will be transferred from the [[National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance]] as a result of the [[sixth Belgian state reform]], in which some additional competences were transferred from the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian federal government]] to the Communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be/begroting-zorg-en-gezondheid|title=Begroting Zorg en Gezondheid|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be|publisher=Agency for Care and Health|language=Dutch|trans-title=Budget Care and Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency is part of the so-called Welfare, Public Health and Family policy area, which consists of the [[Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family (Flanders)|Department of Welfare, Public Health and Family]] and a few associated agencies such as the Agency for Care and Health. The [[Minister (government)|minister]] responsible for the agency is the minister of Welfare, Public Health and Family of the Flemish Government. The current minister in the [[Bourgeois Government]], which assumed office in 2014, is [[Jo Vandeurzen]] of the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian Democratic and Flemish party]]. The agency itself is lead by an administrator-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be/organogram|title=Organogram|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zorg-en-gezondheid.be|publisher=Agency for Care and Health|language=Dutch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aphrodisiac''' or '''love drug''' is a substance that increases [[libido]] when consumed. Aphrodisiacs are distinct from substances that address fertility issues or secondary sexual (dys)function such as [[erectile dysfunction]].

The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀφροδισιακόν, ''aphrodisiakon'', i.e. "sexual, aphrodisiac", from ''aphrodisios'', i.e. "pertaining to [[Aphrodite]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|*)afrodisiako/s|ἀφροδισιακόν|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aphrodisiac|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aphrodisiac&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Twelve Olympians|goddess]] of love. The opposite substance is an [[anaphrodisiac]].

==Assessment of aphrodisiac qualities==
Throughout human history, food, drinks, and behaviors have had a reputation for making sex more attainable and/or pleasurable. However, from a historical and scientific standpoint, the alleged results may have been mainly due to mere belief by their users that they would be effective ([[placebo effect]]). Likewise, many medicines are reported to ''affect'' libido in inconsistent or idiopathic ways:
&lt;ref name="West15"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=West E, Krychman M |title=Natural Aphrodisiacs-A Review of Selected Sexual Enhancers |journal=Sex Med Rev |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=279–288 |date=October 2015 |pmid=27784600 |doi=10.1002/smrj.62 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enhancing or diminishing overall sexual desire depending on the situation of subject. For example, Bupropion ([[Bupropion|Wellbutrin]]) is known as an [[antidepressant]] that can counteract other co-prescribed antidepressants having libido-diminishing effects. However, because Wellbutrin only increases the libido in the special case that it is already impaired by related medications, it is not generally classed as an aphrodisiac.

[[Yohimbine]], [[Spanish fly]], [[Grayanotoxin|mad honey]], and [[Bufo|bufo toad]] have no scientific evidence of providing aphrodisiac effects.&lt;ref name="West15"/&gt; While numerous plants, [[extract]]s or manufactured hormones have been proposed as aphrodisiacs, there is little high-quality [[evidence-based medicine|clinical evidence]] for the efficacy or long-term safety of using them.&lt;ref name="West15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="drugs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual health|url=https://www.drugs.com/sexual-health.html|publisher=Drugs.com|accessdate=17 May 2018|date=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testosterone ===
[[Libido]] in males is linked to levels of sex hormones, particularly [[testosterone]].&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The effects of testosterone on the cavernous tissue and erectile function |author=R.

==In popular culture==
The invention of an aphrodisiac is the basis of a number of films including [[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)|''Perfume: The Story of a Murderer'']], ''[[Spanish Fly (1975 film)|Spanish Fly]]'', ''[[She'll Follow You Anywhere]]'', ''[[Love Potion No. 9 (film)|Love Potion No. 9]]'' and ''[[A Serbian Film]]''.  The first segment of [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' is called "Do Aphrodisiacs Work?", and casts Allen as a [[court jester]] trying to seduce the [[Queen regnant|queen]].

The '''Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005''' ({{USBill|109|S.|1873}}), nicknamed '''"Bioshield Two"''' and sponsored by Senator [[Richard Burr]] (R-[[North Carolina]]), aims shorten the [[drug development|pharmaceutical development process]] for new [[vaccine]]s and [[approved drug|drugs]] in case of a [[pandemic]], and to protect vaccine makers and the [[pharmaceutical]] industry from legal liability for vaccine injuries.  The proposed bill would create a new federal agency, the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency]] (BARDA), that would act "as the single point of authority" to promote advanced research and development of drugs and vaccines in response to [[bioterrorism]] and natural [[disease]] outbreaks, while shielding the agency from public [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) requests.  BARDA would be exempt from long-standing open records and meetings laws that apply to most government departments.

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved the bill, co-sponsored by [[Bill Frist]] (R-[[Tennessee|TN]]), Mike Enzi (R-[[Wyoming|WY]]), and Judd Gregg (R-[[New Hampshire|NH]]), by voice vote, despite Democratic objections.

Several other proposals have contained, in part, similar provisions (or protections) as those found in the ''Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://olpa.od.nih.gov/legislation/109/pendinglegislation/bioterror.asp Office of Legislative Policy and Analysis (OLPA)], [[109th Congress]], Legislative Updates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key provisions==

The Bioshield Two bill would shift the main responsibility for developing bioterrorism countermeasures out of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and into the new BARDA agency within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]].  The proposed new agency would improve on [[Project Bioshield Act|Project BioShield]], a barely two-year-old program also meant to encourage production of vaccines and drugs.

BARDA would receive a first-year budget of $1 billion.  Other key aspects of the proposed legislation include:

* Provision of rebates or grants as incentives for domestic manufacturing of vaccines and medical countermeasures against [[bioterrorism]] and natural [[disease]] outbreaks. 
* Liability protections for drug makers that develop vaccines for [[biological weapons]].  The measure would make manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, or administrators of security countermeasures immune from liability caused by a security countermeasure or any pandemic/epidemic product, by means of a limited antitrust exemption.
* Establishment of a single agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency, as the lead federal agency for the development of countermeasures against [[bioterrorism]].  The new agency would report directly to the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]], which would have sole authority to decide whether a manufacturer violated laws mandating drug safety.  Citizens would be banned from challenging such decisions in the civil court system.  The agency would 'partner' with drug makers while placing information about such partnerships outside of public view.
* Extension of some prescription drug patents.
* Allow the Department of Health and Human Services to sign exclusive sales contracts with particular manufacturers for a particular product.
* Forbid government purchases of [[Generic drug|generic]] versions of such new drugs or vaccines as well as public sales of the products for use as countermeasures.
* Exempt countermeasures from certain federal cost oversight requirements.

==Support==

Much of the support for the bill comes from [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA) and its members.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} In the 2002 election cycle, PhRMA contributed $3,505,052 to politicians, with 95% going to Republicans.  The top recipient in the Senate was the bill's sponsor, Senator Richard Burr, who received $288,684, according to the non-partisan [[Center for Responsive Politics]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Senator Burr said the legislation "creates a true partnership" between the federal government, the pharmaceutical industry and academia to "walk the drug companies through the Valley of Death" in bringing a new vaccine or drug to market.

Exemptions from open records and meetings laws would streamline the development process, safeguard national security and protect the proprietary interests of drug companies, say Republican backers of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/bw-other/2005/dec/02/120200005.html December 2005 Las Vegas Sun Portal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105040303/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/bw-other/2005/dec/02/120200005.html |date=January 5, 2006 }}???&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Senator [[Chris Dodd]] (D-Connecticut) said "Their plan will protect companies that make ineffective or harmful medicines, and because it does not include compensation for those injured by a vaccine or drug, it will discourage first responders and patients from taking medicines to counter a biological attack or disease outbreak."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dodd.senate.gov/?q=node/3305 Editorials &amp; Op-Eds of Sen. Chris Dodd]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104160535/http://dodd.senate.gov/?q=node%2F3305 |date=November 4, 2009  }}, Press Office of Sen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''Biomanufacturing''' is a type of [[manufacturing]] or [[biotechnology]] that utilizes biological systems to produce commercially important [[biomaterial|biomaterials]] and [[biomolecule|biomolecules]] for use in [[pharmaceutical drug|medicines]], food and beverage processing, and industrial applications.  Biomanufacturing products are recovered from natural sources, such as blood, or from cultures of [[microbes]], [[animal cells]], or [[plant cells]] grown in specialized equipment.  The cells used during the production may have been naturally occurring or derived using [[genetic engineering]] techniques. 

==Products==
There are thousands of biomanufacturing products on the market today.  Some examples of general classes are listed below: 

=== Medicine ===
* [[Amino acids]]
* [[Biopharmaceuticals]]
* [[Cytokines]]
* [[Fusion proteins]]
* [[Growth factors]]
* [[Monoclonal antibodies]]
* [[Vaccines]]

=== Food and beverage ===
* [[Amino acids]]
* [[Enzymes]]
* Protein supplements

=== Industrial applications that employ cells and/or enzymes ===
* [[Microbiologically induced calcite precipitation|Biocementation]]
* [[Bioremediation]]
* [[Detergents]]
* [[Plastics]]

==Unit operations==
A partial listing of unit operations utilized during biomanufacturing includes the following:
* [[Blood plasma fractionation]]
* [[Cell culture]]
* Cell separation, such as [[filtration]] and [[centrifugation]]
* [[Fermentation]]
* [[Homogenization (biology)|Homogenization]]
* [[Column chromatography]]
* [[Ultrafiltration]] and/or [[diafiltration]]
* Clarification, such as [[filtration]]
* Formulation
* Filling vials or syringes for injectable medicines
 
==Equipment and facilities==

Equipment and facility requirements are dictated by the product(s) being manufactured. Process equipment is typically constructed of stainless steel or plastic.  Stainless steel equipment can be cleaned and reused.  Some plastic equipment is disposed of after a single use. [[File:BTEC Bioreactors.jpg|thumb|center|alt=Photo of BTEC's 30L and 300L bioreactor.|Stainless Steel Bioreactors]]  Products manufactured for medical or food use must be produced in facilities designed and operated according to [[Good manufacturing practice | Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)]] regulations.  [[Cleanrooms]] are often required to control the levels of particulates and microorganisms.  [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] and [[aseptic]] processing equipment are required for production of [[injectable]] products. 


==Employment==
Skilled professionals are required for positions throughout the life cycle of a biomanufacturing product, which includes:
* [[Research]]
* [[Product development]]
* [[Process development]]
* [[Pre-clinical development|Preclinical evaluation]]
* [[Clinical trials]]
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Manufacturing|Production]]
* [[Supply Chain Management]]
* [[Validation (drug manufacture)|Validation]]
* [[Quality control|Quality Control]]
* [[Quality Assurance]]
* [[Materials Management]]
* [[Sales]]

Details for some of these positions are listed in “The Model Employee,” published by the [[North Carolina Biotechnology Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbiotech.org/sites/default/files/TME-EmailFriendly.pdf|title=The Model Employee|publisher=ncbiotech.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the North Carolina Association for Biomedical Research (NCABR) maintains the website ''About Bioscience'' that offers free online videos on various careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbioscience.org|title=About Bioscience|publisher=www.ncabr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and training==
Several academic institutions have developed curricula and built facilities to provide education and training in biomanufacturing to students from community colleges, universities, and/or industry.   [[NCBioImpact]], established in 2004, is an example of a comprehensive state-wide training network.  Member institutions [[Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center|Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center (BTEC)]] at [[North Carolina State University]], (BRITE) at [[North Carolina Central University]], and [[North Carolina Community College System|North Carolina Community College System’s]] BioNetwork operate multidisciplinary centers dedicated to workforce development for the biomanufacturing industry.

[http://www.miracosta.edu/biotech MiraCosta College] and [http://www.solano.edu/biotech Solano College] in California developed the first bachelor of science degree in biomanufacturing.  The degree is largely lab-based and is built on a contextualized science and statistics backbone.  The upper division classes recognize the unique environment of biological production where the process sciences and technology thrive in partnership with quality and regulatory compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5022">'''Brit shalom''' ({{lang-he-n|ברית שלום}} ("covenant of peace"), also called '''alternative brit''' (or bris in Yiddish and Ashkenazi Hebrew), '''brit ben''', '''brit chayim''' or '''brit tikkun''', is a [[naming ceremony]] for newborn [[Judaism|Jewish]] boys that does not involve [[circumcision]]. It is intended to replace the traditional [[brit milah]], and is promoted by groups such as Beyond the Bris and Jews Against Circumcision. The term is generally not used for girls, since [[Zeved habat|their naming ceremony]] does not involve circumcision.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Brit shalom is recognized by organizations affiliated with [[Humanistic Judaism]] like the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]], The Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations, and the [[International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]], but officially it is not by any of the major denominations in Judaism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The reform movement rabbis welcome these families in their community, but do not advertise this in public.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jweekly.com/2014/02/14/choosing-not-to-circumcise-last-frontier-of-jewish-inclusion/|title=Choosing not to circumcise last frontier of Jewish inclusion – J.|date=2014-02-14|work=J.|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first brit shalom ceremony was conducted by Rabbi [[Sherwin Wine]], the founder of the [[Society for Humanistic Judaism]], around 1970.&lt;ref name="Little-known"&gt;Jonah Lowenfeld: ''[http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/little-known_non-cutting_ritual_appeals_to_some_who_oppose_circumcision_201 Little-known non-cutting ritual appeals to some who oppose circumcision].'' In: Jewish Journal. 2. August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremony==
There are different forms of brit shalom ceremonies. Some of them involve the [[foot washing|washing of the baby's feet]], called ''[[brit rechitzah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish.html#ceremonies Brit Shalom/Shalem/Milim: Covenant of Peace/Wholeness/Words]&lt;/ref&gt; Brit shalom ceremonies are performed by a [[rabbi]] or a lay person; in this context, ''rabbi'' does not necessarily imply belief in God, as some celebrants belong to Humanistic Judaism.&lt;ref name="SHJ"&gt;[http://www.shj.org Society for Humanistic Judaism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
The actual number of brit shalom ceremonies performed per year is not known. Filmmaker Eli Ungar-Sargon, who is opposed to circumcision, said regarding its current popularity ″Calling it a marginal phenomenon would be generous″. This was confirmed by a survey conducted by ''[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|The Jewish Journal]]'' among mohalim and brit shalom celebrants in the Los Angeles area. However, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[NPR]], its popularity is growing.&lt;ref name="Little-known"/&gt;

==Recognition== 
Ritual circumcision of a male child on the eighth day of life is part of [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref name = "Greenberg"&gt;{{Citation

However, even in the most Orthodox groups, Jewish identity is defined by [[matrilineal descent]].

Cannabis was introduced to Grenada by [[Indo-Grenadians|Indian indentured workers]] who first arrived in the country on 1 May 1857 to work on plantations.

[[Rastafari]]an cannabis growers and distributors played in influential role in the [[New Jewel Movement|1979 socialist coup]] in Grenada.&lt;ref name="Hamid1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ansley Hamid|title=Drugs in America: Sociology, Economics, and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uc2Le4tBxwcC&amp;pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-8342-1060-8|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, just a few months following the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada) | 1979 Revolution]], Grenada's Rastafari found themselves betrayed by the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada) | PRG's]] decision to clamp down on marijuana cultivation.&lt;ref name="Steele2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Beverley A. Steele|title=Grenada: a history of its people|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofp6AAAAMAAJ
|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Caribbean|isbn=978-0-333-93053-3|pages=398-399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disillusionment was solidified in 1980, with the violent break-up of a demonstration by cannabis-growers and the scapegoating of Rastafarians for the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|PRA's]] murder of several youths in St. Patrick's-- events that led to hundreds of Rastafari being imprisoned at brutal "reorientation" work camps. &lt;ref name="Steele2003"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Grenada produces some amount of cannabis, and also serves as a transshipment point for drugs to the United States and other markets. Cultivation remains small, in plots of 200–500 plants in remote areas with inaccessible terrain. In 2009, Grenadian authorities seized 460kg of cannabis, as well as 1,309 [[Joint (cannabis)|cannabis cigarettes]].&lt;ref name="Brownfield2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William R. Brownfield|title=International Narcotics Control Strategy Report: Volume I: Drug and Chemical Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jnyNWFuhXYC&amp;pg=PA252|date=1 May 2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4379-8272-5|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grenada Drug Information Network assessed in 2003 that 75 percent of the cannabis grown on Grenada is for local consumption, with the remainder trafficked abroad, particularly to [[Barbados]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme R.

==Reform==
Following increased discussion in [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) around the possibility of reforming cannabis laws, in 2014 Grenada's Education and Human Resource Development Minister clarified: "Government's position on this issue is very clear. The cultivation and use of marijuana in Grenada is illegal, and therefore, we will abide by the laws of our land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caribbean360.com/news/grenada_news/grenada-has-no-interest-in-legalizing-marijuana#ixzz4SCoxvtvm |title=Grenada has no interest in legalizing marijuana |publisher=Caribbean360 |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

The '''Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994''' ("'''DSHEA'''"), is a 1994 statute of [[List of United States federal legislation|United States Federal legislation]] which defines and regulates [[dietary supplements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c103:S.784: |title=Six versions of Bill Number S.784 for the 103rd Congress |publisher=THOMAS.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act, supplements are effectively regulated by the FDA for Good Manufacturing Practices under 21 CFR Part 111.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/ |title=Dietary Supplements |publisher=FDA Office of Dietary Supplement Programs |accessdate=30 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the American Congress was evaluating several bills which would have increased the powers of the FDA. One of these acts, the ''Nutrition Advertising Coordination Act of 1991'' would have tightened the regulations regarding supplement labeling. In response to the proposed bill, many health food companies began lobbying the government to vote down the laws and told the public that the FDA would ban dietary supplements.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. 1998. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/19/opinion/unregulated-dietary-supplements.html "Unregulated Dietary Supplements."]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable ad featured the actor [[Mel Gibson]] being raided and arrested by FDA agents because he was taking vitamin C supplements.&lt;ref name=Molotsky&gt;Molotsky, Irvin. 1993. [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/us/us-issues-rules-on-diet-supplement-labels.html "U.S. Issues Rules on Diet Supplement Labels."] ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Kessler, chief executive of Nature Plus, a dietary supplement manufacturer and one of the leaders of the lobbying effort, accused the FDA of having "a bias against the supplement industry for 50 years."&lt;ref name=Molotsky/&gt;

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah) and [[Tom Harkin]] (D-Iowa) introduced the ''Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act'' in 1994. On October 25, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the Act into law, saying that "After several years of intense efforts, manufacturers, experts in nutrition, and legislators, acting in a conscientious alliance with consumers at the grassroots level, have moved successfully to bring common sense to the treatment of dietary supplements under regulation and law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov/dietsupp/ch1.htm|title=Chapter I - Dietary Supplement Health And Education Act of 1994|website=www.health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of supplement==
DSHEA defines the term "dietary supplement" to mean a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more dietary ingredients, including a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the aforementioned ingredients.&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"&gt;{{Citation |author1=Janet Rehnquist |authorlink1=Janet Rehnquist |date=March 2003 |title=Department of Health and Human Services - Office of the Inspector General - Dietary Supplement Labels: Key Elements |publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] |id=OEI-01-01-00120 |page= |url=https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-01-01-00120.pdf |access-date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a dietary supplement must be labeled as a dietary supplement and be intended for ingestion and must not be represented for use as conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or of the diet.&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt; In addition, a dietary supplement cannot be approved or authorized for investigation as a new drug, antibiotic, or biologic, unless it was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement before such approval or authorization.&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt; Under DSHEA, dietary supplements are deemed to be food, except for purposes of the drug definition.&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;

==Dietary supplement labels==
A "label" is a display of written, printed, or graphic material on the supplement container. DSHEA and other federal regulations require the following information to appear on dietary supplement labels:&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;

*a statement of identity that contains the words "dietary supplement." The word "dietary" may be replaced by the name of the dietary ingredient (e.g., "ginseng supplement")&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*net quantity of contents (for example, "60 capsules")&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*nutrition information in the form of a "Supplement Facts" panel, including the product [[serving size]], the amount, and percent daily value, if established, of each dietary ingredient&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*if a supplement contains a proprietary blend, the net weight of the blend as well as a listing of each ingredient in descending order of weight must be identified&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*the part of the plant used, if an herb or botanical&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*a complete list of ingredients by their common or usual names, either in descending order of prominence or with the source of the dietary ingredient in the "Supplement Facts" panel following the name of the dietary ingredient (for example, [[calcium]] (from [[calcium carbonate]]))&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*safety information that is considered "material" to the consequences that may result from the use of the supplement&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*the disclaimer "This statement has not been evaluated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease" if the supplement bears a claim to affect the structure or function of the body (structure/function claim), a claim of general well-being, or a claim of a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease.&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;
*At their discretion, manufacturers may add additional information on labels (such as claims and statements of quality assurance), and may decide on the placement of that information on their labels.&lt;ref name="OIGlabels"/&gt;

==Regulatory review==
Under the act, supplement manufacturers do not need to receive FDA approval before marketing dietary supplements that were marketed in the United States before 1994.&lt;ref&gt;FDA. [http://www.fda.gov/Food/Dietarysupplements/default.htm "Dietary Supplements."]&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary ingredients not so grandfathered are defined as New Dietary Ingredients in 21 U.S.C. 350b(d),&lt;ref&gt;FDA.gov - New Dietary Ingredients in Dietary Supplements - Background for Industry [http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/NewDietaryIngredientsNotificationProcess/ucm109764.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and notifications of providing reasonable evidence of their safety, or reasonable expectations of their safety, must be reviewed (not approved) by the FDA prior to their marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary Supplements: What You Need to Know|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/UsingDietarySupplements/ucm109760.htm|website=Dietary Supplements: Information for Consumers|publisher=FDA|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The herbal supplement industry has criticized these regulations as unfairly stringent; some feel they undermine the original intentions of the law to afford the herbal supplement industry freedom to market supplements as food.&lt;ref&gt;FDA Draft Guidance on New Dietary Ingredients for the Dietary Supplement Industry [http://www.crnusa.org/pdfs/Backgrounder_NDIN_FINAL_9-29-11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Some research has noted that there is scarce safety information available to the public about dietary supplements on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Supplement manufacturers and supplement consumer advocacy groups have generally welcomed the act, saying that the act protects consumers rights to readily have access to supplements.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Natural Health- USA. [http://www.anh-usa.org/dshea/ "Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)."]&lt;/ref&gt; The National Health Freedom Action calls DSHEA a "foundational cornerstones of health freedom in our country."&lt;ref&gt;National Health Freedom Action. [http://www.nationalhealthfreedom.org/nhfa/protect_dshea.html "Protect DSHEA!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025222912/http://www.nationalhealthfreedom.org/nhfa/protect_dshea.html |date=2013-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
The act has been widely criticised. [[Steven Novella]] has said that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The deal that DSHEA and NCCAM made with the public was this: Let the supplement industry have free {{sic|rei|gn}} to market untested products with unsupported claims, and then we’ll fund reliable studies to arm the public with scientific information so they can make good decisions for themselves. This "experiment" (really just a gift to the supplement industry) has been a dismal failure. The result has been an explosion of the supplement industry flooding the marketplace with useless products and false claims.&lt;ref&gt;Novella, Steven. 2013. [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/herbs_are_drugs "Herbs are Drugs."] Skeptical Inquirer.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The act has also been criticised because supplement manufacturers are not required to demonstrate supplements safety before marketing the supplements. The FDA can only ban a supplement if the FDA finds proof that the supplement is dangerous. This means that unsafe or ineffective supplements can be sold freely, while the FDA has only a limited capacity to monitor adverse reactions from supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Loxton, Daniel|date=2007|url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-12/ |title=The Immortal Lily The Pink: The 100th anniversary of the FDA marks a milestone in medicine before which cranks and charlatans ran amok |work=Skeptic }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | work=The New York Times | date=2013-12-26 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/opinion/dietary-supplements-and-safety.html?_r=0 | title=Dietary Supplements and Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Aaron Kessler|David Kessler]], commissioner of the FDA when DSHEA was approved, has stated that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 1994 Dietary Supplement Act does not require that dietary supplements (defined broadly to include many substances, such as herbs and amino acids, that have no nutritive value) be shown to be safe or effective before they are marketed. The FDA does not scrutinize a dietary supplement before it enters the marketplace. The agency is permitted to restrict a substance if it poses a 'significant and unreasonable risk' under the conditions of use on the label or as commonly consumed&amp;nbsp;... Congress has shown little interest in protecting consumers from the hazards of dietary supplements, let alone from the fraudulent claims that are made, since its members apparently believe that few of these products place people in real danger. Nor does the public understand how potentially dangerous these products can be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Barrett, Stephen|date=2007 |url=http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html |title=How the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 Weakened the FDA |work=Quackwatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also claim that many supplements are unsafe and unnatural, while many members of the public believe that supplements are natural as well as healthier and more effective than drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Skerrett, Patrick. 2012. [http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/fda-needs-stronger-rules-to-ensure-the-safety-of-dietary-supplements-201202024182 "FDA needs stronger rules to ensure the safety of dietary supplements."] Harvard University Health Blog.&lt;/ref&gt; DSHEA has also been criticised for being an industry driven bill, that the bill is made for the supplement industry, a multibillion-dollar industry, and not for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=8 March 2010 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/08/big-supplement-lashes-out-and-john-mccai/ |title="Big supplement" lashes out, and John McCain caves in |author=David Gorski (a.k.a.

The '''Division of Select Agents and Toxins''' (DSAT) of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] is responsible for the [[Select Agent Program]] and the Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program. They inspect the laboratories of more than 300 organizations approved to use and transfer [[select agents]], and put regulations in place to minimize risk in the use of these bacterial agents and toxins.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/phpr/documents/dsat_fact_sheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

DSAT investigates incidents related to the laboratory use of select agents and toxins and refers cases to the [[FBI]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS Office of Inspector General]] when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-04-15-00430.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They also review experiments that are deemed "restricted experiments" because of their increased risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Jacinta |last2=Gangadharan |first2=Denise |last3=Weyant |first3=Robbin |title=Review of Restricted Experiment Requests, Division of Select Agents and Toxins, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006-2013 |journal=Health Security |date=1 September 2015 |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=307–316 |doi=10.1089/hs.2015.0021 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4582684/ |issn=2326-5094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samuel S. Edwin became the director of the division in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC Announces New Director of Division of Select Agents and Toxins -- Occupational Health &amp; Safety|url=https://ohsonline.com/articles/2016/08/04/cdc-announces-new-director-of-division-of-select-agents-and-toxins.aspx|website=Occupational Health &amp; Safety|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office's 2016 budget was approximately $21.5 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">The use of computers (including devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s and [[laptop]]s) by children and adolescents before bed has been associated with a reduction in the hours of [[sleep]] experienced by frequent users, along with a decreased quality of sleep, in most cases. The results of computer use at night have been linked with tiredness.

A 2010 review concluded that "the use of electronic media by children and adolescents does have a negative impact on their sleep, although the precise effects and mechanisms remain unclear", with the most consistent results associating excessive media use with shorter sleep duration and delayed bed times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cain |first=Neralie |last2=Gradisar |first2=Michael |title=Electronic media use and sleep in school-aged children and adolescents: a review |journal=Sleep Medicine |date=15 February 2010 |volume=11 |pages=735–742 |url= |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 meta-analysis found that "Bedtime access and use of media devices was significantly associated with inadequate sleep quantity; poor sleep quality; and excessive daytime sleepiness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carter|first1=Ben|last2=Rees|first2=Philippa|last3=Hale|first3=Lauren|last4=Bhattacharjee|first4=Darsharna|last5=Paradkar|first5=Mandar S.|title=Association Between Portable Screen-Based Media Device Access or Use and Sleep Outcomes|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=1 December 2016|volume=170|issue=12|pages=1202|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.2341|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/60839202/poi160064.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] recommends screen time for children be limited for multiple reasons, among them that "Too much screen time can also harm the amount and quality of sleep".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Academy of Pediatrics Announces New Recommendations for Children’s Media Use|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-new-recommendations-for-childrens-media-use.aspx|website=www.aap.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many apps promise to improve sleep by filtering out blue light produced by media devices; there have been no large studies to assess whether such apps work. Some users express dissatisfaction with the resultant orange tint of screens. Some people use blue-blocking glasses, for the purpose of attempting to block out blue light both from electronic media and from other artificial light sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apps Can Cut Blue Light From Devices, But Do They Help You Sleep?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/11/27/561740031/apps-can-cut-blue-light-from-devices-but-do-they-help-you-sleep|accessdate=13 March 2018|work=NPR.org|date=2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''empowerment''' refers to measures designed to increase the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities in order to enable them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources. To do work with power.

The term empowerment originates from American [[community psychology]] and is associated{{by whom|date=June 2016}} with the social scientist [[Julian Rappaport]] (1981).&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, Julian. In praise of paradox. A social policy of empowerment over prevention, in: American Journal of Community Psychology, Vol. 9 (1), 1981, 1–25 (13)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compsy.org.uk/rethemp.htm|title=Rethinking empowerment: shared action against powerlessness|last=Burton &amp; Kagan|first=|date=1996|website=compsy.org.uk|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social work]], empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of [[citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] and [[democratic education]], empowerment is seen{{by whom|date=June 2016}} as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen. Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting [[civic engagement]]. Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a [[wikt:deficit|deficit]]-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of [[continuing education]] and [[self-help]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Definitions==
Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment', and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 
'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances, exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

One definition for the term is "an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources".&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Empowerment Group. (1989, October). Empowerment and family support. Networking Bulletin, 1(1)2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, M.A. (2000). Empowerment Theory: Psychological, Organizational and Community Levels of Analysis. "Handbook of Community Psychology," 43–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rappaport's (1984) definition includes: "Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport, J. (1984). Studies in empowerment: Introduction to the issue. "Prevention in Human Services," 3, 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociological empowerment often addresses members of groups that social discrimination processes have excluded from decision-making processes through – for example – discrimination based on disability, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], ethnicity, religion, or gender. Empowerment as a methodology is also associated with [[feminism]].

==Process==
Empowerment is the process of obtaining basic opportunities for [[marginalized]] people, either directly by those people, or through the help of non-marginalized others who share their own access to these opportunities. It also includes actively thwarting attempts to deny those opportunities. Empowerment also includes encouraging, and developing the skills for, [[self-sufficiency]], with a focus on eliminating the future need for [[Charity (practice)|charity]] or welfare in the individuals of the group. This process can be difficult to start and to implement effectively.

===Strategy===
One empowerment strategy is to assist marginalized people to create their own [[nonprofit organization]], using the rationale that only the marginalized people, themselves, can know what their own people need most, and that control of the organization by outsiders can actually help to further entrench marginalization. Charitable organizations lead from outside of the community, for example, can disempower the community by entrenching a dependence charity or welfare. A nonprofit organization can target strategies that cause structural changes, reducing the need for ongoing dependence. [[Red Cross]], for example, can focus on improving the health of indigenous people, but does not have authority in its charter to install water-delivery and purification systems, even though the lack of such a system profoundly, directly and negatively impacts health. A nonprofit composed of the indigenous people, however, could ensure their own organization does have such authority and could set their own agendas, make their own plans, seek the needed resources, do as much of the work as they can, and take responsibility – and credit – for the success of their projects (or the consequences, should they fail).

The process of which enables individuals/groups to fully access personal or collective power, authority and influence, and to employ that strength when engaging with other people, institutions or society. In other words, "Empowerment is not giving people power, people already have plenty of power, in the wealth of their knowledge and motivation, to do their jobs magnificently. We define empowerment as letting this power out."&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt;  It encourages people to gain the skills and knowledge that will allow them to overcome obstacles in life or work environment and ultimately, help them develop within themselves or in the society.

To empower a female "...sounds as though we are dismissing or ignoring males, but the truth is, both genders desperately need to be equally empowered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=2273|title=Encouraging and Empowering Girls - Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association|date=13 July 2012|website=Ccpa-accp.ca|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Empowerment occurs through improvement of conditions, standards, events, and a global perspective of life.

===Criticism===
Before there can be the finding that a particular group requires empowerment and that therefore their self-esteem needs to be consolidated on the basis of awareness of their strengths, there needs to be a deficit diagnosis usually carried out by experts assessing the problems of this group. The fundamental asymmetry of the relationship between experts and clients is usually not questioned by empowerment processes. It also needs to be regarded critically, in how far the empowerment approach is really applicable to all patients/clients. It is particularly questionable whether [[mentally ill]] people in acute crisis situations are in a position to make their own decisions. According to Albert Lenz, people behave primarily regressive in acute crisis situations and tend to leave the responsibility to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Lenz: ''Empowerment und Ressourcenaktivierung – Perspektiven für die psychosoziale Praxis.''&lt;/ref&gt; It must be assumed, therefore, that the implementation of the empowerment concept requires a minimum level of communication and reflectivity of the persons involved.

== In social work and community psychology ==
[[File:Altenheim 12.jpg|thumb|Empowerment in the work for senior citizens in a residential home in Germany]]
In [[social work]], empowerment offers an approach that allows social workers to increase the capacity for self-help of their clients. For example, this allows clients not to be seen as passive, helpless 'victims' to be rescued but instead as a self-empowered person fighting abuse/ oppression; a fight, in which the social worker takes the position of a facilitator, instead of the position of a 'rescuer'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalized people who lack self-sufficiency become, at a minimum, dependent on charity, or welfare.  They lose their self-confidence because they cannot be fully self-supporting.  The opportunities denied them also deprive them of the pride of accomplishment which others, who have those opportunities, can develop for themselves. This in turn can lead to psychological, social and even mental health problems. "[[Marginalized]]" here refers to the overt or covert trends within societies whereby those perceived as lacking desirable traits or deviating from the group norms tend to be excluded by wider society and ostracized as undesirables.

===In health promotion practice and research===
As a concept, and model of practice, empowerment is also used in health promotion research and practice.
The key principle is for individuals to gain increased control over factors that influence their health status &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

To empower individuals and to obtain more equity in health, it is also important to address health-related behaviors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/about/HPR%20Glossary%201998.pdf|title= Health Promotion Glossary - World Health Organization|website=WHO.int|accessdate=4 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Studies suggest that health promotion interventions aiming at empowering adolescents should enable active learning activities, use visualizing tools to facilitate self-reflection, and allow the adolescents to influence intervention activities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmberg|first=Christopher|last2=Larsson|first2=Christel|last3=Korp|first3=Peter| last4=Lindgren|first4=Eva-Carin|last5=Jonsson|first5=Linus|last6=Fröberg|first6=Andreas|last7=Chaplin|first7=John E.|last8=Berg|first8=Christina|date=2018-07-04|title=Empowering aspects for healthy food and physical activity habits: adolescents’ experiences of a school-based intervention in a disadvantaged urban community|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|journal=International Journal of Qualitative Studies on Health and Well-being|volume=13|issue=sup 1|doi=10.1080/17482631.2018.1487759|}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In economics==
According to Robert Adams, there is a long tradition in the UK and the USA respectively to advance forms of self-help that have developed and contributed to more recent concepts of empowerment. For example, the free enterprise economic theories of [[Milton Friedman]] embraced self-help as a respectable contributor to the economy. Both the Republicans in the US and the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] built on these theories. 'At the same time, the mutual aid aspects of the concept of self-help retained some currency with socialists and democrats.'&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Robert. ''Empowerment, participation and social work''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, p.7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economic development]], the empowerment approach focuses on mobilizing the [[self-help]] efforts of the poor, rather than providing them with [[social welfare]]. Economic empowerment is also the empowering of previously disadvantaged sections of the population, for example, in many previously colonized African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microempowering.org |title=Welcome to MicroEmpowering! |publisher=Microempowering.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasingly engaged corporate directors===
The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has argued that large [[institutional investor]]s such as [[pension fund]]s and [[Financial endowment|endowment]]s are exercising a greater influence on the process of adding and replacing corporate directors – as they are themselves steered to do so by their own board members (pension trustees).

This could eventually put more pressure on the [[CEO]]s of [[public company|publicly listed companies]], as “more than ever before, many [North American], UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s [[Sustainable Development Goals]]”, and other [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-centric]] investment practices &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Legal empowerment happens when marginalised people or groups use the [[legal mobilisation]] i.e., law, legal systems and justice mechanisms to improve or transform their social, political or economic situations. Legal empowerment approaches are interested in understanding how they can use the [[law]] to advance interests and priorities of the marginalised.&lt;ref name=odi&gt;{{cite web|title=The politics of legal empowerment: legal mobilisation strategies and implications for development|url=http://www.odi.org/publications/8485-legal-empowerment-mobilisation|website=Odi.org|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 'Open society foundations' (an NGO)  "Legal empowerment is about [[Capacity building|strengthening the capacity]] of all people to exercise their [[rights]], either as individuals or as members of a community. Legal empowerment is about grass root justice, about ensuring that [[law]] is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/legal-empowerment|title=What Is Legal Empowerment?|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenzo Cotula in his book ' ''Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control'' ' outlines the fact that [[Law|legal tools]] for securing local resource rights are enshrined in legal system, does not necessarily mean that local resource users are in position to use them and benefit from them. The [[legal system|state legal system]] is constrained by a range of different factors – from lack of resources to cultural issues. Among these factors economic, geographic, linguistic and other constraints on access to courts, ''lack of [[legal awareness]] as well as [[legal aid|legal assistance]] '' tend to be recurrent problems.&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many context, marginalised groups do not trust the legal system owing to the widespread manipulation that it has historically been subjected to by the more powerful. 'To what extent one knows the [[law]], and make it work for themselves with 'para legal tools',  is legal empowerment; assisted utilizing innovative approaches like [[legal literacy]] and awareness training, broadcasting [[legal information]], conducting participatory [[legal discourse]]s, supporting local resource user in negotiating with other agencies and stake holders and to strategies combining use of [[Legal proceeding|legal processes]] with [[advocacy]] along with media engagement, and socio [[legal mobilisation]].&lt;ref name=Cotula /&gt;

Sometimes groups are marginalized by society at large, with governments participating in the process of marginalization. [[Equal opportunity]] laws which actively oppose such marginalization, are supposed to allow empowerment to occur. These laws made it illegal to restrict access to schools and public places based on race. They can also be seen as a symptom of minorities' and [[women's empowerment]] through lobbying.

==Gender==
{{main|Gender empowerment|Women empowerment}}
[[Gender empowerment]] conventionally refers to the [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], which is a significant topic of discussion in regards to development and economics nowadays. It also points to approaches regarding other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context. This approach to empowerment is partly informed by [[feminism]] and employed legal empowerment by building on international [[human rights]]. Empowerment is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights]] and [[International development|development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN Sustainable Development Goals]] targets gender equality and women's empowerment for the global development agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|website=Un.org|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In workplace management==
According to Thomas A. Potterfield,&lt;ref&gt;Potterfield, Thomas. "The Business of Employee Empowerment: Democracy and Ideology in the Workplace." Quorum Books, 1999, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; many organizational theorists and practitioners regard employee empowerment as one of the most important and popular [[Management fad|management concepts]] of our time.

Ciulla discusses an inverse case: that of [[Counterfeit|bogus]] empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ciulla| first = Joanne B.| chapter = Leadership and the Problem of Bogus Empowerment| editor-last = Ciulla| editor-first = Joanne B.| title = Ethics, the heart of leadership| edition = 2| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| publication-date = 2004| isbn = 978-0-275-98248-5| quote = [...] in many organizations, promises of empowerment are bogus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In management===
In the sphere of [[management]] and organizational theory, "empowerment" often refers loosely to processes for giving subordinates (or [[worker]]s generally) greater discretion and resources: distributing control in order to better serve both customers and the interests of employing organizations.

One account of the history of workplace empowerment in the [[United States of America|United States]] recalls the clash of management styles in railroad construction in the [[American West]] in the mid-19th century, where "traditional" hierarchical East-Coast models of control encountered individualistic pioneer workers, strongly supplemented by methods of [[efficiency]]-oriented "worker [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]]" brought to the scene by [[Chinese American|Chinese]] [[coolie|laborer]]s. In this case, empowerment at the level of work [[team]]s or brigades achieved a notable (but short-lived) demonstrated superiority. See the [http://www.motivation-tools.com/workplace/history.htm views] of Robert L. Webb.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, empowerment has become a point of interest in management concepts and business administration. In this context, empowerment involves approaches that promise greater participation and integration to the employee in order to cope with their tasks as independently as possible and responsibly can. A strength-based approach known as "empowerment circle" has become an instrument of organizational development. Multidisciplinary empowerment teams aim for the development of [[quality circles]] to improve the organizational culture, strengthening the motivation and the skills of employees. The target of subjective job satisfaction of employees is pursued through flat hierarchies, participation in decisions, opening of creative effort, a positive, appreciative team culture, self-evaluation, taking responsibility (for results), more self-determination and constant further learning. The optimal use of existing potential and abilities can supposedly be better reached by satisfied and active workers. Here, [[knowledge management]] contributes significantly to implement employee participation as a guiding principle, for example through the creation of [[communities of practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2010/04/empowering-your-employees-to-e|title=Empowering Your Employees to Empower Themselves |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to ensure that the individual employee has the skills to meet their allocated responsibilities and that the company's structure sets up the right incentives for employees to reward their taking responsibilities. Otherwise there is a danger of being overwhelmed or even becoming lethargic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/1998/05/empowerment-the-emperors-new-clothes|title=Empowerment: The Emperor’s New Clothes |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implications for company culture===
Empowerment of employees requires a culture of trust in the organization and an appropriate information and communication system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.atulhost.com/employee-empowerment|title=Employee Empowerment: The Key to Employee Satisfaction|publisher=AtulHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of these activities is to save control costs, that become redundant when employees act independently and in a self-motivated fashion. 
In the book ''Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute'', the authors illustrate three keys that organizations can use to open the knowledge, experience, and motivation power that people already have.&lt;ref name=blanchard/&gt; The three keys that managers must use to empower their employees are:
# [[information sharing|Share information]] with everyone
# Create [[autonomy]] through boundaries
# Replace the old hierarchy with [[self-directed work team]]s

According to Stewart, in order to guarantee a successful work environment, managers need to exercise the "right kind of [[authority]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;6).  To summarize, "empowerment is simply the effective use of a manager’s authority", and subsequently, it is a productive way to maximize all-around work [[efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Aileen Mitchell. ''Empowering People'' (Institute of Management). Pitman. London: Financial Times Management, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

These keys are hard to put into place and it is a journey to achieve empowerment in a workplace.  It is important to [[workplace training|train]] employees and make sure they have trust in what empowerment will bring to a company.&lt;ref name=blanchard&gt;{{cite book|author1=Blanchard, Kenneth H.|author2=John P. Carlos|author3=Alan Randolph|title=Empowerment Takes More than a Minute|publisher=San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the concept of empowerment in management has also been criticised for failing to live up to its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hbr.org/2015/05/6-myths-about-empowering-employees|title=6 Myths About Empowering Employees |publisher=hbr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Age of Popular Empowerment?==

[[Marshall McLuhan]] insisted that the development of [[electronic media]] would eventually weaken the [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures that underpin central governments, large corporation, academia and, more generally, rigid, “[[Descartes|linear-Cartsesian”]] forms of social organization.&lt;ref name="youtube1977"&gt;{{cite news|last1= McLuhan|first1=Marshall|title=‘ABC TV Monday Conference: The Medium is the Message (Part 1)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImaH51F4HBw|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= ABC TV Monday Conference|publisher=ABC TV Monday Conference|date=27 June 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
From that perspective, new, “electronic forms of awareness” driven by [[information technology]] would empower citizen, employees and students by disseminating in [[real-time computing|near-real-time]] vast amounts of information once reserved to a small number of experts and specialists. Citizens would be bound to ask for substantially more say in the management of government affairs, production, consumption, and education &lt;ref name="youtube1977"/&gt;

[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] economist Nicolas Firzli has argued that rapidly rising cultural tides, notably new forms of online engagement and increased demands for [[Environmental, social and corporate governance|ESG-driven]] public policies and managerial decisions are transforming the way governments and corporation interact with citizen-consumers in the “Age of Empowerment” &lt;ref name="pensions-expert1"/&gt;

==Histopathological features==
*The [[epithelial]] lining of eruption cyst is similar to that of the [[dentigerous cyst]] (non-[[keratinized]] stratified [[squamous]] [[epithelium]]), so the eruption cyst is considered a superficial dentigerous cyst.
*The fibrous capsule shows inflammatory cells possibly as a result of trauma.

The '''Functional GEnomics Data Society''' ('''FGED''') (formerly known as the '''MGED Society''')
is a non-profit, volunteer-run international organization 
of biologists, computer scientists, and data analysts that aims to
facilitate biological and biomedical discovery through data
integration. The approach of FGED is to promote the sharing of [[basic research]] 
data generated primarily via [[multiplex (assay)|high-throughput technologies]] 
that generate large data sets within the domain of [[functional genomics]].

Members of the FGED Society work with other organizations to support the effective sharing and reproducibility 
of functional genomics data; facilitate the creation of
standards and software tools that leverage the standards; and promote the sharing of high quality, well
annotated data within the [[life sciences]] and [[biomedical]] communities.

Founded in 1999 as the "Microarray Gene Expression Data (MGED) Society," this organization changed its name to the "Functional Genomics Data Society" in 2010 to reflect the fact that it has broadened its focus beyond the application of [[DNA microarrays]] for [[gene expression]] analysis to include technologies such as [[high-throughput sequencing]]. The scope of the FGED Society includes data generated using any functional genomics technology when applied to genome-scale studies of gene expression, binding, modification and other related applications.

==History==

The FGED Society was formed in 1999 at a meeting on Microarray Gene
Expression Databases in recognition of the need to establish standards
for sharing and storing data from [[DNA microarray]] experiments. Originally named the "MGED Society," the society began with 
a focus on DNA microarrays and [[gene expression]] data.

The original MGED Society was incorporated in 2002 as a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] 
public benefit organization with the title
''Microarray Gene Expression Data Society'' and obtained permanent
charity status in 2007. The MGED name was legally changed in 2007 to
''Microarray and Gene Expression Data Society'' to emphasize a broader
scope.

In September 2008, the Society decided to promote itself simply as the
''MGED Society'' to broaden the Society's scope beyond microarray technology
and gene expression applications, yet still
retain the recognized value of the MGED name within the community.

In July 2010, the society voted to change its name to the "Functional Genomics Data (FGED) Society"
to reflect its current mission which goes beyond microarrays and gene expression to encompass data
generated using any [[functional genomics]] technology applied to
[[genome|genomic]]-scale studies of gene
expression, [[Interactome|binding]], modification (such as [[DNA methylation]]), 
and other related applications. This was formally announced on 14 July 2010 at the society's "MGED13" annual meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FGED_Society|title=Big news: MGED has a new name: FGED - Functional Genomics Data Society|url=https://twitter.com/FGED_Society/status/18534129748|work=Twitter|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidents of the FGED Society===
Board members and officers of the FGED Society are elected annually each May and start serving in June. Presidents of the FGED Society along with their terms in office are as follows:
* Francis Ouellette (2013–Present)
* [[John Quackenbush]] (2011-2013)
* Chris Stoeckert (2007-2011)
* Catherine Ball (2003-2007)
* Alvis Brasma (1999-2003)

==Membership==

The FGED Board of Directors and Advisory Board consist of volunteers
from academia, industry, government, and journals representing a
cross-section of those generating, analyzing, archiving, and
publishing in the functional genomics area.
Although there is no formal membership, the attendees of
the [[#Annual meeting|annual FGED meetings]] are considered to be part of the FGED community.

==Achievements==

To date, FGED has produced a variety of standards specifications
pertaining to DNA microarray experiments. These standards are designed
to improve the annotation, communication, and sharing of data and
findings from such experiments within the life science research
community.

===MINSEQE===
Minimal Information about a high-throughput SEQuencing Experiment (MINSEQE) is a
data content [[Minimum Information Standards|minimum information standard]] that describes the essential information needed to
adequately document a [[next-generation sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] experiment for the purpose of
interpretation and replication of the results.&lt;ref name="minseqe"&gt;{{cite web | author = Functional Genomics Data Society | title = Minimum Information about a high-throughput SEQuencing Experiment |date=June 2012 | url = http://fged.org/projects/minseqe/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MIAME===
[[MIAME]] (Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment) is a
data content standard that describes the essential information needed to
adequately document a DNA microarray experiment for the purpose of
interpretation and replication of the results. It was the first published example of a [[Minimum Information Standards|minimum information standard]] for high-throughput experiments in the life sciences, and as such, laid the groundwork for similar standards in other bioscience domains.

===MAGE-OM and MAGE-TAB===
[[MicroArray and Gene Expression|MAGE-OM]] (MicroArray Gene Expression
Object Model) is a data exchange and data modeling standard for use in encoding 
data from microarray experiments for the purpose of export and import
into software tools and databases via [[XML]] files. MAGE-OM is a
[[platform-independent model]] implemented in the XML-based MAGE-ML
format.

A new version, '''MAGE-TAB''', has been developed to be easier to
understand and generate by data producers as it is in a format
([[Delimiter-separated values|tab-delimited]]) that can be viewed and edited using widely available
spreadsheet software, such as [[Microsoft Excel]].&lt;!--

===MGED Ontology===

The MGED Ontology (MO) provides a standard terminology for describing components of a
DNA microarray experiment.&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MO_FAQ.htm | title=The MGED Ontology FAQ | work=MO project website | accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
--&gt;
The [[Ontology for Biomedical Investigations]] (OBI) is being developed as a replacement for the MO. A mapping of ontology terms from MO to OBI is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping terms between MO and Ontology for Biomedical Investigations|url=http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MO2OBImapping.php|publisher=MGED Ontology Working Group|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual meeting==

A major component of the FGED Society effort
has been the annual FGED meeting to showcase cutting-edge scientific work and promote
standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fged.org/conferences/ | title=List of FGED annual meetings | work=FGED website | accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FGED Society has held its annual meeting at venues around
the world since 1999, coordinating with a local scientific organization 
that provides space for talks, poster sessions, workshops, and tutorials.

A '''game larder''', also sometimes known as a '''deer''' or '''venison larder''', '''deer''', '''venison''' or '''game house''', '''game pantry''' or '''game store''', is a small domestic outbuilding where the carcasses of [[Game (hunting)|game]], including deer, game birds, hares and rabbits, are [[hanging (meat)|hung]] to mature in a cool environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/term_definitions.asp?thesaurus_code=ty&amp;term_id=751 Sine Project: Term Definitions: Game Larder] (accessed 22 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orapweb.rcahms.gov.uk/apex/f?p=210:1:15253310916966::NO::P1_USES_LIST,P1_THE_T_U_UID,P1_SHOW_DETAILS,P1_THE_TE_UID:0,0,2,485 Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: RCAHMS Thesauri] (accessed 22 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Loudon /&gt; A feature of large [[country house]]s in Britain and parts of northern Europe from the 18th century, game larders continue to be used by shooting estates.

==18th–20th centuries==
[[File:The Game Larder, Studley Park - geograph.org.uk - 651682.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Square example at [[Studley Royal Park|Studley Park]], Yorkshire]]
A separate building for storing game during the [[hanging (meat)|maturation process]] improves ventilation, while reducing the odour problem.&lt;ref name=Binney /&gt; Most large [[country house]]s in Britain had a game larder,&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Bryson|Bryson B]]. ''At Home: A Short History of Private Life'' (Random House; 2010), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous examples built between the early 18th and early 20th centuries survive.&lt;ref name=NHLE_search&gt;A search of the [[National Heritage List for England]] on 22 March 2015 for monument category "game larder" gave 162 English examples.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure also existed in other European countries where hunting or shooting game was popular, including Germany and [[Austria–Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Bunting M. ''The Plot: A Biography of an English Acre'', ch. 8 (Granta; 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Game larders were usually situated near the kitchen.&lt;ref name=Loudon /&gt; The usual English design is single storey, sometimes octagonal, and usually of brick or stone construction; ventilation is provided by [[Louver|louvre]]d [[roof lantern]]s and louvred or mesh-covered unglazed windows.&lt;ref name=Binney /&gt;&lt;ref name=NHLE_search /&gt; Some game larders had separate rooms for small and large game.&lt;ref name=Binney /&gt; A stone or slate floor helped to cool the room. By the early 20th century, refrigeration via cooling pipes was employed.&lt;ref name=Binney /&gt; Game larders were sometimes combined with other outbuildings, especially [[ice house (building)|ice house]]s, as for example at [[Elvaston Castle]] in Derbyshire and [[Raith Park]] in Fife. In central Europe, ice houses were themselves sometimes used for storing deer carcasses.&lt;ref&gt;Buxbaum T. "Commercial Icehouses" in ''Icehouses'' (Shire Publications; 2014) ({{ISBN|9780747813002}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The game larder, Audley End - geograph.org.uk - 1281671.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Timber example at [[Audley End House]], Essex]]
[[John Claudius Loudon]] describes a small game larder in 1842: 

{{quotation|I once saw a very pretty convenient larder, which was used only for game. ... It was built out from the wall of the kitchen, in the form of an octagon, having windows on every side, except that formed by the kitchen wall, and in this was the door. The roof projected over the windows, to protect them from the sun and rain. The ceiling in the interior was coved, and from the centre hung an octagon rack with hooks for the smaller birds all ranged in order; and round the wall was another rack for pheasants, hares, rabbits, &amp;c.&lt;ref name=Loudon&gt;Loudon JC. ''An Encyclopædia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture and Furniture'' (Longman, Brown, Green, &amp; Longman: 1842), p. 805&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Uppark game larder.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Game larder at [[Uppark]], Sussex]]
Rails or beams were used to support deer on hooks, with roof-suspended racks, sometimes on pulleys, for small game.&lt;ref name=Binney /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sambrook P. ''A Country House at Work: Three Centuries of Dunham Massey'' (National Trust Books; 2006), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Shelves, possibly of marble, were also used.&lt;ref name=Binney&gt;Binney R. ''Wise Words and Country House Ways'' (David &amp; Charles: 2012), ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Another necessary fixture described by Victorian architect [[Robert Kerr (architect)|Robert Kerr]] is a dresser topped with slate or marble for meat preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr R. ''The Gentleman's House; or, How To Plan English Residences, from the Parsonage to the Palace'' (Murray; 1865), p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively early example is the game larder at [[Farnborough Hall]], Warwickshire, which dates from around 1750 and is thought to be by [[Sanderson Miller]]; the hexagonal rendered-brick structure has a [[loggia]] with [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] columns and is surmounted with a wooden [[cupola]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1374967 |desc=The game larder|accessdate=}} (accessed 24 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meir J (1997) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1587155  Sanderson Miller and the landscaping of Wroxton Abbey, Farnborough Hall and Honington Hall]. ''[[Garden History]]'' 25: 81–106 {{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an unornamented square game larder stands at [[Studley Royal Park|Studley Park]] in Yorkshire; built in limestone, it dates from the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1150599 |desc=Game larder approximately 50 metres south-east of Lindrick Gate|accessdate=}} (accessed 24 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The square stone game larder at [[Rydal Hall]] in Cumbria has a timber upper storey reached by an external staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1245409 |desc=Game larder in grounds of Rydal Hall|accessdate=}} (accessed 24 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Although most extant game larders are built in stone or brick, some timber examples have survived. Examples include the structures at [[Brodsworth Hall]], Yorkshire, [[Audley End House]], Essex, and the Bird Game Larder at [[Ardverikie House]], Badenoch and Strathspey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildingsatrisk.org.uk/details/911457 Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland: Ardverikie House: Bird Game Larder] (accessed 22 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their practical purpose, game larders on great estates often served a decorative function, and could be highly ornate in their design.&lt;ref&gt;Hobson JCJ. ''A Practical Guide To Modern Gamekeeping'' (Hachette; 2012), ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The game larder at [[Uppark]] in Sussex, designed by [[Humphry Repton]], has a floor decorated with deer vertebrae, and has been described as "a mannered grotesque advertisement for the pleasures of the chase and the table awaiting arriving guests."&lt;ref&gt;Macarthur J. ''The Picturesque: Architecture, Disgust and Other Irregularities'', p. 83 (Routledge; 2007) ({{ISBN|978-1844720118}})&lt;/ref&gt; Dating from around 1810, the rectangular flint-faced building has an octagonal timber portion.&lt;ref name=Binney /&gt;&lt;ref name=Uppark_listing&gt;{{NHLE|num=1354701 |desc=The game larder at Up Park to the north west of the old laundry and kitchen block, Compton Road|accessdate=}} (accessed 24 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The game larder at [[Combermere Abbey]] in Cheshire, which also dates from the early 19th century and is thought to be by the Irish [[William Vitruvius Morrison|Morrison]] family, has decorative windows in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] style.

''The Buildings of England: Cheshire'' (2nd edn) (Yale University Press; 2011), pp. 294–5 ({{ISBN|978 0 300 17043 6}})&lt;/ref&gt; The game larder at [[Abbotsford House]] in Selkirkshire, built by John Smith of [[Darnick]] in 1851, takes the form of a circular castle, with [[crenellation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING,HL:15104,abbotsford Historic Scotland: Abbotsford including house, walled gardens and courtyards, conservatory, bothies, game larder, ice house, terraces, gate lodge, boundary walls, gardener's cottage, stable block, garden statuary and all other ancillary structures] (accessed 24 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The circular interior of the game larder at [[Holkham Hall]] in Norfolk is lined with [[alabaster]]; designed by [[Samuel Wyatt]], the octagonal building dates from 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1373660 |desc=Game larder immediately east of orangery at Holkham Hall|accessdate=}} (accessed 24 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martins SW. ''Coke of Norfolk (1754-1842): A Biography'', p. 52 (Boydell &amp; Brewer; 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
Game larders continue to be used on shooting estates in Britain to store game and sometimes additionally to process it to meat products such as [[venison]]. To comply with modern food hygiene regulations, their design incorporates drinking-quality water outlets, and frequently powered ventilation, insect-killing devices and refrigeration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/wildgameguide0611.pdf Food Standards Agency: The Wild Game Guide (6 June 2011)] (accessed 22 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeerinitiative.co.uk/uploads/guides/139.pdf The Deer Initiative: Carcass Larder Design] (accessed 22 March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ghana Optometric Association''' ('''GOA''') is the professional and regulatory body responsible for the development of the Optometry profession in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name=GOA&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana Optometric Association|url=http://ghanaoptometry.org/pages/#|publisher=www.ghanaoptometry.org|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The association was formed in 1997 to unite the optometry professionals as well as provide a united front to promote the activities of member.&lt;ref name=GOA/&gt;

==Executives==

===Executives===
Five executives lead the GOA. It is headed by the late Dr Julius Darko as President of GOA, then subsequently Dr.Samuel O.Asiedu.&lt;ref name=GOA/&gt;
Dr Remi Ninkpe is the current president.

==Activities==
The association in 2009 passed a resolution mandating all optometrists wanting to be members to write a professional exam. Upon successfully passing the exam, the certification required to practice optometry in Ghana is awarded. The group has about 200 members. In 2010 the Ghana Optometric Association along with the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology's Faculty of Distance Learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/90811/1/knust-inaugurates-faculty-of-distance-learning.html |title=KNUST Inaugurates Faculty of Distance Learning - modernghana.com/regional news |accessdate=2011-09-25 |publisher=Modern Ghana Media Communication Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; rolled out a two-year program to offer all members of GOA who did not have the Doctor of Optometry degree to enroll for it. The aim of the programme is to ensure that by the end of 2012 all optometrists in Ghana will have the O.D degree as is required under the Ministry of Health. This was successfully accomplished. As such, the OD certificate in OPTOMETRY, is the only recognised for practise in GHANA. The GOA has grown since its inception. Apart from regulating the activities of optometrists countrywide, it also looks out for the well being of its members in ways such as:
*Organizing continuing education programmes for optometrists
*Advocating for better terms of service from the Ministry of Health
*Partnering international bodies to promote eye care in Ghana

==GOA collaborations==
One of the major achievements of GOA was hosting the World Council of Optometry (WCO) General Delegates meeting in Accra from 6 to 10 April 2005. It was the first time the meeting was held in Africa.
The Ghana Optometric Association did so in collaboration with the Africa Council of Optometry with sponsorship from Essilor International. It was attended by about 200 delegates from the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghana to host world optometry meeting|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/74742/1/ghana-to-host-world-optometry-meeting.html|publisher=www.modernghana.com|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guinness Foreign Extra Stout''' ('''FES''') is a [[stout]] produced by the [[Guinness Brewery]], an Irish [[brewing company]] owned by [[Diageo]], a drinks [[Multinational corporation|multinational]]. First brewed by Guinness in 1801, FES was designed for export, and is more heavily [[hops|hopped]] than [[Guinness Draught]] and Extra Stout, and typically has a higher alcohol content (at around 7.5% [[ABV]]), which gives it a more bitter taste.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Phelan|first=Andrew|title=FAQ|url=http://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/FAQs.aspx|work=Guinness Storehouse|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extra hops were intended as a natural preservative for the long journeys the beer would take by ship.

FES is the Guinness variant that is most commonly found in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and it accounts for almost half of Guinness sales worldwide. Over four million hectolitres of the beer were sold in Africa in 2011, where Diageo intend to grow the product into the continent's highest selling beer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annualreport2012.diageoreports.com/|title=Investors|website=Diageo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, hopped [[wort]] extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, is used for overseas production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. In most overseas markets, Guinness Flavour Extract (GFE) is blended with locally brewed beer to produce FES.

FES was marketed in Nigeria as "gives you power" in the 1960s. This was updated for 1999&amp;ndash;2006 with the [[Michael Power (advertisement)|Michael Power]] campaign, which aired across Africa. The beer is ranked highly on [[beer rating]] websites, while beer critics have varying opinions.

==History==
[[File:Guinness-bier1441.JPG|thumbnail|right|Guinness Foreign Extra Stout bottle label until 2005]]
Guinness West India Porter, the direct predecessor of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] in Dublin in 1801.&lt;ref name="Yenne2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yenne, Bill|title=Guinness: The 250-Year Quest for the Perfect Pint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQY3p75FIdUC&amp;pg=PT17|accessdate=18 July 2012|date=5 October 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-12052-1|pages= 17–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product was formulated for Irish immigrant workers in [[the Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=Garrett|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYVLHMmplRcC&amp;pg=PA494|accessdate=18 July 2012|date=7 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536713-3|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats for up to two years, which gave the finished product greater stability.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;{{cite book|author1=S. Stanley Raymond Dennison|author2=Oliver MacDonagh|title=Guinness 1886–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7q6vPnWj2tkC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=26 February 2013|year=1998|publisher=Cork University Press|isbn=978-1-85918-175-1|pages=3–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer.&lt;ref name="Yenne2007" /&gt; Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.&lt;ref name=bottle&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=A Bottle of Guinness Please|year=2006|publisher=Phimboy|isbn=978-0-9553713-0-1|pages=23–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded shipment of the beer to the United States was in 1817.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; In 1827, the first official shipment of Guinness on the African continent arrived in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=africatimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Dominic|title=Africa gets a stout new bottle for its version of Guinness|newspaper=The Times|date=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer was renamed Foreign Extra Stout from around 1849 onwards.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news|last=MacDonagh|first=Oliver|title=Guinness and foreign trade|newspaper=The Times|date=10 November 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded exports to South East Asia began in the 1860s.&lt;ref name=seasiaex&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guinness story|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx?file=%2f2009%2f8%2f3%2flifeliving%2f4319328&amp;sec=lifeliving|accessdate=17 November 2013|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)|date=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FES accounted for around five per cent of all Guinness production at the turn of the twentieth century, with two thirds destined for Australia and the United States, where it was largely used as a medicinal product.&lt;ref name="Yenne2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt; Australia remained the single largest export market for the product until 1910, when it was eclipsed by the United States.&lt;ref name="Yenne2007" /&gt; Due to the expense of importation, FES was a premium product, retaling for double the price of domestic stouts.&lt;ref name="Yenne2007" /&gt; Total production had reached 105,000 [[hogshead]]s by 1912.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;

The American trade was disrupted by the onset of [[World War I]] and then discontinued entirely with the introduction of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].&lt;ref name="Yenne2007" /&gt; The product was not popular when it returned in the 1930s, as drinkers now preferred the lighter and cheaper Guinness Extra Stout.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; Following discontinuation of export during [[World War II]], FES did not return to the United States until 1956, but this was to prove unsuccessful, and the beer was withdrawn shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Company Limited|newspaper=The Manchester Guardian|date=3 February 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinness export sales were mostly to ethnic [[Anglo Saxon]]s and [[Celts]] prior to 1920.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; This changed from the 1920s onwards, and among the first natives to develop a taste for the drink were the ethnic Chinese of the [[Malay Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; A global Guinness salesman was appointed by the company in 1924, and sales began to be pursued among native populations.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt;

In 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, the British [[War Office]] purchased 500,000 half-pint bottles of FES for distribution to hospitals.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt;

In 1951, exports totalled 90,000 [[barrel]]s, but by 1964 had grown to 300,000 barrels.&lt;ref name="Yenne2007" /&gt; By 1959, sales in Ghana had grown large enough for Guinness to establish a [[joint venture]] in the country with the [[United Africa Company of Nigeria|United Africa Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ghana: 40th anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oybwAAAAMAAJ|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness, with around 100,000 barrels exported to the country every year.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite news|title=Guinness For Power|newspaper=The Economist|date=16 March 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the company to build a brewery in [[Ikeja]] in western Nigeria to supply the demand; it was only the third brewery in the company's history.&lt;ref name=ikejatimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Guinness Brewery Begun at Ikeja|newspaper=The Times|date=1 February 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brewery cost over [[Pound sterling|£]]2 million, had a 150,000 barrel capacity, and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria, 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests.&lt;ref name=power /&gt; Breweries followed in Malaysia (1965), Cameroon (1970) and Ghana (1971), whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African countries and the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinness-storehouse.com/en/docs/Papers-Of-The-Dublin-Export-Department.pdf|title=Guinness Storehouse|website=www.guinness-storehouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically a small proportion of Guinness production, it was this success, especially in Africa but also in Asia, that allowed FES to grow into a 4.5 million hectolitre brand.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;{{cite news|title=To Arthur|url=http://www.digitaldispense.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Brew-Sep_Oct-2010-Guinness-Article.pdf|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=Brewer's Guardian|date=September–October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new bottle design was debuted in Malaysia in 2005, and later rolled out worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gab.com.my/investor/ar09/ar09.pdf untitled&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232822/http://www.gab.com.my/investor/ar09/ar09.pdf |date=30 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, FES received a packaging redesign in Africa and other selected markets, with a gold foil top and a new label.&lt;ref name=fesnigeriarelaunch&gt;{{cite news|author=Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Adam Thomson|title=Diageo upbeat on Africa performance|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9e29ff2a-34fe-11e3-a13a-00144feab7de.html#axzz2he5S2IXN|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=Financial Times|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish version of FES is brewed with [[pale malt]], 25 per cent flaked barley (for [[head (beer)|head]] retention and body) and 10 per cent roasted barley, the latter being what gives the beer its dark hue.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beer-pages.com/notes/beer-of-the-month-2009-02.shtml|title=Home - wine-pages|website=wine-pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the bitter [[List of hop varieties#Galena|Galena]], [[List of hop varieties#Nugget|Nugget]] and [[List of hop varieties#Target|Target]] hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The beer contains about a third more hops, and nearly double the amount of roasted barley than Guinness Draught.&lt;ref name=cheang&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheang|first=Michael|title=Made of more|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Viewpoints/Tipsy-Turvy/Profile/Articles/2013/12/08/Made-of-more.aspx|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=The Star (Malaysia)|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guinyout"&gt;{{cite web |title=Guinness Foreign Extra Stout |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgxWruF-4hw |website=Youtube |publisher=Guinness |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beer is [[force carbonation|force carbonated]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt; The beer has 47 Bitterness Units.&lt;ref name=cheang/&gt;

Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, hopped [[wort]] extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, is used for overseas production of the stout.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of barley.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; Guinness Flavour Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2007/06/15/foreign-extra-stout-three-different-ways/|title=FES three different ways|date=15 June 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, [[Waterford]], but in 2013 production returned to St James's.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

FES is produced at Diageo owned breweries in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Seychelles, Malaysia and Jamaica.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Diageo Annual Report 2013, 29-75&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is produced under licence in 39 other countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theshout.com.au/2013/06/07/article/Lion-brewed-Guinness-gets-quality-nod/BBJVEKCTXI.html|title=Home - The Shout|website=The Shout}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diageo has brewing arrangements with the [[Castel Group]] to license brew and distribute Guinness in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Guinea.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

FES is the oldest variant of Guinness that is still available, although its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an [[original gravity]] (OG) of 1082.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; After a peak in strength in 1840, when the beer had an OG of 1098, by 1860, the beer was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; FES was originally brewed with pale and [[brown malt]]s.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; [[Black malt]] was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; In 1883, the beer was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent [[amber malt]] and 5 per cent roasted malt.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zythophile.wordpress.com/2007/11/06/bristol-fashion-guinness-and-the-roast-barley-question/|title=Bristol-fashion Guinness and the roast barley question|date=6 November 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amber malt continued to be added to the [[grist]] until 1940.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; [[Flaked barley]] was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

Originally a [[bottle conditioned]] beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; Since 1950, in an attempt to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, the beer has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high [[lactic acid]] content.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; Finally, the beer is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=21 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Markets==
[[File:Guinness Foreign Extra.jpg|upright|thumb|A bottle of Guinness Foreign Extra Stout]]

Foreign Extra Stout constitutes 45 per cent of total Guinness sales globally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Originally exported to British and Irish expatriates, from the 1920s the beer began to be drank by local populations. A 7.5% ABV version is sold throughout most of the world, although lower strength variants are found in some locations.

The beer is available in bottles and cans.&lt;ref name=cheang/&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, the product retails at a premium price, with an up to 100 per  cent higher cost than rival beers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;&lt;ref name="WennerJackson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence A.

FES was initially introduced into the Nigerian market through importation in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diageo.com/en-row/ourbrands/categories/Pages/Beers.aspx#guinnessforeign|title=Brand explorer|website=Diageo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guinness in Nigeria is made from locally sourced [[sorghum]] or [[maize]] that has been heavily roasted.&lt;ref name=nigeriamake&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Make Our Brands |url=http://www.guinness-nigeria.com/Brand/Brand.aspx?pageid=47 |publisher=Guinness Nigeria |accessdate=18 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105200759/http://www.guinness-nigeria.com/Brand/Brand.aspx?pageid=47 |archivedate=5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Nigerian versions also contain wheat. The switch from malted barley was made in 1986 when the Nigerian government briefly banned imports of the grain.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The use of sorghum and maize continues as it is a cheaper alternative than barley, which has to be imported, and it is less vulnerable to local currency fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;Dewhurst, Martin ''An interview with Nick Blazquez, President, Africa, Diageo'' (McKinsey: London, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian breweries use high gravity brewing techniques to ferment sorghum and pale malt to 1090 OG.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; Beer writer [[Roger Protz]] describes the Nigerian product as "strikingly different" from the Irish brewed version.&lt;ref name=protznigeria&gt;{{cite news|last=Protz|first=Roger|title=Nigerian Guinness in Tesco|url=http://www.beer-pages.com/2009/12/nigerian-guinness-in-tesco.html|accessdate=18 November 2013|newspaper=beer-pages.com|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brewing of FES has taken place at [[Sierra Leone Brewery Limited]] since October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slbrewery.com/history-of-slbl/good-times-1964-to-1974 | title=Good times 1964 to 1974 | accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ghana, FES is brewed in [[Kumasi]] by [[Guinness Ghana Breweries]], which is 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE is mixed with a locally brewed sorghum lager, but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it contains no wheat and has a higher proportion of roast barley. In Ghana, the product is believed to have medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.&lt;ref name="WolputteFumanti2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven van Wolputte|author2=Mattia Fumanti|title=Beer in Africa: Drinking Spaces, States and Selves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jqRkS-3fRQC&amp;pg=PA51|year=2010|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-1257-7|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a 5.5% ABV, lightly-[[nitrogen]]ated variant of FES was introduced in Ghana called Guinness Extra Smooth.&lt;ref name=bottle /&gt; It was released in Nigeria in 2005, where it constitutes 5-10 per cent of Guinness sales in the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">The '''illegal drug trade in Panama''' includes trans-shipment of [[cocaine]] to the United States. The 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama]] to topple Dictator [[Manuel Noriega]] was justified in part by the need to combat [[drug trafficking]]. Noriega, the dictator of [[Panama]] from 1983 to 1989, had a relationship with the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) from the 1950s. More recently, Mexican cartels such as [[Sinaloa]] have been active in Panama.&lt;ref name=stratfor&gt;"The Sinaloa cartel, which STRATFOR believes is the most capable Mexican trafficker of cocaine, has been detected operating a fairly extensive overland smuggling route from Panama to El Salvador." - Stratfor, 26 March 2009, [http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20090326_central_america_emerging_role_drug_trade Central America: An Emerging Role in the Drug Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuel Noriega==
{{main|Manuel Noriega}}

Although the relationship did not become contractual until 1967, Noriega worked with the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) from the late 1950s until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Key dates for ex-Panama dictator Manuel Noriega |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hms3CjNLe-a1Y-XsKUmUjnc22tCQD9FBCHN80 |agency=Associated Press |date=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430054945/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hms3CjNLe-a1Y-XsKUmUjnc22tCQD9FBCHN80 |archivedate=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] indicted him on federal drug charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dea.gov/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |title=1985–1990 |work=DEA History Book |publisher=Drug Enforcement Administration |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rH5xvq3Y?url=http://www.justice.gov/dea/pubs/history/1985-1990.html |archivedate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/06/world/noriega-indicted-by-us-for-links-to-illegal-drugs.html?pagewanted=1 |work=The New York Times |title=Noriega Indicted By U.S. For Links To Illegal Drugs |first=Philip |last=Shenon |date=February 6, 1988 |accessdate=July 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rH6770ys?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/06/world/noriega-indicted-by-us-for-links-to-illegal-drugs.html?pagewanted=1 |archivedate=July 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1988 Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations concluded that "The saga of Panama's General Manuel Antonio Noriega represents one of the most serious foreign policy failures for the United States. Throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, Noriega was able to manipulate U.S. policy toward his country, while skillfully accumulating near-absolute power in Panama. It is clear that each U.S. government agency which had a relationship with Noriega turned a blind eye to his corruption and drug dealing, even as he was emerging as a key player on behalf of the [[Medellín Cartel]] (a member of which was notorious Colombian drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]])." Noriega was allowed to establish "the hemisphere's first '[[Kleptocracy|narcokleptocracy]]'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB113/north06.pdf |title=Drugs, Law Enforcement and Foreign Policy |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |date=December 1988 |page=3 |format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the large financial institutions that he was able to use to launder money was the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) which was shut down at the end of the Cold War by the FBI.  Noriega shared his cell with ex-BCCI executives in the facility that is known as "Club Med".

As a result of the 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] by the United States, [[Manuel Noriega]] was removed from power, captured, detained as a [[prisoner of war]], and flown to the United States. Noriega was [[Trial|tried]] on eight counts of [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]], [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], and [[money laundering]] in April 1992.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31087">'''Implicit self-esteem''' refers to a person's disposition to evaluate themselves in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. It contrasts with ''explicit self-esteem'', which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit and implicit self-esteem are constituents of [[self-esteem]].

==Overview==
Implicit self-esteem has been specifically defined as "the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) effect of the self-attitude on evaluation of self-associated and self-dissociated objects".&lt;ref name="social cognition"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Banaji | first2 = M. R. | year = 1995 | title = Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, selfesteem, and stereotypes | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = | pages = 4–27 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 | pmid=7878162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because by definition implicit self-esteem may not be accessible to conscious introspection, measures of implicit do not rely on direct self-reports, but rather infer the valence of associations with the self through other means.

The vast majority of implicit self-esteem measures suggest that an individual's self-evaluation spills over to self-related objects. Also, these measures reveal that people, on average, have positive self-evaluations. The overestimation of one's traits and abilities is argued to be a spillover of positive affect from the self to objects associated with the self.&lt;ref&gt;Farnham, D. S., Greenwald, G. A., &amp; Banaji, M. N. (1999) Implicit self-esteem. In D. Abrams &amp; M. Hogg(Eds.), Social identity and social cognition (pp. 230-248). Oxford, UK: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This "spillover" is automatic and unconscious. Implicit self-esteem therefore offers an explanation of positivity bias for things related to the self. [[Association (psychology)|Associations]] are especially important; implicit self-esteem is made up of a series of associations between the [[Self (psychology)|self]] and a positive or negative evaluation of the self. This is especially shown in measures of the [[Implicit Association Test]].

==Influencing factors==
Several researchers have suggested that levels of implicit self-esteem can be affected by [[evaluative conditioning]], through pairing of construct of the self with positive or negative stimuli, with the objective of altering attitude towards the self.&lt;ref name="likes and dislikes"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Houwer | first1 = J. | last2 = Thomas | first2 = S. | last3 = Baeyens | first3 = F. | year = 2001 | title = Associative learning of likes and dislikes: A review of 25 years of research on human evaluative conditioning | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 853–869 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.6.853}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="increasing implicit self-esteem"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baccus | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = M.W. | last3 = Packer | first3 = D.J. | year = 2004 | title = Increasing implicit self-esteem through classical conditioning | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 498–502 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00708.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, social comparison, or more specifically the performance of people in one’s close social circle, can also affect implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Nicholls, E. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholls | first1 = E. | last2 = Stukas | first2 = A.A. | year = 2011 | title = Narcissism and the self-evaluation maintenance model: Effects of social comparison threats on relationship closeness | url = | journal = The journal of social psychology | volume = 151 | issue = | pages = 201–212 | doi=10.1080/00224540903510852}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information suggests that expectancies of social inclusion is a factor in self-evaluation.

===Evaluative conditioning===
The influence of evaluative conditioning on implicit self-esteem is analogous to the principles of classical conditioning on behavioral responses. Although the latter involves pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus repeatedly until presence of the neutral stimulus evokes the consequence of the unconditioned stimulus, evaluative conditioning involves pairing positive and negative stimulus with an internal construct- the self- to manipulate levels of implicit self-esteem.

The effectiveness of evaluative conditioning hinges on the understanding that implicit self-esteem is interpersonally associative in nature, and that there is a causal relationship between the self and positive/negative social feedback. Studies have shown that participants repeatedly exposed to pairings of self-relevant information with smiling faces showed enhanced implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="increasing implicit self-esteem" /&gt;

In addition, studies have also found that pairing the word ‘I’ with positive traits heightens implicit self-esteem regardless of the level of temporal self-esteem prior to the conditioning process. Subliminal presentation of the stimuli reflected that implicit self-esteem is altered in the absence of consciousness. Given that evaluative conditioning changes attitude at a fundamental level and the evaluation that is automatically activated on encountering the attitude object, implicit self-esteem could be assessed as attitude towards the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = AP. | year = 2004 | title = I like myself but I don't know why: enhancing implicit self-esteem by subliminal evaluative conditioning | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 86 | issue = | pages = 345–355 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.2.345 | pmid=14769089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social comparison===
The [[self-evaluation maintenance theory]] (SEM)  suggests that the success of one's partner or "[[significant other]]" in areas that are self-relevant can cause people to feel threatened, allowing comparison of one’s self to the self of another, impacting self-evaluation. Intimacy of relationships predicts likelihood of upward social comparison, which inevitably leads to lower implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Nicholls, E. 2011"/&gt;

Given that the SEM is moderated by intimacy of relationship, its impact can be a prominent influential factor between romantic partners. Evidence shows that men tend to have lowered implicit self-esteem when their romantic partner succeeded than when they failed, automatically interpreting their romantic partner's success as their own failure. The underlying explanation might be that self-evaluation is driven by one's expectations around fulfillment of one's role as a man. Another explanation in line with the interpersonal nature of self-evaluation stems from the belief that women are attracted to men’s success. Hence, the perception of failure in a man could trigger his fear associated with acceptance from his significant other, as well as abandonment issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratliff | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Oishi | first2 = S. | year = 2013 | title = Gender difference in implicit self-esteem following a romantic partner's success or failures | doi = 10.1037/a0033769| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 105 | issue = | pages = 688–702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, studies of social comparison on implicit self-esteem has yielded the conclusion that comparisons with other individuals can impact one's self-esteem. In addition, these effects are greater when there is a close psychological identification with the partner with whom one is being compared.

An individual's level of implicit self-esteem affects him or her in various crucial domains that are relevant to social, emotional, and cognitive well-being. In some cases, discrepancies between the implicit and explicit self-esteem effects affective well-being and are highly associated with clinical symptoms. Implicit self-esteem also determines how individuals approach relational conflicts and social settings. While low levels of implicit self-esteem can be erroneous, boosts in implicit self-esteem through mechanisms involved in narcissism can also impair an individual's performance in cognitive tasks and external representation of competence in occupational settings.

===Discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem===
When explicit self-esteem is lower, it is called ''damaged self-esteem.''  When the implicit self-esteem is lower it is called ''defensive self-esteem.''

It has been found that individuals who tend to have a higher correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem, trust their intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jordan | first1 = Christian H. | last2 = Whitfield | first2 = Mervyn | last3 = Zeigler-Hill | first3 = Virgil | year = 2007 | title = Intuition and the correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 93 | issue = 6| pages = 1067–1079 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.93.6.1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Damaged self-esteem====
Individuals with a combination of high implicit and low explicit self-esteem possess what psychologists call a ''damaged self-esteem''.

Study results indicate that, in comparison to individuals with low implicit and low explicit self-esteem, individuals with damaged self-esteem exhibit more optimism and less self-protection&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Spencer, Christian H. Jordan, Christine E.R. Logel, Mark P. Zanna: ''Nagging doubts and a glimmer of hope. The role of implicit self-esteem in self-image maintenance''. 2005. As cited by: {{cite journal | last1 = Zeigler-Hill | first1 = Virgil | last2 = Terry | first2 = Carol | year = 2007 | title = Perfectionism and explicit self-esteem: The moderating role of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118850 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as higher levels of both maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeigler-Hill | first1 = Virgil | last2 = Terry | first2 = Carol | year = 2007 | title = Perfectionism and explicit self-esteem: The moderating role of implicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate with many clinical symptoms and disorders. In particular, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem in the direction of a damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate positively with heightened symptoms of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creemers | first1 = D.H.M. | last2 = Scholte | first2 = R.H.J. | last3 = Engels | first3 = R.C.M.E | last4 = Prinstein | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Wiers | first5 = R.W. | year = 2012 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem as concurrent predictors of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and loneliness | url = | journal = Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 638–646 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While implicit self-esteem itself is not correlated with these internalizing symptoms, the interaction between implicit and explicit self-esteem does. In particular, when individuals display low explicit self-esteem, their level of implicit self-esteem becomes directly and positively correlated with their level of suicidal ideation. This reflects the crucial role of implicit self-esteem in internalizing problems. We can understand the impact of a damaged self-esteem as an entrapment between goals, which stem from implicit self-esteem, and reality, which mediates explicit self-esteem. Indeed, damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate with a maladaptive pattern of perfectionism, which is hinged upon rigidly high expectations that often contribute to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creemers | first1 = D.H.M. | last2 = Scholte | first2 = R.H.J. | last3 = Engels | first3 = R.C.M.E | last4 = Prinstein | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Wiers | first5 = R.W. | year = 2012 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem as concurrent predictors of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and loneliness | url = | journal = Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 638–646 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of damaged self-esteem also showed a relationship to the use of self-defeating humor as a coping strategy, however, the causal direction is unclear. It could be that the frequent use of self-defeating humor lead to the development of damaged self-esteem (e.g., through a downward spiral of social rejection), or, that people with damaged self-esteem are more likely to use self-defeating humor (i.e., in line with their uncomplimentary view of the self). Another alternative is that both self-defeating humor and damaged self-esteem are caused by a third variable, such as neuroticism or [[alexithymia]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate positively with internet addiction, the underlying mechanism of which parallels that of clinical conditions such as bulimia nervosa. This occurrence of compulsions may be attributed to an automatic defense mechanism in which the individual avoids anxiety. However, the development of a damaged self-esteem as an avoidance mechanism can also precipitate difficulties in establishing a consistent self-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stieger | first1 = S. | last2 = Burger | first2 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Implicit and explicit self-esteem in the context of internet addiction | url = | journal = Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 681–687 | doi=10.1089/cyber.2009.0426 | pmid=21142993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Defensive self-esteem====
Conversely, individuals with a combination of low implicit and high explicit self-esteem have what is called ''defensive self-esteem'' (or synonymously ''fragile self-esteem''). In a comparative study it was found that individuals with defensive self-esteem tended to be less forgiving than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eaton | first1 = Judy | last2 = Struthers | first2 = C. Ward | last3 = Shomrony | first3 = Anat | last4 = Santelli | first4 = Alexander G. | year = 2007 | title = When apologies fail: The moderating effect of implicit and explicit self-esteem on apology and forgiveness | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 2–3 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601118819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit self-esteem correlates===

====Social performance====
An important indicator of relationship stability and health is conflict behavior, the way individuals behave during a conflict. Peterson and DeHart found that implicit self-esteem can regulate connection during times of relationship crises. Studies suggest that individuals with high implicit self-esteem tend to engage more in nonverbal positive behaviors during conflict when they perceive their partners to be committed. Positive nonverbal behaviors during conflict is extremely predictive of relationship outcomes such as commitment, satisfaction and stability. Also, implicit self-esteem also predicts sensitivity towards partners’ availability or support, even within a relationship-threat. That is, individuals high in implicit self-esteem tend to be implicitly motivated to consciously correct for connection and sensitivity to their partners’ effort, despite explicitly doubting their investment in the relationship. This ability to overcome relationship-threats as perpetuated by high levels of implicit self-esteem is crucial to relational well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peterson | first1 = J.L. | last2 = DeHart | first2 = T. | year = 2013 | title = Regulating connection: implicit self-esteem predicts positive non-verbal behavior during romantic relationship-threat | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 99–105 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, low implicit self-esteem has also been found to precipitate uncertainty in self-concept. This instability in grasping the self is especially erroneous in regulation of behaviors in social situations. It has been shown that uncertainty about the self makes people vulnerable to holding and expressing minority opinions, especially those who are susceptible to self-threat (low self-esteem). Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to respond defensively to self-threats, and because minority opinions are more self-diagnostic than majority ones, individuals may hold these opinions to shield themselves from threat of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rios | first1 = K. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = S.C. | last3 = Miller | first3 = D.T. | year = 2012 | title = Compensatory and nonconformity: Self-uncertainty and low implicit self-esteem increase adoption and expression of minority opinions | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1300–1309 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tend to take extreme views and to over-estimate the social consensus for their views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGregor | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jordan | first2 = Christian H. | year = 2007 | title = The mask of zeal: Low implicit self-esteem, threat, and defensive extremism | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 6 | issue = 2–3| pages = 223–237 | doi = 10.1080/15298860601115351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender role====
Gender differences play a vital role in implicit self-esteem in how it is influenced by the performance of the significant other.

Also, women are more prone to trust their feelings and intuition, in contrast to men.  The correlation between explicit and implicit self-esteem is greater for women then for men. Implicit self-esteem contains instinctive and empirical factors; then people who are in touch with their feelings, would report to have higher explicit self-esteem scores, which are consistent to implicit self-esteem scores. There were six studies that supported this idea, and these results were held in three diverse cultures, two unlike measures of implicit self-esteem.{{clarify|date=July 2014}} These ideas showed the correlation between implicit and explicit self-esteem. This is higher for women than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelham | first1 = Brett W. | last2 = Koole | first2 = Sander L. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = Curtis D. | last4 = Hetts | first4 = John J. | last5 = Seah | first5 = Eileen | last6 = DeHart | first6 = Tracy | year = 2005 | title = Gender moderates the relation between implicit and explicit self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 84–89 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive performance====
Self-affirming activities that significantly raises implicit self-esteem, such as viewing one’s own Facebook profile page, has been shown to decrease motivation to do well in cognitive tasks of moderate difficulty. Results like this suggest that a peak in unconscious positivity associated with the self may discount an individual’s efforts to further prove his worth in other areas. Consequently, this leaves an individual unmotivated to perform well in more practical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toma | first1 = C. L. | year = 2013 | title = Feeling better but doing worse: effects of Facebook self-presentation on implicit self-esteem and cognitive task performance | url = | journal = Media psychology | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 199–220 | doi=10.1080/15213269.2012.762189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement and assessment==
Implicit self-esteem is assessed using indirect measures of cognitive processing. These include the [[Name letter effect|Name Letter Task]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sander L. |last1=Koole |first2=Brett W. |last2=Pelham |chapter=On the Nature of Implicit Self-Esteem: The Case of the Name Letter Effect |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJIKwXPZKg0C&amp;pg=PA93 |editors=Steven Spencer, [[Steven Fein]], Mark P. Zanna and James M. Olson |title=Motivated social perception |publisher=[[Lawrence Erlbaum]] |location=[[Mahwah, New Jersey]] |year=2003 |pages=93–116 |isbn=0-8058-4036-2 |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Implicit Association Test]].&lt;ref name="association test"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Anthony G. |last1=Greenwald |first2=Shelly D. |last2=Farnham |title=Using the implicit association test to measure self-esteem and self-concept |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=1022–38 |date=December 2000 |pmid=11138752 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.1022 |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/pdf/Gwald_Farnham_JPSP_2000.OCR.pdf |accessdate=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of, or control of, the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, they feature stimuli designed to represent the [[self (psychology)|self]], such as personal pronouns (e.g., "I") or letters in one's name.

===Name-letter effect===
{{Main article|Name-letter effect}} 
The so-called Name Letter Task (NLT, also called Initial Preference Task, IPT) relies on the name-letter effect and is one of the widest used measures of implicit self-esteem. Different measures have been proposed in order to improve the psychometrical properties of the name letter task.&lt;ref&gt;

The name-letter effect represents the idea that an individual prefers the letters belonging to their own name and will select these above other letters in choice tasks or rate them as more favourable or attractive than other letters in rating tasks. It seemingly occurs subconsciously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koole | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | last3 = van Knippenberg | first3 = A. | year = 2001 | title = What's in a name: Implicit self-esteem and the automatic self | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 669–685 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.4.669}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[mere-exposure effect]] ruled out as a possible explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = J. T. | last2 = Pelham | first2 = B. W. | last3 = Mirenberg | first3 = M. C. | last4 = Hetts | first4 = J. J. | year = 2002 | title = Name–letter preferences are not merely mere exposure: Implicit egotism as self-regulation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 170–177 | doi=10.1006/jesp.2001.1497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This effect has been found in a vast range of studies. In one such scenario, participants were given a list of letters, one of which contained letters from their own name and the other of which contained other letters, and asked them to circle the preferred letter. This study found that, even when accounting for all other variables, letters belonging to the participants' own names were preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nuttin | first1 = J. M. | year = 1985 | title = Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: The name letter effect | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 353–361 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420150309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar results have been found in cross-cultural studies, using different alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoorens | first1 = V. | last2 = Nuttin | first2 = J. M. | last3 = Herman | first3 = I. E. | last4 = Pavakanun | first4 = U. | year = 1990 | title = Mastery pleasure versus mere ownership: A quasi-experimental cross-cultural and cross alphabetical test of the name letter effect | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 181–205 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420200302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note the difference between the name-letter effect and 'implicit egotism',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pelham | first1 = B.W. | last2 = Carvallo | first2 = M. | last3 = Jones | first3 = J.T. | year = 2005 | title = Implicit egoism | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 106–110 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being attributed to the way people gravitate towards places, people and situations that reflect themselves, including perhaps similarities with their own name. Indeed, research into the topic has shown similarities between people's names and their future careers; for example, the names Dennis and Denise are overepresented among [[dentists]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelham, B.W., Mirenberg, M.C., &amp; Jones, J.T. (2002) Why Susie Sells Seashells by the Seashore: Implicit Egotism and Major Life Decisions, Attitudes and Social Cognition&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implicit-association test===
{{Main article|Implicit-association test}} 
The implicit-association test is an experimental method used by psychologists to attempt to tap into a person's automatic, or [[subconscious]] association between a concept and an attribute.&lt;ref name="social cognition" /&gt; It has been widely used in an attempt to uncover a person's subconscious prejudices against certain members of society, such as those who are overweight, as well as other implicit stereotypes and associations. The test was formatted in order to measure [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="association test" /&gt; Participants are asked to make rapid responses, co-classifying themselves ("the self") and positive attributes, as well as negative attributes. The speed, or ease of these associations made is said to show a subconscious, or implicit preference for one attribute over another, with regards to the self.

====Findings====
Many studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karpinski | first1 = A | year = 2004 | title = Measuring self-esteem using the implicit association test: The role of the other | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 22–34 | doi=10.1177/0146167203258835}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that the vast majority of people's implicit self-esteem is positively biased. That is, people find it a great deal easier to associate themselves with a positive concept than a negative one. Whether this is truly displaying implicit self-esteem is arguable; the findings may instead be linked with [[illusory superiority]], in that people tend to rate themselves as above average on a number of scales.

'''Implicit self-esteem''' &lt;br&gt;
In the article "Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?",&lt;ref name="Bosson, J. K. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = J. K. | last2 = Swann | first2 = W. R. | last3 = Pennebaker | first3 = J. W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 631–643 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the validity and reliability of seven implicit self-esteem measures have been explored. The implicit measures were not correlated with one another. However they did correlate, but only faintly with measures of explicit self-esteem.  The implicit self-esteem measurements confirmed partial reliabilities in correlation to good test-retest reliabilities.  Nonetheless implicit measures were limited in their ability to calculate standard variables, for the test. Certain evidence explained that measurements of implicit self-esteem are delicate to put in context, which is further argued in later research of implicit self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Bosson, J. K. 2000"/&gt;

====Links with explicit self-esteem====
However, the validity of the implicit-association test and implicit self-esteem as a measure of [[self-esteem]] itself is questionable due to mixed evidence with regards to explicit self-esteem. On the one hand, researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = J.K. | last2 = Swann | first2 = W.B. | last3 = Pennebaker | first3 = J.W. | year = 2000 | title = Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 631–649 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.4.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a detailed and comprehensive study of implicit self-esteem found the IAT to correlate weakly, yet consistently, with measures of explicit self-esteem. However, more recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rudolph | first1 = A. | last2 = Schroder-Abe | first2 = M. | last3 = Schultz | first3 = A. | last4 = Gregg | first4 = A. P. | last5 = Sedikides | first5 = C. | year = 2008 | title = Through a glass, less darkly?

== History ==

The Institute was founded in 1984 by an interdisciplinary group comprising two family physicians, a family nurse practitioner and a behavioral scientist.  Since its inception, the organization has been led by Neil Calman, MD, President and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.institute2000.org/about-us/history/|work=About Us|publisher=The Institute for Family Health|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute began as a small private non-profit that received federal funds to open a Faculty Development Program in Urban Primary Care, which it ran for twenty years. In 1985, it contracted with Bronx-Lebanon Hospital to re-organize its outpatient department into a family practice center, and initiated its first residency training program in family medicine. It worked with Bronx Lebanon until 1999, and jointly developed several small community-based medical practices.

In 1986, the Institute acquired the Sidney Hillman Health Center in Union Square from the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union]] and turned the-multi-specialty practice into a family practice. In 1994, the Institute developed a relationship with Beth Israel Medical Center, and began the [http://www.bifp-residency.org/ Beth Israel Residency in Urban Family Practice],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiller|first=Red|title=Teaching Health Centers: Expansion of Existing Program|url=http://www.medicaleducationfutures.org/sites/default/files/article-internal/THC%20Expansion%20of%20Existing%20Program%20.pdf|publisher=Medical Education Futures|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  opening the Phillips Family Practice to serve as the ambulatory care training site for those residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.institute2000.org/about-us/history/|work=About Us|publisher=The Institute for Family Health|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Simultaneously, the Institute was building and opening a series of small family practice sites. Between 1991 through 1998, the Institute opened the Parkchester Family Practice, Walton Family Health Center, Urban Horizons Family Health Center, East 13th Street Family Practice, and the Mount Hope Family Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.institute2000.org/about-us/history/|work=About Us|publisher=The Institute for Family Health|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, the Institute received an award from the Centers for Disease Control to initiate Bronx Health REACH, a consortium of community and faith based organizations committed to the elimination of racial disparities in health in the South Bronx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bronxhealthreach.org/about-us/|publisher=Bronx Health Reach|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group addresses issues related to nutrition and fitness education; access to healthy foods and safe places to exercise; diabetes maintenance and prevention; school food and exercise programs; and the segregation of health care in academic medical centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calman|first=Neil|title=Making Health Equality A Reality: The Bronx Takes Action|journal=Health Affairs|date=March 2005|volume=24|issue=2|pages=491–498|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/2/491.full|accessdate=2013-12-20|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.2.491}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the Institute was named a Center of Excellence in the Elimination of Disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bronxhealthreach.org/about-us/|publisher=Bronx Health Reach|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2000, the Institute implemented a system-wide [[electronic health record]] and practice management system, [[Epic Systems|Epic]]. The system has altered the way care is delivered by allowing for increased care coordination and preventive care. The EHR also enables research in health processes and outcomes, and has permitted the Institute to participate in a number of federal and state payment initiatives such as Primary Care Medical Homes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patient Centered Medical Home Resource Center|url=http://pcmh.ahrq.gov/|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and achieve Meaningful Use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaningful Use|url=http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/meaningful-use|work=Policymaking, Regulation &amp; Strategy|publisher=HealthIT.gov|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  designation.

In 2006, the Institute assumed responsibility for three practices operated by St. Christopher’s, Inc. As a result, it obtained Article 31 licensure to operate two community mental health programs in the Bronx.  A year later, the Institute acquired six health centers and the [http://www.midhudsonresidency.org/ Mid Hudson Family Practice Residency Program] in the Mid-Hudson Valley, which doubled the organizational budget, the number of staff, and the number of patients served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PCDC Helps The Institute for Family Health Save Primary Care for 43,000 Patients|url=http://www.pcdc.org/news/press-releases/pcdc-helps-the-institute-for.html|work=Press Releases|publisher=Primary Care Development Corporation|accessdate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, when North General Hospital in East Harlem closed, the Institute opened a community health center on the first floor of the former hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartocollis|first=Anna|title=North General Hospital Is Closing, but Clinics Are Ready to Take Its Place|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/nyregion/29hospital.html?_r=0|accessdate=2013-12-20|newspaper=New York Times|date=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, the Institute moved this practice to the newly built Family Health Center of Harlem, two blocks away, which serves as the home of its third residency program, the [http://www.harlemresidency.org/ Harlem Residency in Family Medicine].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Feeney|first=Michael J.|title=$28 million E.

'''Ivane Gomarteli''' ({{lang-ka|ივანე გომართელი}}) (October 2, 1875 – April 19, 1938) was a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] physician, political figure, and author involved in the [[social-democracy|social-democratic]] movement early in the 20th century.

Gomarteli was born in the village of [[Gorisa]] in the western Georgian province of [[Imereti]], then part of the [[Kutais Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]]. After graduating from the Medical Faculty of [[Moscow University]] in 1899, Gomarteli practiced medicine in his homeland. Around the same time he joined the [[Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party]] and later adhered to its [[Menshevik]] wing. He regularly published medical articles, political commentary and literary criticism in the Georgian press and authored prose fiction. In 1906, he was elected to the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|1st State Duma of the Russian Empire]], representing the Kutais Governorate. When the Duma was dissolved, Gomarteli was imprisoned for three months for signing the [[Vyborg Manifesto]]. In 1907, he moved to work in [[Tiflis]]. By 1913, he had distanced himself from the Mensheviks, criticizing their subservience to the Russian Social Democratic Party on the national question and, like the fellow Menshevik journalist [[Vladimir Darchiashvili]], supported the idea of territorial autonomy for Georgia.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;[[Stephen F.

After [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia became independent]] following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], Gomarteli was elected to the [[National Council of Georgia|Georgian National Council]] and then to the [[Constituent Assembly of Georgia]]. After the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Soviet takeover of Georgia]] in 1921, he retired from politics. Most of his work thereafter was as a physician and literary critic.&lt;ref&gt;Wieczynski, Joseph L. (ed., 1976), ''The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet History'', Vol. 13, p. 35. Academic International Press, {{ISBN|0-87569-064-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at the Vake cemetery in Tbilisi.

The '''John Mordaunt Trust''' (JMT) was set up in 1996 to honour the memory of an influential [[AIDS]] activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dango.bham.ac.uk/record_details.asp?id=3995&amp;recordType=ngo|title=John Mordaunt Trust|publisher=Dango|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The John Mordaunt Trust is an [[advocacy]] project set up to campaign for the health and human rights of ex/current injectors affected by [[HIV]] and other [[blood-borne infection]]s (BBIs.)

==Background==
John was deported from China alone as a result of his HIV status in 1986; when he had recovered from this [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], he joined FRONTLINERS, the then People With AIDS Coalition UK,fighting hard for the [[human right]]s of other men, women and children affected by AIDS. Essentially John was a [[harm reduction]] activist, who began to speak out in the media of drugs-use as a human right, or at least that drugs users had the right NOT to be persecuted. As an ex-injection drug user (IDU), he was only too aware of how dangerous [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] could be - risk of [[overdose]] deaths from unknown purity of drugs, fatal blood borne infections from lack of access to clean injecting equipment, imprisonment, not to mention the collateral damage of crimes committed against others in desperate efforts to access illegal drugs day-in-day-out...including violence related to [[Drug dealing|drug-deals]] gone wrong. Harm Reduction strategies are essential within current drug policy, as drugs users cannot and do not know the quality (therefore DOSE) of the drugs they are buying. Harm Reduction initially sprung out of the need to prevent AIDS in society, but has become a lot more. Harm Reduction workers work alongside drug users making sure they use drugs as safely as possible, thus keeping them as well as possible for as long as possible. Harm Reduction accepts that people use drugs and commits to keeping people alive without demanding they stop using. That said, if people want to stop using, a harm reduction worker is obliged to refer to the appropriate service to help them reach that goal. 

The John MOrdaunt Trust keeps its members informed via a news letter called the Users Voice 
===Achievements===
In June 1998, JMT's founder, Andria (John's widow) arranged for the first ex-injector living with HIV+ - Marsha B (RIP) to address the [[UN General Assembly]] [[UN General Assembly#Special sessions|Special Session]] on Drugs about the failures of prohibition. Marsha was joined by Omarya Morales (RIP) a Columbian cocalera, whose home had been burnt to the ground by US-driven [[Coca eradication|coca eradication policies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40441">The following '''list of [[optometry]] schools''' covers many countries, although the list is not exhaustive. Internationally, optometry as a profession includes different levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (2000), Optometry as an international profession, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 8(4),120.&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions listed below provide academic and professional education and clinical training that ranges from Doctor of Optometry degree level to other [[professional degree]]s in optometry and also non-degree level education leading to a diploma or other qualifications in optometry.

In many countries the role of optometry is statutorily defined, practice is regulated and there is uniformity in professional education and clinical training and the scope of practice is consistent with the definition of optometry as a profession. In such countries the nomenclature of terminal qualification may be reviewed as and when necessary. In Australia, for example, Doctor of Optometry (OD) is now established at University of Melbourne (first intake 2011) and OD is described as "an internationally recognised qualification and the gold standard for optometry education."&lt;ref name="unimelb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optometry.unimelb.edu.au/courses/OD.html |title=Doctor of Optometry : Department of Optometry &amp; Vision Sciences : The University of Melbourne |publisher=Optometry.unimelb.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2012-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
At present there are more than fifty schools of optometry in India. In 1958, two schools of optometry were established, one at Gandhi Eye Hospital, Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh and the other at Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh, under the second five-year plan by Director General of Health Services of Government of India. These schools offered diplomas in optometry courses of two years duration validated by state medical faculties. Subsequently, four more schools were opened across India at Sitapur Eye Hospital, Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, Chennai (formerly Madras) in Tamil Nadu, Bengalooru (formerly Bangalore) in Karnataka and Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum) in Kerala.

The Elite School of Optometry (ESO) was established in 1985 at Chennai and was the first to offer a four-year degree course. This was followed by All India institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum), the first government colleges to offer a bachelor's degree in optometry.

The following list includes educational institutions offering four year degree courses, two or three year diploma courses and also non-degree courses. Post-graduate education in optometry is also offered in India leading to M.Optom, M.Phil., M.Sc. and Ph.D. by several universities.

4 Year Bachelors degrees including clinical optometry

==Sri Lanka==
* School of Ophthalmic Technology, established in 1983 by the ministry of health at National Eye Hospital Colombo with the initiation of Dr. C E Parker III., honours the diploma in ophthalmic technology. However, a degree programme does not exist. These ophthalmic technologists are trained for the purpose of government hospitals.

The course is also undergone by other SAARC countries: Nepal, Maldives and Pakistan.

Part-time courses are conducted by private institutes to provide diploma for the private sector, such as the Eye Care Institute and Sri Lanka Optometrist Association.

The government of Sri Lanka does not recognize optometry as a profession and has no regulations to date.

The following is a '''list of smoking bans in the United States'''. For smoking bans and restrictions outside the United States, see the worldwide [[list of smoking bans]].

The [[United States Congress]] has not attempted to enact any type of nationwide [[law of the United States|federal]] smoking ban. Therefore, smoking bans in the United States are entirely a product of [[Political divisions of the United States|first-level jurisdictional]], [[local government in the United States|local]] [[criminal law|criminal]], and [[occupational safety and health]] laws.

In 1995, [[California]] was the first state to enact a statewide smoking ban; throughout the early to mid-2000s, especially between 2004 and 2007, an increasing number of states enacted a statewide smoking ban of some kind. As of July 2018, the most recent statewide smoking ban is [[Alaska]]'s, which was signed into law on July 18, 2018, and went into effect on October 1, 2018.

As further detailed in this list, smoking laws vary widely throughout the United States. Some places in the United States do not generally regulate smoking at all, some ban smoking in certain areas and not others, and some ban smoking nearly everywhere, even in outdoor areas (no state bans smoking in all public outdoor areas, but some local jurisdictions do). As of July 1, 2017, according to the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation, 81.5% of the U.S. population lives under a ban on smoking in "workplaces, and/or restaurants, and/or bars, by either a state, commonwealth, or local law",&lt;ref name=nosmoke.org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/mediaordlist.pdf |title=Overview List&amp;nbsp;– How many Smokefree Laws?, Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, January 2, 2014 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 58.6% live under a ban covering all workplaces ''and'' restaurants ''and'' bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.no-smoke.org/pdf/SummaryUSPopList.pdf |title=Summary of 100% Smokefree State Laws and Population Protected by 100% U.S. Smokefree Laws, Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, 1&amp;nbsp;January 2, 2014 |format=PDF |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smoking ban (either state or local) has been enacted covering ''all'' bars and restaurants in each of the 60 [[List of United States cities by population|most populated cities in the United States]] ''except'' these 11: [[Atlanta]], [[Jacksonville]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Miami]], [[Las Vegas]], [[Nashville]], [[Oklahoma City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Tampa]], [[Tulsa]], and [[Virginia Beach]].

==Overview==

===Statewide bans on smoking in all enclosed public places===
As of July 2018, 26 states have enacted statewide bans on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including all bars and restaurants: [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota]], [[Utah]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]]. Twelve other states have enacted statewide smoking bans but have carved out an exception for certain establishments and workplaces: [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Tennessee]].

However, these states exempt a variety of places from their respective smoking bans. All except seven (California, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Washington) exempt [[tobacconist]]s. All except six (Alaska, Michigan, Indiana, North Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin) allow hotels and motels to designate a certain percentage of smoking rooms. Many also exempt or do not cover [[casino]]s (10), [[private club]]s (8), [[cigar bar]]s (14), or certain small workplaces (8). The following is a table of common exemptions from these 28 states' smoking bans:
{| class="wikitable"

| CO &amp; TN (3 or fewer employees), CT (5 or fewer employees), ND (1 employee), NM (1 employee), OH (family owned and operated), UT (1 employee), VT (1 employee)
|}

In Connecticut, Oregon, Montana, Utah, and Wisconsin, the state law [[federal preemption|preempts]] local governments from enacting stricter smoking bans than the state, though some cities and/or counties in some of those states have enacted local versions of the state's smoking ban. In the other 23 states with a statewide general smoking ban, some cities and/or counties have enacted stricter local smoking bans to varying degrees. In California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, and Vermont, usage of [[e-cigarettes]] is prohibited indoors. The strictest smoking ban in the United States is in [[Calabasas, California]], where smoking anywhere a non-smoker could congregate, including public sidewalks and apartment complexes, is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of at least $250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taub |first=Daniel |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&amp;sid=apSgkXcQVeXI&amp;refer=us%20 |title=Daniel Taub, "California Town Makes It Tougher to Smoke in Public," Bloomberg.com, March 17, 2006 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=March 17, 2006 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statewide smoking bans exempting adult-only venues===
As of July 2017, six states ban smoking in most enclosed public places, but permit adult venues such as bars (and casinos, if applicable) to allow smoking if they choose: [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Indiana]], [[Louisiana]], [[Iowa]] and [[Nevada]]. In Florida, state law preempts local governments from enacting stricter smoking bans than the state, though in Idaho, Indiana, and Louisiana, some cities and/or counties have enacted stricter local smoking bans to varying degrees, in some cases banning it in all enclosed workplaces. See individual state listings below for details.

===Unique statewide smoking bans===
As of July 2018, 5 states have enacted smoking bans in particular places that do not fit in the other categories:
*[[Alaska]] bans smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including bars and restaurants, but allows smoking in private clubs that were in existence prior to January 1, 2017, and allows for certain localities such as villages to opt out of the law if they feel the need to.     
*[[Idaho]] bans smoking in restaurants, but exempts both bars (which can be 100% smoking) and small workplaces (which can have a designated smoking area); local governments in Idaho can regulate smoking more strictly than the state.
*[[Nevada]] generally bans smoking in all public places and places of employment, but exempts bars, casinos, strip clubs, brothels, and retail tobacco stores, and restaurants that do not allow patrons under 21 years of age. In all other restaurants, smoking is relegated to separately ventilated designated smoking areas. Local governments in Nevada may regulate smoking more strictly than the state.
*[[New Hampshire]] bans smoking in restaurants and some bars (those besides cigar bars and private clubs), schools, and certain common areas open to the public, but not anywhere else, and state law prohibits local governments from enacting local smoking bans.
*[[North Carolina]] bans smoking in all restaurants and bars (excluding cigar bars and private clubs), as well as government buildings and vehicles, but does not regulate smoking anywhere else. Local governments may regulate smoking more strictly than the state, except in cigar bars, private clubs, tobacco shops, private residences/vehicles, designated hotel/motel smoking rooms, and theatrical performances involving smoking.

===States with no statewide smoking ban===
As of July 2018, 12 states have not enacted any general statewide ban on smoking in workplaces and/or bars and/or restaurants: [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]]. Instead, laws in most of these states (see individual state listings below for further information) require proprietors of certain places to designate smoking and non-smoking areas and post [[regulatory sign|warning signage]].

In Oklahoma and Virginia state laws prohibit local governments from regulating smoking more strictly than the state, making those states among the fewest in the nation without any legislated smoking bans. In the other ten states, cities and/or counties have enacted stricter smoking laws than the state, in some cases banning smoking in all enclosed workplaces. In Alabama and Mississippi, the state smoking law expressly allows all local governments to do so. In Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia, a court has ruled that certain local governments have the power to do so. See the individual state listings below for details.

===Smoking laws and non-states===
In the [[District of Columbia]], [[American Samoa]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands]], smoking is banned in all enclosed public places, including bars and restaurants. [[Guam]] prohibits smoking in restaurants, but the ban doesn't extend to workplaces or any other businesses. The [[Northern Mariana Islands]] prohibits smoking in most workplaces and restaurants, but not in bars.

===Smoking laws and the U.S. federal government===
Although Congress has not attempted to enact a general nationwide federal smoking ban in workplaces, several [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] regulations do concern indoor smoking. Effective April 1998, [[inflight smoking]] is banned by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] on all commercial passenger flights in the United States, and/or by American air carriers.&lt;ref&gt;14 C.F.R. Part 252&lt;/ref&gt; This was long after [[Delta Air Lines]] had banned smoking on all of its flights. On August 9, 1997, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] issued {{ExecutiveOrder|13058}}, banning smoking in all interior spaces owned, rented, or leased by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, as well as in any outdoor areas under executive branch control near air intake ducts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinton6.nara.gov/1997/08/1997-08-09-executive-order-13058-on-smoking-in-federal-workplaces.html Executive Order 13058], August 9, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The law exempts (1) a vehicle that is a place of employment when the vehicle is used exclusively by one person, (2) on a vessel when the vessel is engaged in commercial fishing or sport charter fishing, (3) a private club if the private club has been in continuous operation at the same location since January 1, 2017; is not licensed to serve alcoholic beverages; and is not a place of employment, (4) at a private residence, except a private residence described in (b) of 27 section or while a health care provider is present, (5) in a stand-alone shelter if the stand-alone shelter meets the following requirements: food or drink may not be sold or served in the stand-alone shelter; and the stand-alone shelter meets the minimum distance requirements of {{convert|10|ft|m}}, and (6) allows smoking so long as it's not within {{convert|10|ft|m}} of all places where smoking is prohibited. Localities may regulating smoking more stringently than the state, and the bill also allows for certain municipalities such as villages to exempt certain establishments, including bars and restaurants from the bill if they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;https://legiscan.com/AK/text/SB63/2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcenter11.com/content/news/Governor-signs-Senate-Bill-to-ban-indoor-public-smoking-488693241.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arkansas===
*'''No statewide smoking ban.'''

Local jurisdictions may regulate smoking more strictly than the state. Many California communities have established smoke-free registries for private residential [[apartment]] buildings, which range from complexes where smoking is entirely prohibited (whether inside private dwellings or outside) to those where certain sections of dwellings may be designated as smoking dwellings. Most California cities allow landlords to regulate smoking at will.

(a) A landlord of a residential dwelling unit, as defined in Section 1940, or his or her agent, may prohibit the smoking of a cigarette, as defined in Section 104556 of the Health and Safety Code, or other tobacco product on the property or in any building or portion of the building, including any dwelling unit, other interior or exterior area, or the premises on which it is located, in accordance with this article.
(b) (1) Every lease or rental agreement entered into on or after January 1, 2012, for a residential dwelling unit on property on any portion of which the landlord has prohibited the smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products pursuant to this article shall include a provision that specifies the areas on the property where smoking is prohibited, if the lessee has not previously occupied the dwelling unit.
(2) For a lease or rental agreement entered into before January 1, 2012, a prohibition against the smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products in any portion of the property in which smoking was previously permitted shall constitute a change of the terms of tenancy, requiring adequate notice in writing, to be provided in the manner prescribed in Section 827.
(c) A landlord who exercises the authority provided in subdivision (a) to prohibit smoking shall be subject to federal, state, and local requirements governing changes to the terms of a lease or rental agreement for tenants with leases or rental agreements that are in existence at the time that the policy limiting or prohibiting smoking is adopted.
(d) This section shall not be construed to preempt any local ordinance in effect on or before January 1, 2012, or any provision of a local ordinance in effect on or after January 1, 2012, that restricts the smoking of cigarettes or other tobacco products.
(e) A limitation or prohibition of the use of any tobacco product shall not affect any other term or condition of the tenancy, nor shall this section be construed to require statutory authority to establish or enforce any other lawful term or condition of the tenancy.

===Wisconsin===
* '''Statewide smoking ban''': On July 5, 2009, after being signed into law by [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] [[Jim Doyle]] on May 18, 2009, S.B. 181 (2009 Wisconsin Act 12) took effect, banning smoking statewide in all enclosed workplaces in Wisconsin, including all bars, restaurants, lodging establishments, and private clubs, as well as within a "reasonable distance" outdoors from any such place, except in bar/restaurant outdoor patios.&lt;ref name=wiban&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.wi.us/2009/data/SB-181.pdf |title=2009 Wisconsin Senate Bill 181 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act exempts only cigar bars or retail tobacco stores already in existence, private residences, and rooms in nursing homes in which the occupants agree to allow smoking; it does not cover casinos run by American Indian tribes, as those casinos are in the tribes' sovereign territory.&lt;ref name=wiban/&gt; Local governments are [[federal preemption|preempted]] from regulating smoking more strictly than the Act.&lt;ref name=wiban/&gt; Prior to this law taking effect, several localities in Wisconsin had local smoking bans in effect.

== Smoking related damages in the United States ==

=== Slow Decomposition of Cigarettes ===
In the United States alone there over 176,000,000 pounds of discarded cigarette butts per year. Research has shown that cigarettes pose an extremely large threat to the environment and our wildlife. Cigarettes contain small amounts of plastic that cannot naturally decompose. A study published in 2015 showed that after two years only 38% of a cigarette butt decomposes. In addition to cigarette butt's long composition time, the chemicals found within cigarette filters can remain in the soil for up to 10 years. The problem created by cigarettes affects natural resources across the United States and poses a serious threat to the diverse wildlife population within it.

=== Forest Fires and Property Damage from Cigarettes ===
In addition to the pollution from cigarettes, the National Fire Protection Agency has concluded that smoking materials like cigarettes, pipes, and cigars, directly cause 90,000 fires per year in the United States.  These smoking related fires cause over 27 billion dollars per year.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}
In the late 1800s, Loma Linda began as a development of tourist halls called Mound City, as encouraged by railroad companies. In the early 1800s, shops and cottages were built, but the project would later fail. During the late 1890s,  a group of businessmen and physicians from Los Angeles bought the hotel and reopened it as a convalescent home and health resort. They called it Loma Linda, meaning “Beautiful Hill” in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomalinda-ca.gov/our_city/about_us |title=City of Loma Linda ~ Our City: About Us |website=Lomalinda-ca.gov |date=1910-09-23 |accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was [[Municipal corporation#United States|incorporated]] in 1970.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1969, [[San Timoteo Creek]] overflowed its banks, inundating two-thirds of Loma Linda. Many of the bridges over the creek washed away, and [[Loma Linda Academy]] was completely flooded.&lt;ref name=Tyler1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/general-news/20120202/recent-rains-bring-of-flood-of-memories |title=Recent rains bring of flood of memories |website=Redlandsdailyfacts.com |date=1992-02-23 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ford1&gt;[http://docs.adventistarchives.org/docs/PUR/PUR19690313-V68-36__B.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tenorio1&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://patch.com/california/redlands/quakes-not-the-only-concern-locals-face-says-seismologist |title=Quakes Not the Only Concern Locals Face, Says Seismologist - Redlands, CA Patch |website=Patch.com |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the creek again flooded parts of Loma Linda.&lt;ref name="Tenorio1" /&gt;

Loma Linda is twinned with [[Manipal]], India, and [[Libertador San Martin]], Argentina, as its sister cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomalinda-ca.gov/asp/Site/OurCity/SisterCities/|title=Sister Cities|publisher=lomalinda-ca.gov|work=The City of Loma Linda, California|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Loma Linda is located in southwestern San Bernardino County and is considered part of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]. It is bordered on the north by [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], on the east by [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], on the west by [[Colton, California|Colton]], and on the south by [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]]. An area of [[unincorporated area|unincorporated territory]] in Riverside County separates Loma Linda from the city of [[Moreno Valley, California|Moreno Valley]] to the south. The remnants of [[Bryn Mawr, California|Bryn Mawr]], an [[unincorporated community]] formerly located between Loma Linda and Redlands, was annexed by the City in 2008.

The city is in the southern [[San Bernardino Valley]]. The southern third of the city is known as the South Hills; this rugged and hilly area at the northwestern end of [[The Badlands (California)|The Badlands]] is a city-owned [[open space reserve]] protected by a local [[initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomalinda-ca.gov/PDFs/General%20Plan/May%2009/Chapter%209%20-%20Conservation%20&amp;%20Open%20Space%20Element.pdf |format=PDF |title=Loma Linda General Plan : Conservation and Open Space Element |website=Lomalinda-ca.gov |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Timoteo Creek]] flows from southeast to northwest through the city.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|7.5|sqmi|km2|sp=us}}, 99.99% of it land.

===Water contamination and air pollution===
Ground water near Loma Linda is contaminated by a plume of the chemical [[perchlorate]] which was used in the manufacture of [[solid rocket]] fuel. Also, this chemical was formerly (decades ago and in very small amounts) prescribed by physicians to control the overactive thyroid glands of certain patients. Attempts to quantify the effects of low-level exposure to perchlorate have met with resistance from environmental (and other) activists. A nearby plant operated by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aerospace]] has been implicated in the  improper disposal of the rocket fuel ingredient, which leached into the [[ground water]] northeast of Loma Linda. Loma Linda's municipal water supply, nevertheless, has been unaffected by the plume, primarily because Lockheed Martin installed a $19 million treatment plant in 2010 to remove both perchlorate and trichloroethylene from water after pumping it from the aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/pha/PHA.asp?docid=51&amp;pg=1 |title=ATSDR - Public Health Assessments &amp; Health Consultations - California |website=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seventh-day Adventism==
{{Expand section|Controversy over opening of McDonald's fast-food restaurant in the city|date=February 2016}}
[[File:Loma linda university church front.jpg|thumb|Loma Linda University Church.]]
Loma Linda "is home to one of the largest concentrations of [[Seventh-day Adventists]] in the world."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The [[Loma Linda University Church of Seventh-day Adventists]], on the LLU campus, has one of the largest Adventist congregations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://llu.edu/religious/univchurch.html |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211185715/http://www.llu.edu/religious/univchurch.html|title=Loma Linda University Church of Seventh-day Adventists |archivedate=December 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wallawalla.edu/westwind/archives/summer04/summer04other/feature1a.html|title=Welcome to Westwind Online|work=wallawalla.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612114540/http://www.wallawalla.edu/westwind/archives/summer04/summer04other/feature1a.html|archivedate=June 12, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large number of Loma Linda residents who are Seventh-day Adventists, the city was one of the few which had weekend mail delivery service on Sunday instead of Saturday.&lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/DeliveryMondaythroughSaturday.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711013516/http://www.usps.com/postalhistory/_pdf/DeliveryMondaythroughSaturday.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this distinction ended on April 23, 2011, when Saturday delivery resumed as part of a Post Office cost-cutting effort.

Since a popular practice of Seventh-day Adventists is [[vegetarianism]], most restaurants in Loma Linda, including local fast-food franchises, feature a vegetarian menu in addition to regular menu items.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The Loma Linda [[Baker's Drive-Thru]] was the first in that fast-food chain to feature the "Loma Linda Kitchen" vegetarian menu.&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{cite news |title=In Loma Linda, a Seventh Day Adventist culture prevails |first=Courtney |last=Perkes |newspaper=The Press-Enterprise |date=December 6, 1997 |url=http://www.texnews.com/religion97/sev120697.html |accessdate=January 29, 2010 |location=Riverside, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chain has since dropped the Loma Linda name for the menu and expanded its vegetarian choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bakersdrivethru.com/vegetarian/vegitems.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204040417/http://www.bakersdrivethru.com/vegetarian/vegitems.htm |archivedate=December 4, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longevity ===
Adventists in Loma Linda have one of the highest rates of [[longevity]] in the country.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30351406|title=Loma Linda: The secret to a long healthy life?|last=Bowes|first=Peter|date=2014-12-08|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Dan Buettner]] has labeled Loma Linda as a [[Blue Zone]], an area where the longevity is appreciably higher than the national average and a substantial proportion of the population lives past 100 years. Buettner's book, ''The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest,'' attributes Loma Linda's longevity rate to [[Seventh-day Adventist Church#Health and diet|Adventist cultural health and diet practices]].

Located at 3826 Main Street in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, USA, it is the only "brick-and-mortar" museum in the United States dedicated exclusively to preserving the history of people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people-inc.org/news/2012/links-2012-08-29-553/brochureboyscouts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The museum seeks to promote a higher level of societal awareness and understanding, and a change in attitudes, perceptions and actions that will result in people with disabilities having the greatest possible participation in their communities.

== History of the museum ==
[[People Inc.]] first organized the idea for the Museum of disABILITY History in 1998 after James Boles, Ed.D President and CEO of People Inc. discovered there was no museum or single education resource to send students to learn about the history of people with disabilities.  In 2003 the Museum received its Provisional Charter from the New York State Department of Education Board of Regents and continues to be a project of People Inc. The Museum moved to its current location in late 2010, and received its Permanent Charter from the New York State Board of Regents in January 2011.

== Collections ==
The Museum’s exhibits, collections, archives and educational programs create awareness and a platform for dialogue and discovery.  Photographs, rare books, historic artifacts utilized by people with disabilities,these records have helped shaped the lives of these individuals with disabilities, and many primary sources and archival materials, the earliest dating to 1750 are all part of the rapidly growing collection.  Included in the Museum’s collection is a 1963 Greaves [[Thundersley Invacar]].  Few Invacars exist today in Europe and the only known Invacar in North America is at the Museum of disABILITY History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualgaz.com/invacarpage.htm invacar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mydicar''' is a genetically targeted [[enzyme replacement therapy]] being studied for use in patients with severe [[heart failure]]. It is designed to increase the level of SERCA2a, a sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ATPase found in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The SERCA2a gene is delivered to the heart via an adeno-associated viral vector.&lt;ref name=Jaski&gt;Jaski BE, Jessup ML, Mancini DM, Cappola TP, Pauly DF, Greenberg B, et al. (2010). "Calcium Upregulation by Percutaneous administration of gene therapy In cardiac Disease (CUPID Trial), a first-in-human phase 1/2 clinical trial". ''Journal of Cardiac Failure''. 15(3):171-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter in the cardiac muscle cells, also called cardiomyocytes, Mydicar is able to direct the gene expression only to the heart muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Baker DL, Hashimoto K, Grupp IL, Ji Y, Reed T, Loukianov E, et al. (1998). "Targeted overexpression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase increases cardiac contractility in transgenic mouse hearts". ''Circulation Research''. 83:1205–1214.&lt;/ref&gt; Mydicar is being tested in a phase 2 study, in which has been compared to a placebo in 39 advanced heart failure patients.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;Greenberg B, Jessup ML, Zsebo KM, Yaroshinsky A and Hajjar RJ. (2010). "CUPID 1: MYDICAR in patients with advanced heart failure continue to demonstrate improvement in clinical outcomes compared to optimal therapy 9 months post-dose". ''Journal of Cardiac Failure''. 16(11): 911.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far, patients treated with Mydicar have shown a 52% reduction in the risk of worsening heart failure compared to patients treated with the placebo.&lt;ref name=Greenberg /&gt;

__TOC__

==The role of SERCA2a in the heart==

Normal function of the heart involves proper coordination between the contraction and relaxation of [[cardiomyocyte]]s. Proper contraction and relaxation depends on the coordinated rise and fall of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cytosol of the cardiomyocytes.&lt;ref&gt;del Monte F, Harding SE, Schmidt U, Matsui T, Bin Kang Z, Dec GW, et al. (1999). "Restoration of contractile function in isolated cardiomyocytes from failing human hearts by gene transfer of SERCA2a". ''Circulation''. 100:2308–2311.&lt;/ref&gt; The SERCA2a transporter is found in the membrane of the SR and plays an important role in this cycle by removing cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from the cardiomyocyte and pumping it back into the SR during relaxation of the heart (diastole). SERCA2a restores SR Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for the next contraction of cardiomyocytes.&lt;ref name=Lipskaia&gt;Lipskaia L, Chemaly ER, Hadri L, Lompre A, and Hajjar RJ. (2010). "Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ATPase as a therapeutic target for heart failure" ''Expert Opinion on Biology Therapy''. 10(1):29–41.&lt;/ref&gt; SERCA2a activity declines in patients experiencing late-stage heart failure.&lt;ref name=Jaski /&gt; This leads to an above normal amount of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cardiomyocytes during diastole. It also results in less Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; remaining in the SR for the next contraction of the heart. The altered cycling of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cardiomyocytes ultimately leads to improper functioning of the heart, indicating a potentially beneficial effect of gene therapy using Mydicar.&lt;ref name=Jaski /&gt;

==Benefits of Mydicar administration==

Administration of Mydicar occurs via an intracoronary injection of the drug. Mydicar delivers the SERCA2a gene to cardiomyocytes using an adeno-associated viral-vector (AAV).&lt;ref&gt;Hajjar RJ, Zsebo K, Deckelbaum L, Thompson C, Rudy J, Yaroshinsky A, et al. (2008) "Design of a phase 1/2 trial of intracoronary administration of AAV1/SERCA2a in patients with heart failure". ''Journal of Cardiac Failure''. 14:355–367.&lt;/ref&gt; In the cardiomyocytes, the viral vector can insert itself into the genome and increase expression of the SERCA2a protein. Delivering the gene via an AAV is beneficial because it readily infects cardiac tissue and can produce stable, long-term expression of the delivered gene.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;Lewis MA, Cloutier DE, Pacak CA, Mah CS, Thattaliyath BD, Conlon TJ, et al. (2006). "Recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 leads to preferential cardiac transduction in vivo". ''Circulation Research''. 99:e3–e9.&lt;/ref&gt; AAVs also produce less of an immune response than alternative viral vehicles, such as adenoviruses.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; AAVs have been studied in multiple patients and have not been known to cause human disease.&lt;ref name=Lipskaia /&gt;

==The importance of calcium reuptake==

Proper relaxation of the heart in preparation for the next contraction depends largely on the decline of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the cytosol of cardiomyocytes during diastole. Along with impaired contractility, an increased level of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increases the risk of [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s and remodeling of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer M, Schillinger W; Pieske B, Holubarsch C, Heilmann C, Posival H, et al. (1995). "Alterations of sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins in failing human dilated cardiomyopathy". ''Circulation''. 92:778–784.&lt;/ref&gt; Excess Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; found in the cytosol leads to asynchronous contractions of cardiomyocytes causing tachyarrhythmias. The unusual increase in contraction and faster beating of the heart leads to hypertrophy by increasing the size of the cardiac myocytes in the heart. Excess [[hypertrophy]] of the cardiac myocytes leads to further dysfunction of the heart by affecting their ability to relax and contract properly.&lt;ref name=Lipskaia /&gt; Administration of Mydicar increasing functioning SERCA2a can assist in lessening these negative effects of an increase in cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during diastole by increasing reuptake into the SR.

'''Optometry''' is a health care profession which involves examining the [[human eye|eyes]] and applicable [[visual system]]s for defects or abnormalities as well as the medical diagnosis and management of eye disease. Traditionally, the field of optometry began with the primary focus of correcting refractive error through the use of spectacles. Modern day optometry, however, has evolved through time so that the educational curriculum additionally includes intensive medical training in the diagnosis and management of ocular disease in countries where the profession is established and regulated.

'''Optometrists''' (also known as '''Doctors of Optometry''' in the United States and Canada for those holding the O.D. degree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.org/about-the-aoa/what-is-a-doctor-of-optometry?sso=y|title=What is a Doctor of Optometry?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or '''Ophthalmic Opticians''' in the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt; Agarwal, R.K. (1979), Optometrist/Ophthalmic Optician, The Ophthalmic Optician, 7 July 1979, page 550 (the title of this journal was changed to Optometry Today in 1985, published by the Association of Optometrists, London, England)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opticians Act 1989"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/44/pdfs/ukpga_19890044_en.pdf Opticians Act 1989] (cap. 44)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/70/made The General Optical Council (GOC) (Testing of Sight by Persons Training as Ophthalmic Opticians Rules) Order of Council 1994] (SI 1994/70)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/438866/optometrist.pdf Internal Caseworker Guidance] Home Office (retrieved 14 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fodo.com/home/home About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521002358/http://www.fodo.com/home/home |date=21 May 2012 }} The Federation of (Ophthalmic and Dispensing) Opticians (retrieved 1 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opticalconfederation.org.uk/downloads/key-statistics/Optics%20at%20a%20Glance%202011.pdf Optics at a Glance] Optical Confederation, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) are health care professionals who provide primary eyecare through comprehensive [[eye examination]]s to detect and treat various visual abnormalities and eye diseases. Being a regulated profession, an optometrist's scope of practice may differ depending on the location. Thus, disorders or diseases detected outside the treatment scope of optometry are referred out to relevant medical professionals for proper care, more commonly to [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] who are physicians that specialize in tertiary medical and surgical care of the eye. Optometrists typically work closely together with other [[eye care professional]]s such as ophthalmologists and [[optician]]s to deliver quality and efficient eyecare to the general public.

The term "optometry" comes from the Greek words ''[[wikt:ὄψις#Ancient Greek|ὄψις]]'' (''opsis''; "view") and ''[[wikt:μέτρον#Ancient Greek|μέτρον]]'' (''metron''; "something used to measure", "measure", "rule"). The word entered the language when the instrument for measuring vision was called an [[Optometer (ophthalmic instrument)|optometer]], (before the terms [[phoropter]] or refractor were used). The root word ''opto'' is a shortened form derived from the Greek word ''ophthalmos'' meaning, "eye." Like most healthcare professions, the education and certification of optometrists is regulated in most countries. Optometric professionals and optometry-related organizations interact with governmental agencies, other healthcare professionals, and the community to deliver eye- and vision-care.

==Definition of optometry and optometrist==
[[File: Optometrista.jpeg|thumbnail|An optometrist examining the eyes of a patient with a [[slit lamp]] biomicroscope]]
The [[World Council of Optometry]],  [[World Health Organization]] and about 75 optometry organisations from over 40 countries all over the world adopted the following definition, to be used to describe optometry and optometrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/our_members/index.cfm/page/1/|title=Case study|first=Pixl8|last=Developer|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202015502/http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/our_members/index.cfm/page/1/|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{block quote|Optometry is a healthcare profession that is autonomous, educated, and regulated (licensed/registered), and optometrists are the primary healthcare practitioners of the eye and visual system who provide comprehensive eye and vision care, which includes refraction and dispensing, detection/diagnosis and management of disease in the eye, and the rehabilitation of conditions of the visual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldoptometry.org/en/about-wco/who-is-an-optometrist/|title=Who is an optometrist?|first=Laura|last=Prieto|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
[[File:Page 423 from William Porterfield, A treatise on the eye (1759).jpg|thumbnail|Page 423 from "A treatise on the eye, the manner and phaenomena of vision" by William Porterfield, Published 1759 in Edinburgh. In this book the word "optometer" appears for the first time.]]

Optometric history is tied to the development of
* [[vision science]] (related areas of medicine, microbiology, neurology, physiology, psychology, etc.)
* optics, [[History of optics|optical aids]]
* [[optical instrument]]s, imaging techniques
* other [[eye care professional|eye care professions]]

The history of optometry can be traced back to the early studies on optics and image formation by the eye. The origins of optometric science (optics, as taught in a basic physics class) date back a few thousand years BC as evidence of the existence of lenses for [[Decorative arts|decoration]] has been found in Greece and the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

It is unknown when the first [[spectacles]] were made. The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[scientist]] and [[historian]] [[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]], in his ''Science and Civilization in China'', discusses the occasional claim that spectacles were invented in China. He states that the belief may have been based on a source that was modified during the [[Ming dynasty]] (14th - 17th century), that the original document made no references to eyeglasses, and that the references that were there{{which|date=June 2015}}&lt;!-- Which version makes these references, the original or the Ming dynasty version? Please simplify and clarify these statements, perhaps by breaking them down to more, shorter sentences. --&gt; stated the eyeglasses were imported.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Needham|Sir Joseph Needham]]. [http://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf "Science and Civilization in China—Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology; Part 1: Physics]. Monoskop.org. Retrieved 1 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, research by David A. Goss in the United States shows they may have originated independently in the late 13th century in [[Italy]] as stated in a [[manuscript]] from 1305 where a monk from Pisa named Rivalto stated "It is not yet 20 years since there was discovered the art of making eyeglasses".&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opt.indiana.edu/people/faculty/graphics/goss/opthx.pdf |title=History of Optometry |date= |accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectacles were manufactured in Italy, [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] by 1300.

In 1907, Professor [[Berthold Laufer]], who was a [[German American]] [[anthropologist]], stated in his history of spectacles 'the opinion that spectacles originated in India is of the greatest probability and that spectacles must have been known in India earlier than in Europe'.&lt;ref&gt;Laufer, Berthold (1907), Geschichte der Brille, Mitteilungen zur Geschichte der Medizin und der Naturwissenschaften, no. 23, vi Bd., no.4, Leipzig,1907, pages 379-385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal R.K. (1971), Origin of Spectacles in India, ''[[British Journal of Ophthalmology]]'', 55(2), 128-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sri Lanka It is well documented that during the reign of King Bhuvanekabahu the IV (AD 1346 – 1353) of the Gampola period the ancient tradition of optical lens making with natural stone called Diyatarippu was given royal patronage. A few of the craftsman still live and practice in the original hamlet given to the exponents of the craft by royal decree even today. 

But Joseph Needham stated in his "Science and Civilization" that the paper by Laufer had many inconsistencies, and that the references in the document used by Laufer were not in the original copies but added during the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilization Vol. 4.1 page 118 - 119&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the German word ''brille'' (eyeglasses) is derived from [[Sanskrit]] ''vaidurya''.&lt;ref&gt;Olivelle, Patrick (2006), Between the Empires, Society in India 300 BCE to 400 CE, page 463, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologically, ''brille'' is derived from [[beryl]], Latin ''beryllus'', from Greek ''beryllos'', from [[Prakrit]] ''verulia'', ''veluriya'', from Sanskrit ''vaidurya'', of Dravidian origin from the city of ''Velur'' (modern ''Belur''). Medieval Latin ''berillus'' was also applied to eyeglasses, hence German ''brille'', from Middle High German ''berille'', and French ''besicles'' (plural) ''spectacles'', altered from old French ''bericle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beryl|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benito Daza de Valdes published the first full book on optometry in 1623, where he mentioned the use and fitting of eyeglasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fs.aoa.org/optometry-archives/optometry-timeline.html|title=History of Optometry|website=fs.aoa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1692, William Molyneux wrote a book on optics and [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] where he stated his ideas on [[myopia]] and problems related to close-up vision. The scientists Claudius Ptolemy and Johannes Kepler also contributed to the creation of optometry. Kepler discovered how the [[retina]] in the eye creates [[visual perception|vision]]. From 1773 until around 1829, Thomas Young discovered the disability of [[astigmatism]] and it was George Biddell Airy who designed glasses to correct that problem that included spherocylindrical lens.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1715.html |title=Thomas Young |date=|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term optometry appeared in the 1759 book ''A Treatise on the Eye: The Manner and Phenomena of Vision'' by Scottish physician William Porterfield, it was not until the early twentieth century in the United States and Australia that it began to be used to describe the profession. By the early twenty-first century however, marking the distinction with dispensing [[optician]]s, it had become the internationally accepted term.

==Training, licensing, representation and scope of practice==
{{see also|List of optometry schools}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Optometry is officially recognized in many jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (2000), Optometry as an international profession, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 8(4), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Most have regulations concerning education and practice. Optometrists, like many other healthcare professionals, are required to participate in ongoing continuing education courses to stay current on the latest standards of care.  The [[World Council of Optometry]] has a [http://wco.pellesweb.no/ web resource] that provides basic information on eye care providers for more than 46 countries.

===Africa===
In 1993 there were five countries in Africa with optometric teaching institutes: [[Sudan]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8245395 |title=Optometric education and optometry in Africa. |journal=Journal of the American Optometry Association |date=October 1993 |volume=64 |issue=10 |pages=726–729 |last=Penisten |first=DK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudan====
Faculty of optometry and visual sciences

Established in 1954 as institute of optometry in Khartoum eye hospital.
Joined ministry of Higher Education in 1986 as the High Institute of Optometry, and lastly was annexed to Alneelain University in 1997 when it was re- named to become Faculty of Optometry and Visual Sciences (FOVS).

Currently FOVS has the following programs:

1- BSc optometry in 5 years with sub- specialization in either [[orthoptics]],  contact lenses, ocular photography or ocular neurology.
2- BCs in ophthalmic technology in 4 years.
3- BCs in optical dispensary in 4 years.

FOVS also offers MSc and PhD degrees in Optometry.

FOVS is the only of its kind in Sudan and is the first in Middle East  and Africa. There is similar colleges in only 30 out of 193 countries in the world.

In 2010, Alneelain University Eye Hospital was established as part of   FOVS  to expand training capacity and to serve community.

====Ghana====
The [[Ghana Optometric Association]] (GOA) regulates the practise of [[Optometry in Ghana]]. After the six-year training at any of the two universities offering the course, the O.D degree is awarded. The new optometrist must write a qualifying exam, after which the optometrist is admitted as a member of the GOA, leading to the award of the title MGOA.

====Mozambique====
The first optometry course in [[Mozambique]] was started in 2009 at Universidade Lurio, [[Nampula]]. The course is part of the Mozambique Eyecare Project. [[University of Ulster]], [[Dublin Institute of Technology]] and Brien Holden Vision Institute are supporting partners.

====Nigeria====
In Nigeria, optometry is regulated by the Optometry and Dispensing Opticians Registration Board of Nigeria established under the Optometry and Dispensing Opticians ( Registration ETC ) Act of 1989 (Cap O9 Laws of Federation of Nigeria 2004). The Boards publishes from time to time lists of approved qualifications and training institutions in the federal government gazette.&lt;ref&gt;cap O9 Laws of Federation of Nigeria 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Doctor of Optometry degree is awarded after a six-year training at one of the accredited universities in Imo, Edo and Abia states.

===Asia===


==== Bangladesh ====
From 2010 Optometry was first introduced in Bangladesh in Institute of Community Ophthalmology Under Medicine Faculty of University of Chittagong http://icoedu.org. This institute offers a four years Bachelor of science in Optometry (B.Optom) course. Currently there are 60 Graduated Optometrists in Bangladesh. The association which controls the quality of Optometry practice all over the country is named as 'Optometrists Association of Bangladesh' which is also a country member of World Council of Optometry(WCO).
 
In the year 2018 Chittagong Medical University formed and the Bsc. in Optometry course shifted to this University. 

In Bangladesh Optometrists perform primary eye care like Diagnosis and primary management of some ocular diseases, Prescribe Eye Glasses, Low vision rehabilitation, contact lens practice and all type of Orthoptic evaluations and management.

==== Hong Kong ====
The Optometrists Board of the Supplementary Medical Professions Council regulates the profession in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="Supplementary"&gt;Law of Hong Kong, [https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap359!en cap. 359: Supplementary Medical Professions Ordinance.]&lt;/ref&gt; Optometrists are listed in separate parts of the register based on their training and ability. Registrants are subject to restrictions depending on the part they are listed in.&lt;ref&gt;Law of Hong Kong, cap. 359F, [https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap359f!en section 29: Optometrists (Registration and Disciplinary Procedure) Regulation.]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who pass the examination on refraction conducted by the Board may be registered to Part III, thereby restricted to practice only work related to [[Eye examination#Refraction|refraction]]. Those who have a Higher Certificate in Optometry or have passed the Board's optometry examination may be registered to Part II, thereby restricted in their use of diagnostic agents, but may otherwise practice freely. Part I optometrists may practice without restrictions and generally hold a Bachelor degree or a Professional Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;Supplementary Medical Professions Council of Hong Kong, Optometrists Board, [http://www.smp-council.org.hk/op/en/content.php?page=reg_quareg Qualifications for Registration.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are around 2000 optometrists registered in Hong Kong, 1000 of which are Part I.&lt;ref&gt;Supplementary Medical Professions Council of Hong Kong, Optometrists Board, [http://www.smp-council.org.hk/op/en/content.php?page=reg_reg Registration], List of Registrants, Summary.&lt;/ref&gt; There is one Part I optometrist to about 8000 members of the public. The [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University|Polytechnic University]] runs the only optometry school. It produces around 35 Part I optometrists a year.&lt;ref&gt;Tam, Johnny.

====India====
In 2010, it was estimated that India needs 115,000 optometrists; whereas India has approximately 9,000 optometrists (4-year trained) and 40,000 optometrists (2-year trained).&lt;ref&gt;Anon (2010), Organization and Institution News, Plan to boost Indian optometry endorsed, Optometry and Vision Science, Volume 87, Number 7, page 520.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent blindness or [[visual impairment]] more well trained optometrists are required in India.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (2011), Eye care for 11 million vision impaired children in India, Optometry and Vision Science, Volume 88, number 12, page 1532.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that definition of optometry differs considerably in different countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. K. (1985), Optometry in the Indian sub-continent, Optometry Today, Volume 25, No. 14, page 475 (published by the Association of Optometrists, London, England)&lt;/ref&gt; India needs more optometry schools offering four-year degree courses with a syllabus similar to that in force in those countries where practice of optometry is statutorily regulated and well established with an internationally accepted definition.

In 2013, it was reported in the ''[[Indian Journal of Ophthalmology]]'' that poor spectacle compliance amongst school children in rural [[Pune]] resulted in significant vision loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23275214 | doi=10.4103/0301-4738.99996 | volume=61 | issue=1 | title=Spectacle compliance amongst rural secondary school children in Pune district, India. | journal=Indian J Ophthalmol | pages=8–12 | pmc=3555005 | year=2013 |vauthors=Gogate P, Mukhopadhyaya D, Mahadik A, Naduvilath TJ, Sane S, Shinde A, Holden B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported in the [[Optometry and Vision Science]] that, optometrists need to be more involved in providing core optometry services like binocular vision and low vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=25875681 | doi=10.1097/OPX.0000000000000587 | volume=92 | title=Pattern of optometry practice and range of services in India | year=2015 | journal=Optom Vis Sci | pages=615–22 |vauthors=Thite N, Jaggernath J, Chinanayi F, Bharadwaj S, Kunjeer G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Training in India =====
At present there are more than fifty schools of optometry in India.  In the year 1958, two schools of optometry were established, one at Gandhi Eye Hospital, Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh and other one at [[Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital]], Hyderabad in Telangana, under second five-year plan by Director General of Health Services of Government of India. These schools offered diplomas in optometry courses of two years duration validated by State Medical Faculties.

Subsequently, four more schools were opened across India situated at Sitapur Eye Hospital, Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh, Chennai (formerly Madras) in Tamil Nadu, Bengalooru (formerly Bangalore) in Karnataka and Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum) in Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. K. (1970), Optometry in India, The Optician, 3 July, page 18 (published in London, England).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elite School of Optometry (ESO) was established in 1985 at Chennai and was the first to offer a four-year degree course.

Academic degrees such as Bachelor of Optometry, Master of Optometry and Doctor of Philosophy in Optometry are awarded in India by the universities recognised by [[University Grants Commission (India)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/oldpdf/regulations/specificationofDegrees.pdf |title=Specs |date=October 2009 |website=www.ugc.ac.in |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; a statutory body responsible for the maintenance of standards of higher education in India.

Optometrists across India are encouraged to register with the Optometry Council of India, a self-regulatory body registered under the Indian Company Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optometrycouncilofindia.org/career-as-an-optometrist|title=Career as an Optometrist - Optometry Council of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Malaysia====
It takes four years to complete a Degree in Optometry. Today, optometry courses are well received by citizens. More universities and higher education studies are about to implement the courses, e.g., [[National Institute of Ophthalmic Sciences]] in [[Petaling Jaya]] whereby it is the academic arm of [[The Tun Hussein Onn National Eye Hospital]].

====Pakistan====
Optometry is taught as a five/four-year Doctor/ Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors course at many institutions notable among which are Department of Optometry &amp; Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore, Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology (PICO) Peshawar, College of Ophthalmology &amp; Allied Vision Sciences (COAVS) Lahore and Al-Shifa Institute of Ophthalmology Islamabad. After graduation the optometrists can join a four-tiered service delivery level (Centre of Excellence, Tertiary/Teaching, District headquarter and sub-district /Tehsil headquarters). M.Phil in Optometry is also available at select institutions such as King Edward Medical University, Lahore
Department of Optometry &amp; Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore started bridging programmes for Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors to become Doctor of Optometry OD, Post Professional Doctor of Optometry(PP-OD), Transitional Doctor of Optometry(t-OD).
Optometry is not yet a regulated field in Pakistan as there is no professional licensing board or authority responsible for issuing practice licenses to qualified optometrists. This creates difficulty for Pakistani optometrists who wish to register abroad.
University of Lahore has recently launched Doctor of optometry (OD).
Imam Hussain Medical University also has launched Doctor of Optometry Program, Chairman Imam Hussain medical university Dr Sabir Hussain has vowed  to regulate OD curriculum according to   international standard.

====Philippines====
Optometry is regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission of the Philippines. To be eligible for licensing, each candidate must have satisfactorily completed a doctor of optometry course at an accredited institution and demonstrate good moral character with no previous record of professional misconduct. Professional organizations of optometry in the Philippines include Optometric Association of the Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippineoptometry.net/|title=Optometry Update - Optometry News And Updates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Integrated Philippine Association of Optometrists, Inc. (IPAO).

====Saudi Arabia====
In Saudi Arabia optometrists must complete a five-year doctor of optometry degree from Qassim University and King Saud University also they must complete a two residency .

====Singapore====
Tertiary education for optometrists takes 3 years at the following institutions.

Singapore Polytechnic - Diploma in Optometry [[Singapore Polytechnic]]

Ngee Ann Polytechnic - Diploma in Optometry [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]]

====Thailand====
Since late 1990, Thailand has set goal to provide more than 600 optometrists to meet the minimal public demands and international standards in vision cares. There are more than three university degree programs in Thailand. Each program accept students that have completed grade 12th or the third year in high school (following US education model). These programs offer "Doctor of Optometry" degree to graduates from the program that will take six years to complete the courses. Practicing optometrists will also required to pass licensing examination (three parts examinations) that is administrated through a committee under the Ministry of Public Health.

Nowadays, the number of practicing optometrists in Thailand is still less than one hundred (2015). However, it has projected that the number of practicing optometrists in Thailand will greatly increase within the next ten years. In theoretical scenario, the number of optometrists should be able to meet minimal public demands around 2030 or earlier.

===Europe===
Since the formation of the [[European Union]], "there exists a strong movement, headed by the Association of European Schools and Colleges of Optometry (AESCO), to unify the profession by creating a European-wide examination for optometry" and presumably also standardized practice and education guidelines within EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamakiotes DS, Thal LS |title=The unification of European optometry: how the profession will change after 1992 |journal=J Am Optom Assoc |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=904–13 |date=December 1991 |pmid=1814983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first examinations of the new European Diploma in Optometry were held in 1998 and this was a landmark event for optometry in continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (1998), European Diploma in Optometry, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 6(3), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
There is no regulatory framework and optometrists are sometimes trained by completing an apprenticeship at an ophthalmologists' private office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escrs.org/eurotimes/July2003/French_ophthalmology.asp|title=ESCRS - European Society of Cataract &amp; Refractive Surgeons|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407131927/http://www.escrs.org/eurotimes/July2003/French_ophthalmology.asp|archivedate=7 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
Optometric tasks are performed by [[ophthalmologist]]s and professionally trained and certified [[optician]]s.

====Greece====
Hellenic Ministry of Education founded the first department of Optometry at Technological Educational Institute of Patras in 2007. After protests from the department of Optics at Technological Educational Institute of Athens (the only department of Optics in Greece, until 2006), the Government changed the names of the departments to "Optics and Optometry" and included lessons in both optics and optometry. Optometrists-Opticians have to complete a 4-year undergraduate honours degree. Then the graduates can be admitted to postgraduate courses in Optometry at universities around the world.

Since 2015, a Master of Science (MSc) course in Optometry is offered by the Technological Educational Institute of Athens.

The Institute of Vision and Optics (IVO) of the University of Crete focuses on the sciences of vision and is active in the fields of research, training, technology development and provision of medical services. Professor [[Ioannis Pallikaris]] has received numerous awards and recognitions for the Institute’s contribution to [[ophthalmology]]. In 1989 he performed the first [[LASIK]] procedure on a [[human eye]].

====Hungary====
Optometrist education takes 4 years in the medical universities in Hungary, and they will get a Bachelor of Science degree. They work in networks and retail stores and private optics, very few are located in the Health Care care system as [[ophthalmologist]]s as an assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optikaimagazin.hu/a-latszeresz-es-az-optometrista-kepzes-aktualis-helyzete-magyarorszagon/|title=A látszerész- és az optometrista-képzés aktuális helyzete Magyarországon - Optikai Magazin Online|date=1 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
The profession of Optometry has been represented for over a century by the Association of Optometrists, Ireland [AOI]. In [[Ireland]] an optometrist must first complete a four-year degree in optometry at [[Dublin Institute of Technology]]. Following successful completion of the degree, an optometrist must then complete professional qualifying examinations to enter the register of the Opticians Board [Bord na Radharcmhaistoiri]. Optometrists must be registered with the Board to practice in the Republic of Ireland.

The A.O.I. runs a comprehensive continuing education and professional development program on behalf of Irish optometrists. The legislation governing optometry was drafted in 1956. Some feel that the legislation restricts optometrists from using their full range of skills, training and equipment for the benefit of the Irish public. The amendment to the Act in 2003 addressed one of the most significant restrictions: the use of [[cycloplegic]] drugs to examine children.

====Italy====
In Italy Optometry is unregulated profession. It is taught at seven universities: Padua, Turin, Milan, [[University of Salento|Salento]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienzemfn.unisalento.it/cdl_ottica_optometria|title=Facolta di Scienze MM.FF.NN. :: Corso di Laurea in Ottica ed Optometria - Università del Salento|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence, Naples and Rome, as three years course (like a BSc) of "Scienze e tecnologie fisiche" as sector of the Physics Department. Additionally, courses are available at some private institutions (as at Vinci Institute near Firenze) that offer advanced professional education for already qualified opticians (most of the Italian optometrists are also qualified opticians, i.e. "ottico abilitato"). In the last thirty years several verdicts from High Court (Cassazione) proof that optometry is a freely practice and has truly education path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sopti.it/optometria-in-sintesi/ | title=OPTOMETRIA IN SINTESI |website=SOPTI - Società Optometrica Italiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
In Norway, the optometric profession has been regulated as a healthcare profession since 1988. After a three-year bachelor program one can practice basic optometry. At least one year in clinical practice qualify for a post-degree half-year sandwich course in contact lens fitting, which is regulated as a healthcare specialty. A separate regulation for the use of diagnostic drugs in optometric practice was introduced in 2004.

====Russia====
In [[Russia]], optometry education has been accredited by the Federal Agency of Health and Social Development.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
There are only two educational institutions that teach optometry in Russia: Saint Petersburg Medical Technical College, formerly known as St. Petersburg College of Medical Electronics and Optics, and The Helmholtz Research Institute for Eye Diseases. They both belong and are regulated by the Ministry of Health. The optometry program is a four-year program. It includes one to two science foundation years, one year focused on clinical and proficiency skills, and one year of clinical rotations in hospitals. Graduates take college/state [[examinations]] and then receive a specialist [[diploma]]. This diploma is valid for only five years and must be renewed every five years after receiving additional training at state accredited programs.

The scope of practice for optometrists in Russia includes: refraction, contact lens fitting, spectacles construction and lens fitting (dispensing), low vision aids, foreign body removal, referrals to other specialists after clinical condition diagnoses (management of diseases in the eye).

====United Kingdom====
===== Licensing =====
Optometrists in the United Kingdom (also known as ''Ophthalmic Opticians'') are regulated by the [[General Optical Council]] under the Opticians Act 1989 and distinguished from medical practitioners.&lt;ref name="Opticians Act 1989"/&gt; Registration with the GOC is mandatory to practice optometry in the UK. Members of the College of Optometrists (incorporated by a Royal Charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II)&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (1995), A Royal Charter for optometrists, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 3 (3), 100&lt;/ref&gt; may use the suffix MCOptom.

The [[National Health Service]] provides free sight tests and spectacle vouchers for children and those on very low incomes. The elderly and those with some chronic conditions like diabetes get free periodic tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/help-with-health-costs/free-nhs-eye-tests-and-optical-vouchers/|title=Free NHS eye tests and optical vouchers|publisher=NHS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for eye conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts is free and checked for during normal eye examinations.

===== Training =====
In the [[United Kingdom]], optometrists have to complete a 3 or 4 ([[Scotland]]) year undergraduate honours degree followed by a minimum of a one-year "pre-registration period", (internship), where they complete clinical practice under the supervision of a qualified and experienced practitioner. During this year the pre-registration candidate is given a number of quarterly assessments, often including temporary posting at a hospital, and on successfully passing all of these assessments, a final one-day set of examinations (details correct for candidates from 2006 onwards). Following successful completion of these assessments and having completed one year's supervised practice, the candidate is eligible to register as an optometrist with the [[General Optical Council]] (GOC) and, should they so wish, are entitled to membership of the [[College of Optometrists]].  Twelve universities offer Optometry in the UK: [[Anglia Ruskin University|Anglia Ruskin]], [[Aston University|Aston]], [[University of Bradford|Bradford]], [[Cardiff University|Cardiff]], [[City, University of London|City]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[University of Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Plymouth]], [[Ulster University at Coleraine]], [[University of Portsmouth]] and [[University of the West of England, Bristol]].

Additionally, in 2008 the [[Institute of Optometry]] in London established a post-graduate professional doctorate in optometry in partnership with [[London South Bank University]].&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (2008), Integrating theory with practice, Optician, Volume 236, number 6167, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (2014), Developing the doctorate, Optician, volume 247, number 6439, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also from 2008 [[Aston University]] has offered courses leading to a post-graduate professional doctorate in optometry.

===== Scope of Practice =====
In 1990, a survey of the opinions of British medical practitioners regarding the services provided by British optometrists was carried out by Agarwal&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal, R. (1996), British optometry: medical practitioner's opinion survey, British Journal of Optometry and Dispensing, 4(2), 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; at City, University of London. A majority of respondents were in favour of optometrists extending their professional role by treating external eye conditions and prescribing broad spectrum topical antibiotics through additional training and certification.

Since 2009, optometrists in the UK have been able to undertake additional postgraduate training and qualifications that allow them to prescribe medications to treat and manage eye conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/CPD/Therapeutics/independent-prescribing/index.cfm |title=Independent Prescribing|website=The College of Optometrists}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are currently three registerable specialties:
* '''Additional supply specialty''' - to write orders for, and supply in an emergency, a range of drugs in addition to those ordered or supplied by a normal optometrist.
* '''Supplementary prescribing specialty''' -  to manage a patient’s clinical condition and prescribe medicines according to a clinical management plan set up in conjunction with an independent prescriber, such as a GP or ophthalmologist or qualified optometrist.
* '''Independent prescribing specialty''' - to take responsibility for the clinical assessment of a patient, establish a diagnosis and determine the clinical management required, including prescribing where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.optical.org/en/Education/Specialty_qualifications/Therapeutic_Prescribing_Specialties.cfm|title=Therapeutic Prescribing specialties|first=Liz|last=Carr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America===
====Canada====
===== Training =====
In Canada, Doctors of Optometry (O.D.) typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four to five years of optometry studies, accredited by the Accreditation Council on Optometric Education. There are two such schools of optometry located in Canada — the [[University of Waterloo]] and the [[Université de Montreal]]. Canada also recognizes degrees from the twenty US schools.

===== Licensing =====
In Canada, Doctors of Optometry must write national written and practical board exams. Additionally, optometrists are required to become licensed in the province in which they wish to practice. Regulatory of professions is within [[Section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867|provincial jurisdiction]]. Therefore, regulation of optometry is unique to individual provinces and territories. In Ontario, optometrists are licensed by the College of Optometrists of Ontario.

===== Representation =====
In Canada, the profession is represented by the [[Canadian Association of Optometrists]].  In the province of Ontario, the Ontario Association of Optometrists is the designated representative of optometrists to the provincial government.

===== Scope of Practice =====
Optometrists in Canada are trained and licensed to be primary eye care providers. They provide optical and medical eye care. They are able to diagnose and treat most eye diseases and can prescribe both topical and oral medications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opto.ca/sites/default/files/resources/documents/optometry_scope_across_canada_grid_january_2016_0.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410083022/https://opto.ca/sites/default/files/resources/documents/optometry_scope_across_canada_grid_january_2016_0.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-04-10 |title=Optometic scope of practice across Canada |publisher=Canadian Association of Optometrists |date=January 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
Doctors of Optometry (O.D.) (optometric physicians / optometrists) function as primary eye care providers. The scope of optometry has expanded in modern times and significantly overlaps with general [[ophthalmology]], the branch of medicine involving the health of the eyes and visual system. Optometrists in the US are trained and licensed to diagnose and manage all common eye diseases. They can prescribe all topical medications (prescription eye drops) and most oral medications (tablets/capsules by mouth), as well as administer diagnostic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aoa.org/Images/oral.gif|title=We're sorry.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514055951/https://www.aoa.org/Images/oral.gif|archivedate=14 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/faculty/~d_schadler/optometry.htm|title=Oglethorpe University 2012|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513081007/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/faculty/~d_schadler/optometry.htm|archivedate=13 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucop.edu/hss/documents/optometry.pdf University of California 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513080836/http://www.ucop.edu/hss/documents/optometry.pdf |date=13 May 2012 }} (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt; In some states, Optometrists may also be licensed to perform certain types of [[Eye surgery|eye surgery]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionmonday.com/latest-news/article/louisiana-governor-jindal-signs-law-permitting-optometrists-to-perform-certain-surgeries-1/|title=Louisiana Governor Jindal Signs Law Permitting Optometrists to Perform Certain Surgeries|date=June 4, 2014|website=Vision Monday|access-date=24 October 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Scope of Practice =====
Doctors of Optometry (O.D.) (optometric physicians / optometrists) function as primary eye care providers, providing both comprehensive optical and medical eye care. They can prescribe corrective lenses (glasses and contacts) to aid optical abnormalities (e.g., myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, astigmatism). They also manage vision development in children including amblyopia diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, Optometrists are trained and licensed to diagnose all forms of eye disease and provide medical treatment (e.g., infections, inflammation, glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal/retinal abnormalities, uveitis, etc.). They can write prescriptions for all topical medications (eye drops) and most medications taken by mouth (e.g., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, allergy, pain). Optometrists may also order lab tests including: bacterial cultures, blood work, MRI, CT, ultrasound etc. When patients exhibit an advanced form of disease or require surgery, optometrists may refer to specialists (ophthalmologists with fellowship in particular area). Optometrists many also provide pre/post operative surgical care, however, optometrists are not trained to perform invasive surgery. 

Ophthalmologists are Medical/Osteopathic Doctors (MD/DO) who specialize in the eye. They provide comprehensive medical and surgical eye care. While ophthalmologists can prescribe corrective lenses, they are primarily trained to manage complicated eye diseases, many involving surgery. Often, ophthalmologists choose to specialize in a particular area of the eye, such as the retina or cornea.

In Oklahoma and Louisiana, the state optometry board also allows state-certified optometrists to perform surgeries limited to the anterior segment of the eye. In Kentucky, recent legislation permits optometrists to perform a multitude of laser procedures.

===== Regulation =====
Doctors of optometry in the United States are regulated by state boards, which vary from state to state.
The Association of Regulatory Boards of Optometry (ARBO) assists these state board licensing agencies in regulating the practice of optometry.

===== Licensing =====
Optometrists must complete all course work and graduate from an accredited College of Optometry. This includes passage of all parts of the national board examinations as well as local jurisprudence examinations, which vary by state.

===== Education and Training =====
Doctors of Optometry (O.D.) (Optometric physician / Optometrist) typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four years of Optometry school plus an optional year of study in a specialty area (residency). The program includes intense classroom and clinical training in geometric, physical, physiological and ophthalmic optics, specialty contact lens evaluation and fitting, general anatomy, ocular anatomy, ocular disease, pharmacology, ocular pharmacology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the visual system, pediatric visual development, gerontology, binocular vision, color vision, form, space, movement and vision perception, systemic disease, histology, microbiology, sensory and perceptual psychology, biochemistry, statistics and epidemiology. 

Moreover, modern day optometry exhibits significant overlap with general ophthalmology. In Optometry school, students receive extensive ophthalmology training (branch of medicine involving the eye and related structures). Students are trained to diagnose and manage all common eye diseases and ocular emergencies. Students are also educated on all systemic diseases that may cause eye disease, or eye disease indicative of systemic disease. Classes are taught by O.D's, M.D's and various Ph.D's. Optometry students often take five to six classes per quarter as well as complete clinical shifts in their first three years. The fourth year of Optometry school is 100% clinical where students must complete internships in various settings such as hospitals, universities and private clinics. In many internships, optometry students work with ophthalmology residents to co-manage medical cases and also observe surgery, however, optometrists are not trained to perform invasive surgery like ophthalmologists are.

Admission to Optometry school is very competitive. Applicants must take the Optometry Admission Test (OAT) and have excellent undergraduate grades to apply. To graduate, candidates must pass all three parts of the National Board of Examiners of Optometry (NBEO).  Part 1 NBEO is a two day written exam. Part 2 is a computer based exam, takes all day and based on clinical studies including the treatment and management of ocular disease. Part three is a practical exam that must be taken in person in North Carolina. Once a candidate has successfully completed all applicable coursework, clinical rotations, passed all parts of NBEO exams, and satisfied all financial obligations ($225,000 USD), a Doctor of Optometry degree will be conferred. 

Ophthalmologists are Medical/Osteopathic Doctors (MD/DO) who specialize in the eye. They provide comprehensive medical and surgical eye care. Ophthalmologists complete four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, three years of ophthalmology training (residency), and optional year (or two) of specialty training (fellowship). While ophthalmologists can prescribe corrective lenses, they are primarily trained to manage complicated eye diseases, many of which involving surgery. Many ophthalmologists choose to become specialists and specialize in a particular area of the eye (e.g., retina, cornea, etc.).

All O.D.'s and M.D.'s are required to complete continuing education to maintain licensure.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Australia currently has five recognized courses in optometry, and one course seeking to obtain accreditation with the Optometry council of Australia and New Zealand :
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry (BVisSci MOptom), [[Deakin University]]
* Bachelor of Medical Science (Vision Science) and Master of Optometry, [[Flinders University]]
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Clinical Optometry (BVisSc MClinOptom), [[University of New South Wales]]
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[Queensland University of Technology]]
* Doctor of Optometry, [[Melbourne University]] ([[post-graduate]])
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, [[University of Canberra]] (Seeking accreditation)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=372JA&amp;version_number=1|title=Course - University of Canberra|website=www.canberra.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support these courses the [[Australian College of Optometry]] provides clinical placements to undergraduate students from Australian Universities and abroad.

in 2016, almost 5000 optometrists in general practice were licensed with their regulatory body, the [http://www.optometryboard.gov.au/ Optometry Board of Australia].  Of these, approximately 2300 were registered with the scheduled medicines endorsement, which enables them to prescribe some medicines for the treatment of conditions of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.optometryboard.gov.au/About/Statistics.aspx|title=Optometry Board of Australia - Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
New Zealand currently has one recognised course in optometry:
* Bachelor of Optometry (BOptom), [[The University of Auckland]]

In July 2014, the Medicines Amendment Act 2013 and Misuse of Drugs Amendment Regulations 2014 came into effect.  Among other things, the changes to the Act name optometrists as authorised prescribers.  This change enables optometrists with a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent (TPA) endorsement to prescribe all medicines appropriate to their scope of practice, rather than limiting them to a list of medicines specified in regulation; this recognises the safe and appropriate prescribing practice of optometrists over the previous nine years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.odob.health.nz/cms_display.php?sn=74&amp;st=1&amp;pg=1564|title=GLA|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
====Brazil====
The Brazilian Government does not state rules about optometry, and the Brazilian Council of Ophthalmology recommends against its official legal recognition.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The CBOO (Brazilian Council of Optics and Optometry), which is affiliated to the WCO ([[World Council of Optometry]]), represents Brazilian optometrists. In conjunction with organizations representative weight of Brazilian companies, including the National Commerce Confederation for goods, services and tourism (CNC), through the CBÓptica/CNC, its defense arm of optometric and optical industry, are defending the right of free and independent practice of optometrists, even if it is against the interests of ophthalmologists.

The Federal Supreme Court (STF), the Brazilian Court of Justice and the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), another important National Court, ruled several processes granting inquestionable victories to ophthalmologists.

In Brazilian law, however, there is an explicit recommendation that the one prescribing corrective lenses are prohibited to sell them. This restricting rule to the ophthalmologists has keeping the optic shops away from Hospitals and Eye Care Clinics since 1930, and it has to be reviewed before any further regulation for the optometrists.

====Colombia====
In [[Colombia]], optometry education has been accredited by the Ministry of Health. The last official revision to the laws regarding healthcare standards in the country was issued in 1992 through the Law 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cna.gov.co/cont/publicaciones/estandares/salud/anexo_ant_for_pro_cie_sal.htm|title=Consejo Nacional de Acreditación&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040911151134/http://www.cna.gov.co/cont/publicaciones/estandares/salud/anexo_ant_for_pro_cie_sal.htm|archivedate=11 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are eight official universities that are entitled by [[ICFES]] to grant the optometrist certification. The first optometrists arrived in the country from North America and Europe circa 1914. These professionals specialized in optics and [[refraction]]. In 1933, under [[Decree]]s 449 and 1291, the Colombian Government officially set the rules for the formation of professionals in the field of optometry. In 1966 [[La Salle University, Colombia|La Salle University]] opened its first Faculty of Optometry after recommendation from a group of professionals. At the present time optometrists are encouraged to keep up with new technologies through congresses and scholarships granted by the government or the private sector (such as [[Bausch &amp; Lomb]]).

In [[medicine]], '''ovarian vein syndrome''' is a rare (possibly not uncommon, certainly under-diagnosed) condition in which a dilated [[ovarian vein]] compresses the [[ureter]] (the tube that brings the [[urine]] from the [[kidney]] to the [[bladder]]). This causes chronic or [[colic]]ky [[abdominal pain]], [[back pain]] and/or [[pelvic pain]]. The pain can worsen on lying down or between ovulation and menstruation.&lt;ref name="pmid12379831"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tourné G, Ducroux A, Bourbon M, Blinding H |title=The ovarian vein syndrome: eight cases and review of the literature |language=French |journal=J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris) |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=471–7 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12379831 |doi= |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-JGYN-09-2002-31-5-0368-2315-101019-ART5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16703736"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=del Valle González N, Estébanez Zarranz J, Escudero Caro T, etal |title=Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian vein syndrome |language=Spanish|journal=Actas Urol Esp |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=85–9 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16703736 |doi= |url=http://www.actasurologicas.info/v30/n01/ENG/3001NC03.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can also be an increased tendency towards [[urinary tract infection]] or [[pyelonephritis]] (kidney infection). The right ovarian vein is most commonly involved, although the disease can be left-sided or affect both sides. It is currently classified as a form of [[pelvic congestion syndrome]].

==Mechanism==
Normally, the ovarian vein crosses over the ureter at the level of the fourth or fifth lumbar [[Vertebra|vertebral bone]]. The ureter itself courses over the [[external iliac artery]] and [[external iliac vein|vein]].&lt;ref name="pmid9113150"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maubon A, Ferru JM, Thiebaut C, Berger V, Hoche N, Rouanet JP |title=Left ovarian vein syndrome |language=French |journal=J Radiol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=223–5 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9113150 |doi= |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-JR-03-1997-78-3-0221-0363-101019-ART59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these vessels can impinge on the ureter causing obstruction. The left ovarian vein ends in the [[renal vein]] whereas the right ovarian vein normally enters into the [[inferior vena cava]]. In the case of right ovarian vein syndrome, the vein often ends in the renal vein. This is thought to contribute to venous engorgement, in analogy to what is seen in [[varicocele]]s, which arise more commonly on the left side. The straight angle between the ovarian vein (or testicular vein in males in the case of varicocoele) and the renal vein has been proposed as a cause of decreased blood return.

A related diagnosis is "Nutcraker Syndrome" where the left renal vein is described as being compressed between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. This is reported to cause collateral flow paths to open up to drain the left kidney i.e. reversed flow (reflux caudally) in the left renal vein. Pelvic Congestion Syndrome, vaginal and vulval varices, lower limb varices are clinical sequelae. Virtually all such patient are female and have been pregnant, often multiply.

The ovarian vein often displays incompetent valves. This has been observed more often in women with a higher number of previous [[pregnancies]]. Pressure from the baby might hinder the return of blood through the ovarian vein. It has to be noted however that dilation of the [[urinary tract]] is a normal observation in pregnancy, due to mechanical compression and the hormonal action of [[progesterone]]. Ovarian vein dilatation might also follow [[venous thrombosis]] (clotting inside the vein).

Another proposed mechanism of obstruction is when the ovarian vein and ureter both run through a sheath of [[fibrosis|fibrous]] tissue, following a local [[inflammation]]. This could be seen as a localised form of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9113150"/&gt;

Following obstruction, the ureter displays an abnormal [[peristalsis]] (contractions) towards the kidney instead of towards the bladder. This is thought to cause the colicky pain (similar to [[renal colic]]), and it is relieved after surgical decompression.

==Diagnosis==
Since it is a rare disease, it remains a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] of other conditions with similar symptoms. The diagnosis is supported by the results of imaging studies such as [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the abdomen (with or without [[doppler imaging]]) or [[intravenous urography]].

Specialist vascular ultrasonographers should routinely look for left ovarian vein reflux in patients with lower limb varices especially if not associated with long or short saphenous reflux. The clinical pattern of varices differs between the two types of lower limb varices.
CT scanning is used to exclude abdominal or pelvic pathology. CT-Angiography/Venography can often demonstrate left ovarian vein reflux and image an enlarged left ovarian vein but is less sensitive and much more expensive than duplex Doppler ultrasound examination. Ultrasound requires that the ultrasonographer be experienced in venous vascular ultrasound and so is not always readily available. A second specialist ultrasound exam remains preferable to a CT scan.

As a wide range of pelvic and abdominal pathology can cause symptoms consistent with those symptoms due to left ovarian vein reflux, prior to embolisation of the left ovarian vein, a careful search for such diagnoses is essential. Consultation with general surgeons, gynaecologists, and possibly CT scanning should always be considered.

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of [[painkillers]] and surgical ablation of the dilated vein. This can be accomplished with open abdominal surgery ([[laparotomy]]) or keyhole surgery ([[laparoscopy]]).&lt;ref name="pmid8808882"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elashry OM, Nakada SY, Wolf JS, Figenshau RS, McDougall EM, Clayman RV |title=Ureterolysis for extrinsic ureteral obstruction: a comparison of laparoscopic and open surgical techniques |journal=J.

Another approach to treatment involves [[catheter]]-based [[embolisation]],&lt;ref name="pmid17468903"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kwon SH, Oh JH, Ko KR, Park HC, Huh JY |title=Transcatheter ovarian vein embolization using coils for the treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome |journal=Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=655–61 |year=2007 |pmid=17468903 |doi=10.1007/s00270-007-9040-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; often preceded by [[phlebography]] to visualise the vein on X-ray [[fluoroscopy]].&lt;ref name="pmid16703736"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8304795"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Moyano Calvo JL, Teba del Pino F, Arellano Gañan R, etal |title=[The ovarian vein syndrome. Its treatment by percutaneous embolization and a review of the same] |language=Spanish|journal=Arch. Esp. Urol. |volume=46 |issue=9 |pages=802–6 |date=November 1993 |pmid=8304795 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ovarian vein coil embolisation is an effective and safe treatment for pelvic congestion syndrome and lower limb varices of pelvic origin. Many patients with lower limb varices of pelvic origin respond to local treatment i.e. ultrasound guided sclerotherapy. In those cases, ovarian vein coil embolisation should be considered second line treatment to be used if veins recur in a short time period  i.e. 1–3 years. This approach allows further pregnancies to proceed if desired. Coil embolisation is not appropriate if a future pregnancy is possible. This treatment has largely superseded operative options.

Coil embolisation requires exclusion of other pelvic pathology, expertise in endovascular surgery, correct placement of appropriate sized coils in the pelvis and also in the upper left ovarian vein, careful pre- and post-procedure specialist vascular ultrasound imaging, a full discussion of the procedure with the patient i.e. informed consent. Complications, such as coil migration, are rare but reported. Their sequelae are usually minor.

If a Nutcracker compression (see below) is discovered, stenting of the renal vein should be considered before embolization of the ovarian vein. Reducing outflow obstruction should always be the main objective.

'''Paul M. Ellwood Jr.''' (born 16 July 1926) is a prominent figure in [[Health care in the United States|American health care]]. Often referred to as the "[[father of]] the [[health maintenance organization]],"&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/business/hillary-clinton-s-potent-brain-trust-on-health-reform.html |first=Robin |last=Toner |title=Hillary Clinton’s Potent Brain Trust on Health Reform |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 28, 1993 |page=Section 3, p. 1}} and Michael Booth, "The Latest from the Father of the HMO," Corporate Report Minnesota, Cover Story, October 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [http://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/9711/9711.qnaellwood.html "New Optimism from the Father of the HMO, An Interview with Paul Ellwood Jr., MD," Managed Care (November 1997)], Ellwood reports he coined the term in May 1970 for the Nixon Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; he not only coined the term, he also played a role in bringing about structural changes to the [[American health care system]] to simultaneously control cost and promote health by replacing [[fee-for-service]] with prepaid, comprehensive care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Starr |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Starr |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FK4pBXGvQzoC&amp;vq=%22The+Social+Transformation+Of+American+Medicine%22+Basic+Books |title=The Social Transformation of American Medicine |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=1982 |page=395 |isbn=0-465-07935-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "HMO" was coined by Dr. Paul M. Ellwood Jr. in a January 1970 Fortune Magazine article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Our Ailing Medical System: It's Time to Operate |journal=Fortune Magazine |date=January 1970 |publisher=New York, Harper &amp; Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment |title=Managed Care and Competitive Health Care Markets: the Twin Cities Experience |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |date=July 1994 |location=Washington, DC |id=OTA-BP-H- 130 |url=http://ota.fas.org/reports/9419.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he has advanced an agenda for monitoring health outcomes, so that patients, providers, and payers can make health care decisions based on real information about what treatments and providers are actually effective.

Ellwood began his career as a [[pediatrics|pediatric]] [[neurologist]], specializing in [[polio]] at the height of the [[History of poliomyelitis|international polio epidemic]] in the early 1950s. The epidemic subsided with the introduction of the [[polio vaccine]] by [[Jonas Salk]]. The [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Institute]], which Ellwood directed, then filled its vacant beds with children suffering from [[learning disabilities]]. According to Ellwood, one evening while doing rounds amid crying children, it struck him that they were making decisions for economic reasons (the need to fill hospital beds) that were not in the best interests of patients. His growing conviction that this calculus &amp;ndash; putting the interests of health care providers over patient well-being &amp;ndash; characterized the American medical system in general, led him to conceive of and advocate for alternative approaches.&lt;ref name="aha"/&gt;

==Biography==
Ellwood was born on July 16, 1926 in [[San Francisco]]&lt;ref name="aha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zk9rAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=paul+m.+ellwood+jr.+kenny+institute+1953+1971&amp;q=ellwood |title=Who's Who in Health Care |publisher=Hanover Publications |year=1981 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Oakland, California]]. He was the son of a nurse-turned-homemaker and a dedicated physician who made house calls much of Paul’s young life and served inner-city patients in Oakland into his eighties.&lt;ref name="pmid11698912"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ellwood Jr |first1=P.

He went on to earn a bachelor's degree from [[Stanford University]] in 1949 and a medical degree from [[Stanford Medical School]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; He worked in the Elizabeth Kenny Institute, later known as the American Rehabilitation Foundation, from 1953 to 1971, as a physician and ultimately the Executive Director. At the same time he served as Clinical Professor of [[Pediatrics]], [[Neurology]] and [[Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]] at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he founded the program in Pediatric Neurology.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2001/11000/Q__A_With_Paul_Ellwood,_Jr_,_MD__Father_of_Managed.18.aspx |journal=Neurology Today |volume=1 |issue=4 |page=36 |last=Elming |first=Shelley |title=Q &amp;A With Paul Ellwood Jr., MD 'Father of Managed Competition Concept' |date=November–December 2001 |doi=10.1097/00132985-200111000-00018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-editor of the ''Handbook of Physical Medicine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_physical_medicine_and_rehabi.html?id=BgjOjwEACAAJ |title=Handbook of physical medicine and rehabilitation |editor1=Frederic J.

In 1973&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; he founded Interstudy, a health policy think tank based in [[Minnesota]], where he served as Executive Director.  He served as the founder and president of the Jackson Hole Group from 1971 to 2002.

==Health maintenance organizations and managed competition==
{{main|Health maintenance organization}}
In 1970&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; Ellwood was invited to consult with President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon's]] staff to reshape national health policy, where he advanced the idea of giving consumers a choice among health plans that would compete on price and quality. He coined the term Health Maintenance Organization, or HMO, to describe groups of physicians who were pre-paid on a per-patient basis ([[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]]) instead of a [[fee-for-service]] arrangement. While the term "HMO" was Ellwood’s, this institutional model already existed in the form of the non-profit [[Kaiser Permanente|Kaiser health plan]] in California. Ellwood argued that creating a system of many competing HMOs would give health providers an incentive to keep patients well while driving down health care costs. Doctors would promote [[preventive medicine]] and would be less inclined to order costly procedures that had not been proven to improve health outcomes. Ellwood’s work with the [[Nixon administration]] culminated in the passage of the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]].&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt; The result was a dramatic change to the landscape of health care in the United States: the proliferation of HMOs, [[Preferred Provider Organization]]s (PPOs), and [[Managed Care#Independent Practice Association|Independent Provider Associations]] (IPAs) alongside traditional [[fee-for-service]] arrangements.

In 1971, Ellwood founded the Jackson Hole Group, a "loosely organized but highly regarded" group of politicians, providers, and policymakers who came together in the town of [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] to discuss ideas for changing the health care incentive structure.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt; A key member of the group was [[Alain Enthoven]], a [[Stanford]] [[economist]] who was instrumental in shaping the concept of "managed competition" in health care. By influencing policy, as well as the decision-making of some in the [[Health care industry|health care]] and [[insurance]] industries, he and his colleagues would have a major impact on the changing shape of health care for decades.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance "Jackson Hole Revisited: How a Group of Health Policy Thinkers Transformed the Nation’s Healthcare System" Health Leaders, June 2001; [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3257/is_n11_v48/ai_16443634/ Richard L. Clarke, "Paul M. Ellwood, MD: Reforming Health Care from Jackson Hole," Healthcare Financial Management, November 1994];  and [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2002/06/10/gvsa0610.htm Amy Snow Landa, amednews staff, "''Jackson Hole Group Hopes to Spark a Revival''"], American Medical Association, amednews.com, June 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy over HMOs==
Subsequently, when the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration was grappling with [[health care reform]], the Jackson Hole Group, according to the [[New York Times]], was "one of the most important influences in the shaping of the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton plan]]."&lt;ref name="Toner1993-02-28NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/28/business/hillary-clinton-s-potent-brain-trust-on-health-reform.html |title=Hillary Clinton’s Potent Brain Trust on Health Reform |last=Toner |first=Robin |date=1993-02-28 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |pages=section 3, page 1 |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was called managed competition, and two of its most prominent advocates from the Jackson Hole Group were Ellwood and [[Alain Enthoven]].  In essence, the concept was that groups of [[health care provider]]s and [[insurance|insurers]] would compete with each other to get the business of large [[cooperative]]s seeking [[insurance]]. In the end the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton reform plan]] collapsed.  By then, the Jackson Hole Group had distanced itself due to disagreement about the degree of regulation the plan sought to impose, and Ellwood had become a pioneer in outcomes management.&lt;ref&gt;See Emling. Also [http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2002/06/10/gvsa0610.htm Amy Snow Landa, amednews staff, "''Jackson Hole Group Hopes to Spark a Revival''"], American Medical Association, amednews.com, June 10, 2002.  For Ellwood’s critique of the Clinton plan, see Paul M. Ellwood, "Balance the Health Budget," [[The New York Times]] editorial, December 6, 1993, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of HMOs and other pre-paid health plans has spawned significant debate about the impact on quality of care.  From the beginning, critics argued that pre-paid competitive plans like HMOs provided incentives for doctors and hospitals to "skimp" on care.&lt;ref&gt;"Health Care: the Cost Crisis is Over – But What about Quality?" [[Business Week]], October 21, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have complained that the plans restrict providers’ autonomy and patients’ choice of doctors. On the left, advocates of a [[Health care in Canada|Canadian style government health plan]] have argued that the Managed Competition approach enriches the insurance industry at patient and taxpayer expense and relies naively on free market forces.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Eckholm, "On ‘Managed Competition’: Primer on Health-Care Idea," [[The New York Times]], May 1, 1993, provides a discussion over managed competition, including critiques from both the left and right.&lt;/ref&gt; Many proponents of the managed competition approach, including Ellwood, argue that regulations built into the legislation have undermined the market competition that was meant to enable patients and providers to choose among plans based on quality and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=[[Paul Starr|Starr, Paul]] |date=Winter 1976 |title=The Undelivered Health System |journal=[[The Public Interest]] |issue=42 |url=http://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/the-undelivered-health-system |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3710412"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ellwood Jr |first1=P. M. |last2=Paul |first2=B.

"What went wrong?" he reflected in 2011. "Political expediency in the initial plan designed to promote HMO growth led to the inclusion of three mistakes: for-profit plans, independent practice associations, and the failure to include outcome accountability."&lt;ref&gt;American Hospital Association interview, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellwood was particularly adamant about the last.  Without measures of health outcomes, which he had advocated from the beginning, there was no way to really know how the changes in health care organization were affecting patients. More important, there was no way to ensure that patients and providers were making good decisions. And there was no way to hold health providers accountable, to ensure that they were not reducing costs in ways that hurt patients.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the debates over HMOs and the evolution of Ellwood’s thinking, see [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/magazine/but-what-about-quality.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm Lisa Belkin, "But What About Quality?"] [[The New York Times Magazine]], December 8, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes management==
Ellwood’s concern about the importance of measuring health outcomes that would hold health providers accountable for quality dated to the mid-1960s. In 1968, as an adviser to the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] administration, he devised the plans for the establishment of U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ). He would become increasingly vocal about the need for evidence-based medicine and outcomes accountability.

In 1988, he was invited by the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]], which publishes the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], to deliver their annual Shattuck Lecture. He called for "a national data base containing information and analysis on clinical, financial, and health outcomes that estimates as best we can the relation between medical interventions and health outcomes, as well as the relation between health outcomes and money."&lt;ref name="pmid3367968"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ellwood |first1=P. M. |title=Outcomes Management (Presented as the 99th Shattuck Lecture to the Annual Meeting of the Massachusetts Medical Society on May 21, 1988.) |doi=10.1056/NEJM198806093182329 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=318 |issue=23 |pages=1549–1556 |year=1988 |pmid=3367968 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He envisioned a sort of health plan "report card" that would allow patients to make informed choices among health plans based on health outcomes for specific conditions and patients’ reports of their satisfaction.  He argues that there is extraordinary variation in the quality-performance of different doctors and health institutions, yet patients, insurers, policymakers and even other doctors have few tools for assessing quality. Similarly, doctors and patients often choose medical interventions with only limited information about the effectiveness of various treatments and how they impact patients’ quality of life; a health outcomes data base would vastly improve the information available when making such decisions. Finally, a health outcomes data-base would guide policymakers and large providers in the overall design of health systems. The [[Mayo Clinic]] and some health providers have begun to experiment with outcomes management.&lt;ref name="pmid7988991"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Steinwachs |first1=D. M. |last2=Wu |first2=A.

==Family==
Ellwood and his former wife, Elizabeth Ann Schwenk,&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; have three children: Deborah Ellwood, who directs a national consortium of community foundations; Cynthia Ellwood, a regional superintendent in the [[Milwaukee Public Schools|Milwaukee school system]]; and [[David T. Ellwood|David Ellwood]], Dean of the [[Kennedy School]] at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/magazine/but-what-about-quality.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=But What About Quality? |last=Belkin |first=Lisa |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 December 1996 |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 1996, The [[New York Times Magazine]] ran back-to-back stories about Paul Ellwood and David Ellwood under the cover banner, "What Have the Ellwoods Done to America?" &amp;ndash; a reference to Paul Ellwood’s role in reshaping American health care and his son’s role in reshaping the [[Social programs in the United States|American welfare system]].&lt;ref&gt;The cover subheading read, "The visionary father transformed the American way of health.  The visionary son redefined the American way of welfare.  Now both are struggling to rescue their reforms."  Lisa Belkin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/magazine/but-what-about-quality.html But What About Quality?]" (on Paul Ellwood), and Jason DeParle, "Mugged by Reality" (on David Ellwood), [[The New York Times Magazine]], December 8, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Paul Ellwood married Barbara Winch, a former academic health science center executive.  They now reside in Bellingham, WA.

'''Piss On Pity''' is a [[political slogan|rallying cry]] for those in the [[inclusion (disability rights)|disability-inclusive]] circles of world politics. According to its proponents, the implication of the slogan is that [[pity]], while seeming to be a positive, helpful emotion, actually is derogatory. According to them, it is based in conscious or unconscious aversion to disabled people and the [[ableism]] that that aversion consciously or unconsciously represents.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Activists using the slogan will often explain that their ultimate goal in a [[militant (word)|militant]], [[wikt:provoke|provocative]] slogan of this type is to get across the message that, like [[anti-racism]] and anti-[[sexism]], they want to purge [[pity]] from worldwide social discourse on disability, at both the governmental and cultural levels, and instead foster [[Inclusion (disability rights)|disability-inclusive practices]] and equal [[power politics]].

Rarely, pre-eclampsia may begin in the [[postpartum|period after delivery]].&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; While historically both high blood pressure and protein in the urine were required to make the diagnosis, some definitions also include those with hypertension and any associated organ dysfunction.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=G|last2=Brichant|first2=JF|last3=Hartstein|first3=G|last4=Bonhomme|first4=V|last5=Dewandre|first5=PY|title=Preeclampsia: an update.|journal=Acta Anaesthesiologica Belgica|date=2014|volume=65|issue=4|pages=137–49|pmid=25622379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood pressure is defined as high when it is greater than 140&amp;nbsp;mmHg [[systolic blood pressure|systolic]] or 90&amp;nbsp;mmHg [[diastolic blood pressure|diastolic]] at two separate times, more than four hours apart in a woman after twenty weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; Pre-eclampsia is routinely screened for during [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=USPSTF2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=US Preventive Services Task|first1=Force.|last2=Bibbins-Domingo|first2=K|last3=Grossman|first3=DC|last4=Curry|first4=SJ|last5=Barry|first5=MJ|last6=Davidson|first6=KW|last7=Doubeni|first7=CA|last8=Epling JW|first8=Jr|last9=Kemper|first9=AR|last10=Krist|first10=AH|last11=Kurth|first11=AE|last12=Landefeld|first12=CS|last13=Mangione|first13=CM|last14=Phillips|first14=WR|last15=Phipps|first15=MG|last16=Silverstein|first16=M|last17=Simon|first17=MA|last18=Tseng|first18=CW|title=Screening for Preeclampsia: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.|journal=JAMA|date=25 April 2017|volume=317|issue=16|pages=1661–1667|pmid=28444286|doi=10.1001/jama.2017.3439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Edema|Swelling]] (especially in the hands and face) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. However, because swelling is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.

In general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.

==Causes==
There is no definitive known cause of pre-eclampsia, though it is likely related to a number of factors. Some of these factors include:&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; 
* Abnormal [[placentation]] (formation and development of the placenta) 
* Immunologic factors
* Prior or existing maternal pathology—pre-eclampsia is seen more at a higher incidence in individuals with pre-existing [[hypertension]], obesity, [[antiphospholipid antibody syndrome]], and those with history of pre-eclampsia
* Dietary factors, e.g. calcium supplementation in areas where dietary calcium intake is low has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; 
* Environmental factors, e.g. air pollution&lt;ref name=EHP&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jun Wu |author2=Cizao Ren |author3=Ralph J. Delfino |author4=Judith Chung |author5=Michelle Wilhelm |author6=Beate Ritz |title=Association Between Local Traffic-Generated Air Pollution and Pre-eclampsia and Preterm Delivery in the South Coast Air Basin of California |publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719065531/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2009/0800334/0800334.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those with long term [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] have a risk 7 to 8 times higher than those without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bramham|first=K|author2=Parnell, B |author3=Nelson-Piercy, C |author4=Seed, PT |author5=Poston, L |author6= Chappell, LC |title=Chronic hypertension and pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=Apr 15, 2014|volume=348|page=g2301|pmid=24735917 |pmc=3988319 |doi=10.1136/bmj.g2301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiologically, research has linked pre-eclampsia to the following physiologic changes: alterations in the interaction between the maternal immune response and the placenta, placental injury, [[endothelial]] cell injury, altered vascular reactivity, oxidative stress, imbalance among [[vasoactive]] substances, decreased intravascular volume, and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]].&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mustafa|first=Reem|author2=Ahmed, Sana |author3=Gupta, Anu |author4= Venuto, Rocco C. |title=A Comprehensive Review of Hypertension in Pregnancy|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|year=2012|volume=2012|pages=1–19|doi=10.1155/2012/105918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact cause of pre-eclampsia remains unclear, there is strong evidence that a major cause predisposing a susceptible woman to pre-eclampsia is an abnormally implanted placenta.&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; This abnormally implanted placenta may result in poor uterine and placental perfusion, yielding a state of hypoxia and increased oxidative stress and the release of anti-angiogenic proteins along with inflammatory mediators into the maternal plasma.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; A major consequence of this sequence of events is generalized [[endothelial]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt; The abnormal implantation may stem from the maternal [[immune system]]'s response to the placenta, specifically a lack of established [[immunological tolerance in pregnancy]]. Endothelial dysfunction results in hypertension and many of the other symptoms and complications associated with pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt; Those with pre-eclampsia may have a lower risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Innes, KE|author2=Byers, TE|year=1999|title=Preeclampsia and breast cancer risk|journal=Epidemiology|pages=722–32|jstor=3703514|pmid=10535787|volume=10|doi=10.1097/00001648-199911000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Placental abnormalities such as placental ischemia.

==Pathogenesis==
Although much research into mechanism of pre-eclampsia has taken place, its exact pathogenesis remains uncertain. Pre-eclampsia is thought to result from an abnormal placenta, the removal of which ends the disease in most cases.&lt;ref name=Al2014 /&gt; During normal pregnancy, the placenta vascularizes to allow for the exchange of water, gases, and solutes, including nutrients and wastes, between maternal and fetal circulations.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; Abnormal development of the placenta leads to poor placental perfusion. The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DrifeMagowan&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Drife | first1 = James O. | last2 = Magowan | first2 = Brian. | title = Clinical obstetrics and gynecology | year = 2004 | publisher = Saunders | location = Edinburgh, New York | isbn = 0-7020-1775-2 | pages = 367–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of [[angiogenic]] and [[anti-angiogenic]] factors.&lt;ref name=Al2014 /&gt; Both circulating and placental levels of [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt; sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Soluble [[endoglin]] (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19" /&gt;

Both sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.

Oxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]] (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McMaster-Fay RA | title = Pre-eclampsia: a disease of oxidative stress resulting from the catabolism of DNA (primarily fetal) to uric acid by xanthine oxidase in the maternal liver; a hypothesis. | journal = Bioscience Hypotheses | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | pages = 35–43 | doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[T helper cell|Th&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; responses]] and the production of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-γ]]. The origin of IFN-γ is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Laresgoiti-Servitje E, Gómez-López N, Olson DM | title = An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia | journal = Hum Reprod Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 510–24 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20388637 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq007 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.&lt;ref name="Laresgoiti-Servitje" /&gt; It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[Nucleated red blood cell|erythroblasts]] as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia. These findings have given rise to the hypothesis that pre-eclampsia is a disease process by which a placental lesion such as hypoxia allows increased fetal material into the maternal circulation, that in turn leads to an [[immune response]] and endothelial damage, and that ultimately results in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

One hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the maternal-fetal conflict between the maternal organism and fetus.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redman CW, Sargent IL | title = Latest Advances in Understanding Preeclampsia | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728 | pages = 1592–94 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15947178 | pmc = | doi = 10.1126/science.1111726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first trimester trophoblasts enter the spiral arteries of the mother to alter the spiral arteries and thereby gain more access to maternal nutrients.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; Occasionally there is impaired trophoblast invasion that results in inadequate alterations to the uterine spiral arteries.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; It is hypothesized that the developing embryo releases biochemical signals that result in the woman developing hypertension and pre-eclampsia so that the fetus can benefit from a greater amount of maternal circulation of nutrients due to increased blood flow to the impaired placenta.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt; This results in a conflict between maternal and fetal fitness and survival because the fetus is invested in only its survival and fitness while the mother is invested in this and subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Redman2005"/&gt;

Another evolutionary hypothesis for vulnerability to pre-eclampsia is the idea of ensuring pair-bonding between the mother and father and paternal investment in the fetus.&lt;ref name="Davis2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gallup | first2 = G. G.

In normal early embryonic development, the outer epithelial layer contains cytotrophoblast cells, a stem cell type found in the trophoblast that later differentiates into the fetal placenta. These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells. Extravillous trophoblast cells are an invasive cell type which remodel the maternal spiral arteries by replacing the maternal epithelium and smooth muscle lining the spiral arteries causing artery dilation. This prevents maternal vasoconstriction in the spiral arteries and allows for continued blood and nutrient supply to the growing fetus with low resistance and high blood flow.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt;

In pre-eclampsia, abnormal expression of chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) in placental cell lines reduces extravillus trophoblast migration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xie L. |author2=Mouillet J.-F. |author3=Cu T. |author4=Parks W.

Testing for pre-eclampsia is recommended throughout [[pregnancy]] via measuring a woman's blood pressure.&lt;ref name=USPSTF2017/&gt;

===Diagnostic criteria===
Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant woman develops:&lt;ref name="Harrison's"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Longo | first1 = Dan L. (Dan Louis) | title = Harrison's principles of internal medicine | year = 2012 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6 | pages = 55–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood pressure ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90 mmHg diastolic on two separate readings taken at least four to six hours apart after 20 weeks' gestation in an individual with previously normal blood pressure.
* In a woman with essential hypertension beginning before 20 weeks' gestational age, the diagnostic criteria are: an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥30 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥15 mmHg.
* [[Proteinuria]] ≥ {{convert|0.3|g|mg}} or more of protein in a 24-hour urine sample or a SPOT urinary protein to creatinine ratio ≥0.3 or a urine dipstick reading of 1+ or greater (dipstick reading should only be used if other quantitative methods are not available).&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;

Suspicion for pre-eclampsia should be maintained in any pregnancy complicated by elevated blood pressure, even in the absence of proteinuria. Ten percent of individuals with other signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia and 20% of individuals diagnosed with eclampsia show no evidence of proteinuria.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; In the absence of proteinuria, the presence of new-onset [[hypertension]] (elevated blood pressure) and the new onset of one or more of the following is suggestive of the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia:&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; 
* Evidence of kidney dysfunction ([[oliguria]], elevated [[creatinine]] levels)
* Impaired liver function (noted by [[liver function tests]])
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] (platelet count &lt;100,000/microliter)
* [[Pulmonary edema]]
*[[Peripheral edema|Ankle edema]] (pitting type)
* Cerebral or visual disturbances

Pre-eclampsia is a progressive disorder and these signs of organ dysfunction are indicative of severe pre-eclampsia. A systolic blood pressure ≥160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 and/or proteinuria &gt;5g in a 24-hour period is also indicative of severe pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Clinically, individuals with severe pre-eclampsia may also present [[Epigastrium|epigastric]]/right upper quadrant abdominal pain, headaches, and vomiting.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Severe pre-eclampsia is a significant risk factor for intrauterine fetal death.

A rise in baseline blood pressure (BP) of 30 [[Millimeter of mercury|mmHg]] systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic, while not meeting the absolute criteria of 140/90, is important to note but is not considered diagnostic.

===Predictive tests===
There have been many assessments of tests aimed at predicting pre-eclampsia, though no single biomarker is likely to be sufficiently predictive of the disorder.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Predictive tests that have been assessed include those related to placental perfusion, vascular resistance, kidney dysfunction, [[endothelial]] dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Examples of notable tests include:
* Doppler [[ultrasonography]] of the uterine arteries to investigate for signs of inadequate placental perfusion. This test has a high negative predictive value among those individuals with a history of prior pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;
* Elevations in serum uric acid ([[hyperuricemia]]) is used by some to "define" pre-eclampsia,&lt;ref name="al. 2010"/&gt; though it has been found to be a poor predictor of the disorder.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Elevated levels in the blood ([[hyperuricemia]]) are likely due to reduced uric acid clearance secondary to impaired kidney function.
* [[Angiogenic]] proteins such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF) and anti-angiogenic proteins such as [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) have shown promise for potential clinical use in diagnosing pre-eclampsia, though evidence is sufficient to recommend a clinical use for these markers.&lt;ref name="al. 2010"/&gt;
* Recent studies have shown that looking for [[podocyte]]s (specialized cells of the kidney) in the urine has the potential to aid in the prediction of pre-eclampsia. Studies have demonstrated that finding podocytes in the urine may serve as an early marker of and diagnostic test for pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craici|first=IM |author2=Wagner, SJ |author3=Bailey, KR |author4=Fitz-Gibbon, PD |author5=Wood-Wentz, CM |author6=Turner, ST |author7=Hayman, SR |author8=White, WM |author9=Brost, BC |author10=Rose, CH |author11=Grande, JP |author12=Garovic, VD|title=Podocyturia predates proteinuria and clinical features of preeclampsia: longitudinal prospective study.|journal=Hypertension|date=Jun 2013|volume=61|issue=6|pages=1289–96|pmid=23529165|doi=10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.113.01115|pmc=3713793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News - Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|title=BBC News – Pre-eclampsia predicted using test during pregnancy|work=|accessdate=2011-11-22|date=2011-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118120704/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15694021|archivedate=2011-11-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416082731/http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:21656283 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title=Mechanisms and Management of Hypertension in Pregnant Women. |work= |accessdate=2011-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==

Pre-eclampsia can mimic and be confused with many other diseases, including chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, primary seizure disorders, gallbladder and [[pancreatic disease]], immune or [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[antiphospholipid syndrome]] and [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]]. It must be considered a possibility in any pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks of gestation. It is particularly difficult to diagnose when pre-existing conditions such as [[hypertension]] are present.&lt;ref name=AMN1&gt;{{cite web | title =Pre-eclampsia-Eclampsia | publisher=Armenian Medical Network | work =Diagnosis and management of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia | url=http://www.health.am/gyneco/more/pre-eclampsia_eclampsia/ | year = 2003 | accessdate=2005-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women with [[acute fatty liver of pregnancy]] may also present with elevated blood pressure and protein in the urine, but differ by the extent of liver damage. Other disorders that can cause high blood pressure include [[Hyperthyroidism|thyrotoxicosis]], [[pheochromocytoma]], and [[Substance abuse|drug misuse]].&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

==Prevention==
Preventive measures against pre-eclampsia have been heavily studied. Because the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is not completely understood, prevention remains a complex issue. Below are some of the currently accepted recommendations.

===Diet===
Supplementation with a balanced protein and energy diet does not appear to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ota|first1=E|last2=Hori|first2=H|last3=Mori|first3=R|last4=Tobe-Gai|first4=R|last5=Farrar|first5=D|title=Antenatal dietary education and supplementation to increase energy and protein intake.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2 June 2015|issue=6|pages=CD000032|pmid=26031211|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there is no evidence that changing [[salt]] intake has an effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duley L, Henderson-Smart D, Meher S | title = Altered dietary salt for preventing pre-eclampsia, and its complications. | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | page = CD005548 | date =October 19, 2005 | pmid = 16235411 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplementation with [[antioxidant]]s such as vitamin C, D and E has no effect on pre-eclampsia incidence;&lt;ref name="NEJM2006-Rumbold"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold AR, Crowther CA, Haslam RR, Dekker GA, Robinson JS | title = Vitamins C and E and the risks of pre-eclampsia and perinatal complications | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 354 | issue = 17 | pages = 1796–806 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16641396 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa054186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=WHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.|date=2011|isbn=978-92-4-154833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, supplementation with vitamins C, E, and D is not recommended for reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Calcium]] supplementation of at least 1 gram per day is recommended during pregnancy as it prevents pre-eclampsia where dietary calcium intake is low, especially for those at high risk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=GJ|last2=Lawrie|first2=TA|last3=Atallah|first3=AN|last4=Duley|first4=L|last5=Torloni|first5=MR|title=Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing hypertensive disorders and related problems.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jun 24, 2014|volume=6|pages=CD001059|pmid=24960615|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30277579|date = December 2018}} Low [[selenium]] status is associated with higher incidence of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name="pmid14634566"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rayman MP, Bode P, Redman CW | title = Low selenium status is associated with the occurrence of the pregnancy disease pre-eclampsia in women from the United Kingdom | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 189 | issue = 5 | pages = 1343–49 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14634566 | doi = 10.1067/S0002-9378(03)00723-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aspirin===
Taking [[aspirin]] is associated with a 1 to 5% reduction in pre-eclampsia and a 1 to 5% reduction in premature births in women at high risk.&lt;ref name=Hend2014/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17443552"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duley L, Henderson-Smart DJ, Meher S, King JF | title = Antiplatelet agents for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD004659 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17443552 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004659.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends low-dose aspirin for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women at high risk and recommends it be started before 20 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends a low-dose regimen for women at high risk beginning in the 12th week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaspg.htm |title=Low-Dose Aspirin Use for the Prevention of Morbidity and Mortality From Preeclampsia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=Sep 2014 |website= |publisher=United States Preventive Services Task Force |accessdate=17 Sep 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917203610/http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaspg.htm |archivedate=2014-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are less if started after 16 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberge|first1=S|last2=Nicolaides|first2=K|last3=Demers|first3=S|last4=Hyett|first4=J|last5=Chaillet|first5=N|last6=Bujold|first6=E|title=The role of aspirin dose on the prevention of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction: systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=February 2017|volume=216|issue=2|pages=110–120.e6|pmid=27640943|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2016.09.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical activity===
There is insufficient evidence to recommend either exercise&lt;ref name="Cochrane2006-Meher-exercise"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meher S, Duley L | title = Exercise or other physical activity for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD005942 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16625645 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005942 | editor1-last = Meher | editor1-first = Shireen }}&lt;/ref&gt; or strict bedrest&lt;ref name="Cochrane2006-Meher-rest"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meher S, Duley L | title = Rest during pregnancy for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications in women with normal blood pressure | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = CD005939 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16625644 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005939 | editor1-last = Meher | editor1-first = Shireen }}&lt;/ref&gt; as preventive measures of pre-eclampsia.

===Smoking cessation===
In low-risk pregnancies, the association between cigarette [[smoking]] and a reduced risk of pre-eclampsia has been consistent and reproducible across epidemiologic studies. High-risk pregnancies (those with pregestational diabetes, chronic hypertension, history of pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, or multifetal gestation) showed no significant protective effect. The reason for this discrepancy is not definitively known; research supports speculation that the underlying pathology increases the risk of pre-eclampsia to such a degree that any measurable reduction of risk due to smoking is masked.&lt;ref name="pmid18566591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jeyabalan A, Powers RW, Durica AR, Harger GF, Roberts JM, Ness RB | title = Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Angiogenic Factors in Pregnancy and Preeclampsia | journal = Am.

==Treatment==
The definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is the delivery of the baby and placenta. The timing of delivery should balance the desire for optimal outcomes for the baby while reducing risks for the mother.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; The severity of disease and the maturity of the baby are primary considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles R.B. Beckmann ...

Treatment can range from expectant management to expedited delivery by [[Labor induction|induction of labor]] or [[Caesarean section]], in addition to medications. Important in management is the assessment of the mothers organ systems, management of severe hypertension, and prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Separate interventions directed at the baby may also be necessary. Bed rest has not been found to be useful and is thus not routinely recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=CA|last2=Grimes|first2=DA|last3=Lyerly|first3=AD|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=June 2013|volume=121|issue=6|pages=1305–8|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/aog.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood pressure===
The World Health Organization recommends that women with severe [[hypertension]] during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; Evidence does not support the use of one anti-hypertensive over another.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of pre-eclampsia and its complications.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; [[Labetalol]], [[Hydralazine]] and [[Nifedipine]] are commonly used antihypertensive agents for [[Hypertensive disease of pregnancy|hypertension in pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; [[ACE inhibitor]]s and [[Angiotensin II receptor blocker|angiotensin receptor blockers]] are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.&lt;ref name="Harrison's" /&gt;

The goal of treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is to prevent cardiovascular, kidney, and cerebrovascular complications.&lt;ref name=ACOG2013/&gt; The target blood pressure has been proposed to be 140–160 mmHg systolic and 90–105 mmHg diastolic, although values are variable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvog-documenten.nl/uploaded/docs/Hypertensieve%20aandoeningen/Hypertensive_disorders_in_pregnancy%5B1%5D.pdf Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy.

===Prevention of eclampsia===
The intrapartum and postpartum administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended in severe pre-eclampsia for the prevention of [[eclampsia]].&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; Further, magnesium sulfate is recommended for the treatment of eclampsia over other anticonvulsants.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Magnesium sulfate acts by interacting with [[NMDA receptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison's" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Pre-eclampsia affects approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies worldwide,&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Al2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). World health report 2005: make every mother and child count. Geneva: WHO; 2005, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence of pre-eclampsia has risen in the U.S. since the 1990s, possibly as a result of increased prevalence of predisposing disorders, such as chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide.&lt;ref name=Ei2012/&gt; Nearly one-tenth of all maternal deaths in Africa and Asia and one-quarter in Latin America are associated with hypertensive diseases in pregnancy, a category that encompasses pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is much more common in women who are pregnant for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins and Cotran, ''Pathological Basis of Disease, 7th ed.''&lt;/ref&gt; Women who have previously been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Pre-eclampsia is also more common in women who have pre-existing [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]], [[autoimmune]] diseases such as [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]], various inherited thrombophilias such as [[Factor V Leiden]], [[chronic renal failure|renal disease]], multiple gestation ([[twin]]s or [[multiple birth]]), and advanced maternal age.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt; Women who live at high altitude are also more likely to experience pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v54/n1/full/pr2003356a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206095253/http://www.nature.com/pr/journal/v54/n1/full/pr2003356a.html |archivedate=2017-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=LG|last2=Shriver|first2=M|last3=Bemis|first3=L|last4=Hickler|first4=B|last5=Wilson|first5=M|last6=Brutsaert|first6=T|last7=Parra|first7=E|last8=Vargas|first8=E|title=Maternal adaptation to high-altitude pregnancy: an experiment of nature – a review.|journal=Placenta|date=April 2004|volume=25 Suppl A|pages=S60–71|pmid=15033310|url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Moore%20et%20al.,%202004.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.placenta.2004.01.008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817104315/http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~parraest/profile/PDF%20files/Moore%20et%20al.%2C%202004.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-eclampsia is also more common in some ethnic groups (e.g. African-Americans, Sub-Saharan Africans, Latin Americans, African Caribbeans, and Filipinos).&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Urquia ML, Glazier RH, Gagnon AJ, Mortensen LH, Nybo Andersen AM, Janevic T, Guendelman S, Thornton D, Bolumar F, Río Sánchez I, Small R, Davey MA, Hjern A |title=Disparities in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among immigrant women giving birth in six industrialised countries |journal=BJOG |volume=121 |issue=12 |pages=1492–500 |year=2014 |pmid=24758368 |pmc=4232918 |doi=10.1111/1471-0528.12758 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change of paternity in a subsequent pregnancy has been implicated as affecting risk, except in those with a family history of hypertensive pregnancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hjartardottir S, Leifsson BG, Geirsson RT, Steinthorsdottir V | title = Paternity change and the recurrence risk in familial hypertensive disorder in pregnancy | journal = Hypertension in Pregnancy | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 219–25 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15369654 | doi = 10.1081/PRG-120037889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eclampsia]] is a major complication of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects 0.56 per 1,000 pregnant women in developed countries and almost 10 to 30 times as many women in low-income countries as in developed countries.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

==Complications==
Complications of pre-eclampsia can affect both the mother and the fetus. Acutely, pre-eclampsia can be complicated by [[eclampsia]], the development of [[HELLP syndrome]], hemorrhagic or ischemic [[stroke]], liver damage and dysfunction, [[acute kidney injury]], and [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS).&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;

Pre-eclampsia is also associated with increased frequency of [[Caesarean section]], [[Preterm birth|preterm delivery]], and [[placental abruption]]. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals in the first week postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction and potential fetal or perinatal death.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt;

Long-term, an individual with pre-eclampsia is at increased risk for recurrence of pre-eclampsia in subsequent pregnancies.

===Eclampsia===
[[Eclampsia]] is the development of new [[convulsion]]s in a pre-eclamptic patient that may not be attributed to other cause. It is a sign that the underlying pre-eclamptic condition is severe and is associated with high rates of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name=WHO2011/&gt; Warning symptoms for eclampsia in an individual with current pre-eclampsia may include headaches, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain, with a headache being the most consistent symptom.&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= F. Gary Cunningham, et al. (editors) |title=Williams Obstetrics|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0071497015|edition=23rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Magnesium sulfate]] is used to prevent convulsions in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.

===HELLP Syndrome===
[[HELLP syndrome]] is defined as [[hemolysis]] (microangiopathic), elevated liver enzymes (liver dysfunction), and low platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]). This condition may occur in 10–20% of patients with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia&lt;ref name=Lancet2010/&gt; and is associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In 50% of instances, HELLP syndrome develops preterm, while 20% of cases develop in late gestation and 30% during the post-partum period.&lt;ref name=Aru2013/&gt;

===Long term===
There is also an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, including hypertension and ischemic heart disease, and kidney disease.&lt;ref name="Mustafa 2012 1–19"/&gt; Other risks include [[stroke]] and [[Venous thrombosis|venous thromboembolism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellamy L, Casas JP, Hingorani AD, Williams DJ |title=Pre-eclampsia and risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in later life: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7627 |page=974 |year=2007 |pmid=17975258 |pmc=2072042 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39335.385301.BE |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McDonald SD, Malinowski A, Zhou Q, Yusuf S, Devereaux PJ |title=Cardiovascular sequelae of preeclampsia/eclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analyses |journal=Am.

Lowered blood supply to the fetus in pre-eclampsia causes lowered nutrient supply, which could result in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Chen D., Wang W. 2013 1–11"/&gt; The fetal origins hypothesis states that fetal undernutrition is linked with coronary heart disease later in adult life due to disproportionate growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barker D. P. J. | year = 1995 | title = Fetal origins of coronary heart disease | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 311 | issue = | pages = 171–74 | doi=10.1136/bmj.311.6998.171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because pre-eclampsia leads to a mismatch between the maternal energy supply and fetal energy demands, pre-eclampsia can lead to IUGR in the developing fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sharma D. |author2=Shastri S. |author3=Sharma P. | year = 2016 | title = Intrauterine Growth Restriction: Antenatal and Postnatal Aspects | url = | journal = Clinical Medicine Insights: Pediatrics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 67–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants suffering from IUGR are prone to suffer from poor neuronal development and in increased risk for adult disease according to the Barker hypothesis. Associated adult diseases of the fetus due to IUGR include, but are not limited to, coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cancer, osteoporosis, and various psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Calkins K., Devaskar S. U. | year = 2011 | title = Fetal origins of adult disease | url = | journal = Current Problems in Pediatric &amp; Adolescent Health Care | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 158–76 | doi=10.1016/j.cppeds.2011.01.001| pmc = 4608552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of pre-eclampsia and development of placental dysfunction has also been shown to be recurrent cross-generationally on the maternal side and most likely on the paternal side. Fetuses born to mothers that were born small for gestational age (SGA) were 50% more likely to develop pre-eclampsia while fetuses born to both SGA parents were three-fold more likely to develop pre-eclampsia in future pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wikström A. K. |author2=Svensson T. |author3=Kieler H. |author4=Cnattingius S. | year = 2011 | title = Recurrence of placental dysfunction disorders across generations | url = | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 205 | issue = 5| page = 454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word eclampsia is from the Greek term for [[lightning]].&lt;ref name=Em2006/&gt; The first known description of the condition was by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=Em2006/&gt;

An outdated medical term for pre-eclampsia is [[wikt:toxemia|toxemia]] of pregnancy, a term that originated in the mistaken belief that the condition was caused by [[toxins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328201744/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/601156/toxemia-of-pregnancy |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{anchor|paternal tolerance}} 
Some studies have suggested the importance of a woman's [[Immune tolerance|immunological tolerance]] to her baby's father, as the baby and father share genetics. There is tentative evidence that ongoing exposure either by vaginal or oral sex to the same semen that resulted in the pregnancy decreases the risk of pre-eclampsia.&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson SA, Bromfield JJ, Tremellen KP | title = Seminal 'priming' for protection from pre-eclampsia-a unifying hypothesis | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 253–65 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12896827 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(03)00052-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As one early study described, "although pre-eclampsia is a disease of first pregnancies, the protective effect of multiparity is lost with change of partner".&lt;ref name=Dekk9618714&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dekker GA, Robillard PY, Hulsey TC | title = Immune maladaptation in the etiology of pre-eclampsia: a review of corroborative epidemiologic studies | journal = Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 377–82 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9618714 | doi = 10.1097/00006254-199806000-00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also concluded that although women with changing partners are strongly advised to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted diseases, "a certain period of sperm exposure within a stable relation, when pregnancy is aimed for, is associated with protection against pre-eclampsia".&lt;ref name="Dekk9618714"/&gt;

Several other studies have since investigated the decreased incidence of pre-eclampsia in women who had received blood transfusions from their partner, those with long preceding histories of sex without barrier contraceptives, and in women who had been regularly performing [[oral sex]].&lt;ref name=Elizabeth_Bonney&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bonney EA | title = Preeclampsia: A view through the danger model | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 76 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 68–74 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17482268 | pmc = 2246056 | doi = 10.1016/j.jri.2007.03.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having already noted the importance of a woman's immunological tolerance to her baby's paternal genes, several Dutch reproductive biologists decided to take their research a step further. Consistent with the fact that human immune systems tolerate things better when they enter the body via the mouth, the Dutch researchers conducted a series of studies that confirmed a surprisingly strong correlation between a diminished incidence of pre-eclampsia and a woman's practice of oral sex, and noted that the protective effects were strongest if she swallowed her partner's semen.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth_Bonney"/&gt;&lt;ref name = mattar_sexual_behavior&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattar R, Soares RV, Daher S | title = Sexual behavior and recurrent spontaneous abortion | journal = International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–55 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15694097 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A team from the [[University of Adelaide]] has also investigated to see if men who have fathered pregnancies which have ended in [[miscarriage]] or pre-eclampsia had low seminal levels of critical immune modulating factors such as [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-beta]]. The team has found that certain men, dubbed "dangerous males", are several times more likely to father pregnancies that would end in either pre-eclampsia or [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="SeminalPriming"/&gt; Among other things, most of the "dangerous males" seemed to lack sufficient levels of the seminal immune factors necessary to induce [[immunological tolerance]] in their partners.&lt;ref name=Dekker_Partner_Role&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dekker G | title = The partner's role in the etiology of pre-eclampsia | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 57 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 203–15 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12385843 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0378(02)00039-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the theory of immune intolerance as a cause of pre-eclampsia has become accepted, women who with repeated pre-eclampsia, miscarriages, or [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] failures could potentially be administered key immune factors such as TGF-beta along with the father's foreign proteins, possibly either orally, as a sublingual spray, or as a vaginal gel to be applied onto the vaginal wall before intercourse.&lt;ref name="SeminalPriming"/&gt;

'''Prenatal dental care''' is the care of the [[Human mouth|oral cavity]] during the time when the [[fetus]] develops inside a woman. The woman’s body is subject to several changes during [[pregnancy]]. Some of these changes occur in the oral cavity; which may cause [[tooth decay]] and [[Periodontal disease|periodontal tissue loss]], that is why dental care is recommended to maintain oral health, hygiene and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12209058 |year=2002 |author1=Mills |first1=L. W |title=Oral health during pregnancy |journal=MCN. The American Journal of Maternal Child Nursing |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=275–80; quiz 281 |last2=Moses |first2=D. T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological changes during pregnancy ==

The increased levels of [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] induce changes in the [[Gums|gum tissue]] and oral cavity; the gum tissues become more prone to irritants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21407157 |year=2011 |author1=Straka |first1=M |title=Pregnancy and periodontal tissues |journal=Neuro Endocrinology Letters |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=34–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flow of blood and permeability of vessels increase in the [[periodontium]], in addition to changes occurring in the [[collagen]] production. Decreased [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] reduces the [[saliva]] [[pH]] values, altering the composition of saliva, and the medium of the oral cavity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12418714 |year=2002 |author1=Laine |first1=M. A |title=Effect of pregnancy on periodontal and dental health |journal=Acta Odontologica Scandinavica |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=257–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dental interventions during pregnancy ==

There have been suggestions that pregnant women should seek dental visits after child birth to avoid any adverse effects on the mother and fetus during the period of pregnancy, but there is no evidence to support this avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shagana |first1=J. A. |first2=R.

== Radiographic exposure ==

Undergoing [[Dental radiography|radiographic xray]] images with the use of a lead apron and a collar do not impose problems to the mother or [[fetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20478796 |year=2010 |author1=Amini |first1=H |title=Prenatal dental care: A review |journal=General Dentistry |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=176–80 |last2=Casimassimo |first2=P.

== Medications &amp; teratogenic potentials ==
The FDA categorized drugs according to their safety with respect to their effects on pregnant populations into 5 categories, from category A to category X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/Labeling/ucm093307.htm|title=Labeling - Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling (Drugs) Final Rule|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258040972|title=Management of Pregnant Patient in Dentistry|last=Kurien|first=Sophia|last2=sk|first2=Drvivekanand|last3=Rani Sriram|first3=Roopa|last4=Krishna Sriram|first4=Sanjay|last5=Rao V K|first5=Prabhakara|last6=Bhupathi|first6=Anitha|last7=Rani Bodduru|first7=Rupa|last8=N Patil|first8=Namrata|date=2013-02-01|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A - The drug has not shown an increased risk of fetal abnormalities when tested on pregnant women.

B -  The drug was used in animal studies but revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate studies to prove this conclusion in pregnant women, or studies have shown an actual adverse effect on animals, but studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus.

C - studies have shown an adverse effect but no studies to determine these effects in pregnant women.

D - The drug causes a risk to the fetus, but the benefits of therapy may outweigh the potential risk.

X - the product is contraindicated because fetal abnormalities were seen.

== Research &amp; evidence ==

There have been suggestions that severe [[Periodontal disease|periodontitis]] and [[Tooth decay|tooth caries]] may increase the risk of having [[preterm birth]] and [[low birth weight]], however, systemic reviews found insufficient evidence to determine if [[periodontitis]] or [[tooth decay]] can develop adverse birth outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd005297 |title=Treating periodontal disease for preventing preterm birth in pregnant women |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2005 |last1=Crowther |first1=Caroline A |last2=Thomas |first2=Natalie |last3=Middleton |first3=Philippa |last4=Chua |first4=Mei-Chien |last5=Esposito |first5=Marco }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018556 |pmid=29500202 |pmc=5855295 |title=Dental caries and preterm birth: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ Open |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e018556 |year=2018 |last1=Wagle |first1=Madhu |last2=d'Antonio |first2=Francesco |last3=Reierth |first3=Eirik |last4=Basnet |first4=Purusotam |last5=Trovik |first5=Tordis A |last6=Orsini |first6=Giovanna |last7=Manzoli |first7=Lamberto |last8=Acharya |first8=Ganesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Eugene Nisbett''' (born 1941)&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/gnd/143090755/about/html Deutsche Nationalbibliothek "Nisbett, Richard E."]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American social psychologist and writer. He is the Theodore M. Newcomb Distinguished Professor of [[social psychology]] and co-director of the Culture and Cognition program at the [[University of Michigan]] at [[Ann Arbor]]. Nisbett's research interests are in social cognition, culture, social class, and aging. He received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]], where his advisor was [[Stanley Schachter]], whose other students at that time included [[Lee Ross]] and [[Judith Rodin]].

Perhaps his most influential publication is "Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes" (with [[Timothy Wilson|T. D. Wilson]], 1977, ''Psychological Review'', 84, 231–259), one of the most often cited psychology articles published in the seventies {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}. This article was the first comprehensive, empirically based argument that a variety of mental processes responsible for preferences, choices, and emotions are inaccessible to conscious awareness. Nisbett and Wilson contended that introspective reports can provide only an account of "what people think about how they think," but not "how they really think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbett |first1=Richard E. |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes. |journal=Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=3 |year=1977 |pages=231–59 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.84.3.231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some cognitive psychologists disputed this claim, with [[K. Anders Ericsson|Ericsson]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]] (1980) offering an alternative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ericsson |first1=K. Anders |last2=Simon |first2=Herbert A. |title=Verbal reports as data |journal=Psychological Review |volume=87 |issue=3 |year=1980 |pages=215–51 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.87.3.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nisbett's  book ''[[The Geography of Thought| The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently... And Why]]'' (Free Press; 2003) contends that "human cognition is not everywhere the same," that Asians and Westerners "have maintained very different systems of thought for thousands of years,"&lt;ref&gt;Nisbett 2003, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; and that these differences are scientifically measurable.
Nisbett's book ''[[Intelligence and How to Get It: Why Schools and Cultures Count]]'' (2009) argues that environmental factors dominate genetic factors in determining intelligence. The book reviewed extensive favorable attention in the press and from some fellow academics;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/books/review/Holt-t.html{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, University of Pennsylvania psychologist [[Daniel Osherson]] wrote that the book was a "hugely important analysis of the determinants of IQ".  On the other hand, more critical reviewers argued that the book failed to grapple with the strongest evidence for genetic factors in individual and group intelligence differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=James J. |title=Review of intelligence and how to get it: Why schools and cultures count, R.E. Nisbett, Norton, New York, NY |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |volume=48 |issue=2 |year=2010 |pages=247–55 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Edward E. Jones]], he named the [[actor–observer bias]], the phenomenon where people acting and people observing use different explanations for why a behavior occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Actor-observer difference  |encyclopedia=Oxford Reference |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095349125 |language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important concept in [[attribution theory]], and refers to the tendency to attribute one's own behaviour to situational factors, other people's behaviour to their disposition. Jones and Nisbett's own explanation for this was that our attention is focussed on the situation when we are actors, but on the person when we are observers, although other explanations have been advanced for the actor-observer bias. 

==In popular culture==
In an interview with the New York Times, [[Malcolm Gladwell]] said, "The most influential thinker, in my life, has been the psychologist Richard Nisbett. He basically gave me my view of the world."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/books/review/malcolm-gladwell-by-the-book.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ramblers''', formally known as '''The Ramblers' Association''', is the largest [[walking|walkers']] rights organisation in [[Great Britain]], and aims to represent the interests of walkers (or ''ramblers''). It is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] registered in [[England and Wales]] and in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="annualreport2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Resources/Ramblers%20Association/Website/Volunteering/Documents/Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202008-09web.pdf |title=Ramblers Annual Report and Accounts 2008-09 |work=Rambler's Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609212241/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Resources/Ramblers%20Association/Website/Volunteering/Documents/Annual%20Report%20and%20Accounts%202008-09web.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with around 123,000 members.&lt;ref name="annualreport2009" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:North Flank Kinder Scout.JPG|left|300px|thumb|North flank of [[Kinder Scout]]]]

In 1931, the National Council of Ramblers' Federations was formed because walkers felt that a national body to represent their interests was needed.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/aboutus/history |title=About Us: Our history |work=The Ramblers |accessdate=3 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104011851/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/aboutus/history |archivedate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 1932, the [[Communist]]-inspired [[British Workers' Sports Federation]], frustrated at the lack of resolve of the newly formed Ramblers, staged a [[mass trespass of Kinder Scout|mass trespass]] of [[Kinder Scout]], the highest point in the [[Peak District]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; During the mass trespass, the protesters present scuffled with the Duke of Devonshire's gamekeepers and five ramblers were arrested. The National Council of Ramblers' Federations did not endorse the tactics of the trespassers.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

This mass trespass is often seen as the pivotal turning point in the history of the Ramblers. In 1934 the Council decided to change its name, leading to the official founding of the Ramblers' Association on 1 January 1935.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; On 21 and 22 April 2007, the Ramblers celebrated the 75th anniversary of the illegal trespass of Kinder Scout and the imprisonment of those who participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Celebrating+75+Years+at+the+Heart+of+Walking |title=Celebrating 75 Years at the Heart of Walking |work=Ramblers |accessdate=25 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305014149/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Celebrating+75+Years+at+the+Heart+of+Walking |archivedate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 March 1946 the Ramblers' Association incorporated Ramblers' Association Services Limited, this was intended to operate as the commercial wing of the Ramblers' Association; specifically, to manage sales, to provide office services, establish guest houses and to organise walking tours for members at home and abroad. Ramblers' Association Services Ltd eventually became a separate entity from the Ramblers' Association, eventually becoming [[RWH Travel Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Bertie |date=1992 |title=The Story of Ramblers' Association |location=Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire |publisher=Ramblers' Association Services Ltd |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1948 onwards its secretary was [[Tom Stephenson (activist)|Tom Stephenson]], who was a leading campaigner for open-country access and for the first British long-distance footpath, the [[Pennine Way]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Labour politician [[Hugh Dalton]], an avid outdoorsman, served a term as president of the Ramblers Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Matthew |last=Hilton |title=A Historical Guide to NGOs in Britain: Charities, Civil Society and the Voluntary Sector since 1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEAIRdj6hgYC&amp;pg=PT187 |year=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |page=187 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dalton was an [[environmentalist]] before the term came into fashion. As Chancellor in 1946 he started the [[National Land Fund]] to resource [[national park]]s, and in 1951 as Minister of Town and Country Planning he approved the [[Pennine Way]], which involved the creation of seventy additional miles of rights of way.

==Rebranding==
[[File:Black Hill (Peak District).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The paved surface of the [[Pennine Way]] on [[Black Hill (Peak District)|Black Hill]]]]
The Ramblers' Association and its members long felt that there was a need for a change of image following on from the last change in 1987. London-based brand agency Spencer du Bois, which specialises in not-for-profit organisations, was commissioned to create and effect the rebranding.

It surveyed all members and received almost 6,000 responses, which revealed that there was a shift taking place within the membership, from elderly, retired, [[middle class]] and predominantly [[Caucasian race|white]] members, walking in the countryside, towards a younger, more [[ethnic]]ally diverse membership for whom walking was an increasingly [[urban area|urban]] activity.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The rebranding targeted this new and evolving [[demographic]].

In 2009, the Ramblers' Association was rebranded as the "Ramblers"; a new logo emerged incorporating a younger, more all-inclusive urban image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Resources/Ramblers%20Association/Website/Volunteering/Documents/QandA.pdf |title=Rebrand Q &amp; A |work=Ramblers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220094308/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Resources/Ramblers%20Association/Website/Volunteering/Documents/QandA.pdf |archivedate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable objectives==
The Ramblers has five main charitable aims as detailed below from the Ramblers Charity Commission summary:

In summary, the aims of the charity are:
#To promote walking
#To safeguard paths
#To increase access for walkers
#To protect the countryside
#To educate the public

==Ethos and core beliefs==
[[File:St Martha Hill.jpg|thumb|the [[Pilgrims' Way]] climbs [[St Martha's Hill]], on the [[North Downs]], [[Surrey]]]]
The Ramblers as a charitable organization, which believes that walking can have a positive impact on people's lives, and that rambling in the countryside is a right and that it benefits the whole of British society. It also argues that Britain's network of public paths is an invaluable part of its national heritage and that the relevant authorities have a duty to invest in them. Since its inception, The Ramblers have campaigned for full rights of responsible access to all of Britain's green spaces, and this helped create the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] (the CRoW Act). While access in Scotland had traditionally been more liberal than in other parts of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] extended these rights so as to make made Scotland, along with the [[Nordic countries]], among the most walking-friendly countries in Europe, with walkers having the right to access virtually all land.

==Structure==
[[File:Ramblers path.jpeg|thumbnail|right|A paved path in the [[Peak District]], near [[Marsden, West Yorkshire]], constructed by the Ramblers]]
There are 550 Ramblers groups in about 50 areas, and around 350 other affiliated bodies, such as societies especially interested in walking and pedestrianism, including the [[Open Spaces Society|Footpath Society]]. Each area sends representatives to an area committee. Once a year a general council is held, whereby representatives from each area meet to discuss the priorities of The Ramblers for the forthcoming year. The trustees that are legally responsible for The Ramblers are also elected at this time.

Ramblers' groups have been formed targeting specific age ranges, in particular people in their 20s and 30s, but more recently also the 40s and 50s, and this has helped in attracting new younger members. Increased emphasis on urban walking has also resulted in a number of specialised groups being formed, including the London Strollers who specialise in short, leisurely urban, walks of under 8 miles (13&amp;nbsp;km). The organisation also hopes that such initiatives will also attract more members from ethnic and other minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/gwkw/partners/gwkwbackground |title=Get Walking Keep Walking Background |work=Ramblers}}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another initiative is The Gay City Strollers, a collaboration between The Ramblers and the Lesbian and Gay Foundation of Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/news/Latest+news/Get+Walking+with+the+Gay+City+Strollers |title=Get Walking with the Gay City Strollers |date=23 April 2010 |work=Ramblers |accessdate=3 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715081833/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/news/Latest+news/Get+Walking+with+the+Gay+City+Strollers |archivedate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Ramblers receives most of its funding via membership and legacy income.

In addition in recent years the Ramblers have won grants from other bodies including the government for running Walking for Health (a scheme to encourage walking for health purposes) jointly with the [[Macmillan Cancer Support]] charity and the Ramblers Holidays Charitable Trust for running Pathwatch.

==Achievements==
[[File:Old Nags Head.jpg|thumb|right|The Old Nags Head, [[Edale]]. The traditional start point of the Pennine Way, as stated on the black sign (bottom left)]]

A long-term goal of the organization was achieved in 2000 with the passing of The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act]], which grants the [[freedom to roam]] in the open countryside in England and Wales.

The Ramblers has also been at the forefront of those campaigning for a consistent scheme of access to the whole coast of England and Wales (under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/NR/exeres/2191FA69-C0AB-4F2A-9FE6-E546437B0068 |title=One Coast For All: Campaign for the English Coastal Path |work=Ramblers |accessdate=3 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054048/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/NR/exeres/2191FA69-C0AB-4F2A-9FE6-E546437B0068 |archivedate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly Ramblers volunteer teams help maintain footpaths across GB.  The work in conjunction with local authorities has been encouraged and promoted by the organization. This has helped the [[Pennine Way]], the [[Pilgrims' Way]], the [[Saxon Shore Way]], [[Offa's Dyke]], [[The Ridgeway]] and many others routes, as well as innumerable shorter paths.

Along with the [[Long Distance Walkers Association]], the Ramblers is recognised by [[Sport England]] as the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for "Rambling" in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/recognised_sports.aspx |title=Which sports do we recognise? |work=Sport England |accessdate=30 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625123229/http://www.sportengland.org/about_us/recognised_sports.aspx |archivedate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present campaigns==

The Ramblers have been successful in securing government funding for the English coastal path in 2012.

The Ramblers also actively monitor the level of funding cuts to highway authorities, as it is believed these will have a significant impact on footpath provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Campaigns+Policy/Campaigns |title=Campaign for National Trails |work=Ramblers |accessdate=3 April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713000654/http://www.ramblers.org.uk/Campaigns+Policy/Campaigns |archivedate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramblers are active in promoting "walking for health" schemes (under its "Get Walking, Keep Walking" initiative).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getwalking.org |title=Get Walking Keep Walking |work=The Ramblers |accessdate=2 December 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206152023/http://www.getwalking.org/ |archivedate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landowners==
[[File:No Right of Way - geograph.org.uk - 798043.jpg|thumb|No right of way sign in [[Dorset]], England]]
Throughout its history, the Ramblers have often been involved with other countryside user groups and landowners.

A notable case involved [[Nicholas Van Hoogstraten]], the millionaire property tycoon, has had a long-standing dislike of and dispute with Ramblers, describing them as "scum of the earth".  In 1999 Hoogstraten erected a large fence across a footpath on his country estate in East Sussex. Local Ramblers staged a protest against the erection of the fence outside the boundary of Hoogstraten's estate. On 10 February 2003 and after a 13-year battle and numerous legal proceedings, the path was finally re-opened.

==How the groups work==
[[File:Mid Devon - Farm Track &amp; Ramblers (geograph 2813007).jpg|thumb|left|Ramblers on a farm track in Devon]]
Locally, walks vary in length: short distances of three to four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km); a medium range of five to six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km), or seven to nine miles (14&amp;nbsp;km); or for the more experienced ramblers, ten to fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km).

Consideration is given to the difficulty of the course and the terrain, whether stiles, steep hills, and busy roads are to be crossed, and the number of members who may be expected to take part.

Ramblers take their turn in volunteering in advance for the list of leaders of the walks. Leaders walk out the designated route in order to reconnoitre it, bearing in mind that certain features of the route may change before the actual day of the walk. Crops in fields growing or harvested, foliage on trees changing, footpaths overgrowing—all will make a difference to what Ramblers will do.

Lunch will normally be taken en route and may consist of a picnic or a lunch taken in a pub that welcomes Ramblers. The walk leader will be familiar with suitable pubs to visit before the walk.

Many members of the Ramblers are not active members of a group however, but are members to support the access and advocacy work of the Association. Similarly, there are many members who are not users of long-distance paths, but are more interested in preserving the diversity of the existing footpath network.

The majority of Ramblers will drive to the walk starting point, but car sharing is encouraged to lessen the environmental impact of car usage.

'''Theresa Rose Bajt''' (born April 5, 1956) is a former Miss Montana, and a clinical psychologist practicing in [[Creve Coeur, Missouri]]. She has also published several papers, and acted in a Dick Clark film of the week.

==Biography==
Theresa Rose Bajt was born on April 5, 1956 to [[Catholicism|Catholic]] parents in Joliet, Illinois.  Her grandparents emigrated from [[Croatia]]. Her father Jack was one of 11 children. He served in the Coast Guard in WWII.  After returning from the war he met Theresa Rose's mother, Sophia Czerkies,  a first generation American daughter of Polish and Russian immigrants.  They were married for over 50 years.

Theresa Rose was the first born of their two children.  Her sister Mary Lynn Bajt-Jaeschke, Ph.D. is a research scientist at the [[University of Kansas School of Medicine]].

Theresa Rose's father worked for Olin Blockson for over 40 years.  Sophia worked as a factory worker to help support the family and financially allow the girls to attend college.  Both parents were dedicated to get their children the education they did not have.  Neither Theresa Rose’s mother nor father had a high school diploma.

Dr. Bajt attended  the [[University of Dayton]] for two years. She then transferred to [[Rocky Mountain College]] in Billings, Montana.  In 1977, while attending school she became [[Miss Montana USA|Miss Montana U.S.A.]]&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Montana USA Past Winners." Atlius Directory. N.p., n.d. Web. 5 Apr. 2011. &lt;www.altiusdirectory.com/Entertainment/miss-montana-usa-past-winners.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  She also was a cheerleader for Rocky Mountain College.

Her experience as Miss Montana was enough to get Theresa Rose hired as a fundraiser for the Montana State Easter Seal Society.  While at a fund raising event the projector broke and Theresa Rose began to ad lib for a half-hour.  A hospital administrator was in the audience and was so impressed he offered her a position in marketing at St. Vincent Hospital in Billings, Montana. During her two years  at the job she started working on her first master's degree. After finishing her master's degree from [[Montana State University]] she was employed as Director of Deferred Prosecution.  She worked with first-time law offenders  who were offered rehabilitation instead of prosecution.  As she counseled the offenders to "Go for their dreams", she motivated herself to try for her own. She then moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting and writing. Eventually, she landed a small role in the Dick Clark film of the week,  ''Reaching for the Stars'', in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;"Reaching for the Stars (1985) (TV) - Full cast and crew." The Internet Movie Database (IMDb). N.p., n.d. Web. 5 Apr. 2011. &lt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0927634/fullcredits#cast&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Theresa Rose decided to go back to school and was accepted at [[Harvard University]] in the master's degree program.  She continued on to receive her Ph.D. degree from the [[University of Maryland]].  While attending the university she met her husband Michael Powell, Ph.D. whom she married September 2, 1989.   Michael Powell is currently a senior vice president with Optum Health.

==Publishings==
While in school at Harvard University Theresa Rose published several papers. The first, When Laws and Values Conflict: A dilemma for Psychologists was co-written with Ken Pope, Ph.D., the paper covers the conflict a psychologist faces with the law running a private practice.  For instance, the dilemma between revealing private information and reporting illegal activities such as child abuse or “potential harm to third parties."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Kenneth , and Theresa Rose Bajt. "When Laws &amp; Values Conflict--A Dilemma for Psychologists." Articles, Research, &amp; Resources in Psychology. N.p., n.d. Web. 5 Apr. 2011. &lt;http://kspope.com/ethics/research8.php&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, she again co-authored a paper with Dr. Pope, entitled Therapist-Patient Sexual Intimacy Involving Children and Adolescents.  This paper studied the phenomenon of therapist-patient sexual intimacy and the degree to which is occurs.  The paper concluded three suggestions.  First, that people in the profession must take account of the fact that children and adolescents are involved in a number of  abuse cases by a prior therapist, and the approaches to individual and group therapy for victims of therapist patient sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;"Therapist-Patient Sex Involving Children &amp; Adolescents." Articles, Research, &amp; Resources in Psychology. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 May 2011. &lt;http://kspope.com/sexiss/research7.php&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bajt's research has been requested internationally and was cited in the New York Times article "When Do a Therapist’s Actions Cross over the Line?"&lt;ref&gt;GOLEMAN, DANIEL. "Health: Psychology; When Do a Therapist's Actions Cross Over the Line? - New York Times." The New York Times - Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 May 2011. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/19/us/health-psychology-when-do-a-therapist-s-actions-cross-over-the-line.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bajt now currently resides with her family in Missouri.  She has a private practice in Creve Coeur.

==Personal life==
Bajt now currently resides with her husband and two children in [[Wildwood, Missouri]]. She practices psychology for Mind Care Associates in Creve Coeur.

==History==
Water treatment was originally established in order to provide safe drinking water. In the 19th century, the water off the city's shores was severely polluted by the dumping of waste from residences and businesses.

==Early Toronto Water Supply==
Before 1842, Toronto's water supply was manually pumped from [[Lake Ontario]], streams and wells.

Water carters would take the water and distribute it to customers across the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/890303--the-digging-begins-on-avenue-rd?bn=1 |title=The digging begins on Avenue Rd. | first = Raveena | last = Aulakh |newspaper = The Star | publisher=Toronto ''Star'' |date= 12 November 2010|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private Water Supply: Toronto/Furniss Water Works==

From 1843 to 1873, water was privately provided by Furniss Works or Toronto Water Works, a subsidiary of [[Toronto Gas Light and Water Company]], which was owned by Montreal businessman [[Albert Furniss]].&lt;ref&gt;The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage, p 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Furniss's death in 1872, the City of Toronto bought out Furniss Works and transformed the water supply to public hands under the '''Toronto Water Works Commission'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2010/11/12/the_digging_begins_on_avenue_rd.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suburban Water==

Outside of the pre-amalgamation City of Toronto each of the former municipalities had their own treatment plants and pumping stations:

* [[North York]]
** Oriole  1923 - ruins of pumping station found near Duncan Mills Road and Don Mills Road&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nyhs.ca/2011MysteryRuinsDMYM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
** Steeles 1930s
** Sheppard West 1940s
* [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] 1921
* New Toronto 1924

Prior to the 1950s, the municipalities were responsible for water treatment and water came from local water sources like wells and streams.

==From Metro Toronto Public Works to Toronto Water==

The current system was introduced in the mid-1950s, with the formation of [[Metro Toronto]] in 1954, and was managed by [[Metro Toronto]]. Following amalgamation in 1998, Toronto Water was created from the [[Toronto Works and Emergency Services]] and once part of [[Metro Toronto Works]] department. Since 1975, Toronto has supplied water to [[York Region]] (mostly to residents in the south end of York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/system/history.htm |title=History: supplying water to Toronto |publisher=City of Toronto |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drinking water operations==

===Treatment===
Water pumped from [[Lake Ontario]] is treated via conventional drinking water treatment processes:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/supply_facilities/rcharris/pdf/water_filtration_process.pdf | title = How is lake water turned into drinking water? | format= PDF | publisher = City of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Pre-Chlorination
#[[Flocculation]] and [[Sedimentation]]
#[[Media filter|Filtration]]
#[[Water chlorination|Chlorination]]
#[[Chloramination]], prior to distribution

The City of Toronto uses four water treatment plants:

* [[R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant|R.C. Harris Treatment Plant]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/supply_facilities/rcharris/about.htm |title=About – R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant |publisher=City of Toronto |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Queen Street East and Victoria Park Ave.
** Capacity of 950 megalitres per day
* Island Treatment Plant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/supply_facilities/island/history.htm |title=About – Island Water Treatment Plant |publisher=City of Toronto |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Located on Centre Island
** Capacity of 410 ML/d
* F. J. Horgan Treatment Plant (formerly Easterly) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/supply_facilities/fjhorgan/history.htm |title=About – F.J. Horgan Water Treatment Plant |publisher=City of Toronto |date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Copperfield Road
** Capacity of 487 ML/d
* R.L. Clark Treatment Plant (formerly Westerly) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/supply_facilities/rlclark/about.htm |title=About – R.L. Clark Water Treatment Plant |publisher=City of Toronto |date=1968-11-22 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** 23rd Street in Etobicoke
** Capacity of 557 ML/d
** Opened in 1968 replacing the New Toronto Filtration Plant (opened 1915 at Lake Shore Boulevard and Seventh Street and which became Lakeshore Pumping Station 1968-2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontohistory.org/Pages_MNO/New_Toronto_Filtration_Plant.html |title=New Toronto Filtration Plant/Lakeshore Pumping Station Historical Plaque |publisher=Toronto's Historical Plaques at Torontohistory.org |date= June 2002|accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
The drinking water distribution system operated by Toronto Water comprises 6 pressure zones and approximately 520&amp;nbsp;km of watermains (greater than 150&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/water/supply/system/distribution.htm |title=The water distribution system |publisher=City of Toronto |date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pumping stations are located across the city to pump water from the filtration plants to residences. They are particularly critical since the city gains in elevation as it moves northwards away from [[Lake Ontario]].
Some pumping stations are located outside the city.

===Storage===
Toronto water stores water in three formats:
* Floating [[Reservoir]]: newer [[Water tower]] or older [[Water tank]] with limited capacity
* Ground level [[Reservoir]]: underground water storage with grass covered top with large capacity
* Temporary storage: stored at a water treatment plant with limited capacity

Water in the city is stored once it is treated, ensuring uninterrupted water supply.

There are 5 water towers located in the city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eureka4you.com/wtower-on-t/ |title=Water Towers and Standpipes in Ontario: T |publisher=Eureka4you.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1 outside the city. They are mainly located in areas that cannot accommodate underground reservoirs due to space restrictions.

==Early life and education==
Schmidt studied at [[RWTH Aachen University]] and [[FernUniversität Hagen]] before working as a teacher specialising in [[Special education|special needs education]] and the rehabilitation of children with [[learning disability|learning difficulties]] and behavioural issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 Ulla Schmidt, Vice-President of the Bundestag] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101194615/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 |date=2014-11-01 }} Deutscher Bundestag.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Early beginnings===
In 1976 Schmidt was a candidate of the [[Maoism|Maoist]] "Kommunistischer Bund Westdeutschland" (KBW) ''([[Communist League of West Germany]])'' for the Federal Assembly of Germany ([[Bundestag]]) in [[Aachen]]. The KBW dissolved completely in 1985.

In 1983, Schmidt changed to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). There she is a member of the local ([[Aachen]]) leadership and of the "[[Seeheimer Kreis]]". She was elected to the German Bundestag in the first elections in reunified Germany on 2 December 1990, representing the Aachen I constituency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 Ulla Schmidt, Vice-President of the Bundestag] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101194615/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 |date=2014-11-01 }} Deutscher Bundestag.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member of the Federal Government===
As deputy leader of the Social Democratic parliamentary group between 1998 and 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 Ulla Schmidt, Vice-President of the Bundestag] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101194615/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 |date=2014-11-01 }} Deutscher Bundestag.&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt first gained respect in Parliament for her strong defense of pension reforms proposed by Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] government in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Cohen]] (January 11, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/11/world/11BERL.html Two Named to New German Agency in Shuffle Over Beef Disease] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the resignation of incumbent [[Andrea Fischer]], who took the blame for the government's chaotic response to the discovery of 10 cases of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]], Schmidt became [[Federal Minister for Health (Germany)|Federal Minister for Health]] under Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Cohen]] (January 11, 2001), [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/11/world/11BERL.html Two Named to New German Agency in Shuffle Over Beef Disease] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the responsibility for social security was added to her portfolio and she was appointed [[Federal Minister for Health and Social Security (Germany)|Federal Minister for Health and Social Security]].

During her tenure as Germany’s long-serving minister of health, Schmidt oversaw major system reforms, balancing social solidarity with fiscal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Tsung-Mei Cheng and Uwe E. Reinhardt, [http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/27/3/w204.full?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;author1=Tsung-Mei+Cheng&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT Shepherding Major Health System Reforms: A Conversation With German Health Minister Ulla Schmidt] ''Health Affairs'', May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2003, Schmidt worked to tighten the regulations allowing welfare benefits to German expatriates. Under the new rules, the only people to receive benefits are Germans who are receiving long-term medical treatment outside the country or who are in foreign jails.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Landler (October 17, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/17/world/a-german-banker-on-welfare-among-miami-s-palms.html A German Banker on Welfare Among Miami's Palms] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Schmidt again became [[Federal Minister for Health (Germany)|Federal Minister for Health]] in the [[grand coalition]] of [[Angela Merkel]]. Social security was reunited with the portfolio of labour, which in 2002 had been added to that of the [[Federal Minister for Economics (Germany)|Federal Minister for Economics]]. By 2006, Schmidt led negotiations for an agreement on changes to Germany’s healthcare financing.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Williamson (June 9, 2006), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/cf60a71e-f7d6-11da-9481-0000779e2340.html Germany on course for health financing reform] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the Social Democrats’ candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], [[Frank Walter Steinmeier]], dropped Schmidt from his campaign team for the [[German federal election, 2009|federal elections]], after she embarrassed the party by taking her official [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] and chauffeur on a vacation to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05EEDE1538F933A05754C0A96F9C8B63&amp;module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3As%2C{%222%22%3A%22RI%3A15%22} Germany: Setback For Official In Stolen-Car Case] ''[[Financial Times]]'', July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPD subsequently lost the elections.

===Member of the German Bundestag===
From February 2010, Schmidt was a member of the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]] and deputy chairwoman of the German delegation to that assembly. She also served as a member of the Subcommittee on Cultural and Education Policy Abroad of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as a member of the Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 Ulla Schmidt, Vice-President of the Bundestag] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101194615/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 |date=2014-11-01 }} Deutscher Bundestag.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Schmidt became chairwoman of Lebenshilfe, the association for people with mental disability, their families, experts and friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 Ulla Schmidt, Vice-President of the Bundestag] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101194615/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/bundestag/presidium/schmidt/260032 |date=2014-11-01 }} Deutscher Bundestag.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Amid discussions on whether [[Iraq]] possesses the [[smallpox virus]] and that the [[Saddam Hussein]] regime has mobile factories capable of producing chemical and biological weapons, Schmidt recommended in 2003 that Germany stockpile [[smallpox vaccine]] to guard against a possible terrorist attack. In response, members of the conservative opposition accused Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's government of withholding a true picture of the threat from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Bernstein]] (February 4, 2003), [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/04/international/europe/04BERL.html Schröder's Team Not Telling Full Story on Iraq, Foes Say] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Schmidt criticized statements made by Pope [[Benedict XVI]], who claimed that condom usage promoted [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/RubFC06D389EE76479E9E76425072B196C3/Doc~EFDB8778F7D2F4AA8BADA3EEA536C4368~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Empörte Reaktionen auf Papst-Äußerung]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia''' ('''VAIN''') is a condition that describes [[Premalignant condition|premalignant]] [[histological]] findings in the [[vagina]] characterized by [[Dysplasia|dysplastic]] changes.&lt;ref name="Bolognia"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rapini, Ronald P. |author2=Bolognia, Jean L. |author3=Jorizzo, Joseph L. |title=Dermatology: 2-Volume Set |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages=1192 |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Water pyramid''' or '''WaterPyramid''' is a village-scale [[solar still]], designed to [[distill]] water using [[solar energy]] for remote communities without easy access to clean, fresh water. It provides a means whereby communities can produce potable drinking water from [[saline water|saline]], [[brackish water|brackish]] or polluted water sources.

== History ==
Martijn Nitzsche, an engineer from the [[Netherlands]], founded Aqua-Aero Water Systems to develop water treatment and purification systems.  In the early 2000s, the company invented the WaterPyramid technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acumenfund.org/investment/aqua-aero-water-systems.html |title=Aqua-Aero Water Systems |publisher=Acumen Fund |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first WaterPyramid was engineered and installed in collaboration with [[MWH Global]], an international environmental engineering firm, in the country of [[Gambia]] in 2005. The WaterPyramid desalination systems were awarded the World Bank Development Marketplace award in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.worldbank.org/M5C4GZ3SF0 |title=Development Marketplace - Winners of 2006 Development Marketplace |publisher=Go.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The pyramid stands about 26 feet (8 meters) tall, 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter, and has a conical shape.  It is constructed of plastic sheeting, which is inflated using a fan powered by solar energy generated by the pyramid.  Within the pyramid, temperatures reach up to 167&amp;nbsp;°F (75&amp;nbsp;°C), which evaporates water pumped into thin layer of water inside the cone.  Distilled water runs down the sides of the pyramid wall and is collected by gutters that feed into a collection tank.  When sunshine is replaced by rain, the falling water is also collected around the edge of the base of the cone and stored for use in dry weather.  Each pyramid can desalinate approximately 265 gallons (1000 liters) of water each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlink-international.com/news/id663-Dutch_Water_Pyramids_help_Indonesia.html |title=Dutch Water Pyramids help Indonesia |publisher=Waterlink-international.com |date=2009-07-08 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase water production, a village simply adds additional pyramids.

Operation of each pyramid is the responsibility of the local community, generating employment opportunities for the village.  Since the water produced by the Pyramid is [[distilled water]], there are also business uses for excess water production, such as the filling of batteries, which provide additional income to the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tucker J, Anema K, Nitzche M |title=WaterPyramids: Innovative Design Provides Sustainable Water Delivery |publisher=American Water Works Association |pages=26–28 |date=May 2010 |url=http://www.awwa.org/files/Publications/Journal/2010/May/PDFs/JAW201005current.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[water]] and [[sanitation]]''' sector in '''[[Peru]]''' has made important advances in the last two decades, including the increase of water coverage from 30% to 85% between 1980 and 2010. Sanitation coverage has also increased from 9% to 37% from 1985 to 2010 in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/table/ WHO/UNICEF JMP]&lt;/ref&gt; Advances have also been achieved concerning the disinfection of [[drinking water]] and in [[sewage treatment]]. Nevertheless, many challenges remain, such as:
*Insufficient service coverage;
*Poor service quality which puts the population’s health at risk;
*Deficient sustainability of built systems;
*Tariffs that do not cover the investment and operational costs, as well as the maintenance of services;
*Institutional and financial weakness; and,
*Excess of human resources, poorly qualified, and high staff turnover.

== Access ==

Access to water and sanitation increased during the last decades. Political efforts to increase access include the program ''Agua para todos'' which started in 2006 under President [[Alan García]] (see below).

=== Joint Monitoring Program ===

According to the [[Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation|Joint Monitoring Program (JMP)]] by [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] the coverage of [[Improved water source|improved drinking water service]] was 85% and 71% had access to [[improved sanitation]] in 2010. Access increased from 75% concerning water and 54% concerning sanitation in 1990. In 2010, urban coverage was 91% for water and 81% for sanitation. In rural areas coverage of drinking water was 65% and sanitation 37%.&lt;ref name="JMP"/&gt;

=== National figures ===

According to the Peruvian National Statistics and Informatic Institute (''Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática - INEI''), about 73% of the population had access to drinking water supply in 2009, while about 57% had access to sewerage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =2011-08-23 }}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In the framework of the development plan ''Plan Bicentenario'' it is envisaged to increase water supply coverage to 85% and access to sewerage to 79% by 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =2011-08-23 }}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service quality ==

In a national survey conducted in 2008, 64% of respondents indicated that they were satisfied with the quality of the water they received. Those who were not satisfied complained about turbidity, high levels of chlorine, bad taste and bad smell. This figure apparently does not include the level of satisfaction related to the continuity or pressure of water supply.

=== Continuity of water service ===

Urban areas received water service for an average of 17 hours per day in 2005.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional p. 73"/&gt; Only one Peruvian service company has continuous service, the company EMSAP in the Amazon region.&lt;ref name="SUNASS promedio"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.sunass.gob.pe/biblio_virtual_sunass.php SUNASS gráficos promedio 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in 1997, the total continuity average was at 12 hours per day, 5 hours less than in 2005. Rural areas averaged 18 hours, while in urban areas, service was provided on average for 12 hours. Service averaged 8 hours on the coast, 18 hours in forested and mountainous regions, and 10 hours in metropolitan Lima.&lt;ref name="ehproject"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.ehproject.org/PDF/Joint_Publications/JP0012EPeruSanitationPolicyFormat.pdf/ Evaluation of Peru’s National Sanitation Policies 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disinfection ===

In 2000, 80% of urban water supply systems used disinfection measures.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/peru/informe/inf-00.htm#resej WHO/PAHO 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In urban areas, 43 companies that provided information to the regulator complied with the norms for residual chlorine in the network.

In rural areas, however, in a sample consisting of 1,630 analyzed systems, 59% do not disinfect the water because of lacking the necessary facilities or the lack of chlorine. Considering that locations with less than 2,000 inhabitants have around 11,800 systems, it can be estimated that around 7,000 rural water systems provide water without disinfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd51/planes.pdf National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wastewater treatment ===

The share of treated wastewater in 2004 was estimated at 22%. This is to say that more than three fourths of the wastewater generated did not receive any type of treatment prior to its final discharge, which poses a serious threat to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd51/planes.pdf National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015], p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Back in 1997, the coverage of wastewater treatment had only been 13%.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.sunass.gob.pe/indicadores/ SUNASS: evolution of indicators, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, only two companies treated all of their sewage, one of them being from the Provincia de Marañón.&lt;ref name="SUNASS promedio"/&gt;

The great majority of sewage of the Lima-Callao metropolitan area is discharged without treatment into the ocean, resulting in serious contamination of the surrounding beaches. The Japanese Bank of International Cooperation (JBIC) provided a loan for the sanitation of the Lima-Callao area in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbic.go.jp/en/ Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) - List of projects]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was not implemented.

In 2013 the Taboada wastewater treatment plant was commissioned in Lima. With a capacity of 1,8 million cubic meters/day it is the largest wastewater treatment plant in South America. It was privately financed as a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project by the Spanish firm Técnicas de Desalinización de Aguas (Tedagua). It is envisaged that some of the treated water will be used for the irrigation of urban parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taboada WWTP, Peru|newspaper=Global Water Intelligence, February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing for another wastewater treatment plant in La Atarjea has been secured in February 2014 through a 48,66 million Euro loan from the German development bank KfW. The treated waster will be reused for irrigation after being discharged into an existing irrigation canal.

== Water resources and impact of climate change ==
{{Main|Water resources management in Peru}}

On average, surface water in Peru is abundant. Nevertheless, it is unequally distributed in space and time. Especially the coastal area, where the
country's major cities are located and two thirds of the population live, is very dry. Lima with 8 million people, is the world's second largest city located on a desert (after Cairo).
[[Image:Alpamayo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The peaks of the Andes are the source of many Peruvian rivers.]]
Peru contains over two-thirds of all [[tropical]] [[glacier]]s&lt;ref name="glaciers"&gt;[http://www.geography.osu.edu/faculty/bmark/2008%20ESR%20Vuille_etal.pdf Climate change and tropical Andean glaciers: Past, present and future]&lt;/ref&gt; which provide important water sources for the dry western half of the country. These glaciers are rapidly melting as a result of [[climate change]],&lt;ref name="glaciers"/&gt; making the flow of rivers more irregular, leading to more droughts and floods. A report by a team from the [[World Bank]] published in June 2007 in the bulletin of the [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) predicts that many of the lower glaciers in the Andes will be gone in the next decade or so, and that glacial runoff may dry up altogether within 20 years. The last comprehensive satellite survey by Peru's National Environmental Council, carried out in 1997, found that the area covered by glaciers had shrunk by 22% since the early 1960s. Partial surveys by geologists suggest that the rate at which the glaciers are melting has sped up over the past decade.&lt;ref name="Econ"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/9481517?zid=305&amp;ah=417bd5664dc76da5d98af4f7a640fd8a "When Ice turns to water", The Economist, July 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Quelccaya]] ice cap is the second largest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kochtitzky|first1=William H.|last2=Edwards|first2=Benjamin R.|last3=Enderlin|first3=Ellyn M.|last4=Marino|first4=Jersy|last5=Marinque|first5=Nelida|title=Improved estimates of glacier change rates at Nevado Coropuna Ice Cap, Peru|journal=Journal of Glaciology|date=2018|volume=64|issue=244|pages=175–184|doi=10.1017/jog.2018.2|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/improved-estimates-of-glacier-change-rates-at-nevado-coropuna-ice-cap-peru/AE2C29B25C4757967B2C6CEB8C918C33|language=en|issn=0022-1430}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Peruvian Andes and has shrunk by 30% in the last 33 years.  Streams fed by glaciers and rainwater provide water further downstream.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081900967.html "Warming may exacerbate global water conflicts" by Doug Struck, Washington Post, September 20, 2007, p. A23. The estimate of the rate of meltdown of the glacier is based on research by [[Lonnie Thompson]] from Ohio State University.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Water use ==
In 2005, an average of 259 liters/person/day of water were produced in urban areas. Actual water consumption is much lower than this level due to distribution losses estimated around 45%. Per capita water production has decreased by 26% since 1997 when production was at 352 liters/person/day. This decrease may be partly due to an increase in the share of metered users from 24% to 47% (1997–2005). According to the National Sanitation Plan, it is inadmissible that with such high levels of production water supply remains intermittent in many cities.&lt;ref name="Plan Nacional p. 73"/&gt;

In rural areas, water use is much lower than in urban areas.

According to a 2008 national survey by the radio station RPP and the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), 38% of respondents indicate that they "take great care" of water in the household. 89% of respondents indicated that they treat tap water before drinking it, primarily by boiling it, and 48% store water in their house because of intermittent supply or because they have no access to piped drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio de Vivienda/JICA/JBIC/Grupo RPP/RPP Noticias/WSP:[http://www.wsp.org/UserFiles/file/Construyendo_una_cultura.pdf Construyendo una cultura del agua en el Perú]. Estudio de perecepción sobre el agua y hábitos de consumo en la población, 2008, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and recent developments ==
The institutional framework for the water and sanitation sector has undergone many successive changes, including some reforms that were never implemented and some that considerably changed the responsibilities in the sector. Two reforms that had a lasting impact were the transfer of the responsibility for water supply and sanitation from municipalities to the national government in the late 1960s and the creation of a national water holding company in 1981 consisting of utilities in the large cities. In 1990, the government gave service responsibility in urban areas back to the municipalities. The new government of Fujimori introduced a policy of promoting the private sector and of commercializing the municipal utilities. In 1994 an autonomous regulatory agency was created at the national level. In the meantime the program to promote the private sector stalled: Only in 2005 the first and so far only water concession in Peru was awarded in the city of Tumbes. In 2006, a new government launched a massive investment program called Agua Para Todos (Water for All).

=== From municipal service provision to a national holding company ===
In the beginning of the 1960s, the municipalities had the responsibility of providing water and sanitation services. However, this responsibility was transferred to the Ministry of Housing and Construction in most urban areas towards the end of the decade. In rural areas, investments were realized through the Ministry of Public Health. The systems, once built, were handed over to community-based organizations for operation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 antecedentes"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/peru/informe/inf-02.htm WHO/PAHO 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the large cities of [[Lima]], [[Arequipa]] and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] created their own Water and Sanitation Companies.&lt;ref name="PIDHHD p. 1"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.pidhdd.org/v3/ PIDHDD 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[Image:Cusco-c02.jpg|thumb|350px|Cusco]] 
In 1981, the government of [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] merged the three Sanitation Companies of Lima, Arequipa, and Trujillo and the General Directorate for Water and Sanitation of the Ministry of Housing and Construction in a single national state holding company, the National Service of Water and Sewage Supply (SENAPA). SENAPA was composed of 15 constituent companies and 10 operational units. SEDAPAL in Lima was the largest one. 200 cities (20%) were left out of SENAPA and administered their own services.

The Government of [[Alan García]] (1985–1990) passed a law that transferred the functions related to rural water and sanitation construction and technical assistance to regional governments. With the change in government in 1990, these changes did not materialize, as the regionalization stalled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minsa.gob.pe "Organization and Functions of the Ministry of Health Law" of 1990 (Legislative Decree N. 584)]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decentralization and commercialization ===
During the 1990s, the water and sanitation sector was decentralized again. In May 1990, the outgoing government of [[Alan García]] decided to transfer all SENAPA constituent companies and operational units to the municipalities. SENAPA was to be converted into a company in charge of only giving technical assistance to the municipalities, a decision that was never implemented.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 antecedentes"/&gt;

The Government of [[Alberto Fujimori]] (1990–2000) initiated another restructuring of the sector with the objectives of commercializing and privatizing the service providers.&lt;ref name="PIDHHD p. 1"/&gt; In 1991, the government enacted the Private Investment Promotion Law for water and sanitation. In 1992, the National Water and Sewage Program (PRONAP) was created. SENAPA and SEDAPAL were placed under the direct authority of the President. In 1994, a new law was passed that created the legal figure of the municipal utility (EPS) as an entity that is legally and financially separate of the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunass.gob.pe/doc/sector%20saneamiento/ds09-95-pres.pdf  General Law of Sanitation Services]&lt;/ref&gt; More than ten years later, in 2005, the Water and Sanitation Program of the [[World Bank]] called the commercialization of municipal water utilities in the interior of the country a “silent reform in the sector”.&lt;ref name="revista"&gt;{{es icon}}[http://www.wsp.org WSP Revista Agua No. 19 Junio 2005], p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Law of the National Superintendence of Sanitation Services (SUNASS) was passed in 1994.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 antecedentes"/&gt; A tariff restructuring with the objective of achieving financial viability of the EPS was carried out in parallel. Despite the government’s expectations, no single public-private partnership in water supply and sanitation was put in place during the Fujimori government and all service providers remained public. Only in October 2005 the first water and sanitation concession contract in Peru was signed in the province of [[Tumbes Province|Tumbes]]. The 30-year concession was awarded after open bidding to a Peruvian-Argentine consortium, Latinaguas-Concyssa.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.sodepaz.net SODEPAZ]&lt;/ref&gt; The interventions under the concession were to be financed with the support of a loan and grant from the German development bank KfW.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.embajada-alemana.org.pe/ TUMBES: primera concesión de una Empresa de Agua en el Perú]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[La Libertad Region]] the public company for water supply and sanitation is [[SEDALIB]] which is formed by shareholders of municipalities of the Region.

=== "Water for everyone" ===
In September 2006, the new President [[Alan García]] announced an ambitious investment plan for the water and sanitation sector called “Water for everyone” (''Agua para todos''), promising water access to all Peruvians – mainly to the poorest – by the end of his mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://apra-global.blogspot.com/2006/09/presidente-garca-inaugura-programa.html Water for all]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

In 2006-07 nine small towns (between 5,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) across Peru introduced a new water and sanitation management model, under which the community is being more empowered, including through deciding themselves about a certain level of service quality, such as low-cost technologies, and corresponding tariffs. Subsequently the municipality hires a specialized operator who is being regulated by a Community Supervision Board under a Public-Private-Social Partnership. The specialized operator can be a private or a mixed company. The aim of the new approach was to break with the low-level equilibrium of poor service quality and poor cost recovery that prevails throughout small towns in Peru, under which poor quality water services are provided directly by the municipality. The new approach was supported through the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) of the Ministry of Housing, with technical support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and financial support of US$ 6.6 million from the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] for limited infrastructure investments and training for both the operator and members of the Community Supervision Boards. After the municipal elections of 2007, 3 new mayors decided to abandon the new approach and to return to the old model of direct municipal management. In the 6 other cities specialized operators continue to operate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/pa_1_peru_dpsp.pdf Jorge McGregor, Water and Sanitation Program: Small Town Pilot Project (STPP)], London, June 10–11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility for water supply and sanitation ==

=== Policy ===
[[Image:PalacioEjecutivodelPeru.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Government Palace (Peru)|''Casa de Pizarro'']] is the official residence of the President.]]
The [http://www.vivienda.gob.pe/ Ministry of Housing, Construction, and Sanitation] is the sector governing entity through the Vice Ministry of Construction and Sanitation (VMCS) and the National Sanitation Board (DNS).&lt;ref&gt;In Peru the term “sanitation” also encompasses water provision, sewage systems, and raw sewage.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry formulates, approves, executes and supervises the application of the national water and sanitation policies. The Ministry was created on June 11, 2002, through the Organic Law #27779.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd51/planes.pdf National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015], p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Various drafts of a General Water Law for water resources management have been in discussion for two decades. Nevertheless, no law has been approved up to now.

=== Regulation ===
The sector regulating entity is the [http://www.sunass.gob.pe National Sanitation Services Supervisory (SUNASS)], created by law in 1992.
Its functions are to regulate and supervise service providers, approve tariffs, establish norms, impose sanctions for violations of the law, and resolve user controversies and complaints. As part of its supervision activities SUNASS has established a benchmarking system to monitor the performance of service providers.

SUNASS is funded through a 2% surcharge on water bills with an annual budget of approximately US$4 million. According to the law, it enjoys administrative and financial autonomy.&lt;ref name="Plan 69-71"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd51/planes.pdf National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015], p. 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;
Its Board consists of five members nominated as follows:
* 2 by the Prime Minister's Office (including the Board's Chairman)
* 1 by the Ministry of Finance
* 1 by the Ministry of Housing, Construction, Water and Sanitation
* 1 by the Office of Fair Competition (Indecopi)

=== Provision of services ===
[[Image:Arequipa-plaza-armas-c01.jpg|thumb|450px|right|Arequipa]]
The Peruvian Constitution of 1993 bestows the responsibility of water and sanitation service provision to the city councils. The Ley Orgánica de Municipalidades (Law Nº 27972) states that the function of the provincial municipalities is to directly or by concession administer and regulate the water service, sewage, and drainage. Peru has 194 provincial city councils.&lt;ref&gt;Furthermore, there are 1831 district municipalities.&lt;/ref&gt;

The service providers in the country are:
* [http://www.sedapal.com.pe Water and Sewer Company (SEDAPAL)] in [[Lima]];
* 53 Municipal Service Providers (EPS) in other cities (SEDAPAL and the EPS have 62% of the country’s population within their jurisdiction);
* approximately 11,800 Communal Organizations – Sanitation Services Administrative Committees (JASS) – that are responsible for 29% of the population mainly situated in rural areas; and,
* 490 small municipalities that contain 9% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/sde/ops-sde/bvsde.shtml National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

When mayors change in Peru this often leads to the removal of the general manager of the municipal service provider (EPS) or of the head of the municipal department in charge of water supply in smaller municipalities that do not have an EPS. In 1999 it was estimated that the EPS changed general managers on the average every 17 months.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 fort"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/eswww/eva2000/peru/informe/inf-05.htm WHO/PAHO 2000, fortalezas y aspectos críticos del sector]&lt;/ref&gt; This happens although the majority of the EPS are made up of several provincial municipalities, which in theory should decrease the influence of city governments and reduce the political interference in the administration of companies.

Nearly all of the country’s service providers remain weak in financial and institutional aspects, as well as in human resources, despite attempts to strengthen them.

=== Support to Communal Organizations ===
A key function in the water and sanitation sector that is frequently neglected is the support to communal organizations that provide services, mainly in rural areas. This function can be assigned to municipalities, EPS, or to national entities with departmental filiations.

The WHO observed that in 2000 the municipal participation in assistance to rural services was insufficient to different extents, ranging from its total exclusion to the need for support in the preparation of the technical records and the complete integration in the planning, financing, and construction supervision processes.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"/&gt;
 
The regional governments have technical and financial supporting functions (also see Peru Regulation).&lt;ref&gt;According to the Ley Orgánica of Regional Governments, Law Nº 27867&lt;/ref&gt; The 24 separate Regional Boards of Housing, Construction, and Sanitation – one in each department – support them in this role.

Many interventions in rural areas during the 1990s were made without verifying the community demand and without their contributions to the execution of the projects. This resulted in overly designed systems that the communities did not maintain thus leading to loss of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the PRONASAR project supports the Administrative Assemblies of Sanitation Services (JASS) directly and through NGOs as well as municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/06/000094946_02081904011341/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf World Bank: PRONASAR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other functions ===
The [http://www.minsa.gob.pe/ Ministry of Health (MINSA)] is also participating in the sector through the General Director’s Office of Environmental Health (DIGESA) and the Executive Director’s Office on Basic Sanitation (DESAB), entities which exert functions in the aspects pertaining to sanitary and water quality for human consumption and the protection of a healthy environment.

Other institutions which act and participate in the sector are the [http://www.mef.gob.pe/ Ministry of Economy and Finances (MEF)] that specifically interferes in the aspects of economic sectoral and normative planning related to finances; several [[NGOs]] and the private sector, among others.

The National Cooperation Fund for Social Development (FONCODES), created in 1991, channels resources to investing in marginalized rural and urban areas in various sectors including potable water and sanitation. Within the framework of the state decentralization process, since October 2003, FONCODES transfers resources to the district city councils verified for social infrastructure projects, offering technical assistance and contributes to the capacity building for the responsible handling of social investments. The FONCODES depends on the [http://www.mimdes.gob.pe/ Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIMDES)]. Since the beginning of PRONASAR, FONCODES has retired from water and sanitation activities in rural areas.

Some 46 service providers have formed the [http://www.anepssa.tripod.com/ National Peruvian Association of Sanitation Service Providers (ANEPPSA)] to “promote the excellence in sanitation services management” through training and exchange of experiences.

== Economic efficiency ==
It is estimated that 45% of the water produced is [[Non-revenue water|not counted due to physical and commercial losses]], which is higher than the other 40% average of [[Water and sanitation in Latin America]]. This coefficient has not changed a lot during the last 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.sunass.gob.pe SUNASS: evolution of indicators, 2005] The 1997 value is probably not reliable due to micromeasurements&lt;/ref&gt; The highest levels are detected in the provinces of Marañón and Barranca (greater than 70%). Some companies had water levels not accounted for at less than 10%, however, these values do not seem viable given the low level of household metering (50%).&lt;ref name="pro 2"&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.sunass.gob.pe SUNASS "gráficos promedio 2"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial aspects==
Water tariffs in Peru are somewhat low compared to other Latin American countries and water bills are often not paid. As a result, according to an estimate, 95% of the country's urban service providers can be considered bankrupt. In many urban areas it is common to spend significant sums to water tanker operators, which are prevalent because of intermittent supply and deficient coverage. In rural areas, tariffs are even lower than the already low tariffs in urban areas, making it impossible to properly maintain water systems.

=== Urban areas ===
'''Tariffs''' In 2004, water tariffs in Peru were on average Sol 1.29/m3 (US$ 0.38/m3) in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}}[http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd51/planes.pdf National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015], p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Average urban tariffs increased slightly from Sol 1.04/m3 in 1997 (US$ 0.40/m3 with 1997 monetary values) to Sol 1.45/m3 in 2000 (US$ 0.42/m3), however dropped in real terms thereafter.&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; Each provider has its own tariffs, with significant differences between them, ranging from Sol 0.45/m3 in Valle del Mantaro (US$0.14/m3) to Sol 2.60/m3 in [[Ilo, Peru|Ilo]] (US$ 0.79/m3) in 2005.&lt;ref name="pro 2"/&gt;

Users in urban areas that do not have access to piped water pay much higher prices for water from water tankers.

According to a 2008 national survey by Radio RPP, respondents indicated that, on average, they paid 44 Soles (close to US$ 15) per month and per household for water.&lt;ref&gt;using the August 29, 2008 exchange rate of US$ 1=Sol 2.97, see www.oanda.com. It is not clear if this amount includes payments for water from vendors.&lt;/ref&gt; 44% of respondents said that they paid "much or too much" for water.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio de Vivienda/JICA/JBIC/Grupo RPP/RPP Noticias/WSP:[http://www.wsp.org/UserFiles/file/Construyendo_una_cultura.pdf Construyendo una cultura del agua en el Perú].Estudio de perecepción sobre el agua y hábitos de consumo en la población, 2008, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cost recovery''' In 1999, water companies billed only 55% of the produced water and of this value only 50% was actually paid. Payment arrears were equivalent to 140 days of billed revenues.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000 fort"/&gt;

There are significant differences in levels of cost recovery among service providers. For example, SEDAPAL had an [[operating margin]] of 35% in 2000, while the EPS had an average operating margin of only 16%. 6 out of 46 EPS had a negative operating margin.&lt;ref&gt;USAID/EHP/WSP/OPS 2004, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Only five years later in 2005, according to the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program, no more than 5% of the EPS and of the municipalities had the financial capacity to carry out their functions. The rest are considered financially bankrupt.&lt;ref name="revista"/&gt; In the same year, the government decided to apply a new tariff regulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=676452 IDB: Desarrollo del marco tarifario de los servicios de agua potable y saneamiento básico del Perú], p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The government contracted studies for the elaboration of this model with the support from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), a World Bank trust fund, and later from the IDB.

=== Rural areas ===

In rural areas, the water committees apply fixed monthly tariffs independently of use as the use of water meters is not common in these areas. The tariff is estimated to be the equivalent of US$0.50/month and household.&lt;ref&gt;WSP 2005&lt;/ref&gt; At a consumption of 20 cubic meter per month and household this corresponds to US$ 0.025 per cubic meter, or about 15 times less than the average tariff in urban areas. Needless to say, the revenues generated are insufficient for the operation and maintenance of the systems.

=== Ability to Pay ===

In 1997, the average the Peruvian household spent 1.8% of their total expenses in water, including water bought from carro-tanques, but without spending in sanitation. In urban areas they spent 1.9% of the expenses for water and only 0.8% in rural areas. The poorest (first decil) spent 2.4% in urban areas and 1.7% in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://helid.digicollection.org/en/d/Js2915s/ OMS/OPS 2001], p. 17-20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investments and financing ===
As shown in the bar chart below, investment levels increased substantially during much of the 1990s, from US$39 million in 1990 to a peak of US$422 million in 1997. Since then investments have declined again to US$106 million in 2004 and US$190 million in 2005. Total investment between 1990 and 2005 was at US$43.3 billion, the average being at US$205m p.a.&lt;ref&gt;Sources: 1990-1997: Ministry of urban development and housing; 1997-2005: Ministry of Economy and finance; investments at the municipal level are not included.&lt;/ref&gt; Investments are financed through programs providing subsidies to municipal utilities, as well as to a limited extent by internal cash generation and debt.

&lt;/timeline&gt;

====In the 1990s====
Between 1990 and 1998, an annual average of US$228.9 million was invested for water and sanitation infrastructure, equivalent to 0.5% of the [[GDP]]. In this period the investments in the sector increased from US$1.1/per capita in 1990 to US$15/per capita in 1998, the latter being an unusually high investment level compared to other Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="revista"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:100soles.jpg|thumb|200px|right]] --&gt;
These investments were financed as follows:

* 26% by SEDAPAL, financed by internal cash generation and debt;
* 17% by grants from the central government through the Social Fund FONCODES, destined primarily at rural areas,
* 10% by grants through the Program for the Support of Water Sector Reform (PARSSA), destined primarily at provincial cities;
* 22% by municipal companies, municipalities and NGOs;
* 23% by debt from the National Housing Fund FONAVI; and
* 2% by the Southern Zone Lima Metropolitan Sewer System Improvement Project (MESIAS), a project to improve the sanitary conditions of southern Lima, reducing the coastal contamination from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Calculated based on USAID/EHP/WSP/PAHO 2004, p. 18-19, quoting the 1999 Sanitation Subsector Assessment by the Directorate General of Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 total debt contracted by service providers stood at US$1.15 billion, equivalent to the operating margin of all service providers over 9 years. 46% of this debt contributed to reimbursable contributions by the National Housing Fund FONAVI.&lt;ref&gt;Calculated based on USAID/EHP/WSP/PAHO 2004, p. 17, quoting the Vice-Ministry of Housing and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000-2005====
The period between 2000 and 2005 witnessed investments of US$833.1 million (US$166.6 million/year) in the sector, carried out by the following entities:&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/cd51/planes.pdf National Housing and Water Plan 2006-2015], p. 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future investments====
The government's draft National Sanitation Plan considers that investments of US$4,789 million would be needed in 2005-2015 (US$497 million/year) to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] in the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Plan Nacional de Saneamiento&lt;/ref&gt;

However, billions more would be needed to divert water along tunnels beneath the Andes if glacial melting accelerates.&lt;ref name="Econ"/&gt;

== External cooperation ==
Multilateral financial institutions including the [[World Bank]], the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) as well as bilateral cooperation agencies (the German [[KfW]] and [[GTZ]], the Canadian [[Canadian International Development Agency|CIDA]], and the Japanese [[JICA]] (ex-JBIC), among others) play an important role in investment financing and in technical assistance in the sector.

Assistance to segments of the sector, differentiated by the size of localities, is provided by different donors:

* The World Bank provides support to rural areas as well as to small towns with populations less than 30,000 through the PRONASAR (see above).
* Larger towns and small cities &amp;mdash; such as [[Ayacucho]], [[Cajamarca]] or [[Puno]] &amp;mdash; receive support from KfW.
* Larger cities &amp;mdash; such as [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]], [[Piura]] or [[Cusco]] &amp;mdash; receive support from KfW, IDB and JICA.
* The CAF, the World Bank, and the JICA support SEDAPAL in [[Lima]] and [[Callao]].&lt;ref name="revista"/&gt;

An example of this support is the agreement signed in September 2009 by the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA) to provide a loan for up to $60 million for the North Lima Metropolitan Area Water Supply and Sewerage Optimization Project. The purpose of the project is to improve the quality of water and sanitation services by renovating the water supply network and improving its operation and management. It aims at reducing [[non-revenue water]] and increasing the continuity of water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Japan International Cooperation Agency]]: [http://www.jica.go.jp/english/news/press/2009/090929.html Japanese ODA Loan Agreement with Peru: Efficient Water Use in Arid North Lima], September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The project complements another JICA-supported project to build a water treatment plant, water distribution systems, and sewerage systems in marginal areas of the same place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jica.go.jp/english/news/jbic_archive/english/base/release/oec/2000/A05/B0516/nr20d.html#project4 Lima Marginal Areas Sanitary Improvement Project], September 5, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wienerwaldsee''' (English:''Vienna Forest Lake'') is a shallow [[reservoir]], located 20 kilometres west of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].

It is located just north of Austria's main [[motorway]], the [[West Autobahn]], between [[Tullnerbach]] and Neu-Purkersdorf. It was created over three years, 1895–1897, by [[dam]]ming the Wienfluss ([[Wien (river)|The Wien]]) and letting it fill the valley behind. The area around the lake is a nature [[conservation area]]. On the northern shore, near the [[weir]], stands the [[statue]] of [[Wilhelm Kress]]. He was an early pioneer of [[seaplanes]] and during testing one of his [[prototypes]] sank without trace after hitting debris on the surface. The long distance [[West railway (Austria)|Westbahn]] (''Western Railway'') runs along the northern shore of the lake.
