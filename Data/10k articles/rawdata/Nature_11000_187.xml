{{Antimatter}}
{{Modern physics}}

In modern [[physics]], '''antimatter''' is defined as a [[material]] composed of the [[antiparticle]] (or "partners") to the corresponding [[subatomic particle|particles]] of ordinary [[matter]].  Microscopic numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at [[particle accelerator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-11-08|title=Ten things you might not know about antimatter|url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-antimatter|newspaper=symmetry magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in natural processes like [[cosmic ray]] collisions and some types of [[radioactive decay]], but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form anti-atoms. No macroscopic amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.  

In theory, a particle and its anti-particle (e.g., proton and antiproton) have the same mass as one another, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge. 

A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner is known to lead to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle–antiparticle pairs.  Annihilation usually results in a release of energy that becomes available for heat or work. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the [[mass–energy equivalence]] equation, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;

Antimatter particles bind with one another to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a [[positron]] (the antiparticle of the [[electron]]) and an [[antiproton]] (the antiparticle of the [[proton]]) can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom. The nuclei of [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] have been artificially produced with difficulty, and these are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.

There is strong evidence that the [[observable universe]] is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter. &lt;ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Antimatter particles can be defined by their negative [[baryon number]] or [[lepton number]], while "normal" (non-antimatter) matter particles have a positive baryon or lepton number.&lt;ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The idea of [[negative matter]] appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned. Using the once popular [[vortex theory of gravity]], the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by [[William Mitchinson Hicks|William Hicks]] in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, [[Karl Pearson]] proposed the existence of "squirts"&lt;ref&gt;

 |jstor=2369570
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sinks of the flow of [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter. Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.&lt;ref&gt;

The term antimatter was first used by [[Arthur Schuster]] in two rather whimsical letters to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed [[antigravity|negative gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

The modern theory of antimatter began in 1928, with a paper&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Paul Dirac]]. Dirac realised that his [[Dirac equation|relativistic version]] of the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]] for electrons predicted the possibility of [[antielectron]]s. These were discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl D. Anderson]] in 1932 and named [[positron]]s (a [[portmanteau]] of "positive electron"). Although Dirac did not himself use the term antimatter, its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons, antiprotons, etc.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation]] states that antimatter and [[antiparticles]] are regular particles traveling backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
One way to denote an [[antiparticle]] is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Properties==
There are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric charge and spin), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is a consequence of the [[CPT theorem]]&lt;/ref&gt; This means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes (if unstable). It also implies that, for example, a star made up of antimatter (an "antistar") will shine just like an ordinary star.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin and asymmetry==
{{see also|Baryogenesis}}

Almost all matter observable from the Earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter. If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable.&lt;ref&gt;

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (i.e., the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by ''[[speed of light|c]]''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Observations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of [[X-ray binaries]] (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a [[stellar remnant]].&lt;ref&gt;

Antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far-away galaxies due to [[cosmic inflation]] in the primordial time of the universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, are expected to have the same chemistry and [[spectroscopy|absorption and emission spectra]] as normal-matter galaxies, and their [[astronomical object]]s would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Natural production==
{{main article|Positron emission}}

Positrons are produced naturally in β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, [[potassium-40]]) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. [[Antineutrino]]s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) [[cosmic ray]]s. In January 2011, research by the [[American Astronomical Society]] discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above [[thunderstorm]] clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds.&lt;ref&gt;

Antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the [[pair production]] threshold). It is hypothesized that during the period of baryogenesis, when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated.

===Observation in cosmic rays===
{{main article|Cosmic ray}}

Satellite experiments have found evidence of [[positron]]s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. This antimatter cannot all have been created in the Big Bang, but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies. For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in [[pulsar]]s, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. Therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. This weathering takes place as "the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star."&lt;ref&gt;

Preliminary results from the presently operating [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (''AMS-02'') on board the [[International Space Station]] show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 [[wikt:gigaelectron volt|GeV]] to 250&amp;nbsp;GeV. In September, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters.&lt;ref&gt;

Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2&amp;nbsp;GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.&lt;ref&gt;

There is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for, because the detection of natural antihelium implies the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.&lt;ref&gt;

The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[physicist]]s [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]], for which they were awarded the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;

The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton. Shortly afterwards, in 1956, the antineutron was discovered in proton–proton collisions at the [[Bevatron]] ([[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]) by [[Bruce Cork]] and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;

In addition to anti[[baryon]]s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by [[Antonino Zichichi]] reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at [[CERN]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1995, [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the [[SLAC]]/[[Fermilab]] concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was performed using the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]].

In 1999, CERN activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from {{val|3500|ul=MeV}} to {{val|5.3|u=MeV}}—still too "hot" to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first "cold" antihydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than {{val|100|u=[[Electronvolt|meV]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons. Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also based at CERN. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test [[CPT symmetry]] through comparison of the [[atomic spectra]] of [[hydrogen]] and antihydrogen (see [[hydrogen spectral series]]).&lt;ref&gt;

In 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (E Low Energy Antiproton decelerator) was built. It takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90&amp;nbsp;keV, which is "cold" enough to study. This machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber. More than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a [[nanogram]] of antimatter.

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of their component particles produce a [[magnetic moment]]. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum. Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.&lt;ref&gt;

===Antihelium===
Antihelium-3 nuclei ({{SimpleNuclide2|anti=yes|helium|3}}) were first observed in the 1970s in proton–nucleus collision experiments at the Institute for High Energy Physics by Y. Prockoshkin's group (Protvino near Moscow, USSR)&lt;ref&gt;

===Preservation===
&lt;!--===Antimatter trap===!--&gt;

Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of [[charged particle]]s can be contained by a combination of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, in a device called a [[Penning trap]]. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which [[atomic trap]]s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the [[dipole]] moment ([[Electric dipole moment|electric]] or [[Magnetic moment|magnetic]]) of the trapped particles. At high [[vacuum]], the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a [[magneto-optical trap]] or [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]]. Small particles can also be suspended with [[optical tweezers]], using a highly focused laser beam.&lt;ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Medical===
Matter–antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). In positive [[beta decay]], a [[nuclide]] loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a [[neutrino]] is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.&lt;ref&gt;

Since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels, an antimatter-fueled spacecraft would have a higher [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] than a conventional spacecraft.

If matter–antimatter collisions resulted only in [[photon]] emission, the entire [[rest mass]] of the particles would be converted to [[kinetic energy]]. The [[energy density|energy per unit mass]] ({{val|9|e=16|u=J/kg}}) is about 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] greater than [[chemical energy|chemical energies]],&lt;ref&gt;(compared to the [[heat of formation|formation]] of water at {{val|1.56|e=7|u=J/kg}}, for example)&lt;/ref&gt; and about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the [[nuclear potential energy]] that can be liberated, today, using [[nuclear fission]] (about {{val|200|u=MeV}} per fission reaction&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{val|8|e=13|u=J/kg}}), and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] (about {{val|6.3|e=14|u=J/kg}} for the [[proton–proton chain reaction|proton–proton chain]]). The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000&amp;nbsp;kg [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s. The [[Pion#Neutral pion decays|neutral pions]] decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 [[attoseconds]]) into high-energy photons, but the [[Pion#Charged pion decays|charged pions]] decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be [[Antimatter rocket#Direct use of reaction products|deflected magnetically to produce thrust]].

Charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. [[muon decay]]; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about {{nowrap|1=0.22 + (2/3)⋅0.78=0.74}}).&lt;ref&gt;

For more regular (earthly) applications (e.g., regular transport, use in portable generators, powering of cities, ...) artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier, despite its high energy density, because the process of creating antimatter is extremely inefficient. According to CERN, only one part in ten billion ({{val|e=-10}}) of the energy invested in the production of antimatter particles can be subsequently retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;

Antimatter production is currently very limited, but has been growing at a nearly [[geometric progression|geometric rate]] since the observation of the first antiproton in 1955 by Segrè and Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current antimatter production rate is between 1 and 10 nanograms per year, and this is expected to increase to between 3 and 30 nanograms per year by 2015 or 2020 with new superconducting linear accelerator facilities at CERN and [[Fermilab]].

Some researchers{{Who|date=May 2012}} claim that with current technology, it is possible to obtain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Many experts{{Who|date=March 2011}}, however, dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude. They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&amp;nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.

Storage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.

One researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:
{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed from [[satellite photo]]s, the cloud appears as a giant brown stain hanging in the air over much of South Asia and the Indian Ocean every year between January and March, possibly also during earlier and later months. The term was coined in reports from the UNEP [[Indian Ocean Experiment]] (INDOEX).&lt;ref name="Ramanathan-2002"&gt;Ramanathan, Veerabhadran ''et al.'' (2002) [http://www.rrcap.unep.org/issues/air/impactstudy/index.cfm ''The Asian brown cloud climate and other environmental impacts: impact study''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040605194625/http://www.rrcap.unep.org/issues/air/impactstudy/index.cfm |date=June 5, 2004 }} Center for Clouds, Chemistry and Climate, United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi Kenya, {{ISBN|92-807-2240-9}}, accessed 8 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''atmospheric brown cloud'' is used for a more generic context not specific to the Asian region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haag |first=Amanda Leigh|date=2007 |title=The even darker side of brown clouds |url=http://www.nature.com/climate/2007/0709/full/climate.2007.41.html |journal=Nature Reports Climate Change|issue=709|pages=52|doi=10.1038/climate.2007.41 |accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The Asian brown cloud is created by a range of airborne particles and pollutants from combustion (e.g., woodfires, cars, and factories), [[biomass]] burning&lt;ref name="Gustafsson-09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gustafsson |first=Örjan |last2=Kruså |first2=Martin |last3=Zencak |first3=Zdenek |last4=Sheesley |first4=R.

W. (2003) "A darkening sky: A smoky shroud over Asia blocks both sun and rain" ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' (17 March 2003), 134(8): pp. 46-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
This pollution layer was observed during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) intensive field observation in 1999 and described in the UNEP impact assessment study published 2002.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan-2002"/&gt; Scientists in India claimed that the Asian Brown cloud is not something specific to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ijoem.com/article.asp?issn=0019-5278;year=2008;volume=12;issue=2;spage=93;epage=95;aulast=Pandve | last = Pandve | first = Harshal T. | title=The Asian Brown Cloud | accessdate= 8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Subsequently, when the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) organized a follow-up international project, the subject of study was renamed ''the Atmospheric Brown Cloud'' with focus on Asia.

The cloud was also reported by [[NASA]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/environment/brown_cloud.html NASA Eyes Effects of a Giant 'Brown Cloud' Worldwide (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8857 Global Aerosol System 2000-2007 (NASA Earth Observatory)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although aerosol particles are generally associated with a [[global cooling]] effect, recent studies have shown that they can actually have a warming effect in certain regions such as the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Impacts==

===Health problems===
One major impact is on [[health]]. A 2002 study indicated nearly two million people die each year, in Asia alone, from conditions related to the brown cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=K. |title=Pollution cloud over south Asia is increasing ill health |journal=[[Lancet (journal)|Lancet]] |year=2002 |volume=360 |issue=9332 |pages=549 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)09762-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional weather===
A second assessment study was published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/ABCSummaryFinal.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-11-18 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20081118220650/http://www.unep.org/pdf/ABCSummaryFinal.pdf |archive-date=2008-11-18 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It highlighted regional concerns regarding:
* Changes of rainfall patterns with the Asian [[monsoon]], as well as a delaying of the start of the Asian monsoon, by several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=15452 Brown cloud delaying monsoon].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://zc.iap.ac.cn/uploadpdf/tac2012_Rashed_Li_BC.pdf Paper reporting the delaying of the monsoon being caused by brown cloud]{{Dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observed weakening Indian monsoon and in China northern drought and southern flooding is influenced by the clouds.
* Increase in rainfall over the [[Australia]]n [[Top End]] and [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] regions. A [[CSIRO]] study has found that by displacing the [[thermal equator]] southwards via cooling of the air over East Asia, the [[monsoon]] which brings most of the rain to these regions has been intensified and displaced southward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotstayn|first=Leon|title=Have Australian rainfall and cloudiness increased due to the remote effects of Asian anthropogenic aerosols?|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=112|issue=D09202|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184533/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2006JD007712.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-30|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2006JD007712.shtml|date=2 May 2007|doi=10.1029/2006JD007712|pages=D09202|last2=Cai|first2=Wenju|last3=Dix|first3=Martin R.|last4=Farquhar|first4=Graham D.|last5=Feng|first5=Yan|last6=Ginoux|first6=Paul|last7=Herzog|first7=Michael|last8=Ito|first8=Akinori|last9=Penner|first9=Joyce E.|last10=Roderick|first10=Michael L.|last11=Wang|first11=Minghuai|bibcode=2007JGRD..11209202R|display-authors=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Retreat of the [[List of glaciers of Pakistan|Hindu Kush]]-[[List of glaciers of India|Himalaya]]n glaciers and snow packs. The cause is attributed to rising air temperatures that are more pronounced in elevated regions, a combined warming effect of greenhouse gases and the Asian Brown Cloud. Also [[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition]] of [[black carbon]] decreases [[albedo|the reflection]] and exacerbates the retreat. Asian glacial melting could lead to water shortages and floods for the hundreds of millions of people who live downstream.
* Decrease of crop harvests. Elevated concentrations of [[smog|surface ozone]] are likely to affect crop yields negatively. The impact is crop specific.

===Cyclone intensity in Arabian Sea===
A 2011 study found that pollution is making [[Arabian Sea]] cyclones more intense as the atmospheric brown clouds has been producing weakening wind patterns which prevent wind shear patterns that historically have prohibited cyclones in the Arabian Sea from becoming major storms. This phenomenon was found responsible for the formation of stronger storms in [[Cyclone Gonu|2007]] and [[Cyclone Phet|2010]] that were the first recorded storms to enter the [[Gulf of Oman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=122072&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_51&amp;WT.mc_ev=click|title=Link Between Air Pollution and Cyclone Intensity in Arabian Sea |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|date=2011-11-02|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7371/full/nature10552.html |title=Arabian Sea tropical cyclones intensified by emissions of black carbon and other aerosols |first1=Amato T.|last1= Evan|first2=James P.|last2=Kossin|first3=Chul|last3=Chung|first4=V.|last4=Ramanathan|journal=Nature|issue=7371|pages=94–97 |date=2011-11-03|accessdate=2011-11-07|doi=10.1038/nature10552 |pmid=22051678 |volume=479|bibcode = 2011Natur.479...94E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming and dimming===
The 2008 report also addressed the global concern of [[global warming|warming]] and concluded that the brown clouds have masked 20 to 80 percent of [[greenhouse gas]] forcing in the past century. The report suggested that air pollution regulations can have large amplifying effects on global warming.

Another major impact is on the polar ice caps. [[Black carbon]] ([[soot]]) in the Asian Brown Cloud may be reflecting sunlight and dimming Earth below but it is warming other places by absorbing incoming radiation and warming the atmosphere and whatever it touches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biello|first=David|title=Brown Haze from Cooking Fires Cooking EarthToo.The brown haze over Asia warms the atmosphere just as much as greenhouse gases.|journal= Scientific American|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=brown-haze-from-cooking-fires-cooking-earth|date= August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is three times more effective than carbon dioxide—the most common greenhouse gas—at melting polar ice and snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biello|first=David|title= Impure as the Driven Snow: Smut is a bigger problem than greenhouse gases in polar meltdown.|journal= Scientific American|url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=impure-as-the-driven-snow|date= June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon in snow causes about three times the temperature change as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. On snow—even at concentrations below five parts per billion–dark carbon triggers melting, and may be responsible for as much as 94 percent of Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boswell |first=Randy |title=Burning crops darken Arctic sky, speed polar melt. |journal=Canwest News Service |url=http://www.canada.com/technology/Burning+crops+darken+Arctic+speed+polar+melt/1635692/story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206215104/http://www.canada.com/technology/Burning%2Bcrops%2Bdarken%2BArctic%2Bspeed%2Bpolar%2Bmelt/1635692/story.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 6, 2010 |date=October 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]] in 2002, the group has been led by [[Abubakar Shekau]] since 2009. When Boko Haram first formed, their actions were nonviolent. Their main goal was to “purify Islam in northern Nigeria."

After its founding in 2002, Boko Haram's increasing radicalisation led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was [[Summary execution|summarily executed]]. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against [[soft target]]s, but progressing in 2011 to include [[suicide bombing]]s of police buildings and the [[United Nations]] office in [[Abuja]]. The government's establishment of a [[state of emergency]] at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of Nigeria, led to an increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian Military Enter 'Final Stages' of Boko Haram Offensive|author=Jack Moore|date=23 April 2015 |work=Newsweek|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/nigerian-military-enter-final-stages-boko-haram-offensive-324384|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1581959/Boko-Haram |title=Boko Haram |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hundreds&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian army frees hundreds more women and girls from Boko Haram|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=1 May 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/02/nigerian-women-girls-boko-haram-rebel|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boko Haram crisis: Nigerian military chiefs given deadline|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-33913305|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=BBC News|date=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
[[File:NG-Sharia.png|thumb|Nigerian states with sharia law shown in green]]
Boko Haram was founded upon the principles of the [[Khawaarij]] advocating [[Sharia law]]. It developed into a [[Jihadist]] group in 2009. The movement is diffuse, and fighters associated with it do not follow the [[Salafi movement#Tenets|Salafi doctrine]]. Their beliefs tend to be centered on strict adherence to Wahhibism, which is an extremely strict form of Islam that sees many other forms of Islam as idolatrous.&lt;ref name="Congressional"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43558.pdf |title=Nigeria's Boko Haram:  Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Lauren Ploch Blanchard |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cfrBackgrounder&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739 | title=Backgrounder&amp;nbsp;— Boko Haram | publisher=Council of Foreign Relations | work=www.cfr.org | date=27 December 2011 | accessdate=12 March 2012 | last=Johnson |first=Toni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-rise-of-boko-haram-in-nigeria |title=The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria|last=Cook |first=David |date=26 September 2011 |publisher=Combating Terrorism Centre |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gloria-center.org/2014/07/the-diffusion-of-intra-islamic-violence-and-terrorism-the-impact-of-the-proliferation-of-salafiwahhabi-ideologies/ |title=The Diffusion of Intra-islamic Violence and Terrorism: the Impact of the Proliferation of Salafi/Wahhabi Ideologies |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Onuoha&gt;{{Cite book |title=Boko Haram: Islamism, politics, security and the state in Nigeria |chapter=Boko Haram and the evolving Salafi Jihadist threat in Nigeria|last=Onuoha |first=Freedom |year=2014 |publisher=African Studies Centre|location= Leiden |isbn=978-90-5448-135-5 |pages=158–191 |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/23853/ASC-075287668-3441-01.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 May 2014 |editor-last=Pérouse de Montclos |editor-first=Marc-Antoine }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has denounced the members of the [[Sufi]], the [[Shiite]] and the [[Izala Society|Izala]] sects as infidels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tolu Ogunlesi]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/opinion/nigerias-internal-struggles.html?_r=0 "Nigeria's Internal Struggles"], ''The New York Times'', 23 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Boko Haram seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in Nigeria.

==History==
===Background===
{{Further|Fourth Nigerian Republic}}
Before [[colonization]] and subsequent annexation into the [[British Empire]] in 1900 as [[Colonial Nigeria]], the [[Bornu Empire]] ruled the territory where Boko Haram is currently active. It was a [[sovereign]] [[sultanate]] run according to the principles of the [[Constitution of Medina]], with a majority [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] Muslim population. In 1903, both the [[Borno Emirate]] and [[Sokoto Caliphate]] came under the control of the British. Christian missionaries at this time spread the Christian message in the region and had many converts.&lt;ref name="Nigeria"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/nigeria/ Helen Chapin Metz, ed. "Influence of Christian Missions"], ''Nigeria: A Country Study'', Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991. Retrievaed 18 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; British occupation ended with Nigerian independence in 1960.&lt;ref name="bbc20110826"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Martin Meredith]] |title=[[The State of Africa: A History of the Continent Since Independence]] |date=2011|chapter=5. Winds of Change|edition=illustrated |publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780857203892|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for a brief period of civilian rule between 1979 and 1983, Nigeria was governed by a series of military dictatorships from 1966 until the advent of democracy in 1999. [[Ethnic violence|Ethnic militancy]] is thought to have been one of the causes of the [[Nigerian Civil War|1967–1970 civil war]]; [[Religious violence in Nigeria|religious violence]] reached a new height in 1980 in [[Kano]], the largest city in the north of the country, where the Muslim fundamentalist sect [[Yan Tatsine]] ("followers of Maitatsine") instigated riots that resulted in four or five thousand deaths. In the ensuing military crackdown, Maitatsine was killed, fuelling a backlash of increased violence that spread across other northern cities over the next twenty years.&lt;ref name="Martin Ewi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.issafrica.org/iss-today/why-nigeria-needs-a-criminal-tribunal-and-not-amnesty-for-boko-haram |title=Why Nigeria needs a criminal tribunal and not amnesty for Boko Haram |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |author=Martin Ewi |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social inequality and poverty contributed both to the Maitatsine and Boko Haram uprisings.&lt;ref name=journals&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/afsp/article/viewFile/330/330 |title=The Boko Haram Uprising and Islamic Revivalism in Nigeria |publisher=Africa Spectrum|last=Adesoji |first=Abimbola |year=2010 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97–98}}

In the decades since the end of British occupation, politicians and academics from the mainly Islamic North have expressed their fundamental opposition to Western education. Political ethno-religious interest groups, whose membership includes influential political, military and religious leaders, have thrived in Nigeria, though they were largely suppressed under military rule. Their [[paramilitary]] wings, formed since the country's return to civilian rule, have been implicated in much of the sectarian violence in the years following. The [[Arewa People's Congress]], the militia wing of the [[Arewa Consultative Forum]], the main political group representing the interests of northern Nigeria, is a well-funded group with military and intelligence expertise, and is considered capable of engaging in military action, including covert bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2014/05/19/revolt-in-the-north-interpreting-boko-harams-war-on-western-education-by-kirk-ross/ |title=Revolt in the North: Interpreting Boko Haram's war on western education |publisher=African Arguments |author=Kirk Ross |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
[[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]] founded the sect that became known as Boko Haram in 2002 in Maiduguri, the capital of the north-eastern state of Borno. He established a religious complex and school that attracted poor Muslim families from across Nigeria and neighbouring countries. The center had the political goal of creating an [[Islamic state]], and became a recruiting ground for [[Jihadism|jihadis]]. By denouncing the police and state corruption, Yusuf attracted followers from unemployed youth.&lt;ref name=cfrBackgrounder/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc20110826"&gt;{{cite news |first=Farouk |last=Chothia |title=Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamists? |date=11 January 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13809501 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRIN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/93250/Analysis-Understanding-Nigeria-s-Boko-Haram-radicals |title=Analysis: Understanding Nigeria's Boko Haram radicals |publisher=www.irinnews.org |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=econ1405&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/05/islam-west-and-nigeria |title=Whose faith, whose girls? |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that the reason Yusuf founded Boko Haram appears to be that he saw an opportunity to exploit public outrage at government corruption by linking it to Western influence in governance.&lt;ref name="GatestoneInstitute"&gt;{{cite news |first=Femi |last=Owolade |title=Boko Haram: How a Militant Islamist Group Emerged in Nigeria |date=27 March 2014 |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4232/boko-haram-nigeria |publisher=Gatestone Institute |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have used the existing infrastructure in Borno of the [[Izala Society]] (Jama'at Izalatil Bidiawa Iqamatus Sunnah), a popular conservative Islamic sect, to recruit members, before breaking away to form his own faction.

==Campaign of violence==
{{Further|Boko Haram insurgency}}

Boko Haram's attacks consist of suicide bombers as well as conventional armed assaults on both civilian and military targets. Following the 2014 kidnapping, a majority of Boko Haram's suicide bombers are female; some are as young as seven years old. Boko Haram jihadists rely on stealth, blending into local communities or hiding in the vast countryside. Critics accuse the Nigerian military of not properly equipping its soldiers to fight Boko Haram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Mark|title=Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42735414|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CNN|first1=Robyn Kriel,|title=Boko Haram favors women, children as bombers: Study|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/africa/boko-haram-women-children-suicide-bombers/index.html|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=CNN|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, police began an investigation into the group code-named Operation Flush. On July 26, security forces arrested nine Boko Haram members and confiscated weapons and bomb-making equipment. Either this or a clash with police during a funeral procession led to revenge attacks on police and widespread rioting. A joint military task force operation was launched in response and by 30 July more than 700 people had been killed, mostly Boko Haram members, and police stations, prisons, government offices, schools and churches had been destroyed.&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name=journals/&gt;{{rp|98–102}}&lt;ref name="Nigeria: Boko Haram 101"&gt;{{cite web |author=Joe Bavier |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/nigeria-boko-haram-terrorist-group-islam-christian-church-targets-youth-military |title=Nigeria: Boko Haram 101 |website=Pulitzercenter.org |date=15 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOSSITER&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/world/africa/28nigeria.html?scp=6&amp;sq=nigeria&amp;st=cse |title=Scores Die as Fighters Battle Nigerian Police|last=Nossiter|first=Adam |date=27 July 2009 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusuf was arrested, and died in custody "while trying to escape".

According to the leaked document, there were reports that Yusuf's deputy had survived, and audio tapes were believed to be in circulation in which Boko Haram threatened future attacks. Nevertheless, many observers did not anticipate imminent bloodshed. Security in Borno was downgraded. Borno government official Alhaji Boguma believed that the state deserved praise from the international community for ending the conflict in such a short time, and that the "wave of fundamentalism" had been "crushed".&lt;ref name=wikileaks/&gt;

===2010===
{{main|Bauchi prison break}}
In September 2010, having regrouped under their new leader, Boko Haram broke 105 of its members out of prison in [[Bauchi]] along with over 600 other prisoners and went on to launch attacks in several areas of northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Martin Ewi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boko Haram attacks – timeline"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/boko-haram-timeline-nigeria |title=Boko Haram attacks – timeline |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace and Security Council Report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.issafrica.org/uploads/No31Feb2012.pdf |title=Peace and Security Council Report |publisher=ISS |date=February 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
Under Shekau's leadership, the group continuously improved its operational capabilities. After launching a string of [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] attacks against soft targets and its first vehicle-borne IED attack in June 2011, killing 6 at the [[Abuja]] police headquarters, in August Boko Haram bombed the [[United Nations]] (UN) headquarters in Abuja, the first time they had struck a Western target. A spokesman claiming responsibility for the attack, in which 11 UN staff members died as well as 12 others, with more than 100 injured, warned of future planned attacks on U.S. and Nigerian government interests. Speaking soon after the U.S. embassy's announcement of the arrival in the country of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], he went on to announce Boko Haram's terms for negotiation, i.e. the release of all imprisoned members. The increased sophistication of the group led observers to speculate that Boko Haram was affiliated with [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM), which was active in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="Boko Haram attacks – timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peace and Security Council Report"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/un-house-bombing-why-we-struck-boko-haram/ |title=UN House bombing: Why we struck-Boko Haram |work=Vanguard |author=Ndahi Marama |date=30 July 2014 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Counterterrorism 2014 Calendar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/29/us-nigeria-bombing-claim-idUSTRE77S3ZO20110829 |title=Islamist sect Boko Haram claims Nigerian U.N. bombing |publisher=Reuters |author=Ibrahim Mshelizza |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-nigeria-bokoharam-idUSTRE80U0LR20120131 |title=Special Report: Boko Haram&amp;nbsp;— between rebellion and jihad |publisher=Reuters |author=Joe Brock |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-nigeria-bokoharam-idUSTRE80U0LR20120131 |title=Special Report: Boko Haram – between rebellion and jihad |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boko Haram has maintained a steady rate of attacks since 2011, striking a wide range of targets, multiple times per week. They have attacked politicians, religious leaders, security forces and civilian targets. The tactic of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]], used in the two attacks in the capital on the police and UN headquarters, was new to Nigeria. In Africa as a whole, it had only been used by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]] and to a lesser extent AQIM.&lt;ref name=Bureau/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Counterterrorism 2014 Calendar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nctc.gov/site/groups/boko_haram.html |title=Counterterrorism 2014 Calendar |publisher=The National Counterterrorism Center |date=2014 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Dowden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2012/03/09/boko-haram-%E2%80%93-more-complicated-than-you-think-%E2%80%93-by-richard-dowden/ |title=Boko Haram – More Complicated Than You Think |publisher=Africa Arguments |author=Richard Dowden |date=9 March 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-rise-of-boko-haram-in-nigeria |title=The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center |author=David Cook |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2013/12/boko-haram-attacks-an-air-base-nigeria-2013123164011457106.html |title=Boko Haram attacks an air base in Nigeria |publisher=Aljazeera |date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential inauguration====
{{Further|Nigerian presidential election, 2011}}
Within hours of [[Goodluck Jonathan]]'s presidential inauguration in May 2011, Boko Haram carried out a series of bombings in [[Bauchi]], [[Zaria]] and Abuja. The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: "This is not a [[banana republic]]". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. He added: "We are doing what we are doing to fight injustice, if they stop their satanic ways of doing things and the injustices, we would stop what we are doing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/06/boko-haram-claims-responsibility-for-bomb-blasts-in-bauchi-maiduguri/ |title=Boko Haram claims responsibility for bomb blasts in Bauchi, Maiduguri |work=Vanguard News |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |title=Boko Haram has infiltrated my govt –Jonathan |work=Punch |author=Olalekan Adetayo |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043607/http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was one of several political and religious assassinations Boko Haram carried out that year, with the presumed intention of correcting injustices in the group's home state of Borno. Meanwhile, the trail of massacres continued relentlessly, apparently leading the country towards civil war. By the end of 2011, these conflicting strategies led observers to question the group's cohesion; comparisons were drawn with the diverse motivations of the militant factions of the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]]. Adding to the confusion, in November the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] announced that four criminal syndicates were operating under the name Boko Haram.&lt;ref name="Richard Dowden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-rise-of-boko-haram-in-nigeria |title=The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center |author=David Cook |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JEAN HERSKOVITS"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/in-nigeria-boko-haram-is-not-the-problem.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=In Nigeria, Boko Haram Is Not the Problem |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Jean Herskovits |date=2 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2012/01/19/boko-haram-the-answer-to-terror-lies-in-providing-more-meaningful-human-security-by-olly-owen/ |title=Boko Haram: Answering Terror With More Meaningful Human Security |publisher=African Arguments |author=Olly Owen |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theme throughout the north-east was the targeting of police, who were regularly massacred at work or in [[drive-by shooting]]s at their homes, either in revenge for the killing of Yusuf, or as representatives of the state apparatus, or for no particular reason. Five officers were arrested for Yusuf's murder, which had no noticeable effect on the level of unrest. Opportunities for criminal enterprise flourished. Hundreds of police were dead and more than 60 police stations had been attacked by mid-2012. The government's response to this self-reinforcing trend towards insecurity was to invest heavily in security equipment, spending $5.5 billion, 20 percent of their overall budget, on bomb detection units, communications and transport; and $470&amp;nbsp;million on a [[Africa–China relations|Chinese]] [[CCTV]] system for Abuja, which has failed in its purpose of detecting or deterring acts of [[Terrorism|terror]].&lt;ref name="JEAN HERSKOVITS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2012/01/19/boko-haram-the-answer-to-terror-lies-in-providing-more-meaningful-human-security-by-olly-owen/ |title=Boko Haram: Answering Terror With More Meaningful Human Security |publisher=African Arguments |author=Olly Owen |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Nigeria-March-20121.pdf |title=Review of the January 2012 UK Border Information Service Nigeria Country of Origin Information Report |publisher=Independent Advisory Group on Country Information |author=Gernot Klantschnig |date=February 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016235722/http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Nigeria-March-20121.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204153#wrapper |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/11/nigeria-boko-haram-attacks-likely-crimes-against-humanity |title=Nigeria: Boko Haram Attacks Likely Crimes Against Humanity |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/163975-high-level-corruption-rocks-470million-cctv-project-secure-abuja.html#sthash.rEA1DWAX.dpbs |title=High-level corruption rocks $470million CCTV project that could secure Abuja |work=Premium Times |author=Ibanga Isine |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election defeat of former military dictator [[Muhammadu Buhari]] increased ethno-religious political tensions, as it broke the terms of a tacit agreement that the presidency would alternate after two terms of office between candidates from the Christian south and Muslim north of the country. Sectarian riots engulfed the twelve northern states of the country during the three days following the election, leaving more than 800 dead and 65,000 displaced. The subsequent campaign of violence by Boko Haram culminated in a string of bombings across the country on Christmas Day. In the outskirts of Abuja, 37 died in a church that had its roof blown off. One resident commented, "Cars were in flames and bodies littered everywhere", a phrase commonly repeated in international press reports about the bombings. Similar Christmas events had been reported in previous years. Jonathan declared a [[state of emergency]] on New Year's Eve in local government areas of Jos, Borno, [[Yobe]] and [[Niger State|Niger]] and closed the international border in the north-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/8977585/Coordinated-bomb-attacks-across-Nigeria-kill-at-least-40.html |title=Coordinated bomb attacks across Nigeria kill at least 40 |newspaper=The Telegraph |author=Duncan Gardham |author2=Laura Heaton |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/88249/five-bombs-explode-across-nigeria-killing-dozens |title=Five bombs explode across Nigeria killing dozens |newspaper=Buenos Aires Herald |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/world/africa/explosion-rips-through-catholic-church-in-nigeria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Nigerian Group Escalates Violence With Church Attacks |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Adam Nossiter |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/christmas-day-bombings-nigeria-kill-25-radical-muslim-sect-claims-responsibility-article-1.996711 |title=Christmas Day bombings in Nigeria kill at least 39, radical Muslim sect claims responsibility |newspaper=New York Daily News |author=Tina Moore |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/12/2011122581347745807.html |title=Nigeria churches hit by blasts |publisher=Aljazeera |date=26 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918023235/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/12/2011122581347745807.html |archivedate=18 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12077944 |title=Christmas bombings kill many near Jos, Nigeria |publisher=BBC |date=25 December 2010 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/31/us-nigeria-emergency-idUSL6E7NV07T20111231 |title=Nigeria's Jonathan declares state of emergency |publisher=Reuters |author=Felix Onuah |author2=Tim Cocks |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16579001 |title=Nigerian fuel subsidy: Strike suspended |publisher=BBC |date=16 January 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/16/nigeria-post-election-violence-killed-800 |title=Nigeria: Post-Election Violence Killed 800 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FalolaHeaton2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Toyin Falola|author2=Matthew M.

===2012===
====State of emergency====
Boko Haram carried out 115 attacks in 2011, killing 550. The state of emergency would usher in an intensification of violence. The opening three weeks of 2012 accounted for more than half of the death total of the preceding year. Two days after the state of emergency was declared, Boko Haram released an ultimatum to southern Nigerians living in the north, giving them three days to leave. Three days later they began a series of mostly small-scale attacks on Christians and members of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] ethnic group, causing hundreds to flee. In Kano, on 20 January, they carried out by far their most deadly action yet, an assault on police buildings, killing 190. One of the victims was a TV reporter. The attacks included a combined use of car bombs, suicide bombers and IEDs, supported by uniformed gunmen.&lt;ref name="Congressional"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/9062825/Al-Qaedas-hand-in-Boko-Harams-deadly-Nigerian-attacks.html |title=Al-Qaeda's hand in Boko Haram's deadly Nigerian attacks |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |author=David Blair |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIKE OBOH"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/22/us-nigeria-violence-idUSTRE80L0A020120122 |title=

[[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] published reports in 2012 that were widely quoted by government agencies and the media, based on research conducted over the course of the conflict in the worst affected areas of the country. The [[NGO]]s were critical of both security forces and Boko Haram. HRW stated "Boko Haram should immediately cease all attacks, and threats of attacks, that cause loss of life, injury, and destruction of property. The Nigerian government should take urgent measures to address the human rights abuses that have helped fuel the violent militancy". According to the 2012 [[US Department of State]] ''[[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Country Report on Human Rights Practices]]'':&lt;ref name="hrw report"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/11/nigeria-boko-haram-attacks-likely-crimes-against-humanity |title=Nigeria: Boko Haram Attacks Likely Crimes Against Humanity |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, witnesses in Maiduguri claimed members of the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] "Restore Order" [&lt;nowiki /&gt;a [[vigilante]] group], based in Maiduguri, went on a [[killing spree]] after a suspected Boko Haram bomb killed an officer. Media reported the JTF killed 20 to 45 civilians and razed 50 to 100 houses in the neighborhood. The JTF commander in Maiduguri denied the allegations. On November 2, witnesses claimed the JTF shot and killed up to 40 people during raids in Maiduguri. The army claimed it dismissed some officers from the military as a result of alleged abuses committed in Maiduguri, but there were no known formal prosecutions in Maiduguri by year's end.

Credible reports also indicated&amp;nbsp;... uniformed military personnel and [[paramilitary]] [[Nigerian Mobile Police|mobile police]] carried out summary executions, assaults, torture, and other abuses throughout Bauchi, Borno, [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], and Yobe states&amp;nbsp;... The national police, army, and other security forces committed [[extrajudicial killing]]s and used lethal and [[excessive force]] to apprehend criminals and suspects, as well as to disperse protesters. Authorities generally did not hold police accountable for the use of excessive or [[deadly force]] or for the deaths of persons [[Death in custody|in custody]]. Security forces generally operated with impunity in the illegal apprehension, detention, and sometimes [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]] [[execution]] of criminal suspects. The reports of state or federal panels of inquiry investigating [[suspicious death]]s remained unpublished.

There were no new developments in the case of five police officers accused of executing Muhammad Yusuf in 2009 at a state police headquarters. In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.

Police use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year. For example, although the January fuel subsidy demonstrations generally remained peaceful, security forces reportedly fired on protesters in various states across the country during those demonstrations, resulting in 10 to 15 deaths and an unknown number of wounded.

Despite some improvements resulting from the closure of police checkpoints in many parts of the country, states with an increased security presence due to the activities of Boko Haram experienced a rise in violence and lethal force at police and military [[roadblock]]s.

Continuing abductions of civilians by criminal groups occurred in the Niger Delta and [[Biafra|Southeast]]&amp;nbsp;... Police and other security forces were often implicated in the kidnapping schemes.

Although the constitution and law prohibit such practices and provide for punishment of such abuses, torture is not criminalized, and security service personnel, including police, military, and State Security Service (SSS) officers, regularly tortured, beat, and abused demonstrators, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners.

[[File:Lakechad map.png|thumb|[[Lake Chad]]]]

Nigeria's Borno State, where Boko Haram is based, adjoins [[Lake Chad]] as do [[Niger]], [[Cameroon]] and the country of [[Chad]]. The conflict and refugees spilled over the national borders to involve all four countries.

In 2013, Boko Haram increased operations in Northern Cameroon, and were involved in skirmishes along the borders of [[Chad]] and Niger. They were linked to a number of kidnappings, often reportedly in association with the splinter group [[Ansaru]], drawing towards them a higher level of international attention.

The [[Bureau of Counterterrorism|U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism]] provides the following summary of Boko Haram's 2013 foreign operations:
{{quote|In February 2013, Boko Haram was responsible for kidnapping seven French tourists in the far north of Cameroon. In November 2013, Boko Haram members kidnapped a French priest in Cameroon. In December 2013, Boko Haram gunmen reportedly attacked civilians in several areas of northern Cameroon. Security forces from Chad and Niger also reportedly partook in skirmishes against suspected Boko Haram members along Nigeria's borders. In 2013, the group also kidnapped eight French citizens in northern Cameroon and obtained ransom payments for their release.&lt;ref name=Bureau/&gt;}}

Boko Haram has often managed to evade the Nigerian army by retreating into the hills around the border with Cameroon, whose army is apparently unwilling to confront them. Nigeria, Chad and Niger had formed a Multinational Joint Task Force in 1998. In February 2012, Cameroon signed an agreement with Nigeria to establish a Joint Trans-Border Security Committee, which was inaugurated in November 2013, when Cameroon announced plans to conduct "coordinated but separate" border patrols in 2014. It convened again in July 2014 to further improve cooperation between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/99174/with-cross-border-attacks-boko-haram-threat-widens |title=With cross-border attacks, Boko Haram threat widens |publisher=IRIN |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/30/us-nigeria-boko-haram-idUSKBN0EA1LE20140530 |title=Cameroon weakest link in fight against Boko Haram |publisher=Reuters |author=Tim Cocks |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201302060270.html |title=Nigeria: FG Inaugurates Nigeria-Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee |publisher=allAfrica |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/07/2nd-session-nigeriacameroon-trans-border-security-committee-meets-abuja/ |title=2nd session of Nigeria/Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee meets in Abuja |newspaper=Daily Independent |date= |accessdate=August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809232618/http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/07/2nd-session-nigeriacameroon-trans-border-security-committee-meets-abuja/ |archivedate=9 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.news24.com/nigeria/National/News/Nigeria-Cameroon-security-committee-meets-20140707 |title=Nigeria-Cameroon security committee meets |publisher=News 24 Nigeria |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of emergency was extended in May 2013 to cover the whole of the three north-eastern states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]] and [[Yobe State|Yobe]], raising tensions in the region. In the 12 months following the announcement, 250,000 fled the three states, followed by a further 180,000 between May and August 2014. A further 210,000 fled from bordering states, bringing the total displaced by the conflict to 650,000. Many thousands left the country.

====Chibok kidnapping====

[[File:Michelle-obama-bringbackourgirls.jpg|thumb|[[Michelle Obama]] raising public awareness of the Chibok kidnapping]]

In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 schoolgirls from [[Chibok]]. Shekau announced his intention of selling them into slavery. More than 50 escaped. The incident brought Boko Haram extended global media attention, much of it focused on the pronouncements of the [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. Former First Lady]] Michelle Obama{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}. Faced with condemnation for his perceived incompetence, as well as allegations from Amnesty International of state collusion, President Jonathan responded by hiring a Washington [[Public relations|PR]] firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/06/210204.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of State |title=Rewards for Justice – First Reward Offers for Terrorists in West Africa |date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/06/23/nigeria-says-21-girls-in-boko-haram-kidnapping-still-missing/ |title=Nigeria says 219 girls in Boko Haram kidnapping still missing |publisher=Fox News |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nigeria-kidnapped-schoolgirls-michelle-obama-delivers-weekly-presidential-address-condemning-abduction-9349085.html |title=Nigeria kidnapped schoolgirls: Michelle Obama condemns abduction in Mother's Day presidential address |newspaper=The Independent |author=Maria Tadeo |date=10 May 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/jonathans-pr-offensive-backfires-nigeria-abroad-131630710.html |title=Jonathan's PR offensive backfires in Nigeria and abroad |publisher=Yahoo!

Parents of the missing girls and those who had escaped were kept waiting until July to meet with the president, which caused them concern. In October, the government announced the girls' imminent release, but the information proved unreliable. The announcement to the media of a peace agreement and the imminent release of all the missing girls was followed days later by a video message in which Shekau stated that no such meeting had taken place and that the girls had been "married off". The announcement to the media, unaccompanied by any evidence of the reality of the agreement, was thought by analysts to have been a political ploy by the president to raise his popularity before his confirmation of his candidacy in the [[Nigerian general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. Earlier in the year, the girls' plight had featured on "#BringBackOurGirls" political campaign posters in the streets of the capital, which the president denied knowledge of and soon took down after news of criticism surfaced. These posters, which were interpreted, to the dismay of campaigners for the girls' recapture, as being designed to benefit from the fame of the kidnapping, had also been part of Jonathan's "pre-presidential campaign". In September, "#BringBackGoodluck2015" campaign posters again drew criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-10/nigeria-s-president-jonathan-bans-bring-back-goodluck-campaign.html |title=Nigeria's President Jonathan Bans 'Bring Back Goodluck' Campaign |publisher=Bloomberg |author=Daniel Magnowski |date=10 September 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official announcement of the president's candidacy was made before cheering crowds in Abuja on 11 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/11/nigeria-politics-idUKL6N0T136F20141111 |title=Nigeria's Jonathan seeks second term, vows to beat Boko Haram |publisher=Reuters |author=Felix Onuah |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the organisations [[International Alert]] and [[UNICEF]] published a study revealing that girls and women released from Boko Haram captivity often face rejection upon returning to their communities and families, in part due to a culture of stigma around sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/16/women-freed-boko-haram-rejected-for-bringing-bad-blood-back-home-nigeria |title=Women freed from Boko Haram rejected for bringing 'bad blood' back home |publisher=The Guardian |author=Liz Ford |date=16 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Cameroon====
[[File:Roumsiki.jpg|thumb|Northern Cameroon [[Mandara Mountains]]]]
In 2014, Boko Haram continued to increase its presence in northern Cameroon. On May 16, ten Chinese workers were abducted in a raid on a construction company camp in Waza, near the Nigerian border. Vehicles and explosives were also taken in the raid, and one Cameroon soldier was killed. Cameroon's antiterrorist Rapid Intervention Battalion attempted to intervene but were vastly outnumbered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304908304579567933126108684 |title=Chinese Workers Kidnapped by Suspected Boko Haram Militants in Cameroon |work=The Wall Street Journal |author=Emmanuel Tummanjong |date=17 May 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the deputy prime minister's home village was attacked by around 200 militants; his wife was kidnapped, along with the Sultan of [[Kolofata]] and his family. At least 15 people, including soldiers and police, were killed in the raid. The deputy prime minister's wife was subsequently released in October, along with 26 others including the ten Chinese construction workers who had been captured in May; authorities made no comment about any ransom, which the Cameroon government had previously claimed it never pays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/boko-haram-releases-27-hostages-including-deputy-pms-wife-cameroon-says-9788845.html |title=Boko Haram releases 27 hostages including Deputy PM's wife, Cameroon says |work=The Independent |author=Natasha Culzac |date=11 October 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate attack, nine bus passengers and a soldier were shot dead and the son of a local chief was kidnapped. Hundreds of local youths are suspected to have been recruited. In August, the remote Nigerian border town of [[Gwoza]] was overrun and held by the group. In response to the increased militant activity, the Cameroonian president sacked two senior military officers and sent his army chief with 1000 reinforcements to the northern border region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2014/08/boko-haram-plans-attacks-recruits-many-young-people/ |title=Boko Haram plans more attacks, recruits many young people |work=Vanguard |date=8 August 2014 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28684302 |title='Islamist militants' kill 10 in northern Cameroon |publisher=BBC |date=6 August 2014 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/boko-haram-takes-nigeria-town-resident-says-172534738.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018131556/http://news.yahoo.com/boko-haram-takes-nigeria-town-resident-says-172534738.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 October 2014 |title=Boko Haram takes Nigeria town, resident says |publisher=Yahoo!

Between May and July 2014, 8,000 Nigerian refugees arrived in the country, up to 25 percent suffering from acute malnutrition. Cameroon, which ranked 150 out of 186 on the 2012 [[UNDP]] [[Human Development Index|HDI]], hosted as of August 2014 107,000 refugees fleeing unrest in the [[Central African Republic|CAR]], a number that was expected to increase to 180,000 by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.ng/news/news-headlines/item/10497-cameroon-receives-8-000-refugees-fleeing-boko-haram-in-nigeria/10497-cameroon-receives-8-000-refugees-fleeing-boko-haram-in-nigeria |title=Cameroon receives 8,000 refugees fleeing Boko Haram in Nigeria |newspaper=Nigerian Tribune |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811211242/http://tribune.com.ng/news/news-headlines/item/10497-cameroon-receives-8-000-refugees-fleeing-boko-haram-in-nigeria/10497-cameroon-receives-8-000-refugees-fleeing-boko-haram-in-nigeria |archivedate=11 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfp.org/countries/cameroon |title=Cameroon: Malnutrition Hits Children Arriving From Central African Republic |publisher=World Food Program |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/fr/report/99390/nigerian-overnight-refugees-worry-cameroon |title=Nigerian overnight refugees worry Cameroon |publisher=IRIN |date=24 December 2013 |accessdate=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further 11,000 Nigerian refugees crossed the border into Cameroon and Chad during August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48727#.VCKijPldVx8 |title=UN agency, partners appeal for $34 million for Nigerian refugees |publisher=UN News Centre |date=16 September 2014 |accessdate=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expansion of occupied territory====
[[File:Attentat Nyanya VOA2.jpg|thumb|Wounded people following a [[April 2014 Nyanya bombing|bomb attack]] by Boko Haram in [[Nyanya]], in April 2014]]
The attack on Gwoza signalled a change in strategy for Boko Haram, as the group continued to capture territory in north-eastern and eastern areas of Borno, as well as in Adamawa and Yobe. Attacks across the border were repelled by the Cameroon military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/boko-haram-commander-reportedly-killed-in-clash-with-nigerian-forces |title=Boko Haram commander reportedly killed in clash with Nigerian forces |newspaper=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |date=13 September 2014 |accessdate=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territorial gains were officially denied by the Nigerian military. In a video obtained by the news agency [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] on 24 August 2014, Shekau announced that Gwoza was now part of an Islamic [[caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/03/nigeria-talks-boko-haram-advance |title=Nigeria and neighbours hold talks on Boko Haram's rapid advance |newspaper=The Guardian |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=3 September 2014 |accessdate=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Bama, Nigeria|Bama]], {{convert|45|mi|km|order=flip|round=5}} from the state capital Maiduguri, was reported to have been captured at the beginning of September, resulting in thousands of residents fleeing to Maiduguri, even as residents there were themselves attempting to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/boko-haram-nigeria-raid-bama-town |title=Boko Haram kills scores in raid on Nigerian town |newspaper=The Guardian |agency=Reuters |date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military continued to deny Boko Haram's territorial gains, which were, however, confirmed by local vigilantes who had managed to escape. The militants were reportedly killing men and teenage boys in the town of over 250,000 inhabitants. Soldiers refused orders to advance on the occupied town; hundreds fled across the border into Cameroon, but were promptly repatriated. Fifty-four [[deserter]]s were later sentenced to [[death by firing squad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/05/hundreds-flee-homes-nigeria-islamic-extremists-boko-haram |title=Hundreds flee homes in northern Nigeria as Boko Haram move in |newspaper=The Guardian |agency=Associated Press |date=5 September 2014 |accessdate=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monica Mark"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/18/boko-haram-raid-nigerian-village-gumsuri |title=Women seized in Boko Haram raid on Nigerian village |work=The Guardian |author=Monica Mark |date=18 December 2014 |accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October, the [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Nigeria)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] announced that a ceasefire had been brokered, stating: "I have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development in the field". Despite a lack of confirmation from the militants, the announcement was publicised in newspaper headlines worldwide. However, within 48 hours the same publications were reporting that Boko Haram attacks had continued unabated. It was reported that factionalisation would make such a deal particularly difficult to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/169671-breaking-nigerian-military-boko-haram-agree-immediate-ceasefire.html |title=Nigerian military, Boko Haram agree immediate ceasefire |work=Premium Times |date=17 October 2014 |accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/18/chibok-schoolgirls-may-free-tuesday-nigeria-boko-haram |title=Fears grow that Nigeria ceasefire won't secure girls' release amid fresh attacks |work=The Guardian |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/18/us-nigeria-girls-idUSKCN0I709520141018 |title=Suspected Boko Haram fighters mount deadly attacks after Nigeria 'ceasefire' |publisher=Reuters |author=Lanre Ola |date=18 October 2014 |accessdate=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baga massacre was one of the Nigerian army's biggest defeats in terms of loss of equipment and civilian casualties. Several officers were [[court-martial]]ed. In October 2015, General [[Enitan Ransome-Kuti]] was dismissed from the army and sentenced to six months imprisonment.

On 23 August 2016, the Nigerian Army announced it conducted an overnight air-operation that was 'very successful' in killing the leadership of Boko Haram. Among those presumed killed was [[Abubakar Shekau]], he died in an aerial bombardment in Taye village. The Nigerian Army claims that the disputed Boko Haram leader died from injuries to his shoulders while he was performing prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/worldnews/2016/08/24/news/boko-haram-leader-boko-haram-leader-abubakar-shekau-killed-in-an-air-strike-while-praying-killed-in-an-air-strike-while-p-664628/|title=Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau ‘killed while praying'|website=The Irish News|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-security-bokoharam-idUKKCN10Y0JP|title=As Kerry visits Nigeria, air force says top Boko Haram fighters killed|last=Wroughton|first=Lesley|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August, the Nigerian president [[Muhammadu Buhari]], retracted the military's statement and claimed that the Boko Haram leader was 'wounded' but not killed in the air-strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/28/nigerian-president-boko-haram-leader-wounded-muhammadu-buhari-abubakar-shekau|title=Nigerian president says Boko Haram leader has been wounded|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2016-08-28|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2016, Major General Lucky Irabor stated that the militants now only controlled a few villages and towns near [[Lake_Chad|Lake Chad]] and in [[Sambisa_forest|Sambisa Forest]]. He further stated that the military expected recapturing the final strongholds of the group within weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian Army Commander: Only Weeks Left for Boko Haram|url=http://english.aawsat.com/2016/09/article55357543/nigerian-army-commander-weeks-left-boko-haram|accessdate=2 September 2016|publisher=Asharq al-Awsat|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===
====Rise in child suicide bombing====
UNICEF reported an increase in child suicide bombers with 27 incidents occurring in the first three months of 2017 in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad, compared to 30 in the entire previous year, 56 in 2015 and 4 in 2014. Kidnapped children who escape from Boko Haram are often held in custody or ostracized by their community or family. Patrick Rose, a UNICEF regional coordinator, stated: "They are held in military barracks, separated from their parents, without medical follow-up, without psychological support, without education, under conditions and for durations that are unknown". According to the NGO: "Society's rejection of these children, and their sense of isolation and desperation, could be making them more vulnerable to promises of martyrdom through acceptance of dangerous and deadly missions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boko Haram Is Increasingly Using Children In Suicide Attacks|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/boko-haram-increasingly-using-children-suicide-attacks-n745456|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=NBC News|agency=Reuters|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Alarming' rise in Boko Haram child suicide bombers|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/rise-boko-haram-child-suicide-bombers-170412041301650.html|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=Aljazeera|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to child suicide bombers and despite having been routed from key areas and significantly downgraded in their capacities, throughout 2016 and into 2017, Boko Haram in Nigeria continued to wage attacks against Nigerian security forces, the community-based Civilian Joint Task Forces (CJTF), and regular citizens, using improvised explosives devices (IEDs) and other crude weaponry. These were often deployed with suicide bombers; an increasing number of whom were women and girls recruited to attack markets, transportation depots, mosques, and IDP camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Confronting the Unthinkable: Suicide Bombers in Northern Nigeria”|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/fp303011602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
====Dapchi kidnapping====
Boko Haram kidnapped 110 schoolgirls from the Government Technical Girls College in [[Dapchi]], Yobe, on 19 February 2018. Boko Haram reportedly released all but one of the girls by 21 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=CNN|first1=Bukola Adebayo,|title=Nigeria's President vows schoolgirl with Boko Haram 'will not be abandoned'|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/22/africa/nigeria-missing-girls-father/index.html|accessdate=23 March 2018|work=CNN|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Buhari speaks on abducted Dapchi schoolgirls – Premium Times Nigeria|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/259693-buhari-speaks-abducted-dapchi-schoolgirls.html|accessdate=24 February 2018|work=Premium Times Nigeria|publisher=Premium Times Nigeria|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Maiduguri City Attack====
On 2 April, a Boko Haram attack on the outskirts of Maiduguri resulted in the death of 18 people and another 84 wounded. This attack came just days after the government of Nigeria claimed there was a ceasefire with Boko Haram. The attack happened in the villages of Bale Shuwa and Bale Kura, close to both Maiduguri and the city's military camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abubakar|first1=Aminu|last2=Mckenzie|first2=Sheena|title=Boko Haram attack leaves 18 dead in northeast Nigeria|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/02/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-attack-intl/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Operation Lafiya Dole====
On 18 May, the Nigerian Army killed 15 Boko Haram insurgents and rescued 49 persons in separate encounters between Boko Haram and Nigerian troops throughout the Southern Lake Chad Basin. The Nigerian troops killed 11 of the insurgents during a battle in Gamoran Village, while the remaining insurgents were killed trying to escape from the Army's efforts in Northern Borno. The Nigerian troops rescued 4 men, 33 women, and 16 children from the insurgent's hideouts in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigerian soldiers battle Boko Haram, kill 15, rescue 49 women, children|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/268734-nigerian-soldiers-battle-boko-haram-kill-15-rescue-49-women-children.html|accessdate=18 May 2018|work=Premium Times Nigeria|publisher=Premium Times Nigeria|date=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Leader===

Boko Haram was founded by Mohammed Yusuf who led the group from 2002 until his death in 2009. After his death, his deputy [[Abubakar Shekau]] took control of the group and has led it until the present day.

Although Boko Haram is organized in a hierarchical structure with one overall leader, the group also operates as a [[clandestine cell system]] using a network structure,&lt;ref name="START"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/STARTBackgroundReport_BokoHaramRecentAttacks_May2014_0.pdf |title=Boko Haram Recent Attacks |publisher=National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt; with units having between 300 and 500 fighters each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarionproject.org/factsheet/boko-haram-nigerias-islamist-group |title=Fact Sheet – Boko Haram: Nigeria's Islamist Group |publisher=ClarionProject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the total number of fighters range between 500 and 9,000.&lt;ref name="conflict-news.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.conflict-news.com/boko-haram-worse-isis/ |title=Are Boko Haram Worse Than ISIS? |publisher=Conflict News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317153121/http://www.conflict-news.com/boko-haram-worse-isis/ |archivedate=17 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visionofhumanity.org-p53"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Terrorism Index 2014 |publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace |url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Terrorism%20Index%20Report%202014.pdf |page=53 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216091255/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Terrorism%20Index%20Report%202014.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/10893889/Al-Qaeda-map-Isis-Boko-Haram-and-other-affiliates-strongholds-across-Africa-and-Asia.html |title=Al-Qaeda map: Isis, Boko Haram and other affiliates' strongholds across Africa and Asia |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===

====Kidnap for ransom====

Boko Haram is said to have raised substantial sums from kidnap for ransom. In 2013, Boko Haram kidnapped a family of seven French tourists on vacation in Cameroon and two months later released the hostages along with 16 others in exchange for a ransom of $3.15 million.&lt;ref name="Caulderwood"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/fake-charities-drug-cartels-ransom-extortion-where-islamist-group-boko-haram-gets-its-cash-1585743 |title=Fake Charities, Drug Cartels, Ransom and Extortion: Where Islamist Group Boko Haram Gets Its Cash |work=International Business Times |author=Kathleen Caulderwood |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extortion====

As well as extortion from local residents, Boko Haram has claimed to extort money from local state governments. A spokesman of Boko Haram claimed that Kano state governor [[Ibrahim Shekarau]] and Bauchi state governor [[Isa Yuguda]] had paid them monthly.&lt;ref name="thenation20120129"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/mobile/sunday-magazine/cover/34867-tracking-the-sect%E2%80%99s-cash-flow.html |title=Tracking the sect's cash flow |work=The Nation |date=29 January 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |last=Ogundipe |first=Taiwo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613065340/http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/mobile/sunday-magazine/cover/34867-tracking-the-sect%E2%80%99s-cash-flow.html |archivedate=13 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties to other militant groups===

It has long been alleged that Boko Haram had a relationship with al-Qaeda. In 2011, letters from Boko Haram were reportedly found in bin Laden's compound.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/11/boko-haram-s-bin-laden-connection.html |title=Boko Haram's Bin Laden Connection |publisher=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after the [[2009 Boko Haram uprising]] began, [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] expressed sympathy for Boko Haram.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/africa/abduction-of-girls-an-act-not-even-al-qaeda-can-condone.html|title=Abduction of Girls an Act Not Even Al Qaeda Can Condone|date=8 May 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking by phone to reporters in November 2012, group spokesman [[Abu Qaqa]] said: "We are together with al-Qaeda, they are promoting the cause of Islam, just as we are doing. Therefore they help us in our struggle and we help them, too." The 2012 Reuters special report details how fighters have trained with al-Qaeda affiliates in small groups over at least 6 years.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

According to the UN Security Council listing of Boko Haram under the al-Qaeda sanctions regime in May 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11410.doc.htm |title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; the group "has maintained a relationship with [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb|AQIM]] for training and material support purposes", and "gained valuable knowledge on the construction of improvised explosive devices from AQIM". The UN found that a "number of Boko Haram members fought alongside al Qaeda affiliated groups in Mali in 2012 and 2013 before returning to Nigeria with terrorist expertise". AQIM is one of al-Qaeda's regional branches, whose leader, [[Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud]], has sworn an oath of allegiance to al-Qaeda's senior leadership.&lt;ref name="longwarjournal.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/05/un_adds_boko_haram_t.php |title=UN adds Boko Haram to al Qaeda sanctions list |publisher=longwarjournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite historic ties, al-Qaeda central has never officially accepted Boko Haram as an affiliate. The issues between AQ and Boko Haram related to the extremism of Abubakar Shekau with respect to him declaring the entire general population of Muslims in Nigeria to be non-Muslims. Shekau argues that due to the widespread apostasy of Muslims through voting in elections that it is legitimate to kill Muslim civilians. Al-Qaeda takes the view that the general population should be viewed as Muslim and thus killing civilians is not acceptable.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-boko-haram-nigeria-20150115-story.html |title=How to help Nigerians defeat Boko Haram |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Shekau released a 16-minute video where he voiced support for [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]'s head [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], al-Qaeda's head [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/africa/2014/07/13/Boko-Haram-voices-support-for-ISIS-Baghdadi.html |title=Boko Haram voices support for ISIS' Baghdadi |website=English.alarabiya.net |accessdate=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Shekau formally pledged allegiance to ISIL, which was accepted by the group's spokesman several days later.&lt;ref name="BokoHaramIS"/&gt; The group was nominally renamed 'Wilayat Garb Ifriqiyah' or the Islamic State's 'West African province' and was led by Shekau.

In August 2016, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] attempted to remove Shekau from his leadership role and replace him with [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]]. The reason behind this was that Shekau had disobeyed [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]]'s order to cease targeting Muslim civilians. Shekau rejected the move, leading to a split between the groups.

==Response by Nigerian authorities==
The Nigerian military is, in the words of a former British military attaché speaking in 2014, "a shadow of what it's reputed to have once been. It's fallen apart". They are short of basic equipment, including radios and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]]. Morale is said to be low. Senior officers are alleged to be skimming military procurement budget funds that are intended to pay for the standard issue equipment of soldiers. The country's defense budget accounts for more than a third of the security budget of $5.8 billion, but only 10 percent is allocated to capital spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/09/us-nigeria-military-insight-idUSBREA4809220140509 |title=
Boko Haram exploits Nigeria's slow military decline|publisher=Reuters |author=Tim Cocks |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 [[United States Department of Defense]] assessment, funds are being "skimmed off the top", troops are "showing signs of real fear" and are "afraid to even engage".&lt;ref name="Congressional"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

In the summer of 2013, the Nigerian military shut down mobile phone coverage in the three north-eastern states to disrupt the group's communication and ability to detonate IEDs. Accounts from military insiders and data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the mobile phone blackout suggest that the shut down was 'successful' from a military- tactical point of view. However it angered citizens in the region (owing to negative social and economic consequences of the mobile shutdown) and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens and organizations developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the [[Sambisa Forest]]. This fundamentally changed the dynamics of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacob | first1 = J.U.U. | last2 = Akpan | first2 = I | year = 2015 | title = Silencing Boko Haram: Mobile Phone Blackout and Counterinsurgency in Nigeria's Northeast region.

In July 2014, Nigeria was estimated to have had the highest number of terrorist killings in the world over the past year, 3477, killed in 146 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35643:nigeria-tops-world-terror-attack-fatality-list&amp;catid=49:National%20Security&amp;Itemid=115 |title=Nigeria tops world terror attack fatality list |publisher=defenseWeb |author=Oscar Nkala |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor of Borno, [[Kashim Shettima]], of the opposition [[All Nigeria Peoples Party|ANPP]], said in February 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/17/us-nigeria-violence-idUSBREA1G1AO20140217 |title=Nigeria Islamists better armed, motivated than army: governor |publisher=Reuters |author=Felix Onuoh |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Boko Haram are better armed and are better motivated than our own troops. Given the present state of affairs, it is absolutely impossible for us to defeat Boko Haram.}}

In March 2015, it was reported that Nigeria had employed hundreds of mercenaries from South Africa and the former Soviet Union to assist in making gains against Boko Haram before the March 28 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=

In October 2015, General [[David M. Rodriguez]], head of U.S. Africa Command, reported that Boko Haram has lost territory, directly contradicting statements made by Boko Haram. U.S. efforts to train and share intelligence with regional military forces is credited with helping to push back against Boko Haram, but officials warn that the group remains a grave threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Boko Haram Has Lost Territory in Nigeria, U.S. General Says | author=Julian E.

In April 2018, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, approved a release of $1bn for the procurement of security equipment to fight insurgency and revolt in the country. This announcement came days after an attack by Boko Haram that left 18 dead in northern Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adetayo|first1=Olalekan|title=Boko Haram: Buhari approves release of $1bn for security equipment|url=http://punchng.com/breaking-boko-haram-buhari-approves-release-of-1bn-for-security-equipment/|website=Punch|publisher=Punch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the [[U.S. Department of State]] had an internal debate on whether to place Boko Haram on its [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]].&lt;ref name="KesslerBoko"&gt;{{cite web|author=Glenn Kessler|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/05/19/boko-haram-inside-the-state-department-debate-over-the-terrorist-label/|title=Boko Haram: Inside the State Department debate over the 'terrorist' label|website=Washington Post|date=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bureau of Counterterrorism]] leaned towards designation while the [[Bureau of African Affairs]] urged caution.&lt;ref name="KesslerBoko" /&gt; Officials from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], the FBI, the CIA, and a number of members of Congress urged the State Department to designate Boko Haram as an FTO.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Rogin, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/07/hillary-s-state-department-refused-to-brand-boko-haram-as-terrorists.html Hillary's State Department Refused to Brand Boko Haram as Terrorists], ''Daily Beast'' (May 7, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian government voiced its opposition to an FTO designation, citing concerns that it would raise Boko Haram's stature and have implications for humanitarian aid in the region where Boko Haram operated.&lt;ref name="KesslerBoko" /&gt; Twenty academic experts on Nigeria signed a letter to the State Department urging it not to designate Boko Haram as an FTO, saying that it would hinder NGO efforts in the region and might legitimize the Nigerian Army's human rights abuses in its efforts to fight Boko Haram.&lt;ref name="KesslerBoko" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carllevan.com/2012/05/boko-haram-letter-to-clinton-from-scholars/|title=Letter to Secretary Clinton from Nigeria Scholars|date=2012-05-21|language=English|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carllevan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Boko-Haram-FTO-letter-to-Clinton4.pdf|title=Boko Haram FTO letter to Clinton|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. State Department designated Boko Haram and its offshoot [[Ansaru]] as terrorist organizations in November 2013, citing Boko Haram's links with AQIM and its responsibility for "thousands of deaths in northeast and central Nigeria over the last several years including targeted killings of civilians".&lt;ref name="Office of the Spokesperson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/11/217509.htm|title=Terrorist Designations of Boko Haram and Ansaru |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department also cited Ansaru's 2013 kidnapping and execution of seven international construction workers.&lt;ref name="Office of the Spokesperson"/&gt; In the statement it was noted, however, "These designations are an important and appropriate step, but only one tool in what must be a comprehensive approach by the Nigerian government to counter these groups through a combination of law enforcement, political, and development efforts."&lt;ref name="Office of the Spokesperson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr3209ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr3209ih.pdf |title=A bill to impose sanctions against persons who knowingly provide material support or resources to Boko Haram or its affiliates, associated groups, or agents, and for other purposes |publisher=U.S. Congress |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department had resisted earlier calls to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group after the [[2011 Abuja United Nations bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-112HPRT71725/pdf/CPRT-112HPRT71725.pdf|title=Boko Haram: Emerging Threat to the U.S. Homeland |publisher=[[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence]]|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government does not believe Boko Haram is currently (2014) affiliated with al Qaeda Central, despite regular periodic pledges of support and solidarity from its leadership for al-Qaeda, but is particularly concerned about ties between Boko Haram and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) (including "likely sharing funds, training, and explosive materials").&lt;ref name="Congressional"/&gt;&lt;!--see page 7--&gt;

Efforts to cooperate in freeing the Chibok schoolgirls had faltered, largely due to mutual distrust; the infiltration of the military by Boko Haram meant that U.S. officials were wary of sharing raw intelligence data, and the Nigerian military had failed to supply information that might have aided U.S. drone flights in locating the kidnapped girls. The Nigerian government claims that Boko Haram is "the West Africa branch of the world-wide Al-Qaida movement" with connections to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]] and AQIM in Mali. The Nigerian government denies having committed human rights abuses in the conflict, and therefore oppose U.S. restrictions on arms sales, which they see as being based on the U.S. mis-application of the [[Leahy Law]] due to concerns over [[human rights in Nigeria]]. The U.S. had supplied the Nigerian army with trucks and equipment but had blocked the sale of [[Cobra helicopter]]s. In November 2014 the U.S. State department again refused to supply Cobras, citing concerns over the Nigerian military's ability to maintain and use them without endangering civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nigeriaembassyusa.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=357&amp;cntnt01origid=15&amp;cntnt01detailtemplate=nigeriadet&amp;cntnt01returnid=108 |title=A Stable and Secure Nigeria: An Asset to America |publisher=Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Washington, D.C. |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30006066 |title=Boko Haram crisis: Nigeria fury over U.S. arms refusal |publisher=BBC News|date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/with-schoolgirls-still-missing-fragile-us-nigeria-ties-falter.html |title=With Schoolgirls Taken by Boko Haram Still Missing, U.S.-Nigeria Ties Falter |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Eric Schmidt |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cobra/&gt;

On 1 December 2014, the U.S. embassy in Abuja announced that the U.S. had discontinued training a Nigerian battalion at the request of the Nigerian government. A spokesman for the U.S. state department said: "We regret premature termination of this training, as it was to be the first in a larger planned project that would have trained additional units with the goal of helping the Nigerian Army build capacity to counter Boko Haram. The U.S. government will continue other aspects of the extensive bilateral security relationship, as well as all other assistance programs, with Nigeria. The U.S. government is committed to the long tradition of partnership with Nigeria and will continue to engage future requests for cooperation and training".&lt;ref name=cobra&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2014/12/01/nigeria-ends-us-mission-counter-boko-haram/19743581/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141201234012/http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2014/12/01/nigeria-ends-us-mission-counter-boko-haram/19743581/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 December 2014 |title=Nigeria ends U.S. mission to counter Boko Haram |newspaper=Navy Times |author=Jeff Schogol |author2=Joe Gould |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2856602/Nigeria-cancels-US-military-training-fight-Boko-Haram.html |title=Nigeria cancels US military training to fight Boko Haram |newspaper=Daily Mail |agency=AFP |date=1 December 2014 |accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2015, the White House announced a military aid package for African allies fighting Boko Haram. The package included up to $45 million for training and other support for Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/24/us-usa-boko-haram-whitehouse-idUSKCN0RO2BY20150924|title=U.S. directs up to $45 million to support countries fighting Boko Haram|agency=Reuters|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October, the White House released a statement, in accordance with the [[War Powers Resolution]], announcing the deployment of 300 troops to Cameroon to conduct airborne ISR: "These forces are equipped with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security, and they will remain in Cameroon until their support is no longer needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/14/letter-from-president-war-powers-resolution-cameroon|title=Letter From The President-- War Powers Resolution Regarding Cameroon|work=The White House|author=Barack Obama|date=14 October 2015|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African Coalition force===
After a series of meetings over many months,&lt;ref name="ngrguardiannews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sunnewsonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Cameroon's foreign minister announced on 30 November 2014 that a coalition force to fight terrorism, including Boko Haram, would soon be operational.

===French and British assistance===
France and the United Kingdom, in coordination with the United States, have sent trainers and material assistance to Nigeria to assist in the fight against Boko Haram.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1507498/china-pledges-help-nigerias-hunt-boko-haram-militants |title=China pledges help to Nigeria's hunt for Boko Haram militants |date=8 May 2014 |work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; France planned to use 3,000 troops in the region for counter-terrorism operations.

In 2017, the United Kingdom enforced an emergency assistance package worth $259 million. The United Kingdom has also aided Nigeria through military support and counter-terrorism training. The British government has provided provided training to 28,000 Nigerian military troops to aid against Boko Haram. More than 40 British troops have also been sent long term to Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|title=UK government doubles Nigerian aid package to help fight Boko Haram|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/30/africa/uk-foreign-secretary-boris-johnson-nigeria-visit-boko-haram/index.html|website=CNN|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese assistance===
In May 2014, China offered Nigeria assistance that included satellite data, and possibly military equipment.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;

===Colombian assistance===
In October 2015, [[Colombia]] sent a delegation of security experts to assist the Nigerian authorities and share expertise on security and counter terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Talatu Usman, [http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/191413-boko-haram-obasanjo-leads-colombian-security-experts-to-buhari.html "Boko Haram: Obasanjo leads Colombian security experts to Buhari"], ''Premium Times'', 12 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, a delegation led by [[Tukur Yusuf Buratai|Lieutenant General Tukur Yusuf Buratai]] also visited Colombia to exchange information in regards to the war against Boko Haram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2016/01/in-pictures-lt-general-buratai-visits-colombia/ |title=In Pictures: Lt.

[[File:BNHS - Hornbill House (386658001).jpg|thumb|right|Hornbill House, the head office of the Bombay Natural History Society.]]
The '''Bombay Natural History Society''', founded on 15 September 1883, is one of the largest non-governmental organisations in India engaged in [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[biodiversity]] research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/international/asian/india/resources/india-organizations.html ''Organizations: India'']. US Library of Congress, Portals to the World. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It supports many research efforts through grants and publishes the ''[[Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society]]''. Many prominent naturalists, including the ornithologists [[Salim Ali (ornithologist)|Sálim Ali]] and [[S. Dillon Ripley]], have been associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bnhs.org/article.php?cid=MTU=&amp;sid=MA%3D%3D&amp;t=Mg==&amp;aid=MQ%3D%3D BNHS:Mission and Vision] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030145913/http://bnhs.org/article.php?cid=MTU%3D&amp;sid=MA%3D%3D&amp;t=Mg%3D%3D&amp;aid=MQ%3D%3D |date=2007-10-30 }}, Bombay Natural History Society. Retrieved 3 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The society is commonly known by its initials, BNHS. BNHS is the partner of [[BirdLife International]] in India. It has been designated as a 'Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation' by the Department of Science and Technology. It's headquarter is in Mumbai and has one regional centre at Wetland Research and Training Centre, near [[Chilika Lake]], [[Odisha]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/bnhs-to-open-its-regional-centre-today/article24788326.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:JPNHS titlepage1a.jpg|right|thumb|Title page of volume 1, number 1, of the ''[[Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society]]'', 1886.]]
On 15 September 1883 eight men interested in [[natural history]] met at [[Bombay]] in the then Victoria and Albert Museum (now [[Bhau Daji Lad Museum]]) and:&lt;ref name="JBNHS#1"&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Aitken|editor-first=E.H.|editor2-first=R. A. |editor2-last=Sterndale |date=January 1886|title=Introduction|journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural Society|publisher=Education Society's Press|location=Bombay|volume= 1|issue= 1|url=https://archive.org/details/journalofbombayn01bomb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|constituted themselves as the Bombay Natural History Society. They proposed to meet monthly and exchange notes, exhibit interesting specimens and otherwise encourage each other.}}

According to [[Edward Hamilton Aitken|E. H. Aitken]] (the first honorary secretary, September 1883-March 1886), Dr G. A. Maconochie was the ''{{lang|la|fons et origo}}'' (Latin for "source and origin") of the society. The other founders were Dr D. MacDonald, [[Charles Swinhoe|Col. C. Swinhoe]], Mr J. C. Anderson, Mr J. Johnston, Dr [[Atmaram Pandurang]] and Dr [[Sakharam Arjun]].&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Reuben (2005) The Indian Founders. ''Hornbill'' (Apr-Jun): pp.13-15&lt;/ref&gt; Mr [[H. M. Phipson]] (second honorary secretary, 1886–1906) was a part of the founding group. He lent a part of his wine shop at 18 Forbes Street to the BNHS as an office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The founders, the builders and the guardians. Part I. |author=Ali, Salim| journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society| year=1978| volume=75| issue=3| pages= 559–569|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofbomba751978bomb#page/n15/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, [[R. C. Wroughton]] a BNHS member and forest officer organised a survey of mammals making use of the members spread through the [[Indian subcontinent]] to provide specimens. This was perhaps the first collaborative natural history study in the world. It resulted in a collection of 50,000 specimens in 12 years. Several new species were discovered, 47 publications were published, and the understanding of biogeographic boundaries was improved.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Paul &amp; Matt Ridley. Biology under the Raj. ''New Scientist''. (22 September 1983) pp. 857-867&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, the ''Journal of the BNHS'' reviewed contemporary literature from other parts of the world. The description of ant-bird interactions in German by [[Erwin Stresemann]] was reviewed in a 1935 issue leading to the introduction of the term ''[[Anting (bird activity)|anting]]'' into English.

Today the BNHS is headquartered in the specially constructed 'Hornbill House' in southern [[Mumbai]]. It sponsors studies in Indian wildlife and conservation, and publishes a four-monthly journal, ''[[Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society]]'' (''[[JBNHS]]''), as well as a quarterly magazine, ''Hornbill''.

==BNHS logo==

The BNHS logo is the [[great hornbill]], inspired by a great hornbill named William, who lived on the premises of the Society from 1894 until 1920, during the honorary secretaryships of [[H. M. Phipson]] until 1906 and [[W. S. Millard]] from 1906 to 1920.&lt;ref name=phipson-william&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Great Indian Hornbill in captivity |volume=11 |url=http://biostor.org/reference/169867 |issue=2 |journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |author=Phipson, H M |year=1897 |pages=307–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was created in 1933, the silver-jubilee year of the Society's founding.

===William===
According to H. M. Phipson, William was born in May 1894 and presented to the Society three months later by H. Ingle of [[Karwar]]. He reached his full length ({{convert|4.25|ft|m}} by the end of his third year. His diet consisted of fruit, (like plantains and wild figs) and also of live mice, scorpions, and plain raw meat, which he ate with relish.&lt;ref name=phipson-william/&gt; He apparently did not drink water, nor use it for bathing.&lt;ref name=phipson-william/&gt; William was known for catching tennis balls thrown at him from a distance of some 30 feet with his beak.&lt;ref name=phipson-william/&gt;

In his obituary of W. S. Millard, Sir [[Norman Boyd Kinnear|Norman Kinnear]] made the following remarks about William:&lt;ref name=kinnear&gt;{{cite journal |title=W. S. Millard |volume=50 |url=http://biostor.org/reference/169868 |journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |author=Kinnear, Norman B |year=1952 |pages=910–913}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|Every visitor to the Society's room in Appollo Street will remember the great Indian Hornbill, better known as the "office canary" which lived in a cage behind Millard's chair in Phipson &amp; Co.'s office for 26 years and died in 1920. It is said its death was caused by swallowing a piece of wire, but in the past "William" had swallowed a lighted cigar without ill effects and I for my part think that the loss of his old friend was the principal cause.}}

==Internet of Birds==
IT consultancy firm Accenture and the Bombay Natural History Society have developed  Internet of Birds platform that identifies bird species found in India using Artificial Intelligence technology, including machine learning and computer vision, from digital photos that are uploaded by the public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8950">'''Bose–Einstein condensation of polaritons''' is a growing field in semiconductor optics research, which exhibits [[Coherent_states|spontaneous coherence]] similar to a [[laser]], but through a different mechanism. A continuous transition from [[polariton]] condensation to lasing can be made similar to that of the crossover from a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] to a [[BCS theory| BCS state]] in the context of Fermi gases.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Themes of Bose-Einstein Condensation, published by Cambridge University Press (2017). {{ISBN|978-1107085695}}, {{ISBN|1107085691}} This book reviews much of the work on polariton condensation, and compares and contrasts these condensates to atomic condensates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Deng, H. Haug, and Y. Yamamoto,”Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation,” Reviews of Modern Physics 82, 1489 (2010). DOI: 10.1103/RevModPhys.82.1489&lt;/ref&gt; Polariton condensation is sometimes called “lasing without inversion”.&lt;ref&gt;I. Carusotto and C. Ciuti, “Quantum fluids of light,” Reviews of Modern Physics 85, 299 (2013). DOI: 10.1103/RevModPhys.85.299&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Snoke and J. Keeling, “Polariton condensates come of age,” Physics Today, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Polaritons are [[boson]]ic [[quasiparticle]]s which can be thought of as [[Dressed_particle|dressed photons]]. In an [[optical cavity]], photons have an effective mass, and when the optical [[resonance]] in a cavity is brought near in energy to an electronic resonance (typically an [[exciton]]) in a medium inside the cavity, the photons become strongly interacting, and repel each other. They therefore act like atoms which can approach equilibrium due to their collisions with each other, and can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) at high density or low temperature. The Bose condensate of polaritons then emits coherent light like a laser. Because the mechanism for the onset of coherence is the interactions between the polaritons, and not the optical gain that comes from [[Population inversion|inversion]], the threshold density can be quite low.

==History==
The theory of polariton BEC was first proposed by [[Atac Imamoglu]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Imamoglu, R.J. Ram, S. Pau, and Y. Yamamoto, “Nonequilibrium condensates and lasers without inversion: Exciton-polariton lasers,” Phys. Rev. A 53, 4250 (1996). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.53.4250&lt;/ref&gt; and coauthors including [[Yoshihisa Yamamoto (scientist)|Yoshihisa Yamamoto]]. These authors claimed observation of this effect in a subsequent paper,&lt;ref&gt;S. Pau et al., “Observation of a laserlike transition in a microcavity exciton polariton system,”
Phys. Rev. A 54,  R1789 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; but this was eventually shown to be standard lasing.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kira et al., “Quantum theory of nonlinear semiconductor microcavity luminescence explaining ‘boser’ experiments.” Physical Review Letters 79, 5170 (1997). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.5170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Cao et al., “Transition from a microcavity exciton polariton to a photon laser,” Physical Review A  55,  4632 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In later work in collaboration with the research group of [[:fr:Jacqueline Bloch|Jacqueline Bloch]], the structure was redesigned to include several [[quantum well]]s inside the cavity to prevent saturation of the exciton resonance, and in 2002 evidence for nonequilibrium condensation was reported&lt;ref&gt;H. Deng et al., “Condensation of semiconductor microcavity exciton polaritons,” Science 298,  199 (2002). DOI: 10.1126/science.1074464&lt;/ref&gt; which included photon-photon correlations consistent with spontaneous coherence. Later experimental groups have used essentially the same design. In 2006, the group of Benoit Deveaud and coauthors reported the first widely accepted claim of nonequilibrium Bose–Einstein condensation of polaritons&lt;ref&gt;J. Kasprzak et al., “Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton polaritons,” Nature 443, 409 (2006).
DOI: 10.1038/nature05131&lt;/ref&gt; based on measurement of the momentum distribution of the polaritons. Although the system was not in equilibrium, a clear peak in the ground state of the system was seen, a canonical prediction of BEC.  Both of these experiments created a polariton gas in an uncontrolled free expansion. In 2007, the experimental group of [[David W. Snoke|David Snoke]] demonstrated nonequilibrium Bose–Einstein condensation of polaritons in a trap,&lt;ref&gt;R. Balili; V. Hartwell; D.W. Snoke; L. Pfeiffer; K. West (2007). "Bose-Einstein Condensation of Microcavity Polaritons in a Trap," Science 316 (5827): 1007–10. Bibcode:2007Sci...316.1007B. {{PMID|17510360}}. doi:10.1126/science.1140990.&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the way atoms are confined in traps for Bose–Einstein condensation experiments. The observation of polariton condensation in a trap was significant because the polaritons were displaced from the laser excitation spot, so that the effect could not be attributed to a simple nonlinear effect of the laser light. Jaqueline Bloch and coworkers observed polariton condensation in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;E. Wertz et al., “Spontaneous formation of a polariton condensate in a planar GaAs microcavity,” Applied Physics Letters 95, 051108 (2009). DOI: 10.1063/1.3192408&lt;/ref&gt; after which many other [[experimentalist]]s reproduced the effect (for reviews see the bibliography). Evidence for polariton [[superfluidity]] was reported in by Alberto Amo and coworkers,&lt;ref&gt;A. Amo et al., “Superfluidity of polaritons in semiconductor microcavities,” Nature Physics 5 805 (2009). DOI: 10.1038/NPHYS1364&lt;/ref&gt; based on the suppressed scattering of the polaritons during their motion. This effect has been seen more recently at room temperature,&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Lerario  et al. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03153 "Room-temperature superfluidity in a polariton condensate"].&lt;/ref&gt; which is the first evidence of room temperature [[superfluidity]], albeit in a highly nonequilibrium system.

==Equilibrium polariton condensation==
The first clear demonstration of Bose–Einstein condensation of polaritons in equilibrium&lt;ref&gt;Y.N. Sun et al., “Bose-Einstein Condensation of long-lifetime polaritons in thermal equilibrium,” Physical Review Letters 118, 016602 (2017). DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.016602&lt;/ref&gt; was reported by a collaboration of [[David W. Snoke|David Snoke]], [[Keith A. Nelson|Keith Nelson]], and coworkers, using high quality structures fabricated by Loren Pfeiffer and Ken West at Princeton. Prior to this result, polariton condensates were always observed out of equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., T. Byrnes, Na Young Kim and Y. Yamamoto, “Exciton–polariton condensates,” Nature Physics 10, 803 (2014) doi:10.1038/nphys3143;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., D. Sanvitto and S. Kéna-Cohen, “The road towards polaritonic devices,” Nature Materials 15, 1061 (2016) doi:10.1038/nmat4668&lt;/ref&gt; All of the above studies used [[optical pumping]] to create the condensate. Electrical injection, which enables a polariton laser which could be a practical device, was shown in 2013 by two groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, P.; Xiao, B.; Das, A.; Bhowmick, S.; Heo, J. (2013). "Solid State Electrically Injected Exciton-Polariton Laser". Physical Review Letters. 110 (20): 206403. Bibcode:2013PhRvL.110t6403B. {{PMID|25167434}}. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.206403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, C. et al (2013). "An electrically pumped polariton laser." Nature. 497: 348–352. Bibcode:2013Natur.497..348S. doi:10.1038/nature12036.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonequilibrium condensation==
Polariton condensates are an example, and the most well studied example, of Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles. Because most of the experimental work on polariton condensates used structures with very short polariton lifetime, a large body of theory has addressed the properties of nonequilibrium condensation and superfluidity. In particular, Jonathan Keeling&lt;ref&gt;J. Keeling, “Superfluid Density of an Open Dissipative Condensate,” Physical Review Letters 107, 080402 (2011). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.080402&lt;/ref&gt; and Iacopo Carusotto and C. Ciuti &lt;ref&gt;I. Carusotto and C. Ciuti, “Probing microcavity polariton superfluidity through resonant Rayleigh scattering,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 166401 (2004). DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.166401&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that although a condensate with dissipation is not a “true” superfluid, it still has a critical velocity for onset of superfluid effects.

The '''EL84''' is a [[vacuum tube|thermionic valve]] of the power [[pentode]] type. It is used in the power output stages of audio amplifiers, most commonly now in [[guitar amplifier]]s, but originally in radios. The EL84 is smaller and more sensitive than the octal [[6V6]] that was widely used around the world until the 1960s. An interchangeable North American type is the ''6BQ5'' (the [[RETMA tube designation]] name for the EL84).

The EL84 was developed to eliminate the need for a driver tube in radios, so it has rather more gain than is usual in a power pentode. Eliminating  a [[preamplifier]] triode in radios made them cheaper. Manufacturers were quick to adopt it in general use, and they are found in many old European valve radios and other audio equipment. A single EL84 was used in low-cost equipment, and a [[Push–pull output|push–pull]] pair for lower distortion and higher power.

In common with all 'E' prefix tubes, using the [[Mullard–Philips tube designation]], it has a heater voltage of 6.3V. It is can produce 17 watts output in [[Electronic amplifier|Class AB1]] in push–pull configuration. Many guitar amplifiers routinely run EL84 tubes in excess of 400VDC, with the Traynor Guitarmate reportedly putting out 25w RMS with 2 EL84's in a push–pull configuration and a B+ between 400-420VDC.

Developed by [[Philips]] in 1953 for use in the British [[Mullard 5-10]] amplifier,{{citation needed|reason=Was the valve developed for the amplifier or (more likely) vice versa|date=August 2016}} the EL84 came to prominence when used in Watkins (and later the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]]) amplifiers preferred by many [[British Invasion]] bands of the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== N709, 6BQ5/EL84/6P15, and other exact equivalents==
The 1959 "Miniwatt" Technical Data book from [[Philips]] lists the '''6BQ5''' as the [[RETMA tube designation|R.E.T.M.A.]] (American) name for the EL84 in its "Type Number Cross Reference",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Miniwatt" Technical Data|date=1958|publisher=The "Miniwatt" Electronics Division of Philips Electrical Industries Pty. Limited|location=20 Herbert Street, Artarmon, N.S.W., Australia|page=158|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence an ''exact'' substitute. American and Japanese manufacturers might label their versions of the EL84 as "'''EL84/6BQ5'''" or "'''6BQ5/EL84'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sylvania Receiving Tubes Technical Manual|publisher=reprinted by Audio Amateur Press|page=124|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "6BQ5" Other manufacturers followed with their versions, such as the '''N709''' from General Electric Co. Ltd. of England and the '''6P15''' from UK brand Mazda, that were designed to be "drop-in" substitutes.  The '''CV2975''' is the military designation (Common Valve) for EL84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A simple CV Register cross reference|url=http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/aaa/cv_register.htm|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other equivalent tubes are the '''7189''' and '''7189A''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7189A|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_7189a.html|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7189 &amp; 7189A Datasheets from Sylvania|url=http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/106/7/7189.pdf|accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extended-ratings version of the tube for industrial applications, '''E84L''' ('''7320''') long life, professional version with more than 10000 hours expected lifetime and the directly equivalent '''6P14P''' (Cyrillic: '''6П14П''') produced in the [[USSR]] by the Reflektor plant.  {{As of|2012}} a slightly modified version of the 6P14P was manufactured in Russia for [[Sovtek]].  An extended-ratings version of the 6P14P is also available - '''6P14P-EV''' (Cyrillic: '''6П14П-ЕВ''') and is known among US guitar players as "'''EL84M'''" or the "Russian military EL84".  While not necessarily a true "military version" of the tube (in fact it is more comparable to the '''7189'''), 6P14P-EVs are known for their low noise and durability.  Large NOS (New Old Stock) supplies of the tube are available.
The '''6GK6''' has nearly equivalent operating characteristics with a different pinout.

{{As of|2012}} the tube was manufactured in [[Russia]] ([[Sovtek]] and [[Electro-Harmonix]] brands), [[Slovakia]]- [[Čadca]] ([[JJ Electronic]]), and [[Serbia]]- [[Niš]] (Ei).  The Sovtek EL84 is often sold under their own brand name by other well-known [[electric guitar]] and [[guitar amplifier]] manufacturers - such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] or [[Mesa Boogie]].

Also see [[6P1P]].

== PL84, UL84 and EL86 ==
Although [[RCA]] and Sylvania produced the '''8BQ5''' and '''10BQ5''' as exact equivalents to the '''6BQ5/EL84''' other than heater voltage/current, most variants of the EL84 (e.g. the '''15CW5/PL84''') for series-heater applications such as television receivers (where it was most economical to directly-rectify the mains) made slight changes to the geometry of the original EL84 design to optimise performance for the slightly lower power supply voltages. When a 6.3V heater version of the PL84 was needed, the type number '''EL86''' was assigned; the EL86 and PL84 are therefore very similar to, but ''not exactly identical'' to, the original EL84.

== Characteristics ==
Note: Specifications given for the EL84, PL84 and UL84 are from Philips;  [[RCA]] and [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] list slightly higher voltage ratings for Va and Vkf and lower for Vg2 for the xCW5 series - the 6CW5/EL86, 8CW5/XL86, 10CW5/LL86, 15CW5/PL84, and 30CW5/HL84.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philips Data Handbook - Electron Tubes Part 4|date=1967|publisher=Philips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EL86 @ The National Valve Museum|url=http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aad0122.htm|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5646">Equilibrium [[isotope fractionation]] is the partial separation of [[isotopes]] between two or more substances in [[chemical equilibrium]]. '''Equilibrium fractionation''' is strongest at low temperatures, and (along with [[kinetic isotope effect]]s) forms the basis of the most widely used isotopic [[paleothermometer]]s (or [[proxy (climate)|climate proxies]]): [[deuterium|D/H]] and [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]] records from [[ice cores]], and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O records from calcium carbonate. It is thus important for the construction of [[geologic temperature record]]s.&lt;ref name='Urey_1947'&gt;{{cite journal | author=H. C. Urey | year=1947 | journal=[[J. Chem. Soc.]] | title=The Thermodynamic Properties of Isotopic Substances | pages=562–581 | doi=10.1039/JR9470000562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Isotopic fractionations attributed to equilibrium processes have been observed in many elements, from hydrogen ([[deuterium|D/H]]) to uranium ([[Isotopes of uranium|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U/&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]]). In general, the light elements (especially [[hydrogen]], [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]]) are most susceptible to fractionation, and their isotopes tend to be separated to a greater degree than heavier elements.

== Definition ==
Most equilibrium fractionations are thought to result from the reduction in vibrational energy (especially [[zero-point energy]]) when a more massive isotope is substituted for a less massive one. This leads to higher concentrations of the massive isotopes in substances where the vibrational energy is most sensitive to isotope substitution, i.e., those with the highest bond force constants.

In a reaction involving the exchange of two isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|l}}&lt;/sup&gt;X and &lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|h}}&lt;/sup&gt;X, of element "X" in [[molecule]]s AX and BX,

:&lt;chem&gt;{A^\mathit{l} X} + B^\mathit{h} X &lt;=&gt; {A^\mathit{h} X} +  B^\mathit{l} X&lt;/chem&gt;

each reactant molecule is identical to a product except for the distribution of isotopes (i.e., they are [[isotopologue]]s). The amount of isotopic fractionation in an exchange reaction can be expressed as a fractionation factor:

:&lt;math chem&gt;\alpha = \frac{(^h\ce{X}/^l\ce{X})_\ce{AX}}{(^h\ce{X}/^l\ce{X})_\ce{BX}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the isotopes are distributed evenly between AX and BX, with no isotopic fractionation. &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; indicates that &lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|h}}&lt;/sup&gt;X is concentrated in substance AX, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; indicates &lt;sup&gt;{{mvar|h}}&lt;/sup&gt;X is concentrated in substance BX. {{mvar|&amp;alpha;}} is closely related to the [[equilibrium constant]] (K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = (K_{eq} \cdot \Pi \sigma_{Products}/ \Pi \sigma_{Reactants})^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi\sigma_{Products}&lt;/math&gt; is the product of the [[rotational symmetry]] numbers of the products (right side of the exchange reaction), &lt;math&gt;\Pi\sigma_{Reactants}&lt;/math&gt; is the product of the rotational symmetry numbers of the reactants (left side of the exchange reaction), and {{mvar|n}} is the number of atoms exchanged.

An example of equilibrium isotope fractionation is the concentration of heavy isotopes of [[oxygen]] in liquid [[water]], relative to [[water vapor]],

:&lt;chem&gt;{H2{^{16}O}{(l)}} + {H2{^{18}O}{(g)}} &lt;=&gt; {H2{^{18}O}{(l)}} + {H2{^{16}O}{(g)}}&lt;/chem&gt;

At 20&amp;nbsp;°C, the equilibrium fractionation factor for this reaction is

:&lt;math chem&gt;\alpha = \frac\ce{(^{18}O/^{16}O)_{Liquid}}\ce{(^{18}O/^{16}O)_{Vapor}} = 1.0098 &lt;/math&gt;

Equilibrium fractionation is a type of mass-dependent isotope fractionation, while [[mass-independent fractionation]] is usually assumed to be a [[non-equilibrium]] process.

For non-equilibrium reactions, isotopic effects are better described by the GEBIK and GEBIF equations for [[transient kinetic isotope fractionation]], which generalize non-steady isotopic effects in any chemical and biochemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi F. and W. J. Riley, (2010), Mathematical treatment of isotopologue and isotopomer speciation and fractionation in biochemical kinetics, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, {{doi|10.1016/j.gca.2009.12.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
When [[water vapor]] condenses (an equilibrium fractionation), the heavier water isotopes (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) become enriched in the liquid phase while the lighter isotopes (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) tend toward the vapor phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Retrieved 23 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]], [[Poland]] and the [[UK]], Delta estimates that supply-side options can contribute up to 32% of the overall goal of a 20% carbon emission reduction and up to 26% of an overall goal to reduce [[primary energy consumption]] by 20%.&lt;ref name=DeltaReportSep/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeltaReportMay/&gt;

EME² argues that ensuring supply-side [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] requires system-wide cohesion and investment, from the supply and conversion of primary energy through to the transmission and distribution of power and heat.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt;  The movement places no emphasis on a specific energy source and argues that Europe will continue to rely on a broad mix of [[energy sources]] and innovative technologies over the coming decades.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; Such a mix would evolve and vary from region to region and country to country for both political and practical reasons.&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt; EME² define's its purpose as to "help drive understanding and uptake of policy strategies and technologies for maximising supply-side, system-wide efficiencies whatever the mix".&lt;ref name=EME21/&gt;

The concept of efficient energy goes beyond just reducing [[greenhouse gases]]; it is about the efficient use of our resources, our [[fuel]], [[water]] and [[land (economics)|land]].&lt;ref name=EER1&gt;European Energy Review 15/04/2011. [http://www.europeanenergyreview.eu/site/pagina.php?id=2905 Europe’s energy future is not only about energy efficiency, it’s also about ‘Efficient Energy’]. Retrieved 27 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is about developing a more resource efficient energy production and delivery system in Europe.&lt;ref name=EER1/&gt;

== EU policy today ==
[[European Union|EU]] policy-makers have given significant attention has been given to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] amongst energy consumers.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; Policies addressing to this 'end-use' energy efficiency including encouraging the renovation and increased insulation of buildings, promoting [[European Union energy label|energy label]]s for electrical appliances and phasing out high-energy light bulbs.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; EME² argues more attention should now be paid to supply-side energy efficiency.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt;

The [[European Commission]] has begun to address these issues.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; In its Energy Efficiency Plan (March 2011), the European Commission called on [[EU member states]] to expand the scope of their energy efficiency policies beyond the demand side to the supply side, i.e. energy production and delivery.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; Specifically the plan calls for the increaseduse of energy production from [[co-generation]] and [[combined heat and power]] systems to help Europe achieve its energy goals.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt; The Commission is further looking to strengthen the basis for [[wikt:national grid|national grid]] regulators consider energy efficiency issues in their decisions and in monitoring the management and operation of [[gas]] and [[electricity grid]]s and markets.&lt;ref name=EurActiv1/&gt;

In September 2011, the [[European Commission]] also released a Roadmap for a Resource Efficient Europe.&lt;ref name=ECRER&gt;European Commission 20/09/2011. [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/resource_efficiency/pdf/com2011_571.pdf Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe]. Retrieved 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; That roadmap described the economic benefits of using resources more efficiently, by creating major economic opportunities for companies and workers, improving productivity, reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; A key and potentially most controversial plank of the Commission proposal is to shift [[taxation]] from [[Labor (economics)|labour]] to resource use.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; It seeks to address market prices that do not reflect the true costs of using resources and their environmental impacts, by removing Environmentally Harmful Subsidies (EHS).&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; The roadmap also suggests turning waste into a key resource with the aim of decreasing the [[European Union|EU]]'s dependency on imports of [[raw materials]], lower impacts on the [[Natural environment|environment]] and open up new markets.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt; The roadmap sets a 2020 target for all key resources – [[ecosystem services]], [[biodiversity]], minerals and [[metals]], [[water]], [[air]], [[land (economics)|land]] and [[soil]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] resources – and lists a series of actions and initiatives the [[European Union|EU]] and its member states should embark on.&lt;ref name=ECRER/&gt;

'''Polish forests''' cover about 30% of Poland's territory, and are mostly owned by the state. Western and northern parts of [[Poland]] as well as the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the extreme south, are much more forested than eastern and central provinces.&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt; The most forested [[Voivodeship|administrative districts]] of the country are: [[Lubusz Voivodeship]] (48,9%), [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]] (37,2%), and [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]] (36,1%).&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt; The least forested are: [[Łódź Voivodeship]] (21%), [[Masovian Voivodeship]] (22,6%), and [[Lublin Voivodeship]] (22,8%).&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt;

==Contemporary history==
At the end of the 18th century, forests covered around 40% of [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=rap09&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://bip.lasy.gov.pl/pl/bip/px_~raport_o_stanie_lasow_09.pdf?page_opener=http%3A%2F%2Fbip.lasy.gov.pl%2Fpl%2Fbip%2Fraporty_i_prognozy Raport o stanie lasów w Polsce 2009] (Raport on the state of forests in Poland 2009), Centrum Informacyjne Lasów Państwowych, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the 19th century economic exploitation during the [[partitions of Poland]], as well as, the [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Nazi German and Soviet occupations]] between 1939–1945 with trees shipped to battle fronts across Europe, [[deforestation]] and [[slash and burn]] conditions of war shrank Polish forests to only 21% of total area of the country (as of 1946).&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt; Furthermore, rich [[deciduous tree]]s were replaced with fast growing [[coniferous tree]]s of lesser value meant for commerce, such as [[pine]]. After [[World War II]], the government of Poland initiated the National Plan of Afforestation. By 1970, forests covered 29% of the country.&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt; As of 2009 – 29,1% of Poland's territory was forested, amounting to 9,088,000 [[hectare]]s.&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt; It is estimated that by 2050, the total area of forested land should increase to 33%.&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt;

As much as 81,8% of the Polish forests are state-owned, majority (77,8%) by [[Polish State Forests]] (Lasy Panstwowe), 2% constitute [[Polish National Forests]] protected zones, 2% are owned by other governmental entities (such as local [[self-government]] or the [[Agricultural Property Agency]]) and 18,2% belong to private owners.&lt;ref name=rap09/&gt; High percentage of Polish forests owned by the state is the result of [[nationalization]] of forests that occurred in the [[aftermath of World War II]] when Poland became a [[communist state]] (see [[People's Republic of Poland]]) under the Soviet sphere of influence.

==Inhabitation==
Forest in Poland occupy the poorest soil. [[Coniferous]] type accounts for 54.5%, whereas [[broadleaved]] type accounts for 45.5% (out of that, [[alder]] and [[riparian]] forests account for 3.8%).&lt;ref name=state2009&gt;[http://www.lasy.gov.pl/dokumenty/in_english/files/the_state_forests_in_figures2009-pdf/view The State Forests in Figures 2009.]  Official website of the [[Polish State Forests]] with [[PDF]] document, 3.606 MB.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of forested zones are now protected by the [[Polish government]] and, in many cases, they have become tourist destinations. Over the years, many of the largest Polish forests have been reduced in size, and that reflected on the structure of forest inhabitation.&lt;ref name="gov.pl" /&gt;

Up until the end of the 18th Century, beginning in what is known as the [[Middle Ages]], forests were considered places for travelers and ordinary folk to stay away from, as they were home to bandits and were believed to be inhabited by evil spirits. Law and order did not apply to forests for many centuries, except for self-policing observed and administered by their inhabitants. However, the forests did contain numerous woodsmen and their families who made the best of their remote environment. These woodsmen lived on what the forest could produce, collecting [[pitch (resin)|pitch resin]] for sale – important as method of illuminating city streets – logging construction [[lumber]], collecting [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], [[bees wax]], [[honey]], [[hops]], [[mushrooms]] and whatever other saleable items could be harvested in the forest and sold in villages outside of it.

Families of the woodsmen produced their own food through gardening and hunting, as well as their own clothing. In some cases, their sewing of intricate laces became well known outside the forest, resulting in additional family income.&lt;ref name="gov.pl"&gt;[http://www.kolegium.lasy.gov.pl/editor-cm-web-portlet/content/Mjgw/Raport%20o%20stanie%20las%C3%B3w%20w%20Polsce%202006.pdf State Forests of Poland. Report of Polish Forests, Warsaw, September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their isolation from society in general, woodsmen and their families developed their own style of dress, music, sewing, dialect, celebrations, and the type of dwellings. The [[Masovia]] woodsmen for example, known as [[Kurpie]] people, who lived in the forested region known in Poland as the White Wilderness ([[Puszcza Biała]]) and the Green Wilderness, still proudly proclaim and celebrate their unique culture and customs.

The '''Google Maps pin''' is the inverted-drop-shaped icon that marks locations in [[Google Maps]]. The pin is protected under a U.S. [[design patent]] as "teardrop-shaped marker icon including a shadow".&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/50/209/D06/1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://pimg-fpiw.uspto.gov/fdd/13/214/D06/0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Google has used the pin in various graphics, games, and promotional materials.

The pin, sometimes referred to as "the marker"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Customizing Google Maps: Custom Markers | work = Google Developers | date = 7 October 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-11 | url = https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/customizing/custom-markers}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has been widely co-opted by other companies, organizations, and individuals for their own marketing efforts, artwork, and activism. In both digital and physical representations, the pin is often used to symbolize mapping software and the technology industry as a whole.

The Google Maps pin has been called "a product of pure function that has evolved into a cultural phenomenon"&lt;ref name="6thf_WhoM"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Who Made Google's Map Pin? | author = Hilary Greenbaum | work = The New York Times' 6th Floor Blog | date = 18 April 2011 | accessdate = 2014-12-11 | url = http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/who-made-googles-map-pin/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a solution that would take on a life of its own, recognizable enough to stick up for itself in the art and design projects of others".&lt;ref name="desi_Stea"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stealth Iconography: The Google Maps Pin | author = Rob Walker | work = Design Observer | date = 16 June 2011 | accessdate = 2014-12-11 | url = http://designobserver.com/feature/stealth-iconography-the-google-maps-pin/28118

==History==
[[Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen]] designed the Google Maps pin prior to the launch of Google Maps in 2005. He wanted the pin to accurately mark a point on a map without obscuring the location.&lt;ref name="6thf_WhoM" /&gt; The main body of the pin is circular at the top, but tapers into a point at the bottom, forming an inverted teardrop shape. A drop shadow extends from the point at the bottom, giving the pin a three-dimensional look.

In the original version of Google Maps, the pin was displayed with the letters "A" through "J" when there was more than one search results.&lt;ref name="date_Thee"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The era 'A' at Aram Bartholl – Blog | author = Aram Bartholl | work = datenform.de | date = 19 June 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://datenform.de/blog/the-era-a/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions, the pin was shown with a black dot inside to mark a single location.&lt;ref&gt;http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/04/617/D06/1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google released a minor redesign of the pin that changed the black outline of the pin to a dark red for a softer look.&lt;ref name="news_TheG"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Google Maps Pin Gets Modernized, Maps Sports a Fresh New Look

==Use by Google==
Google has used the pin in online and traditional print marketing campaigns for Google Maps. The pin is displayed as part of the icon for the Google Maps mobile application, on a stylized map along with an uppercase letter "G" for "Google."

===Promotional materials===
[[File:Google Maps at Deschutes.jpg|thumb|upright=0.78|[[Deschutes Brewery]], 2011]]
The pin has been used on promotional objects like beer glasses, stickers, and coffee cup sleeves in various marketing campaigns.&lt;ref name="davi_Mihm"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Mihmorandum {{!}} Google Brings Portland Hotpot Campaign to a Rolling Boil {{!}} Google | author = David Mihm | work = davidmihm.com | date = 2 February 2011 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://www.davidmihm.com/blog/google/hotpot-portland-update/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Google has also designed and sold T-shirts that display a Google Maps pin along with the words "I am here".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Map T-Shirt | work = googlemerchandisestore.com | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = https://www.googlemerchandisestore.com/MadeInUSA/Google+Map+T-Shirt.axd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Favorite Places campaign===
In 2009, Google launched the Favorite Places marketing campaign. 100,000 local businesses received a store-window decal portraying the Google Maps pin on a map, with the words "We're a Favorite Place on Google."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Favorite Places coming to window near you | author = Tom Krazit | work = c{{!}}net | date = 6 December 2009 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://www.cnet.com/news/google-favorite-places-coming-to-window-near-you/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stickers included a [[QR code]] which could be scanned by customers to bring up the business' Place Page in order to leave an online review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Promoting Maps with 100,000 Favorite Places Posters | author = Mike Blumenthal | work = Understanding Google Places &amp; Local Search | date = 7 December 2009 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://blumenthals.com/blog/2009/12/07/google-promoting-maps-with-100000-favorite-places-poster/  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Google commissioned New York-based graphic designer Matt Delbridge for the Hello World ad campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Ad Campaign Cleverly Incorporates Iconic 'Google Maps' Graphics - DesignTAXI.com | author = Dorothy Tan | work = designtaxi.com | date = 8 August 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://designtaxi.com/news/359881/Google-Ad-Campaign-Cleverly-Incorporates-Iconic-Google-Maps-Graphics/?interstital_shown=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the illustrations incorporated the Google Maps pin along with images associated with specific locations around the world.&lt;ref name="thed_Goog"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google unveils 'Hello World' campaign images for newly updated Google Maps | author = Jennifer Faull | work = The Drum | date = 9 August 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/08/09/google-unveils-hello-world-campaign-images-newly-updated-google-maps }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses by Google===
In 2010, Google created online cards that used several pins to spell out "Happy Holidays".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Send a message of holiday cheer with Google Maps | author = Katie Mandel | work = Official Google Blog | date = 16 December 2010 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/send-message-of-holiday-cheer-with.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google doubled the Google Maps pin to create a heart for a Map Your Valentine holiday feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Maps Goes Gooey- MapYourValentine.com | author = Mike Blumenthal | work = Understanding Google Places &amp; Local Search | date = 13 February 2011 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://blumenthals.com/blog/2011/02/13/google-maps-goes-gooey-mapyourvalentine-com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Google partnered with [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] to create a campaign called Pink Pin in New York City. Businesses and consumers were asked to pin their locations on the Pink Pin website, share personal stories related to breast cancer awareness, and donate to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Small businesses in NYC help fight breast cancer with Pink Pin - Google Small Business | author = Ria Tobaccowala | work = googlesmb.blogspot.com | date = 19 October 2011 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://googlesmb.blogspot.com/2011/10/small-businesses-in-nyc-help-fight.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Google launched "Smarty Pins", a browser-based geographical trivia game that features the Google Maps pin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Maps Smarty Pins | work = smartypins.withgoogle.com | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://smartypins.withgoogle.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players receive clues about locations around the world, which they then identify by placing the Google Maps pin on a map. Players start the game with 1,000 points, and lose points equivalent to the number of miles they place their pins from the correct location. Bonus points can be gained by answering the trivia questions quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Maps tests your geography knowledge with 'Smarty Pins' game | author = Chris Welch | work = The Verge | date = 7 July 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/7/5876835/google-smarty-pins-geography-game }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google's Smarty Pins Lets You Test Your Geography Knowledge | author = Frederic Lardinois | work = TechCrunch | date = 1 July 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/01/googles-smarty-pins-lets-you-test-your-geography-knowledge/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by other organizations==
The Google Maps API allows developers to create customized maps, for which they can create their own markers.&lt;ref name="cart_Well" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Customizing Google Maps: Custom Markers | work = Google Developers | date = 7 October 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/customizing/custom-markers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusion in logos===
Although the Google Maps pin is protected under a U.S. [[design patent]], other organizations have used it as a component of their own logos.&lt;ref name="wo-w_Aktu"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Aktuelle Mittagstisch-Angebote in Deiner Umgebung | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://www.wo-wollen-wir-essen.de/ | language = de | quote = Denis Campbell IT Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = PizzaPerto.com - Encontre as pizzarias próximas de você!

The [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] of [[Malta]] used an image closely resembling the Google Maps pin as their logo in the 2014 European Parliament election campaign. A Google spokesperson contacted by The Times of Malta would not comment on whether the logo was a breach of Google's intellectual property rights, though a copyright lawyer interviewed for the article explained that the similarity could result in legal repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google silent on PL map pin similarity | author = Ivan Martin | work = Times of Malta | date = 22 May 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140522/local/Google-silent-on-PL-map-pin-similarity.520018 | quote = Jeanine Rizzo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Facebook filed a trademark application for a design including a marker similar to the Google Maps pin above a representation of a rectangular map, but later abandoned the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = F - Reviews &amp; Brand Information - FACEBOOK, INC.

===Political use===
When Metahaven, an Amsterdam-based studio for design and research, was charged with drafting concepts for Wikileaks' new visual identity, they considered integrating the Google Maps pin, inverted.&lt;ref name="desi_Stea" /&gt; This suggested a dripping leak, and the impossibility of pinpointing the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = In Conversation with Julian Assange, Part I {{!}} e-flux | author = Hans Ulrich Obrist | work = e-flux.com | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-julian-assange-part-i/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In San Francisco, demonstrators in San Francisco have carried signs shaped like the Google Maps pin and bearing the word "evicted" to protest the recent surge in tech-driven evictions in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Anti-gentrification activists "GET OUT" with Pride {{!}} SF Politics | author = Rebecca Bowe | work = sfbg.com | date = 30 June 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-12 | url = http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2013/06/30/anti-gentrification-activists-“get-out”-pride }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Do the Anti-Tech Protests Still Matter? |last=Montgomery |first=Kevin |work=Valleywag |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=2014-12-13 |url=http://valleywag.gawker.com/do-the-anti-tech-protests-still-matter-1596158848 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218102856/http://valleywag.gawker.com/do-the-anti-tech-protests-still-matter-1596158848 |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Google Maps pin has evolved beyond its original intended use to become quasi-iconic in popular culture. [[Rob Walker (journalist)|Rob Walker]] cites the pin as an example of dedigitization, "something from the digital world crossing over to the physical".&lt;ref name="desi_Stea" /&gt; The pin has been used in various mediums not just to pinpoint locations, but to represent abstracts like mapping technology or even the technology industry as a whole.

===Sculpture===
Berlin-based conceptual artist [[Aram Bartholl]] is known for creating works that examine the relationship between the digital and physical world, using popular imagery from software and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Aram Bartholl's "Speed Book" Collapses The Digital World Into Physical Space | author = Noah Robischon | work = Fast Company | date = 14 February 2012 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/3010824/aram-bartholls-speed-book-collapses-the-digital-world-into-physical-space }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006, Bartholl has created a public art installation called ''Map''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Art Imitates Digital Life: Real-World Google Map Pins | author = Stephanie Rogers | work = WebUrbanist | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://weburbanist.com/2012/04/24/art-imitates-digital-life-real-world-google-map-pins/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholl installs a large physical representation of the Google Maps pin in the exact location that Google Maps identifies as the center of a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = gateways. Art and Networked Culture - Works - Map | work = goethe.de | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://www.goethe.de/ins/ee/prj/gtw/aus/wer/bar/enindex.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Locations thus far have included [[Taipei]], [[Berlin]], [[Arles]], and [[Tallinn]]. Each sculpture remains in place for about three months, usually coinciding with a local art festival or exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Map  | author = Aram Bartholl | work = datenform.de | date = 19 June 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://datenform.de/blog/tag/map/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was designed to raise viewers' awareness of the increasing overlap between the virtual and the physical, and to highlight mapping services' influence on perceptions of location. Bartholl's physical representations of the Google Maps pin urges viewers to reevaluate the information given by digitized maps, the meaning of the "center" of a city, the politicization of boundaries, and other issues related to maps and the digital versus the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Aram Bartholl - datenform.de | work = datenform.de | accessdate = 2014-12-13 | url = http://www.datenform.de/mapeng.html }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Royal College of Art]]'s 150th-anniversary exhibition in 2007, student Robert Sollis e-mailed Google requesting a temporary Google Maps marker be placed over the college's temporary site in Kensington Gardens.&lt;ref&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Google_Carpet_Emails.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receiving only an auto-reply, Sollis created his own physical marker, which he hoped would appear in satellite images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Carpet by Robert Sollis | author = Jeannie Choe | work = Core77 - Industrial Design Supersite | date = 19 June 2007 | accessdate = 2014-12-16 | url = http://www.core77.com/blog/object_culture/google_carpet_by_robert_sollis_6609.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sollis constructed the '''Google Carpet''' of individual carpet tiles, each 185mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which corresponds to one pixel of Google's satellite imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Make your own Google map marker for your house | author = jonahbc | work = MAKE | date = 13 November 2008 | accessdate = 2014-12-16 | url = http://makezine.com/2008/11/13/make-your-own-google-map/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, as part of a public art event in [[Horsens]], Denmark, the [[Iceland]]ic-Danish design duo ÖRNDUVALD installed a mural called ''Pin'' at {{coord|55|51|42|N|9|50|47|E}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Partition By ÖRNDUVALD | author = Costas Voyatzis | work = Yatzer.com | date = 20 July 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-20 | url = http://www.yatzer.com/partition-ornduvald }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 9-square-meter piece,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = glittering google map icon made from 10,000 sequins | author = Nina Azzarello | work = designboom {{!}} architecture &amp; design magazine | date = 23 July 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-17 | url = http://www.designboom.com/art/glittering-google-map-icon-made-from-10000-sequins/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; "a giant and shimmering reinterpretation of the Google Maps pin",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Google Maps Pin made from 10.000 sequins by Örnduvald | work = urdesign.it | date = 1 August 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-17 | url = http://www.urdesign.it/index.php/2013/08/01/google-maps-pin-made-from-10-000-sequins-by-ornduvald/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; was made from 10,078 circular discs mounted to plywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Giant Map Pin Installation Made of Metallic Discs | author = Caroline Williamson | work = Design Milk | date = 23 July 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-17 | url = http://design-milk.com/pin-55-51-42-n-9-50-47-e-by-ornduvald/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Kooser of [[cnet]] wrote, "if Liberace had been on the Google Maps design team, all the pins would look like this,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Giant sequined Google Maps pin lands on Denmark | author = Amanda Kooser | work = c{{!}}net | date = 24 July 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-17 | url = http://www.cnet.com/news/giant-sequined-google-maps-pin-lands-on-denmark/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Jamie Condliffe stated in [[Gizmodo]], "The Google Maps pin is iconic: bold and simple, yet incredibly memorable. And emblazoned on the side of a Danish building in twinkling metallic form, it might just be the geekiest mural ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Is This the Geekiest Mural Ever? | last = Condliffe | first = Jamie | work = Gizmodo | date = 25 February 2014 | accessdate = 2014-12-17 | url = https://gizmodo.com/is-this-the-geekiest-mural-ever-1530402651 | quote = Pin (55° 51′ 42″ N ; 9° 50′ 47″ E) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Taiwanese designer Shu-Chun Hsiao created ''Project Google Birdhouse'' by hanging pin-shaped birdhouses around Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Project Google Birdhouse by Shuchun Hsiao  | author =  | work = urdesign.it | date = 15 January 2013 | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | url = http://www.urdesign.it/index.php/2013/01/15/project-google-birdhouse-by-shuchun-hsiao/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 2012 Project Google Birdhouse | author = Shu-Chun Hsiao | work = Flickr | date = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/hvn1007/sets/72157631160876530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, "Google Map had created a remarkable landmark icon, showing the sites on its street views. To search for a landmark with online Google map, we can scroll to zoom from the satellite, soon we’ll be able to wander on streets, virtually. Birds, have the most real experience of google map. Birds can fly through the city, through streets. A birdhouse becomes their destination as google map does. The iconic symbol will become a navigating landmark for the flying birds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = SHUCHUN HSIAO | date = 2012 | accessdate = 2014-12-21 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109170716/http://shuchunhsiao.com/#ccc/custom_plain | archivedate = 2014-01-09 | deadurl = yes | url = http://shuchunhsiao.com/#ccc/custom_plain }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime Derriger wrote, "The icon that we have all come to know and love which graces our Google maps to let us know where we are, or where we need to go, has become ubiquitous.

The '''Hornitos Formation''' is a [[Campanian]] geologic [[Formation (geology)|formation]] of the [[Algarrobal Basin]] in the [[Atacama Region]] of northern [[Chile]]. The formation comprises [[limestone]]s, [[sandstone]]s, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[marl]]s and [[tuff]]. [[Dinosaur]] remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, although none have yet been referred to a specific [[genus]].&lt;ref name="dinosaurdistribution"&gt;Weishampel, et al. (2004). "Dinosaur distribution." Pp. 517-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Hornillos Formation, deposited in the [[Algarrobal Basin]],&lt;ref name=Abad1982_p5&gt;Abad, 1982, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; comprises [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], and [[caliche]]s, intercalated with lavas and [[andesite|andesitic]] [[breccia]]s and various volcanic rocks. Between these last is a conspicuous layer of [[rhyolite|rhyo]]-[[dacite|dactitic]] lithic [[tuff]], which  reaches up to {{convert|10|m|ft}} in thickness. Bones of indeterminate [[titanosaur]]s appear in a [[marl]]y limestone stratum of {{convert|10|m|ft}} thick with decimeter-sized calcareous concretions. The smallest pieces were found as rollings, whereas the larger piece was included in the limestone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=35282 Hornitos] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hornitos Formation formerly was though to be of [[Paleocene]] to [[Eocene]] age.&lt;ref name=Rivera1985_p5&gt;Rivera Cabello, 1985, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The formation may be older and belong to the [[Early Cretaceous]], as a [[granite]] intruded the rocks about 105 ± 10 Ma.&lt;ref name=Rivano1985_p28&gt;Rivano et al., 1986, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sources and influencing factors ==

=== Sources for indoor environments ===
Indoor [[bioaerosol]]s may originate from outdoor air and indoor reservoirs.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; Although outdoor bioaerosols cannot easily migrate into large buildings with complex [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation systems]], certain categories of outdoor bioaerosols (i.e., fungal spores) do serve as major sources for indoor bioaerosols in naturally ventilated buildings at specific periods of time (i.e., growing seasons for fungi).&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;
Major indoor sources for bioaerosols at residential homes include human occupants, [[pet]]s, house dust, [[organic waste]], as well as the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="six" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;Chen, Q. and L.M. Hildemann, The Effects of Human Activities on Exposure to Particulate Matter and Bioaerosols in Residential Homes. Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2009. 43(13): p. 4641-4646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;Park, J.H., et al., Predictors of airborne endotoxin in the home. Environmental Health Perspectives, 2001. 109(8): p. 859-864.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have identified human activities as an important source for indoor bioaerosols.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;Kalogerakis, N., et al., Indoor air quality - bioaerosol measurements in domestic and office premises. Journal of Aerosol Science, 2005. 36(5-6): p. 751-761.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Li, C.S. and P.A. Hou, Bioaerosol characteristics in hospital clean rooms. Science of the Total Environment, 2003. 305(1-3): p. 169-176.&lt;/ref&gt; Human bodies can generate bioaerosols directly through activities like talking, sneezing, and coughing,&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; while other residential activities (i.e., washing, flushing toilet, sweeping floor) can generate bioaerosols indirectly.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Since microorganisms can accumulate and grow on [[dust]] particles, house dust is a potential source of bioaerosols.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; In a study by Wouters ''et al''.,&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; they investigated the effects of indoor storage of organic household waste on microbial contamination among 99 households in the Netherlands in the summer of 1997, and indicated that “increased microbial contaminant levels in homes are associated with indoor storage of separated organic waste”, which might elevate “the risk of bioaerosol-related respiratory symptoms in susceptible people”. However, the analysis by Wouters ''et al''.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; was based on the collected samples of settled house dust, which might not serve as a strong indicator for bioaerosols suspended in the air. Other materials in residential buildings, such as food stuffs, house plants, [[textile]]s, wood material and furniture stuffing can also become bioaerosol sources when water content is appropriate for microorganisms to grow.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;
For non-residential buildings, some specific indoor environments, such as [[hospital]]s, [[wastewater treatment]] plants, [[compost]]ing facilities, certain biotechnical laboratories, have been revealed to have bioaerosol sources related to their particular environmental characteristics.&lt;ref name="two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Sanchez-Monedero, M.A., E.I. Stentiford, and C. Mondini, Biofiltration at composting facilities: Effectiveness for bioaerosol control. Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2003. 37(18): p. 4299-4303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Bauer, H., et al., Bacteria and fungi in aerosols generated by two different types of wastewater treatment plants. Water Research, 2002. 36(16): p. 3965-3970.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors influencing indoor bioaerosol generation ===
According to previous studies,&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Verreault, D., S. Moineau, and C. Duchaine, Methods for sampling of airborne viruses. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 2008. 72(3): p. 413-444.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Dekoster, J.A. and P.S. Thorne, Bioaerosol concentrations in noncomplaint, complaint, and intervention homes in the Midwest. American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal, 1995. 56(6): p. 573-580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Law, A.K.Y., C.K. Chau, and G.Y.S. Chan, Characteristics of bioaerosol profile in office buildings in Hong Kong. Building and Environment, 2001. 36(4): p. 527-541.&lt;/ref&gt; major indoor environmental factors influencing bioaerosol concentration include relative [[humidity]], characteristics of air ventilation systems, [[seasonal variation]], temperature, and chemical composition of the air. Other factors, such as the type of home, [[building material]], geographical factors, do not seem to have significant impacts on respirable fungi and bacteria (important constituents of bioaerosols).&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Relative humidity is one of the most widely studied influencing factors for indoor bioaerosols. Concentrations of two categories of bioaerosols, endotoxin and airborne fungi, are both positively related to indoor relative humidity (higher concentration associated with higher relative humidity).&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sixteen" /&gt; Relative humidity also affects the [[infectivity]] of airborne viruses.&lt;ref name="fourteen" /&gt; Regarding the characterisation of air ventilation system, increased use of central air conditioning is found to be associated with lower fungal bioaerosol concentration.&lt;ref name="fifteen" /&gt;

== Human health effects ==
Adverse health effects/diseases related to indoor bioaerosol exposure can be divided into two categories: those confirmed to be associated with bioaerosol and those suspected but not confirmed to be associated with bioaerosol. Bioaerosols have been revealed to cause certain human diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], [[Legionnaires' disease]] and different forms of [[bacterial pneumonia]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[Gastrointestinal diseases|gastrointestinal illness]].&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;Peccia, J. and M. Hernandez, Incorporating polymerase chain reaction-based identification, population characterization, and quantification of microorganisms into aerosol science: A review. Atmospheric Environment, 2006. 40(21): p. 3941-3961.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioaerosols are also associated with some noninfectious airway diseases, such as allergies and asthma.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; As a known component of indoor bioaerosol, β(1→3)-glucan (cell wall components of most fungi) is proposed to be the [[causative agent]] of [[mold]]-induced nonallergic inflammatory reactions.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; It is reported that 25%-30% of allergenic [[asthma]] cases in industrialised countries are induced by fungi,&lt;ref name="seventeen" /&gt; which has been the focus of concerns about human exposure to airborne microorganisms in recent years.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Vanhee, L.M.E., H.J. Nelis, and T. Coenye, Rapid Detection and Quantification of Aspergillus fumigatus in Environmental Air Samples Using Solid-Phase Cytometry. Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2009. 43(9): p. 3233-3239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other human diseases and symptoms have been proposed to be associated with indoor bioaerosol, but no deterministic conclusions could be drawn due to the [[insufficiency of evidence]]. One example is the well-known [[sick building syndrome]] (SBS). SBS refers to non-specific complaints, such as upper-respiratory irritative symptoms, [[headache]]s, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and [[rash]], which cannot be related to an identifiable cause but are building related.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Redlich, C.A., J. Sparer, and M.R. Cullen, Sick-building syndrome. Lancet, 1997. 349(9057): p. 1013-1016.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two decades, there have been many studies indicating association of indoor bioaerosol with sick building syndrome.&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;Cooley, J.D., et al., Correlation between the prevalence of certain fungi and sick building syndrome. Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 1998. 55(9): p. 579-584.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-one"&gt;Gyntelberg, F., et al., Dust and the sick building syndrome. Indoor Air-International Journal of Indoor Air Quality and Climate, 1994. 4(4): p. 223-238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-two"&gt;Teeuw, K.B., C. Vandenbrouckegrauls, and J. Verhoef, Airborne gram-negative bacteria and endotoxin in sick building syndrome - a study in Dutch governmental office buildings. Archives of Internal Medicine, 1994. 154(20): p. 2339-2345.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-three"&gt;Li, C.S., C.W. Hsu, and M.L. Tai, Indoor pollution and sick building syndrome symptoms among workers in day-care centers. Archives of Environmental Health, 1997. 52(3): p. 200-207.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the related studies based their conclusions on statistical correlation between concentrations of certain types of bioaerosols and incidence of complaints, which has various drawbacks methodologically. For example, some studies have a small sample size,&lt;ref name="twenty-one" /&gt; which critically undermines the validity of speculations based on the statistical results. Also, many studies were not able to exclude the influences of other factors beside bioaerosol in their analysis, which makes the statistical correlation theoretically inappropriate to support association of SBS with bioaerosols. Additional studies revealed that bioaerosol is unlikely to be the cause of SBS.&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-four"&gt;Burge, P.S., Sick building syndrome. Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 2004. 61(2): p. 185-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-five"&gt;Harrison, J., et al., An investigation of the relationship between microbial and particulate indoor [[air pollution]] and the sick building syndrome. Respiratory Medicine, 1992. 86(3): p. 225-235.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent epidemiological and toxicological studies continued to suggest a possible link between bioaerosol exposure and sick building syndrome, but methodological limitations remained in these studies.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-six"&gt;Laumbach, R.J. and H.M. Kipen, Bioaerosols and sick building syndrome: particles, [[inflammation]], and [[allergy]]. Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2005. 5(2): p. 135-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of bioaerosols to cause human [[disease]] depend not only on their [[chemical composition]] and biological characteristics, but also on the quantity of bioaerosol inhaled and their size distribution, which determines the site of bioaerosol deposition to human [[respiratory system]]s.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Bioaerosols larger than 10&amp;nbsp;µm in aerodynamic diameter are generally blocked by the nasal region of the [[respiratory tract]], those between 5-10&amp;nbsp;µm mainly deposit in the upper respiratory system and usually induce symptoms like allergic [[rhinitis]], and particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 5&amp;nbsp;µm can reach the alveoli and hence lead to serious illnesses such as allergic [[Extrinsic allergic alveolitis|alveolitis]].&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;

Because of the confirmed and potential adverse health effects associated with indoor bioaerosol, some concentration limits for total number of bioaerosol particles are recommended by different agencies and organisations as follow: 1000 CFUs/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH)), 1000 CFUs/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH)) with the culturable count for total bacteria not exceeding 500 CFUs/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt; Note that for most types of indoor bioaerosols, the establishment of specific concentration limits or acceptance levels presents multiple challenges (e.g., differences on sampling and analysis method, irrelevance of sampling units to human exposure measurement; multiplicity and variability of composition, etc.).&lt;ref name="eighteen" /&gt;

== Sampling and detection methods ==

=== Bioaerosol sampling techniques ===
To enable subsequent identification and [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], bioaerosols need to be captured from the air first. Different air sampling techniques have been used to realise the goal of capturing indoor bioaerosols.. Important characteristics of bioaerosol sampling include: representativeness of sampling, sampler performance, and compatibility with subsequent analysis.&lt;ref name="twenty-seven"&gt;Pasanen, A.L., A review: Fungal exposure assessment in indoor environments. Indoor Air, 2001. 11(2): p. 87-98.&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term sampler theoretically has a better representativeness of sampling than short-term sampler, but may not have a good temporary resolution. Performance of samplers (i.e., limit of detection and upper limit of range) has a significant impact on the reliability of results.&lt;ref name="twenty-seven" /&gt; Different characterisations of samplers can also limit the possibilities for further analysis (identification and quantification). Major bioaerosol sampler types and their possible subsequent analysis are summarised in Table 1. A frequently used sampler in previous studies is the Andersen impactor.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eleven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twenty-eight"&gt;Gorny, R.L. and J. Dutkiewicz, Bacterial and fungal aerosols in indoor environment in Central and Eastern European countries. Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine, 2002. 9(1): p. 17-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain limitations exist for commonly used bioaerosol samplers. For most of the samplers, nonbiological environmental particles such as dust must be separated from bioaerosols prior to detection.&lt;ref name="twenty-nine"&gt;Moon, H.S., et al., Dielectrophoretic Separation of Airborne Microbes and Dust Particles Using a Microfluidic Channel for Real-Time Bioaerosol Monitoring. Environmental Science &amp; Technology, 2009. 43(15): p. 5857-5863.&lt;/ref&gt; The diluted nature of bioaerosol in the air also poses challenges to samplers. While total microorganism concentrations are on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or greater, bioaerosol concentrations are commonly less than 1/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and often less than 1/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the case of infectious aerosols.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Moreover, many commercially available bioaerosol samplers haven not been investigated on their collection efficiencies for particles with different aerodynamic diameters, which makes it impossible to get the size-resolved bioaerosol information.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

=== Identification and quantification methods ===
In previous research on indoor bioaerosol in residential environments, microorganisms have been quantified by conventional culture-based techniques, in which colony forming units (CFU) on selective media are counted.&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;Li, C.S. and T.Y. Huang, Fluorochrome in monitoring indoor bioaerosols. Aerosol Science and Technology, 2006. 40(4): p. 237-241.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivating methods have several disadvantages. Culture-based methods are known to underestimate environmental microbial diversity, based on the fact that only a small percentage of microbes can be cultivated in the laboratory. This underestimation is likely to be signified for the quantification of bioaerosol, since colony counts of airborne microbes are typically quite different from direct counts.&lt;ref name="thirty-one"&gt;Fierer, N., et al., Short-term temporal variability in airborne bacterial and fungal populations. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2008. 74(1): p. 200-207.&lt;/ref&gt; Culture-based methods also need relatively long incubation times (over 24 hours) and are labor-intensive.&lt;ref name="twenty-nine" /&gt; Consequently, culture-based methods are no longer suitable for effective and rapid identification and quantification of bioaerosol,&lt;ref name="twenty-nine" /&gt; and non-culture based methods, such as immunoassays, molecular biological tests, and optical, and electrical methods, have been developing over the past few decades.&lt;ref name="twenty-nine" /&gt;

Major culture-independent identification/quantification methods adopted in previous bioaerosol studies include polymerase chain reaction (PCR),&lt;ref name="seventeen" /&gt; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR),&lt;ref name="thirty-two"&gt;An, H.R., G. Mainelis, and L. White, Development and calibration of real-time PCR for quantification of airborne microorganisms in air samples. Atmospheric Environment, 2006. 40(40): p. 7924-7939.&lt;/ref&gt; microarray (PhyloChip),&lt;ref name="thirty-three"&gt;Brodie, E.L., et al., Urban aerosols harbor diverse and dynamic bacterial populations. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2007. 104(1): p. 299-304.&lt;/ref&gt; fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH),&lt;ref name="thirty-four"&gt;Lange, J.L., P.S. Thorne, and N. Lynch, Application of flow cytometry and fluorescent in situ hybridisation for assessment of exposures to airborne bacteria. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 1997. 63(4): p. 1557-1563.&lt;/ref&gt; flow cytometry&lt;ref name="thirty-four" /&gt; and solid-phase cytometry,&lt;ref name="eighteen" /&gt; immunoassay (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)).&lt;ref name="twenty-eight" /&gt; The well-known PCR is a powerful tool in identifying and even quantifying the biological origin of bioaerosols. PCR alone cannot accomplish all the tasks related to bioaerosol detection; instead it usually serves as the preparation tool for subsequent processes like DNA sequencing, microarray, and community fingerprinting techniques. A typical procedure for PCR-based bioaerosol analysis is shown in Figure 1.

[[Image:Bioaerosol Analysis Procedure.png|thumb|upright=2.5|none|alt=Pathways to PCR-based bioaerosol analysis.|Figure 1 Pathways to PCR-based bioaerosol analysis (adapted from&lt;ref name="seventeen" /&gt;).The numbers listed indicate the quantities of bioaerosols required for successful analysis.]]

Molecular biological methods for bioaerosol are significantly faster and more sensitive than conventional culture-based methods, and they are also able to reveal a larger diversity of microbes. Targeting the variation in the 16S rRNA gene, a microarray (PhyloChip) was used to conduct comprehensive identification of both bacterial and archaeal organisms in bioaerosols.&lt;ref name="thirty-three" /&gt; New U.S. EPA methods have been developed to utilise qPCR to characterise indoor environment for fungal spores.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; In a study by Lange ''et al''.,&lt;ref name="thirty-four" /&gt; FISH method successfully identified eubacteria in samples of complex native bioaerosols in swine barns. Nonetheless, molecular biological tools have limitations. Since PCR methods target DNA, viability of cells could not be confirmed in some cases.&lt;ref name="eighteen" /&gt; When qPCR technique is used for bioaerosol detection, standard curves need to be developed to calibrate final results. One study indicated that “curves used for quantification by qPCR needs to be prepared using the same environmental matrix and procedures as handling of the environmental sample in question” and that “reliance on the standard curves generated with cultured bacterial suspension (a traditional approach) may lead to substantial underestimation of microorganism quantities in environmental samples”.&lt;ref name="thirty-two" /&gt; Microarray techniques also face the challenge of natural sequence diversity and potential cross-hybridisation in complex environmental bioaerosols).&lt;ref name="thirty-three" /&gt;

== Approaches to control indoor bioaerosols ==
Based on the sources and the influencing factors for indoor bioaerosols, corresponding remedial actions can be taken to control related contamination. Potentially effective strategies include: 1) limiting entrance of outdoor aerosols; 2) keeping the relative humidity level below high levels (&lt;60%);&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt; 3) installing appropriate filtration devices to air ventilation system to inlet filtered outdoor air into indoor environment; 4) reducing/removing contaminant sources (i.e., indoor organic waste). As in the U.S., due to the increase in tuberculosis in the mid-1980s, indoor air treatment has developed substantially during the past two decades.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt; Current or developing indoor air purification technologies include filtration, aerosol ultraviolet irradiation, electrostatic precipitation, unipolar ion emission, and photocatalytic oxidation.&lt;ref name="five" /&gt;

Once the glacier melts, the edges of the delta may subside as [[ice]] under it melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CMECS:          Glacial (Kame) Delta|url = http://www.cmecscatalog.org/classification/unit/75.html|website = www.cmecscatalog.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309061226/https://www.cmecscatalog.org/classification/unit/75.html|archivedate = 2016-03-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glacial till]] is deposited on the lateral sides of the delta, as the glacier melts.

== Associations ==

Kame deltas form in association with other glacial features such as, [[Kettle (landform)|kettles]] and [[esker]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kame|url = http://www.landforms.eu/cairngorms/kame.htm|website = www.landforms.eu|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kettle lakes can form in between kame deltas. Eskers are remnants of old stream sediment flows, that are exposed after the glacier has melted. These formations give indication that kame deltas formed during times of glaciation.

== Formation ==
As a river or stream empties into a proglacial lake, sediments of silt, sand, and gravel are deposited into the lake. Since these sediments are stream deposited, the [[stratigraphy]] of the [[Bed (geology)|beds]] will be well sorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glacialfeatures|url = http://dabbler.org/home/Sam/Features.html#KameDelta|website = dabbler.org|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these bed layers, sharp distinct size variations may occur in the clast size. This indicates a quick change in the river or stream's velocity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Over time, depending on how deep the proglacial lake was and if the stream melt water was a constant, these sediments would build up and out of the lake. Sediments will then begin depositing against the terminus, or toe, of the glacier. This type of formation causes the asymmetrical triangular shaped mound, with a flat top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Fluvioglacial/glacial_meltwater_e.pdf|title = Glacial Meltwater Landforms|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer side of the triangle, is the side that slopes down into the proglacial lake. The steeper side is the one that was up against the terminus. As the glacier retreats and the ice under the delta melts, the edges of the glacier will drop, causing a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] line to be visible on the side of the kame delta.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8295">{{short description|Spirits of the land in Norse mythology, Scottish druidry, and Germanic neopaganism}}
'''Landvættir''' ("land [[wight]]s") are spirits of the land in [[Norse mythology]], Scottish [[Druid|druidry]], and [[Germanic neopaganism]]. They protect and promote the flourishing of the specific places where they live, which can be as small as a rock or a corner of a field, or as large as a section of a country.

==The nature of landvættir==
Some scholars have suggested that landvættir are [[chthonic]] in nature, spirits of the dead, but others have interpreted them as nature spirits, since they sometimes live in land that has never been populated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]], ''Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte'', vol. 1, p. 260, Berlin: De Gruyter, 1956, repr. as 3rd ed. 1970, citing Dag Strömbäck.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] argued that stories such as that of Goat-Björn imply that they were already there when the settlers arrived in Iceland. Goat-Björn was offered a partnership by a "rock-dweller" (''bergbúi'') and thereafter prospered. People with second sight saw "all the land-spirits" following him to the [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]] and following his brothers hunting and fishing. They told of people worshipping and receiving advice from spirits living in waterfalls, woods, and rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson]], ''Myths and Symbols in Pagan Europe: Early Scandinavian and Celtic Religions'', Manchester University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780719022074}}, pp. 103-04. Goat-Björn, the waterfall, and the wood she cites from ''[[Landnámabók]]'', the advising spirit in the rock from ''[[Kristni saga]]'' and ''[[Þáttr Þorsteins enn Viðförla]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jörmundur Ingi Hansen]], former High Priest of the [[Ásatrúarfélagið]], said that landvættir are "spirits and they in some way control the safety of the land, the fertility of the land, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Blain, ''Wights and Ancestors: Heathenism in a Living Landscape'',  Devizes, Wiltshire: Wyrd's Well, 2000, {{ISBN|0-9539044-0-7}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to him, they are "tied to a spot in the landscape, to a huge rock, to a mountain, or to a specially beautiful place" and that place can be recognized by being more beautiful than "just a few yards away."&lt;ref&gt;Blain, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief in local landvættir lives on in Iceland, with many farms having rocks that are not mowed closely and on which children are not allowed to play.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephan Grundy|Kveldúlf Hagan Gundarsson]], ed., ''Our Troth'', vol. 1: History and Lore, 2nd ed. North Charleston, NC: Booksurge, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4196-3598-0}}, p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; When construction was about to start on [[Keflavík]] air base, the Icelandic foreman dreamed that a woman came to him asking to delay moving a boulder to give her family time to move out. He did so for two weeks over American objections, until she came to him in another dream telling him the landvættir were all out.&lt;ref&gt;KveldulfR Hagan Gundarsson, ''Elves, Wights, and Trolls'', Studies Towards the Practice of Germanic Heathenry vol. 1, New York: iUniverse, 2007, {{ISBN|0-595-42165-2}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms are sometimes used in the texts for the spirits, such as ''bergbúi'', ''ármaðr'', and ''spámaðr'', but there is one mention of pre-Christian Icelanders bringing offerings specifically to ''landvættir''. In a section of [[Hauksbók]], a Christian bishop rails against "foolish women" who take food out to rocks and hollows to feed the landvættir in hopes of being blessed with a prosperous household.&lt;ref&gt;"Heimslýsing ok Helgifrœði" ch. 9; ed. Eiríkur Jónsson, [[Finnur Jónsson]], Copenhagen: Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab, 1896, p. 167 at Google Books (Old Norse) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qvw_AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hauksb%C3%B3k+J%C3%B3nsson&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q=hollar%20vera&amp;f=false.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Vries, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; 10. Carmina Gadelica, Alexander Carmichael (1900) 11. Pictish orthodox Druidism, Ray Hess (2015).

==Wealth and Weal of the Land==
One version of the Icelandic [[Landnámabók|Book of Settlement]] says that the ancient law of Iceland forbade having a dragon-prow in place on one's ship in harbor or coming in to land "with gaping mouth or yawning snout," because the landvættir would be frightened away.&lt;ref&gt;de Vries, p. 260, referring to Ulfljót's Law, at Google Books (Old Norse) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb1GAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=enna+hei%C3%B0nu+laga+at+menn+skyldu+eigi+hafa+h%C3%B6fu%C3%B0skip&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U3W9ghFDb8&amp;sig=Ufu6ic89JA0pxH_WCHfM1ojuCZ4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=irXDSqnSLJHysQPFqIGlCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=enna%20hei%C3%B0nu%20laga%20at%20menn%20skyldu%20eigi%20hafa%20h%C3%B6fu%C3%B0skip&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Egils saga]], [[Egil Skallagrímsson]] set up a [[nithing pole]] to agitate the landvættir in Norway so that they would "go astray . . . until they have driven King Eric and Queen Gunnhild" out of the country.  Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards translate ''landvættir'' as "guardian spirits" in this passage.&lt;ref&gt;Egil's Saga, Penguin Classics, 1976, {{ISBN|0-14-044321-5}}, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The four landvættir of Iceland===

[[Iceland]] is protected by four great guardians who are known as the four ''landvættir'' ({{IPA-is|ˈlantˌvaiʰtɪr̥|lang}}).

According to the Saga of King Olaf Tryggvason in [[Heimskringla]], King [[Harald Bluetooth]] Gormsson of Denmark, intending to invade Iceland, had a wizard send his spirit out in the form of a whale to scout it out for points of vulnerability.  Swimming westwards around the northern coast, the wizard saw that all the hillsides and hollows were full of landvættir, "some large and some small."  He swam up [[Vopnafjörður]], intending to go ashore, but a great [[dragon]] came flying down the valley toward him, followed by many snakes, insects, and lizards, all spitting poison at him. So he went back and continued around the coast westward to [[Eyjafjörður]], where he again swam inland. This time he was met by a great bird, so big that its wings touched the hillsides on either side, with many other birds large and small following it. Retreating again and continuing west and south, he swam into [[Breiðafjörður]]. There he was met by a huge [[bull]], bellowing horribly, with many landvættir following it. He retreated again, continued south around [[Reykjanes]], and tried to come ashore at [[Vikarsskeið]], but there he encountered a mountain giant (''bergrisi''), his head higher than the hill-tops, with an iron staff in his hand and followed by many other giants (''[[jötunn|jötnar]]''). He continued along the south coast but saw nowhere else where a [[longship]] could put in, "nothing but sands and wasteland and high waves crashing on the shore."&lt;ref&gt;tr. [[Lee M. Hollander]], Austin: University of Texas Press, 1964, repr. 1999, {{ISBN|0-292-73061-6}}, pp. 173-74; ch. 33, "Frá Haraldi Gormssyni" at Netútgafn (in Icelandic) [http://www.snerpa.is/net/snorri/ol-tr.htm].  de Vries p. 260 refers only to the initial sight of landwights crowding the landscape; in the remainder of the passage the four guardians themselves are not called ''landvættir'', and at the end they are stated to have been four named Icelanders.&lt;/ref&gt;

The four landvættir are now regarded as the protectors of the [[Farthings of Iceland| four quarters of Iceland]]: the dragon (''Dreki'') in the east,  the [[eagle]] (''Gammur'') in the north, the bull (''Griðungur'') in the west, and the giant (''Bergrisi'') in the south. 

The four landvættir of Iceland are depicted on the [[Coat of arms of Iceland|Icelandic coat of arms]] and on the obverse of the [[Icelandic króna]] coins.

==Subgenus ''Cyclobalanopsis''==
[[File:Quercus lamellosa.jpg|thumb|Illustration of ''Quercus lamellosa'', showing acorns in clusters, with visible rings on their cups]]
The '''ring-cupped oaks''' (synonym genus ''Cyclobalanopsis''). Eastern and southeastern Asia. They are distinct from subgenus ''Quercus'' in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this does not apply to all of the species. About 150 species.

==Notes==
&lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt; Species with [[evergreen]] foliage ("[[live oak]]s") are tagged #. Note that the change from deciduous to evergreen character (or vice versa) has evolved on numerous occasions in ''Quercus'', and does not necessarily indicate that the species concerned are closely related.

This is a '''list of energy cooperatives'''. A [[cooperative]] is an autonomous association of persons who [[voluntary association|voluntarily]] cooperate for their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit.&lt;ref name="ica-principles"&gt;[http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html Statement on the Cooperative Identity.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081503/http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html |date=2012-02-04 }} ''[[International Cooperative Alliance]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperatives include non-profit community organizations and businesses that are owned and managed by the people who use its services (a [[consumer cooperative]]) or by the people who work there (a [[worker cooperative]]) or by the people who live there (a [[housing cooperative]]), hybrids such as worker cooperatives that are also consumer cooperatives or [[credit union]]s, multi-stakeholder cooperatives such as those that bring together civil society and local actors to deliver community needs, and second and third tier cooperatives whose members are other cooperatives.

A 2009 study found that 23% of the newly founded cooperatives in Germany were in the energy sector. These cooperatives primarily operate wind farms, bioenergy and photovoltaic farms with local and regional scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate Change Governance|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-642-29831-8|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQnNpayz04cC&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=%22energy%20cooperatives%22&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Caspian Sea====
The Caspian Sea, located in western Asia on the eastern edges of Europe, is the largest lake on the planet. History records that it is called a sea because the Romans found it salty, especially in the southern reaches, and the name stuck.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Oil and natural gas production platforms are replete along the edges of the sea. In addition, large quantities of sturgeon live in its waters, and the caviar produced from their eggs is a valuable commodity. Fresh water flows into the sea via the Volga River and Ural River in the north; however, the sea remains somewhat salty, central and south. The measured surface area is 371,000 sq km (143,244 sq mi), and he maximum depth is at 1025 m (3,363&amp;nbsp;ft). Additional details and map.

====Lake Baikal====
Lake Baikal is positioned in southeastern (Siberia) Russia, directly to the north of Mongolia. Recognized as the oldest (still existing) freshwater lake on the planet, it is also measured as the deepest continental body of water at 5,315 feet (1,620 m). In addition, it is the largest freshwater lake by volume, containing an astounding 20% of the planet's fresh water. With a maximum width of 60 miles (96&amp;nbsp;km), Lake Baikal is about 389 miles (626&amp;nbsp;km) in length. Completely surrounded by mountains, over 300 rivers and streams drain into this massive lake. Detailed map.

====Aral Sea====
Positioned in far-western Asia, just to the east of the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea is located in the countries of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The Aral Sea is disappearing (evaporating) and is today almost totally polluted by fertilizer runoff, weapon testing residue left here by the former Soviet Union and careless industrial projects. The mismanagement of its valuable waters is considered by many experts to be one of the world's worst environmental disasters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for irrigation began in 1918, and that action, along with other factors have now shrunk the Aral Sea to almost 60% of its former size. Over the last few years the outlook for the northern reaches of the sea have brightened some, but the lower half is basically abandoned and the remaining western waters are now predicted to be gone within a decade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">The '''Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe''' is a [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[ecoregion]] of [[North Africa]]. It occupies interior plateaus and mountain ranges of the [[Maghreb]] region, lying generally between the coastal [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] to the north and the [[Sahara]] to the south.
[[File:AtlasOasis.jpg|right|200px|thumb|High Atlas Mountains]]

==Setting==
The Mediterranean woodlands and forests occupy an area of {{convert|291,700|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} in [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]]. The main portion of the ecoregions extends from the southern slopes of the [[High Atlas]] in eastern Morocco across [[Algeria]] and Tunisia, where it meets the Mediterranean shore at the [[Gulf of Gabes]]. In Algeria, it lies south of the coastal [[Tell Atlas]], covering the high plateau and [[Saharan Atlas]]. Further east, several enclaves of the ecoregion lie nearer the coast. In western [[Tripolitania]] it lies to the Mediterranean shore, and on the [[Cyrenaica]] peninsula it forms a belt between the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] and the Sahara. The easternmost portion of the ecoregion is a small coastal enclave lying just west of the [[Nile Delta]] in Egypt, near the city of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name = WWF&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1213 | title = Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe | accessdate = 2016-11-27 | publisher = World Wildlife Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The climate of the region is arid and annual rainfall is between 100 and 300&amp;nbsp;mm. The rainfall occurs mainly during the winter months, normally as intermittent storms. It can get as cold as O°C during the winter and temperatures can climb to 40&amp;nbsp;°C during the summer months, the mean annual temperature is around 18&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Settlement==
The human population of these regions is low, settled agriculture is only viable in valleys where there is a supply of water, such as ''dayas'', depressions with good quality soil, and the beds of ''[[wadi]]s''. In these areas it is possible to cultivate fodder and food crops. Such agriculture may not be possible in every year and they farmers shift to follow the rainfall.. Poupulation densities are low and most of the population are somewhat nomadic, however, there are some permanent settlements in coastal towns where the main economic activity is fishing.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Habitat==
At higher elevations on the plateau, different types of steppe vegetation dominate depending on soil conditions, for example in the slopes and foothills of the [[Atlas Mountains]] there is a steppe dominated by ''[[Stipa tenacissima]]'' whereas ''[[Artemisia herba-alba]]'' dominates in where there are silty slopes and depressions; ''[[Lygeum spartum]]'' steppe grows in sandy soils. Where sand accumulates  there is a mosaic of vegetation types including patches of ''[[Thymeleae muicrophila]]'', ''[[Aristida pungens]]'', ''[[Retama retam]]'', and of [[tamarisk]]s ''Tamarix spp''. In depressions the vegetation includes a scrub consisting of the Mount Atlas mastic tree ''[[Pistacia atlantica]]'', ''[[Ziziphus lotus]]'', ''[[Asterichus graveolens]]'' and mallows ''[[Malva]] spp''.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

==Fauna==
The fauna lacks [[endemism]] and most species found are widespread. There are abundant small mammals including many [[gerbil]] species, the endangered [[four-toed jerboa]] ''Allactaga tetradactyla'' and the [[Günther's vole]] ''Microtus guentheri''. [[Barbary sheep]] ''Ammotragus lervia'' and [[mountain gazelle]] ''Gazella cuvieri'' still have populations in the region, as does the [[striped hyena]] ''Htaena hyaena'', and these are mixed with mammals which have more European origins such as [[wild boar]] ''Sus scrofa'', [[Eurasian otter]] ''Lutra lutra'' and [[red fox]] ''Vulpes vulpes''. These European affinities are echoed in the herpetofauna where [[grass snake]] ''Natrix natrix'', [[Sahara frog]] ''Pelophylax saharicus'' and the [[European green toad]] ''Bufo viridis'' mixed with the African common toad ''[[Amietophrynus regularis]]''. The [[North African ostrich]] ''Struthio camelus camelus'' occurred in this region but is now largely extirpated.&lt;ref name = WWF/&gt;

The '''New Jersey Naval Museum''' (NJNM), located along the [[Hackensack River]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]], United States, is dedicated to the state's [[United States Navy|Navy]] heritage and [[naval history]] in general.  The prominent element in the collection is the [[USS Ling (SS-297)|USS ''Ling'' (SS-297)]], a {{convert|312|ft|m|sing=on}} long [[Balao class submarine|''Balao''-class]] [[submarine]] of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="matthew_keegan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keegan|first1=Matthew|title=Hackensack, New Jersey: 300 Years of Modern History - Destinations Article|url=http://www.articles3k.com/article/482/15483/Hackensack_New_Jersey_300_Years_of_Modern_History/|website=www.articles3k.com|accessdate=17 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113332/http://www.articles3k.com/article/482/15483/Hackensack_New_Jersey_300_Years_of_Modern_History/|archivedate=15 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located along River Street and is operated by the Submarine Memorial Association.

Since 1972, the Museum had paid one dollar per year to rent its riverside site.&lt;ref name="adely"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adely|first1=Hannan|title=Navy museum remains closed, seeks funding for repairs|url=http://www.northjersey.com/community-news/navy-museum-remains-closed-seeks-funding-for-repairs-submarine-ling-site-1.540528|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=The Record|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, the [[North Jersey Media Group]], owner of the site, informed the museum that the site was going to be sold for redevelopment within the year and that the museum and submarine would need to be relocated. Efforts are being made to find an alternate site.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, John. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/11njtopic.html "Retired Submarine, 63, Seeks Loving New Home"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 11, 2007. Accessed October 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
When the museum still operated, guided tours of the ''Ling'' were available to take visitors from bow to stern, exploring equipment, quarters, and weaponry. The weaponry on the ''Ling'' includes twenty-four torpedoes and one 4" deck gun (it originally had two 5" deck guns) for handling military targets too small to warrant the expenditure of a [[torpedo]].

Volunteers maintained Japanese [[Kaiten]] IIs, a World War II Japanese suicide torpedo; a German [[Seehund]], a World War II German two-man coastal defense submarine; and A [[Vietnam War]]-era [[Patrol Boat, River]] (PBR), all of which the US Navy has since reclaimed, in addition to ''Ling'' and some torpedoes, missiles, and artillery shells.  The onshore museum building contained a number of different and unique items ranging from a [[United States Navy SEALs]] delivery vehicle to personal photographs and effects.

==Disuse==

After [[Hurricane Sandy]] the [[gangway (nautical)|gangway]] was destroyed, leading to the closure of the sub and museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/nyregion/submarine-hackensack-uss-ling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the area was selected for a development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/video/njtvnews-redevelopment-plans-raise-concerns-uss-ling}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Naval History and Heritage Command]] has taken several artifacts after they were in a state of disrepair; with the remaining artifacts being housed by [[Harbor Freight]].

==Vandalism  and Burglary==

On September the 10th, 4 memorial plaques and artifacts from the submarine were stolen. The Ling was also flooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://patch.com/new-jersey/teaneck/vandals-steal-wwii-plaques-flood-uss-ling-hackensack}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people have been identified in connection with the burglary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/bergen/hackensack/2018/09/27/3-more-suspects-identified-uss-ling-vandalism/1442670002/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Novaculite''', also called '''Arkansas Stone''', is a [[microcrystalline]] to [[cryptocrystalline]] rock type that consists of [[silica]] in the form of [[chert]] or [[flint]]. It is commonly white to grey or black in color, with a [[specific gravity]] that ranges from 2.2 to 2.5. It is used in the production of [[sharpening stone]]s. It occurs in parts of [[Arkansas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]], as well as in [[Japan]] and parts of the [[Middle East]]. The name ''novaculite'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''novacula'', meaning a sharp knife, dagger, or razor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiktionary|title=Novacula|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/novaculite|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to its use in sharpening.

==Occurrence==
Novaculite beds are present in the [[Ouachita Mountains]] of [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]], and in the [[Marathon Uplift]] and [[Solitario]] regions of [[Texas]]. Novaculite is very resistant to [[erosion]] and the beds stand out as ridges in the Ouachita Mountains.&lt;ref name=Spearing /&gt; There are also occurrences in [[Japan]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=Woodworking&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularwoodworking.com/article/what-is-an-oilstone-2|title=What is an Oilstone?|last=Adam Cherubini|date=12 October 2011|publisher=Popular Woodworking magazine|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The novaculite beds of the south-central United States were deposited in the [[Ouachita Geosyncline]], a deep-water marine trough, during [[Silurian]] to early [[Mississippian (geology)|Mississippian]] time. Sedimentation consisted primarily of [[silica|siliceous]] skeletal particles of marine organisms such as [[sponge spicule]]s and [[radiolaria]], and very fine-grained, wind-blown [[quartz]] particles; there was very little [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous]] sedimentation during novaculite deposition.&lt;ref name=McBride&gt;McBride, E.F. and Thomson, A. 1970. The Caballos novaculite, Marathon region, Texas. Geological Society of America, Special Paper 122, 129. p.&lt;/ref&gt; The novaculite beds were later subjected to folding and uplift, and probably low-grade [[metamorphism]], during the [[Ouachita orogeny]] in early [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] time.&lt;ref name=Spearing /&gt;

==Use==
Because novaculite is very hard and dense, it has been mined since prehistoric times, first for use as arrow and spear points, and later to make sharpening stones. Novaculite-rich sharpening stones  from Arkansas are called ''Arkansas stones'';&lt;ref name=Trubitt&gt;{{cite web|last=Trubitt|first=Mary Beth|title=Arkansas Novaculite: A Virtual Comparative Collection|url=http://arkarcheology.uark.edu/novaculite/index.html|work=|publisher=Arkansas Archeological Survey|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; stones produced in the [[Ottoman empire]] (Syria, Lebanon, and Israel) were called ''Turkey stones'';&lt;ref name=Woodworking /&gt; and novaculite stones were also produced in Japan.&lt;ref name=Woodworking /&gt;

The weathered upper strata of Arkansas novaculite, known as [[rotten stone|tripoli]] or "rotten stone", are rich in silica and have found a niche market as a performance additive or filler in the coatings, adhesives, sealants, and [[elastomer]] industries. Tripoli is mined just east of [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] by the Malvern Minerals Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/ouachita/natural-resources/minerals/otherminerals.shtml Nichols, John C., ''Minerals on the Ouachita National Forest,'' USDA Forest Service 12 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astrophysics]] and [[nuclear physics]], '''nuclear pasta''' is a theoretical type of [[degenerate matter]] that is postulated to exist within the crusts of [[neutron star]]s. Between the surface of a neutron star and the [[quark–gluon plasma]] at the core, at matter densities of 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Nuclear force|nuclear attraction]] and [[Coulomb repulsion]] forces are of similar magnitude. The competition between the forces allows for the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from [[neutron]]s and [[proton]]s. Astrophysicists call these types of structures ''nuclear pasta'' because the geometry of the structures resembles various types of pasta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Too much "pasta" for pulsars to spin down |date=2013 |version= |accessdate= |last1=Pons|first1=José A. |first2= Daniele|last2=Viganò |first3=Nanda|last3=Rea |doi= 10.1038/nphys2640 |journal= Nature Physics |volume= 9 |issue= 7 |pages= 431–434|arxiv=1304.6546 |bibcode = 2013NatPh...9..431P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reagan&gt;{{cite web|last=Reagan|first=David|title=Visualizations of Nuclear Pasta|url=http://pti.iu.edu/research/scholarly-highlights/articles/nuclear-pasta.php|publisher=Advanced Visualization Lab, Research Technologies, Indiana University|accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

[[Neutron star]]s form as remnants of massive stars after a [[supernova]] event. Unlike their progenitor star, neutron stars do not consist of a gaseous plasma. Rather, the intense gravitational attraction of the compact mass overcomes the [[electron degeneracy pressure]] and causes [[electron capture]] to occur within the star. The result is a compact ball of nearly pure neutron matter with sparse protons and electrons in between in a space several thousand times smaller than the progenitor star.&lt;ref name="PanelCommittee1986"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nuclear Physics Panel |author2=Physics Survey Committee |author3=Board on Physics and Astronomy |author4=Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences |title=Nuclear Physics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sg48AHOEZ_EC&amp;pg=PA111|date=1 January 1986|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|isbn=978-0-309-03547-7|pages=111–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the surface, the pressure is low enough that conventional nuclei, such as [[helium]] and [[iron]], can exist independently of one another, and are not crushed together due to the mutual [[Coulomb repulsion]] of their nuclei.&lt;ref name="Surface"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1070/pu1999v042n11ABEH000665|pages=1173–1174|title=Radio pulsars|date=1999|last1=Beskin|first1=Vasilii S|journal=Physics-Uspekhi|volume=42|issue=11|bibcode = 1999PhyU...42.1071B }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the core, the pressure is so great that this Coulomb repulsion cannot support individual nuclei, and some form of ultradense matter, such as the theorized [[quark–gluon plasma]], should exist.

The presence of a small population of protons is essential to the formation of nuclear pasta. The nuclear attraction between protons and neutrons is greater than the nuclear attraction of two protons or two neutrons. Similar to how neutrons act to stabilize heavy nuclei of conventional atoms against the electric repulsion of the protons, the protons act to stabilize the pasta phases. The competition between the electric repulsion of the protons, the attractive force between nuclei, and the pressure at different depths in the star lead to the formation of nuclear pasta.

===Phases===

While nuclear pasta has not been observed in a neutron star, its phases are theorized to exist in the inner crust of neutron stars, forming a transition region between the conventional matter at the surface, and the ultradense matter at the core. Towards the top of this transition region, the pressure is great enough that conventional nuclei will be condensed into much more massive semi-spherical collections. These formations would be unstable outside the star, due to their high neutron content and size, which can vary between tens and hundreds of nucleons. This semispherical phase is known as the '''[[gnocchi]] phase'''.

When the gnocchi phase is compressed, as would be expected in deeper layers of the crust, the electric repulsion of the protons in the gnocchi is not fully sufficient to support the existence of the individual spheres, and they are crushed into long rods, which, depending on their length, can contain many thousands of nucleons. Immersed in a neutron liquid, these rods are known as the '''[[spaghetti]] phase'''. Further compression causes the spaghetti phase rods to fuse, and form sheets of nuclear matter. This is called the '''[[lasagna]] phase'''. Further compression of the lasagna phase yields the uniform nuclear matter of the outer core with intermittent holes of neutron (and possibly proton) liquid. Progressing deeper into the inner crust, those holes in the nuclear pasta change from being cylindrical, dubbed by some the '''[[bucatini]] phase''' or '''antispaghetti phase''', into scattered spherical holes, which can be called the '''[[Swiss cheese]] phase'''.  The nuclei disappear at the crust-core interface, transitioning into the liquid core of the star. For a typical neutron star of 1.4 [[solar mass]]es ({{solar mass}}) and 12&amp;nbsp;km radius, the nuclear pasta layer in the crust can be about 100 m thick and have a mass of about 0.01 {{solar mass}}. In terms of mass, this is a significant portion of the crust of a neutron star.

'''''Les observations de plusieurs singularitez et choses memorables trouvées en Grèce, Asie, Judée, Egypte, Arabie et autres pays estranges''''' is a work of ethnographical, botanical and zoological exploration by '''[[Pierre Belon]]''' (1517–1564), a French [[natural history|naturalist]] from [[Le Mans]]. Starting in 1546, Belon travelled through [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Egypt]], [[Arabia]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], returning to France in 1549.

His ''Observations'', with illustrations, were first published in 1553. A second edition appeared in 1555. The work was translated into Latin by [[Charles de l'Écluse]] (Carolus Clusius) and published in 1589 under the title ''Petri Bellonii Cenomani plurimorum singularium et memorabilium rerum ... observationes''. The Latin text was reprinted as an appendix to Clusius's ''[[Exoticorum libri decem]]'' (1605).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4372">'''Pacific Centennial Oscillation''' is a [[climate oscillation]] predicted by some [[climate model]]s.

In the [[Pacific Ocean]], variability in [[sea surface temperature]]s is an important influence on precipitation regimens in the [[Americas]] and how this variability changes in response to [[anthropogenic climate change]] ([[El Nino]]-like or [[La Nina]]-like) may determine the outcome of climate change.{{sfn|Karnauskas|Smerdon|Seager|González-Rouco|2012|p=5943}} The sea surface temperature patterns may fluctuate over thousands or millions of years and determining trends and patterns from observational data is difficult.{{sfn|Karnauskas|Smerdon|Seager|González-Rouco|2012|p=5944}}

Several climate models have shown the existence of a centennial scale cycle in [[Pacific Ocean]] temperatures, with fluctuations of about {{convert|0.5|C}}{{sfn|Karnauskas|Smerdon|Seager|González-Rouco|2012|p=5958}} and most temperature changes concentrated below the surface of the [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]]. The predicted effects have some similarities to [[El Nino Southern Oscillation]]{{sfn|Karnauskas|Smerdon|Seager|González-Rouco|2012|p=5943}} and may be responsible for recent [[La Nina]]-like trends in Pacific Ocean temperature patterns{{sfn|Coats|Smerdon|Cook|Seager|2015|p=125}} and trends in the east-west gradient of Pacific sea surface temperatures from 1900 forward;{{sfn|Samanta|Karnauskas|Goodkin|Coats|2018|pp=10609-10610}} in one climate model the Pacific Centennial Oscillation drives long [[drought]]s in the [[Southwestern United States]]{{sfn|Coats|Smerdon|Cook|Seager|2015|p=136}} such as the [[2011–2017 California drought]].&lt;ref name="Seager2015" /&gt;
 
The Pacific Centennial Oscillation cycle however might be spurious,{{sfn|Karnauskas|Smerdon|Seager|González-Rouco|2012|p=5959}} a model [[artifact (error)|artifact]].{{sfn|Samanta|Karnauskas|Goodkin|Coats|2018|p=10610}} Later research has shown the possibility that centennial cycles in the Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature structure can be a consequence of an overly long Pacific [[cold tongue]], although genuine centennial cycles in nature cannot be completely ruled out.{{sfn|Samanta|Karnauskas|Goodkin|Coats|2018|p=10616}}

'''Plants in space''' is about [[plants]] in [[outer space]].&lt;ref name="Mizuna"/&gt; In the late 20th and 21st century, plants were often taken into space in low Earth orbit to be grown in a weightless but pressurized controlled environment, sometimes called space gardens.&lt;ref name="Mizuna"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html NASA - Growing Plants and Vegetables in a Space Garden]&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of human spaceflight, they can be consumed as food and/or provide a refreshing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/spacelife/topics/plants/index.html NASA - Plants in Space]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants can metabolize carbon dioxide in the air to produce valuable oxygen, and can help control cabin humidity.&lt;ref name=zvet/&gt; Growing plants in space may provide a psychological benefit to human spaceflight crews.&lt;ref name=zvet/&gt; Usually the plants were part of studies or technical development to further develop space gardens or conduct science experiments.&lt;ref name="Mizuna"/&gt; To date plants taken into space have had mostly scientific interest, with only limited contributions to the functionality of the spacecraft, however the Apollo [[Moon tree]] project was more or less forestry inspired mission and the trees part of a country's bicentennial celebration

The first challenge in growing plants in space is how to get plants to grow without gravity.&lt;ref name="root"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/tages.html NASA - Getting to The Root of Plant Growth Aboard The Space Station]&lt;/ref&gt; This runs into difficulties regarding the effects of gravity on root development, providing appropriate types of lighting, and other challenges. In particular, the nutrient supply to root as well as the nutrient biogeochemical cycles, and the microbiological interactions in soil-based substrates are particularly complex, but have been shown to make possible [[space farming]] in hypo- and micro-gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Maggi F. and C.

== History ==
[[File:Learning About 'Veggie' at the NASA Social.jpg|thumb|Vegetable Production System for ISS being discussed]]
In the 2010s there was an increased desire for long-term space missions, which lead to desire for space-based plant production as food for astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/veggie]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is vegetable production on the International Space Station in Earth orbit.&lt;ReF&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/veggie&lt;/ref&gt; By the year 2010, 20 plant growth experiments had been conducted aboard the [[international Space Station]]..&lt;ref name="Mizuna"/&gt;

Several experiments have been focused on how plant growth and distribution compares in micro-gravity, space conditions versus Earth conditions. This enables scientists to explore whether certain plant growth patterns are innate or environmentally driven. For instance, Allan H. Brown tested seedling movements aboard the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] in 1983. Sunflower seedling movements were recorded while in orbit. They observed that the seedlings still experienced rotational growth and circumnation despite lack of gravity, showing these behaviors are instinctual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chamovitz|first1=Daniel|title=What a plant knows : a field guide to the senses|date=2012|publisher=Scientific American/Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0-374-28873-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experiments have found that plants have the ability exhibit [[gravitropism]], even in low-gravity conditions. For instance, the ESA's European Modular Cultivation System&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jost|first1=Ann-Iren Kittang|last2=Hoson|first2=Takayuki|last3=Iversen|first3=Tor-Henning|title=The Utilization of Plant Facilities on the International Space Station—The Composition, Growth, and Development of Plant Cell Walls under Microgravity Conditions|journal=Plants|date=20 January 2015|volume=4|issue=1|pages=44–62|doi=10.3390/plants4010044|issn=2223-7747|pmc=4844336|pmid=27135317}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables experimentation with plant growth; acting as a miniature [[greenhouse]], scientists aboard the [[International Space Station]] can investigate how plants react in variable-gravity conditions.The Gravi-1 experiment (2008) utilized the EMCS to study [[lentil]] seedling growth and amyloplast movement on the calcium-dependent pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driss-Ecole|first1=Dominique|last2=Legué|first2=Valérie|last3=Carnero-Diaz|first3=Eugénie|last4=Perbal|first4=Gérald|title=Gravisensitivity and automorphogenesis of lentil seedling roots grown on board the International Space Station|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|date=1 September 2008|volume=134|issue=1|pages=191–201|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01121.x|issn=1399-3054|pmid=18429941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment found that the plants were able to sense the direction of gravity even at very low levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific objectives|url=https://lensesinspace.wordpress.com/objectives-of-the-gravi-experiment-2/|website=Plants in space: GRAVI-2 experiment|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later experiment with the EMCS placed 768 lentil seedlings in a centrifuge to stimulate various gravitational changes; this experiment, Gravi-2 (2014), displayed that plants change calcium signalling towards root growth while being grown in a several gravity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A decade of plant biology in space|url=https://phys.org/news/2016-07-decade-biology-space.html|publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many experiments have a more generalized approach in observing overall plant growth patterns as opposed to one specific growth behavior. One such experiment from the [[Canadian Space Agency]], for example, found that [[white spruce]] seedlings grew differently in the anti-gravity space environment compared with Earth-bound seedlings;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA - Advanced Plant Experiment - Canadian Space Agency 2|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/70.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; the space seedlings exhibited enhanced growth from the shoots and needles, and also had randomized [[amyloplast]] distribution compared with the Earth-bound control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rioux|first1=Danny|last2=Lagacé|first2=Marie|last3=Cohen|first3=Luchino Y.|last4=Beaulieu|first4=Jean|title=Variation in stem morphology and movement of amyloplasts in white spruce grown in the weightless environment of the International Space Station|journal=Life Sciences in Space Research|date=1 January 2015|volume=4|pages=67–78|doi=10.1016/j.lssr.2015.01.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221455241500005X|bibcode=2015LSSR....4...67R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early efforts===
The first organisms in space were "specially developed strains of seeds" launched to {{convert|134|km|mi|abbr=on}} on 9 July 1946 on a U.S. launched [[V-2 rocket]]. These samples were not recovered. The first seeds launched into space and successfully recovered were [[maize]] seeds launched on 30 July 1946. Soon followed [[rye]] and [[cotton]]. These early [[suborbital]] biological experiments were handled by [[Harvard University]] and the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] and were concerned with [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] on living tissue.&lt;ref name=Beischer1962&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beischer, DE |author2=Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space.

These [[Moon trees]] were planted and grown with controls back on Earth where no changes were detected.

In 1982, the crew of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Salyut 7]] space station conducted an experiment, prepared by Lithuanian scientists ([[Alfonsas Merkys]] and others), and grew some [[Arabidopsis]] using Fiton-3 experimental micro-greenhouse apparatus, thus becoming the first plants to flower and produce seeds in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-species-of-plant-to-flower-in-space |title=First species of plant to flower in space |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasawatch.com/archives/2016/01/no-nasa-these-a.html |title=No NASA, These Are Not The First Plants To Flower In Space |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Skylab]] experiment studied the effects of gravity and light on [[rice]] plants.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-401/ch5.htm NASA SP-401 - Chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SVET-2]] Space Greenhouse successfully achieved seed to seed plant growth in 1997 aboard space station ''[[Mir]]''.&lt;ref name=zvet&gt;[http://www.space.bas.bg/astro/Aerosp16/tania1.pdf T.Ivanova, et al. - First Successful Space Seed-to-Seed Plant Growth Experiment in the SVET-2 Space Greenhouse in 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bion 5]] carried ''[[Daucus carota]]'' and [[Bion 7]] carried [[maize]] (aka corn).

Plant research continued on the [[International Space Station]]. Biomass Production System was used on the ISS [[Expedition 4]]. The [[Vegetable Production System]] (Veggie) system was later used aboard [[ISS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/Veggie.html NASA - VEGGIE]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants tested in Veggie before going into space included lettuce, Swiss chard, radishes, Chinese cabbage and peas.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/veggie.html NASA - Station Investigation to Test Fresh Food Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; Red [[Romaine lettuce]] was grown in space on [[Expedition 40]] which were harvested when mature, frozen and tested back on Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6305">The idea of '''public ecology''' has recently emerged in response to increasing disparities over political, social, and environmental concerns.  Of particular interest are the processes that generate, evaluate and apply knowledge in political, social, and environmental arenas.  Public ecology offers a way of framing [[sustainability]] problems, community dynamics and social issues.  Forests, [[Drainage basin|watersheds]], parks, [[flora]], [[fauna]], air, and water all constitute environmental quality and are therefore public goods.  The processes society engages in to negotiate the meaning of these goods, upon which decisions and actions are based, reside within the [[public domain]].

==Dynamics==

The boundaries that are ascribed to both social and ecological systems are permeable and dynamic.  The creation and maintenance of these boundaries should not be exclusionary.  Politicians, economists and ecologist must work with citizens across cultural, organizational, institutional, political and geographic boundaries.  However, which citizens should be involved, and to what extent and in what manner they should participate are questions that need to be addressed.

Knowledge bases, roles of experts, and state and local power dynamics are changing in ways that impel us to learn new ways of coexisting.  A more public ecology could take many forms and exist in many forums, some of which are currently being explored through theory and practice.  [[Adaptive Management]], [[citizen science]] (Backstrand 2003), ecological real-world experiments (Gross &amp; Hoffmann-Riem 2005), and [[Collaborative Ecosystem Governance]] (Karkkainen 2002) are examples of evolving processes that attempt to deal with the increasing complexity and dynamism of social and ecological systems.  Governance of these systems must integrate biological and social dimensions.  Competing value claims will inevitably arise and lead to conflicts that must be addressed through an inclusive, deliberative and adaptive process.  An understanding of [[ecosystems]] must consider and dignify the values of affected communities and not just rely on claims made by scientific experts.

== Main organizing principles ==

*  Promotes a blending of natural with the social that goes beyond [[Conservation movement|naturalism]] and [[environmental science]]
*  Seeks integrative collaborative processes that cross the many disciplinary and cultural boundaries  
that separate scientists, policy-makers, and citizens

*  Explores dimensions, qualities, and aspects of the world that are public and driven by normative 
claims

*  Supports respect for the various value systems that shape political discourse at local, regional, and national scales
*  Values local decision making that is embedded in the larger context of protecting public goods
*  Recognizes the need for local knowledge and local action to address local concerns in a more 
inclusive and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] process

*  Considers local decision making embedded in a larger context of protecting public goods
                                           
(''Adapted from David Robertson, Bruce Hull and [[Timothy Luke]]'')

Many of these principles are shared or have roots in disciplines such as political ecology, sustainable development, [[Urban area|urban]] ecology, [[conservation biology]] and restoration ecology.  Public Ecology also shares a common interdisciplinary and [[holistic]] approach to social-environmental interactions with Human Ecology.

== Quotes ==

''“The challenge today is how to develop a truly public ecology with new organizations, institutions, and ideas whose material articulation can balance the insights of scientific experts, the concerns of [[private property]] holders, the worries about social inequity, and the need for ecological [[sustainability]] to support human and nonhuman life in the 21st century.”''  
(Luke 2005)

''“Public ecology is distinctive in that it explicitly and critically embraces its own normativity and uncertainty while striving to create a more democratic body of knowledge that will help us to understand the environment as a complex and dynamic biocultural system, one that can be interpreted from a variety of perspectives and points of view.  Public ecology encourages citizens and all concerned stakeholders to participate with research scientists and professional policy-makers in the interdisciplinary, collaborative efforts necessary to resolve the uncertainty and conflict that surrounds contemporary environmental issues”'' (Robertson and Hull 2003)

''“Public ecology is a more powerful [[ecology]].  It is a body of environmental knowledge that seeks to bridge the gulf between science and policy.  Public ecology not only exists at the interface of science and policy but functions as a joint product of these generally disparate realms.  The language of public ecology facilitates the flow of ideas and information form one side to the other and back again.”'' (Robertson and Hull 2001)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3234">'''[[regeneration (biology)|Regeneration]]''' is the ability for a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[organism]] to recover from damage. It can also be used to describe the ability of an [[ecosystem]]-- specifically, the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and its living [[population]]-- to recover from damage.

[[Resilience (ecology)|Resilience]] to minor [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] is one characteristic feature of healthy ecosystems. Following major (lethal) disturbances, such as a [[forest fire|fire]] or pest outbreak in a forest, an immediate return to the previous [[dynamic equilibrium]] will not be possible. Instead, [[Pioneer species|pioneering species]] will occupy, compete for space, and establish themselves in the newly opened habitat. The new growth of seedlings and [[Assembly rules|community assembly]] process is known as regeneration in [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Dietze08"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1890/07-0271.1 | last1=Dietze | first1=M.

In certain regions like [[Bushfires in Australia|Australia]], natural [[wildfire]] is a necessary condition for a cyclically [[Ecological stability|stable ecosystem]] with cyclic regeneration.

==Artificial disturbances==
While natural disturbances are usually fully compensated by the rules of ecological succession, human interference can significantly alter the regenerative [[homeostatic]] faculties of an ecosystem up to a degree that [[self-healing]] will not be possible. For regeneration to occur, active [[restoration ecology|restoration]] must be attempted.

'''Richard Thomas Mabey''' (born 20 February 1941) is a writer and broadcaster, chiefly on the relations between nature and culture. 

==Education==
Mabey was educated at three independent schools, all in [[Berkhamsted]], Hertfordshire. The first was at [[Rothesay School]], followed by Berkhamsted Preparatory School and then [[Berkhamsted School]]. He then went to [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]] at the [[University of Oxford]] where he read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]].

==Life and work==
After Oxford, Mabey worked as a lecturer in Social Studies in Further Education at [[Dacorum College]], [[Hemel Hempstead]], then as a Senior Editor at [[Penguin Books]]. He became a full-time writer in 1974. He spent most of his life among the beechwoods of the [[Chilterns]]. He now lives in the [[Waveney Valley]] in Norfolk, with his partner Polly Lavendar, and retreats to a boat on the Norfolk [[The Broads|Broads]].

In the 1970s and 80s Mabey wrote and presented several television documentaries. He appeared in the 1975 BBC programme ''[[In Deepest Britain]]'', with [[John Gooders]] and other naturalists, giving an unscripted narration of the wildlife observed during a country walk.&lt;ref name="Countryfile"&gt;{{Cite episode | series = Countryfile | serieslink = Countryfile | url =  | accessdate = 2012-10-14 | network = BBC | date = 2012-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/726479|title=In Deepest Britain (1975) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]]|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and narrated the 1996 [[BBC]] [[television series]] ''Postcards from the Country'', for whose eight, 40- minute episodes he was series [[Television producer|producer]], as well as being the producer- [[Television director|director]] on four. He made a film for the [[BBC]] on [[Kew Gardens]]. His ''Unofficial Countryside'' and ''The Flowering of Britain'' were based on his books of the same names. ''White Rock, Black Water'' was a specially-written film about the limestone Country of the [[Yorkshire Dales]], and a [[Channel 4]] 8-part series -  ''Back to the Roots'' – explored the role of plants in Britain’s contemporary culture . In the 1990s he appeared regularly on BBC’s ''[[Country File]]''.&lt;ref name="Countryfile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BFI"/&gt;

Between 1982 and 1986 he sat on the UK government’s advisory body, the [[Nature Conservancy Council]]. Mabey writes regularly for ''[[The Guardian]]'', the ''[[New Statesman]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[Granta]]''. A selection of these writings was compiled as the book ''Country Matters''. He has written a personal column in ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' magazine since 1984, and a selection of these columns has been published as ''A Brush with Nature''.

Between 2000 and 2002 Mabey suffered from depression, and his book ''Nature Cure'', describing his experiences and recovery in the context of man’s relationship with landscape and nature, was short-listed for three major literary awards, the [[2005 Whitbread Awards|Whitbread Biography of the Year]], the [[Royal Society of Literature]]’s [[Ondaatje Prize]] for evoking the spirit of place and the [[J.R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography]].

He has edited and introduced editions of [[Richard Jefferies]], [[Gilbert White]], [[Flora Thompson]] and [[Peter Matthiessen]]. His contributions to [[BBC radio]] include 'The Scientist and the Romantic', a series of five essays on his lifelong relationship with science and the natural environment broadcast in 'The Essay' on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] in 2009, and ''Changing Climates'', on our everyday experience of living with the weather, in 2013. Mabey was the first president of the [[London Wildlife Trust]]&lt;ref name="Mabey's Meadow"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/reserves/frays-island-and-mabeys-meadow | title=Frays Island and Mabey's Meadow | publisher=London Wildlife Trust | accessdate=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a Vice-president;&lt;ref name="Wild London"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wildlondon.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/WIld%20London%20Summer%202009.pdf | title=Wild London | publisher=London Wildlife Trust | work=Wild London | date=Summer 2009 | accessdate=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mabey's Meadow, named for him by the London Wildlife Trust, was one of his favourite haunts, and is described in his book ''The Unofficial Countryside'' (1974). It provides the only access to [[Frays Island]] in the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]].&lt;ref name="Mabey's Meadow"/&gt;

==Awards and distinctions==

Mabey has been awarded two Leverhulme Fellowships, and honorary doctorates by St Andrews, Essex and East Anglia for his contributions to nature writing. He was awarded a [[Civil List Pension]] in 2008 for services to literature. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 2011. He is a Trustee of the arts and conservation charity Common Ground, Vice-President of the Open Spaces Society, Patron of the [[John Clare]] Society and President of the Waveney and Blythe Arts.{{cn|date=December 2013}}

His life of [[Gilbert White]] won the [[1986 Whitbread Biography of the Year]].{{cn|date=December 2013}} His ''Flora Britannica'' won the [[British_Book_Awards#Illustrated_Book_of_the_Year|British Book Awards]]’ Illustrated Book of the Year and the [[Botanical Society of the British Isles]]’ President’s Award, and was runner-up for the [[BP Natural World Book Prize]].{{cn|date=December 2013}}

A '''solar flare''' is a sudden flash of increased brightness on the [[Sun]], usually observed near its surface
and in close proximity to a [[sunspot]] group. 
Powerful flares are often, but not always, accompanied by a [[coronal mass ejection]]. Even the most powerful flares are barely detectable in the [[total solar irradiance]].&lt;ref name="Kopp2005"&gt;{{cite journal

Solar flares occur in a [[power-law]] spectrum of magnitudes; an energy release of typically 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s of [[energy]] suffices to produce a clearly observable event, while a major event can emit up to 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; joules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/sftheory/flare.htm |title=What is a Solar Flare?  |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=May 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flares eject clouds of electrons, ions, and atoms through the [[Sun]]'s [[corona]] into [[outer space]], and also emit [[radio waves]].  

If ejection is in the direction of the Earth, particles associated with this disturbance can penetrate into the upper atmosphere (the [[ionosphere]]) and cause bright [[aurora]]s, and may even disrupt long range radio communication. 
It usually takes a day or two for the solar ejecta to reach [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Menzel, Whipple, and de Vaucouleurs, "Survey of the Universe", 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Flares also occur on other stars, where the term [[flare star|stellar flare]] applies.

On July 23, 2012, a massive, potentially damaging, [[Solar storm of 2012|solar storm]] (solar flare, coronal mass ejection and [[electromagnetic radiation]]) barely missed Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140723a"&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips |first=Dr. Tony |title=Near Miss: The Solar Superstorm of July 2012 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/23jul_superstorm/ |date=July 23, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140429"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Video (04:03) – Carrington-class coronal mass ejection narrowly misses Earth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ukQhycKOFw |date=April 28, 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NASA, there may be as much as a 12% chance of a similar event occurring between 2012 and 2022.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140723a"/&gt;

== Description ==
Solar flares affect all layers of the solar atmosphere ([[Photosphere#The Sun|photosphere]], [[chromosphere]], and [[corona]]). The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] medium is heated to tens of millions of [[Kelvin]], while [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and heavier [[ion]]s are accelerated to near the [[speed of light]]. Flares produce [[electromagnetic radiation]] across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] at all [[wavelength]]s, from [[Radio frequency|radio waves]] to [[gamma ray]]s. Most of the energy is spread over frequencies outside the visual range and so the majority of the flares are not visible to the naked eye and must be observed with special instruments. Flares occur in active regions around [[sunspot]]s, where intense magnetic fields penetrate the photosphere to link the corona to the solar interior.
Flares are powered by the sudden (timescales of minutes to tens of minutes) release of magnetic energy stored in the corona. The same energy releases may produce [[coronal mass ejections]] (CMEs), although the relationship between CMEs and flares is still not well understood.

[[X-ray]]s and [[UV radiation]] emitted by solar flares can affect Earth's [[ionosphere]] and disrupt long-range radio communications. Direct radio emission at decimetric wavelengths may disturb the operation of radars and other devices that use those frequencies.

Solar flares were first observed on the Sun by [[Richard Christopher Carrington]] and independently by Richard Hodgson in 1859&lt;ref name="Carrington1859"&gt;"[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1859MNRAS..20...13C Description of a Singular Appearance seen in the Sun on September 1, 1859]", ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', v20, pp13+, 1859&lt;/ref&gt; as localized visible brightenings of small areas within a sunspot group. Stellar flares can be inferred by looking at the lightcurves produced from the telescope or satellite data of variety of other stars.

The frequency of occurrence of solar flares varies, from several per day when the Sun is particularly "active" to less than one every week when the Sun is "quiet", following the 11-year cycle (the [[solar cycle]]). Large flares are less frequent than smaller ones.

== Cause ==
Flares occur when accelerated charged particles, mainly electrons, interact with the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] medium. Evidence suggests that the phenomenon of [[magnetic reconnection]] leads to this copious acceleration of charged particles.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu et al, ApJ, 2016, 821, L29&lt;/ref&gt;
On the Sun, magnetic reconnection may happen on solar arcades&amp;nbsp;– a series of closely occurring loops following magnetic lines of force. These lines of force quickly reconnect into a lower arcade of loops leaving a helix of magnetic field unconnected to the rest of the arcade. The sudden release of energy in this reconnection is the origin of the particle acceleration. The unconnected magnetic helical field and the material that it contains may violently expand outwards forming a coronal mass ejection.&lt;ref name="sciam1"&gt;"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-mysterious-origins-of The Mysterious Origins of Solar Flares]", ''Scientific American'', April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This also explains why solar flares typically erupt from active regions on the Sun where magnetic fields are much stronger.

Although there is a general agreement on the source of a flare's energy, the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. It is not clear how the magnetic energy is transformed into the kinetic energy of the particles, nor is it known how some particles can be accelerated to the GeV range (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; [[electronvolt|electron volt]]) and beyond. There are also some inconsistencies regarding the total number of accelerated particles, which sometimes seems to be greater than the total number in the coronal loop. Scientists are unable to forecast flares.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The strength of an event within a class is noted by a numerical suffix ranging from 1 to 9, which is also the factor for that event within the class. Hence, an X2 flare is twice the strength of an X1 flare, an X3 flare is three times as powerful as an X1, and only 50% more powerful than an X2.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/active-region-on-sun-continues-to-emit-solar-flares&lt;/ref&gt; An X2 is four times more powerful than an M5 flare.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

=== H-alpha classification ===
An earlier flare classification was based on [[H-alpha|Hα]] spectral observations. The scheme uses both the intensity and emitting surface. The classification in intensity is qualitative, referring to the flares as: faint ('''f'''), normal ('''n''') or brilliant ('''b'''). The emitting surface is measured in terms of ''millionths'' of the hemisphere and is described below. (The total hemisphere area ''A&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 15.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

A flare then is classified taking '''S''' or a number that represents its size and a letter that represents its peak intensity, v.g.: '''Sn''' is a ''normal sunflare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Solar flares strongly influence the local [[space weather]] in the vicinity of the Earth. They can produce streams of highly energetic particles in the [[solar wind]] or [[stellar wind]], known as a [[solar proton event]]. These particles can impact the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] (see main article at [[geomagnetic storm]]), and present [[radiation]] hazards to spacecraft and astronauts. Additionally, massive solar flares are sometimes accompanied by [[coronal mass ejections]] (CMEs) which can trigger [[geomagnetic storms]] that [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|have been known]] to disable satellites and knock out terrestrial electric power grids for extended periods of time.

The soft [[X-ray]] flux of X class flares increases the ionization of the upper atmosphere, which can interfere with short-wave radio communication and can heat the outer atmosphere and thus increase the drag on low orbiting satellites, leading to orbital decay. Energetic particles in the magnetosphere contribute to the [[aurora borealis]] and [[aurora australis]]. Energy in the form of hard x-rays can be damaging to spacecraft electronics and are generally the result of large plasma ejection in the upper chromosphere.

The radiation risks posed by solar flares are a major concern in discussions of a [[manned mission to Mars]], the Moon, or other planets. Energetic protons can pass through the human body, causing [[Ionizing radiation#Biological effects|biochemical damage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=06-10 | title=New Study Questions the Effects of Cosmic Proton Radiation on Human Cells | accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting a hazard to astronauts during interplanetary travel. Some kind of physical or magnetic shielding would be required to protect the astronauts. Most proton storms take at least two hours from the time of visual detection to reach Earth's orbit. A solar flare on January 20, 2005 released the highest concentration of protons ever directly measured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/10jun_newstorm.htm|title=A New Kind of Solar Storm – NASA Science|website=nasa.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323174903/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2005/10jun_newstorm.htm|archivedate=2010-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving astronauts as little as 15 minutes to reach shelter.

== Observations ==
Flares produce radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, although with different intensity. They are not very intense in visible light, but they can be very bright at particular atomic lines. They normally produce [[bremsstrahlung]] in X-rays and [[synchrotron radiation]] in radio.

=== History ===
==== Optical observations ====
[[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] observed a flare for the first time on [[Solar storm of 1859|1 September 1859]] projecting the image produced by an optical telescope through a broad-band filter. It was an extraordinarily intense ''white light flare''. Since flares produce copious amounts of radiation at [[H-alpha|Hα]], adding a narrow ( ≈1 Å) passband filter centered at this wavelength to the optical telescope, allows the observation of not very bright flares with small telescopes. For years Hα was the main, if not the only, source of information about solar flares. Other passband filters are also used.

==== Radio observations ====
During [[World War II]], on February 25 and 26, 1942, British radar operators observed radiation that [[James Stanley Hey|Stanley Hey]] interpreted as solar emission. Their discovery did not go public until the end of the conflict. The same year [[George Clark Southworth|Southworth]] also observed the Sun in radio, but as with Hey, his observations were only known after 1945. In 1943 [[Grote Reber]] was the first to report radioastronomical observations of the Sun at 160&amp;nbsp;MHz. The fast development of [[radioastronomy]] revealed new peculiarities of the solar activity like ''storms'' and ''bursts'' related to the flares. Today ground-based radiotelescopes observe the Sun from c. 15&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 400&amp;nbsp;GHz.

==== Space telescopes ====
Since the beginning of [[space exploration]], telescopes have been sent to space, where they work at wavelengths shorter than UV, which are completely absorbed by the atmosphere, and where flares may be very bright. Since the 1970s, the [[GOES]] series of satellites observe the Sun in ''soft'' X-rays, and their observations became the ''standard measure'' of flares, diminishing the importance of the [[H-alpha|Hα]] classification. ''Hard'' X-rays were observed by many different instruments, the most important today being the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager ([[RHESSI]]). Nonetheless, UV observations are today the ''stars'' of solar imaging with their incredible fine details that reveal the complexity of the [[solar corona]]. Spacecraft may also bring radio detectors at extremely long wavelengths (as long as a few kilometers) that cannot propagate through the [[ionosphere]].

The following spacecraft missions have flares as their main observation target.
* [[Yohkoh]] – The Yohkoh (originally Solar A) spacecraft observed the Sun with a variety of instruments from its launch in 1991 until its failure in 2001. The observations spanned a period from one solar maximum to the next. Two instruments of particular use for flare observations were the Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT), a glancing incidence low energy X-ray telescope for photon energies of order 1 keV, and the Hard X-ray Telescope (HXT), a collimation counting instrument which produced images in higher energy X-rays (15-92 keV) by image synthesis.
* [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]] – The Wind spacecraft is devoted to the study of the interplanetary medium. Since the Solar Wind is its main driver, solar flares effects can be traced with the instruments aboard Wind. Some of the WIND experiments are: a very low frequency spectrometer, (WAVES), particles detectors (EPACT, SWE) and a magnetometer (MFI).
* [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES]] – The GOES spacecraft are satellites in [[geostationary orbit]]s around the Earth that have measured the soft X-ray flux from the Sun since the mid-1970s, following the use of similar instruments on the [[Galactic Radiation and Background|Solrad]] satellites. GOES X-ray observations are commonly used to classify flares, with A, B, C, M, and X representing different powers of ten&amp;nbsp;– an X-class flare has a peak 1-8 Å flux above 0.0001 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* [[Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager|RHESSI]] – The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectral Imager is designed to image solar flares in energetic photons from soft X rays (c. 3&amp;nbsp;keV) to gamma rays (up to c. 20&amp;nbsp;MeV) and to provide high resolution spectroscopy up to gamma-ray energies of c. 20&amp;nbsp;MeV. Furthermore, it has the capability to perform spatially resolved spectroscopy with high spectral resolution.
* [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] – The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory is collaboration between the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and [[NASA]] which is in operation since December 1995. It carries 12 different instruments, among them the [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope]] (EIT), the [[Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph]] (LASCO) and the [[Michelson Doppler Imager]] (MDI). SOHO is in a halo orbit around the earth-sun [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point.
* [[TRACE]] – The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer is a NASA [[Small Explorer program]] (SMEX) to image the solar corona and transition region at high angular and temporal resolution.  It has passband filters at 173 Å, 195 Å, 284 Å, 1600 Å with a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc sec, the best at these wavelengths.
* [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] – The Solar Dynamics Observatory is a NASA project composed of 3 different instruments: the [[Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager]] (HMI), the [[Atmospheric Imaging Assembly]] (AIA) and the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment]] (EVE). It has been operating since February 2010 in a [[geosynchronous]] earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/about.php "About the SDO Mission"] ''Solar Dynamics Observatory.'' Retrieved: 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hinode]] –The Hinode spacecraft, originally called Solar B, was launched by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] in September 2006 to observe solar flares in more precise detail. Its instrumentation, supplied by an international collaboration including Norway, the U.K., the U.S., and Africa focuses on the powerful magnetic fields thought to be the source of solar flares. Such studies shed light on the causes of this activity, possibly helping to forecast future flares and thus minimize their dangerous effects on satellites and astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* [[Advanced Composition Explorer|ACE]] – The Advanced Composition Explorer was launched in 1997 into a halo orbit around the earth-sun [[Lagrangian point#L1|L1]] point. It carries spectrometers, magnetometers and charged particle detectors to analyze the solar wind. The Real Time Solar Wind (RTSW) beacon is continually monitored by a network of [[NOAA]]-sponsored ground stations to provide early warning of earth-bound CMEs.
* [[MAVEN]] – The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on November 18, 2013, is the first mission devoted to understanding the Martian upper atmosphere. The goal of MAVEN is to determine the role that loss of atmospheric gas to space played in changing the Martian climate through time. The Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) monitor on MAVEN is part of the Langmuir Probe and Waves (LPW) instrument and measures solar EUV input and variability, and wave heating of the Martian upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;lasp.colorado.edu/maven&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these solar observing facilities, many non-solar astronomical satellites observe flares either intentionally (e.g., [[NuSTAR]]), or simply because the penetrating hard radiations coming from a flare can
readily penetrate most forms of shielding.

In modern times, the largest solar flare measured with instruments occurred on November 4, 2003. This event saturated the GOES detectors, and because of this its classification is only approximate. Initially, extrapolating the GOES curve, it was estimated to be X28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/hotshots/2003_11_04/ |title=SOHO Hotshots |publisher=''Sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov'' |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysis of the ionospheric effects suggested increasing this estimate to X45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=13844 |title=Biggest ever solar flare was even bigger than thought {{!}} SpaceRef – Your Space Reference |date=2004-03-15 |publisher=''SpaceRef'' |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This event produced the first clear evidence of a new spectral component above 100&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.guigue.gcastro.net/publicaciones/cientificas/Kaufmannetal2004.pdf|format=pdf|title=A new solar burst spectral component emitting only in the terahertz range|first=Pierre|last=Kaufmann|first2=Jean-ierre|last2=Raulin|first3=C.

== Prediction ==
Current methods of flare prediction are problematic, and there is no certain indication that an active region on the Sun will produce a flare. However, many properties of sunspots and active regions correlate with flaring. For example, magnetically complex regions (based on line-of-sight magnetic field) called delta spots produce the largest flares. A simple scheme of sunspot classification due to McIntosh, or related to fractal complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= McAteer|first1= James|date= 2005|title= Statistics of Active Region Complexy|journal= The Astrophysical Journal|volume= 631 |issue= 2|page=638|bibcode= 2005ApJ...631..628M |doi = 10.1086/432412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly used as a starting point for flare prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wheatland|first1= M. S.|date= 2008|title= A Bayesian approach to solar flare prediction|journal= The Astrophysical Journal|volume= 609|issue= 2|pages= 1134–1139|doi= 10.1086/421261|url= http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/609/2/1134/pdf/0004-637X_609_2_1134.pdf|arxiv = astro-ph/0403613 |bibcode = 2004ApJ...609.1134W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictions are usually stated in terms of probabilities for occurrence of flares above M or X GOES class within 24 or 48 hours. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] issues forecasts of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ |title=Space Weather Prediction Center |publisher=''NOAA'' |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2052">The '''Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of [[Indochina]].

==Setting==
The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|124,300|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending across portions of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]]. 

The Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests occupy the lower portion of the [[Mekong Basin]], where they are intertwined with the [[Central Indochina dry forests]]. The [[Southern Annamites montane rain forests]] border the dry evergreen forests on the east, occupying the higher elevations of the [[Annamite Range]]. To the south, the [[Indochina mangroves]] lie between [[tropical seasonal forest]]s and the [[South China Sea]]. The [[Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forests]] and [[Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forests]] lie to the southeast, in the seasonally and permanently flooded lowlands along the [[Tonle Sap]] and [[Mekong]] rivers and Tonle Sap Lake.

==Flora==
The Southeastern Indochina dry evergreen forests are one of three dry broadleaf forest ecoregions with predominantly evergreen trees; trees in dry broadleaf forests typically lose their leaves during the dry season.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is home to many large mammals, including the [[Asian elephant]] ''(Elephas maximus)'', [[tiger]] ''(Panthera tigris)'', previously one of two known populations of the now extinct [[Javan rhinoceros]] ''(Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus)'', [[Eld's Deer]] ''(Cervus eldi)'', [[banteng]] ''(Bos javanicus)'', [[gaur]] ''(Bos gaurus)'', [[clouded leopard]] ''(Pardofelis nebulosa),'' [[leopard]] ''(Panthera pardus)'', [[Malayan sun bear]] ''(Ursus malayanus)'', and [[khting-vor]] ''(Pseudonovibos spiralis)''.

The '''TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics)''' is an orbiter mission dedicated to study the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of the [[Mesosphere]] and Lower [[Thermosphere]] (MLT) portion of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The mission was launched from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[California]] on December 7, 2001 aboard a [[Delta II rocket]] launch vehicle. The project is sponsored and managed by [[NASA]], while the spacecraft was designed and assembled by the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The mission has been extended several times, and has now collected data over an entire [[solar cycle]], which helps in its goal to differentiate  the Sun's effects on the atmosphere from other effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Fox| first=Karen| title=Ten Successful Years of Mapping the Middle Atmosphere| url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/timed-10yrs.html| publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atmospheric region under study==
[[Image:Timed litho front.jpg|right|thumb|left|TIMED Mission diagram (NASA)]]
The [[Mesosphere]] and Lower [[Thermosphere]] (MLT) region of the atmosphere to be studied by TIMED is located between 60–180&amp;nbsp;km above the Earth's surface where energy from solar radiation is first deposited into the atmosphere. This can have profound effects on Earth's upper atmospheric regions, particularly during the peak of the Sun's 11-year solar cycle when the greatest amounts of its energy are being released. Understanding these interactions is also important for our understanding of various subjects in [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], and [[atmospheric science]], as solar radiation is one of the primary driving forces behind [[tide|atmospheric tides]]. Changes in the MLT can also affect modern [[satellite]] and [[radio]] [[telecommunications]].

==Scientific instruments onboard==
The spacecraft payload consists of the following four main instruments:

*'''Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI)''': A spatial-scanning, far-ultraviolet spectrograph designed to globally measure the composition and [[temperature]] profiles of the MLT region, as well as its [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] energy inputs.
*'''Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE)''': A [[spectrometer]] and a suite of [[photometer]]s designed to measure the solar soft X-rays, extreme-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet radiation that is deposited into the MLT region.
*'''TIMED  Doppler Interferometer (TIDI)''': Designed to globally measure the wind and temperature profiles of the MLT region.
*'''Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER)''': Multichannel radiometer designed to measure heat emitted by the atmosphere over a broad altitude and spectral range, as well as global temperature profiles and sources of atmospheric cooling.

He  established a division of labor using three criteria: skill, class and  age. Skilled labor involved carpenters, masons and saddlers. Unskilled labor involved  field workers. Laborie proposed  appointing slaves to supervisory positions. He also divided labor by age. Small children were  weeding and pruning. Young adolescents between the ages of 12 and 16  were weeding and gathering coffee. Adults did the field work. The elderly supervised children and guarded poultry and provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wTegBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT100&amp;lpg=PT100&amp;dq=P.+J.+Laborie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A-4T4983Xe&amp;sig=e4WgYXw2t95XDuEK2xZ3mjcjPj4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiW8_XW_4DcAhWlzVkKHfycCpg4ChDoAQhPMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=P.%20J.%20Laborie&amp;f=false|title=An Archaeology of Social Space: Analyzing Coffee Plantations in Jamaica’s Blue Mountains|last=Delle|first=James A.|date=2013-06-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781475791594|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If interest direct the first, humanity enjoins the second, and here they go hand in hand. Happy accord! the consciousness of which forms the whole philosophical and political system of the planter; all the magic of the supreme power of one chief, and of that entire submission of the many, which would still have subsisted unimpaired in this island, had not the fatal French revolution introduced principles, incompatible with the conditions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qfgaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Coffee Planter of Saint Domingo: With an Appendix, Containing a View of the Constitution, Government, Laws, and State of that Colony, Previous to the Year 1789.

[[Image:NaturalHistoryIrelandVolume1.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Natural History of Ireland'' Volume 1 Frontis]]
'''''The Natural History of Ireland''''' is a four volume work by [[William Thompson (naturalist)|William Thompson]]. The first three volumes were published by Reeve and Benham, [[London]] between 1849 and 1851. Volume 4 was published by Henry G. Bohn, London in 1856. 
''The Natural History of Ireland'' is very influential of later developments.

The parts are:

*Volume 1: ''Birds, comprising the orders raptores and insessores'' (1849)
*Volume 2: ''Birds, comprising the orders rasores and grallatores'' (1850)
*Volume 3: ''Birds, comprising the order natatores'' (1851)
*Volume 4: ''Mammalia, reptiles and fishes. Also, invertebrata'' (1856)&lt;br/&gt;edited and published by [[George Dickie (botanist)|George Dickie]], [[James Ramsey Garrett]] and [[Robert Patterson (Belfast)|Robert Patterson]] four years after Thompson's death.

The  ''Natural History of Ireland''  was the first attempt to produce an account of the [[fauna of Ireland]]. ''"With so much already done pictorially and descriptively, on the subject of British ornithology, it may be considered superfluous to treat of the birds of Ireland in a separate work, but, in the author's opinion, every country should possess a Natural History specially appertaining to itself. In the publications referred to, the birds of Ireland have been but briefly indicated, — a species generally dis- missed in a single line, and so much appearing only in two works; — those of Sir Win. Jardine and Mr. Yarrell"''.

==Precursors and sources==
In 1837 [[Robert Templeton]] published a scientific paper entitled "Irish Vertebrate Animals", selected from the Papers of the late [[John Templeton (botanist)|John Templeton]] in the Magazine of Natural History [[s:Irish Vertebrate Animals: selected from the Papers of John Templeton]]. This is the first scientific Irish list of Ireland's bird, mammal and fish.

Text on the bird species, Thompson’s main interest, is a mixture of his own observations (some of which he had previously published in ''[[Journal of Natural History|Annals and Magazine of Natural History]]''), and as quotations, those of British authors and his many correspondents in Ireland. William Sinclaire, a merchant in Belfast and a [[Bird collections|bird collector]], [[John Vandeleur Stewart]] and Richard Langtry an estate owner at Milltown near Belfast figure prominently. Reference is also made to specimens held by the [[Belfast Natural History Society|Belfast Museum]], [[Robert Ball (naturalist)|Dublin University Museum]] and the [[Leskean Cabinet|Royal Dublin Society Museum]]. There is frequent mention of [[Taxidermy|bird preservers]].

==Classification==
The birds are placed in the higher groups proposed by [[Pierre Barrère]] and adopted by early 19th century authors.
*Raptores - birds of the orders [[Falconiformes]] and [[Strigiformes]].
*Insessores - obsolete term used for a bird with feet adapted for perching.
*Rasores - obsolete term for an order of birds; corresponds to [[Gallinae|Gallinæ]].
*Grallatores, sometimes Grallæ - obsolete term order of birds which formerly included all the waders. 
*Natatores - The swimming birds (a very artificial group including ducks, geese and swans).

==Illustrations==
The work is not illustrated "Figures of Irish birds are not required, as all the species are included, down to the period of publication (to mention British works only) in [[Prideaux John Selby|Selby]]'s ''Illustrations of British Ornithology'', [[John Gould|Gould]]'s ''Birds of Europe'' [https://archive.org/stream/birdsEuropeIGoul#page/n7/mode/2up Volume 1], 
[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132861#page/10/mode/2up Volume 2], 
[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/133913#page/8/mode/2up Volume 3],
[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132862#page/9/mode/2up Volume 4],
[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/133915#page/8/mode/2up Volume 5] ;
and the ''History of British Birds'' by [[Thomas Bewick|Bewick]] [https://archive.org/stream/memorialeditiono01bewirich#page/n7/mode/2up Bewick volume 1], [https://archive.org/stream/memorialeditiono02bewirich#page/n5/mode/2up Bewick volume 2] and [[William Yarrell|Yarrell]] [1843], respectively.[https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish01will#page/n11/mode/2up Yarrell Volume 1],
[https://archive.org/stream/britishbirds02yarrrich#page/n5/mode/2up Volume 2],
[https://archive.org/stream/britishbirds03yarrrich#page/n5/mode/2up Volume 3]
Coloured figures of many of the species are also given in [[Sir William Jardine, 7th Baronet|Sir Wm. Jardine]]'s work on British Birds and in [[William MacGillivray|Mr. Macgillivray]]'s [https://archive.org/stream/historyofbritish03macg#page/n3/mode/2up ], the heads, at least, of nearly all the land birds are represented".

==Style==
The style is literary. Note that the quote is verbatim, the verification complete and the museum location given and that Temminck's French text has been translated and that Thompson knows that this is the first British Isles record. From page 364:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;THE GREAT SPOTTED CUCKOO. 
''[[Great spotted cuckoo|Cuculus glandarius]]'', Linn. 
Has once been obtained.&lt;/center&gt;

A letter from A. Crighton, Esq., of Clifden, Connemara, to Mr. R, Ball gives the following information respecting it:—-&lt;br /&gt;
{{spaces|10}}"The cuckoo, pursued by hawks, was taken by two persons, walking on the island of Omagh. It flew into a hole in a stone fence or wall, was caught alive, and lived for four days on potatoes and water. The inhabitants of this country had never seen any bird like it before, and as they are constantly in the habit of fishing at Bofin and Arran Islands, if the bird were to be met with, no doubt they would have recognised it. The bird when chased by the hawks, appeared fatigued, weak, and emaciated, as though it had taken a long flight, as woodcocks and other birds of passage do on first arrival." The month of March, 1842 is said to have been the time of its capture. On being sent to Dublin to be preserved, an excellent coloured drawing of it, the size of life, was kindly made by Miss Battersby, and forwarded for my acceptance: the plumage represented agrees best with that of the adult bird, as described by Temminck. The specimen has subsequently been obtained by Mr. Ball for the museum of Trinity College Dublin. It is the only one known to have visited the British Islands.&lt;br /&gt;
{{spaces|10}}According to Temminck (part 3, p. 277) the northern parts of Africa seem to be the chief abode of this bird, which occasionally visits southern Europe—Spain, France (south of), Italy, &amp;c. In Germany also, it has been met with in different instances.&lt;br /&gt;
{{spaces|10}}"Mr Gould, in his well known work on the Birds of Europe, says, that the true habitat of this species is the wooded districts, skirting the sultry plains of North Africa, but those that pass the Mediterranean, find a congenial climate in Spain and Italy. Opportunities are still wanting to confirm the most interesting of its habits." *

(2nd edit.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dg_CePmIzCUC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;lpg=PA364&amp;dq=%22A+letter+from+A.+Crighton,+Esq.,+of+Clifden,+Connemara,+to+Mr.+R.+Ball%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=woSFFLaYEu&amp;sig=dF_NrBSXXFDvP_9nn_NWRQA3Cdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMI4emcnLncxgIVFjCICh3IzAjZ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20letter%20from%20A.%20Crighton%2C%20Esq.%2C%20of%20Clifden%2C%20Connemara%2C%20to%20Mr.%20R.%20Ball%22&amp;f=false ''The Natural History of Ireland'', Volume 1, p 364], Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Volume 4==
[[Invertebrate|Invertebrata]]
In this section the editors of Volume 4 (Dickie,Garrett and Patterson) were assisted by two of its contributors [[Robert Ball (naturalist)|Robert Ball]] in Dublin and [[George Crawford Hyndman]] in Belfast who had supplied Thompson with information on [[Invertebrate]]s . [[Alexander Henry Haliday]] wrote a short section on insects which was limited to the number of Irish species in each Order.[[William Henry Harvey]], [[George Allman (natural historian)|George James Allman]] and [[Joshua Alder]] are prominent in the text. Invertebrata is part based on [[Robert Templeton]]'s 1836 text A catalogue of the species annulose animals and of rayed ones found in Ireland as selected from the papers of the late [[John Templeton (botanist)|J. Templeton]] Esq. of Cranmore with localities, descriptions and illustrations. ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' 9: 233-240; 301-305; 41-421; 466-472.There are two lady contributors - Miss Hancock (sister of [[Albany Hancock]]) and [[Mary Ball]].
[[Image:ThompsonArchive.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Envelope (folder) with letter extracts and notes on the [[goosander]]]]

==Method==
Thompson kept his notes for ''The Natural History of Ireland'' in envelopes. These contained notes made at various times, letters, or extracts from letters, references to his personal journals or to his published papers, to books, to scientific periodicals, or to the transactions of societies (many foreign). Small envelopes contained notes on species. These were placed in larger envelopes for [[Genus|genera]] (also containing notes on genera). In turn these were placed in envelopes for families (containing notes on families). The families, genera, and species were arranged in regular sequence so that any particular one could immediately be found. The notes were written on paper "of the most miscellaneous description ; and occasionally on scraps so small that six or eight lines were crowded into a slip not exceeding an inch in breadth".

The '''turbopause''' marks the altitude in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] below which [[turbulence|turbulent mixing]] dominates. The region below the turbopause is known as the [[homosphere]], where the chemical constituents are well mixed and display identical height distributions; in other words, the chemical composition of the atmosphere remains constant in this region for chemical species which have long mean residence times. Highly reactive chemicals tend to exhibit great concentration variability throughout the atmosphere, whereas unreactive species will exhibit more homogeneous concentrations. The region above the turbopause is the [[heterosphere]], where [[diffusion|molecular diffusion]] dominates and the chemical composition of the atmosphere varies according to chemical species.

The turbopause lies near the [[mesopause]], at the intersection of the [[mesosphere]] and the [[thermosphere]], at an altitude of roughly 100&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net/|title=ACP - Home|website=www.atmospheric-chemistry-and-physics.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''white dwarf''', also called a '''degenerate dwarf''', is a [[Compact star|stellar core remnant]] composed mostly of [[electron-degenerate matter]]. A white dwarf is very [[density|dense]]: its mass is comparable to that of the [[Sun]], while its volume is comparable to that of [[Earth]]. A white dwarf's faint [[luminosity]] comes from the [[Thermal radiation|emission]] of stored [[heat|thermal energy]]; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy.&lt;ref name="osln" /&gt; The nearest known white dwarf is [[Sirius B]], at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius [[binary star]]. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

White dwarfs are thought to be the final [[stellar evolution|evolutionary state]] of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a [[neutron star]], that of about 10 [[solar mass]]es. This includes over 97% of the other stars in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="cosmochronology" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, §&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/sup&gt; After the [[hydrogen]]-[[stellar nucleosynthesis|fusing]] period of a [[main sequence|main-sequence star]] of low or medium mass ends, such a star will expand to a [[red giant]] during which it fuses [[helium]] to [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] in its core by the [[triple-alpha process]]. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon (around 1 billion K), an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a [[planetary nebula]], it will leave behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf.&lt;ref name="rln"&gt;{{cite web

If the mass of the progenitor is between 8 and 10.5 [[solar mass]]es ({{solar mass|link=y}}), the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not [[neon]], in which case an oxygen–neon–[[magnesium]] white dwarf may form.&lt;ref name="oxne"&gt;{{cite journal

The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, so the star has no source of energy. As a result, it cannot support itself by the heat generated by fusion against [[gravitational collapse]], but is supported only by [[electron degeneracy pressure]], causing it to be extremely dense. The physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf, the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]—approximately 1.44 times of {{solar mass}}—beyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. A carbon-oxygen white dwarf that approaches this mass limit, typically by mass transfer from a companion star, may explode as a [[type Ia supernova]] via a process known as [[carbon detonation]];&lt;ref name="osln"&gt;{{cite web

A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, it will gradually radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high [[color temperature]], will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize, starting with the core. The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and it will become a cold [[black dwarf]].&lt;ref name="rln" /&gt; Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current [[age of the universe]] (approximately 13.8 billion years),&lt;ref name="aou"&gt;{{cite journal

== Discovery ==
{{See also|List of white dwarfs}}
The first white dwarf discovered was in the [[triple star system]] of [[40 Eridani]], which contains the relatively bright [[main sequence]] star [[40 Eridani A]], orbited at a distance by the closer [[binary star|binary system]] of the white dwarf [[40 Eridani B]] and the [[main sequence]] [[red dwarf]] [[40 Eridani C]]. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on 31 January 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=106749 |pages=40–126

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, [[Henry Norris Russell]], [[Edward Charles Pickering]] and [[Williamina Paton Stevens Fleming|Williamina Fleming]] discovered that, despite being a dim star, 40 Eridani B was of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] A, or white.&lt;ref name="holberg"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Russell looked back on the discovery:&lt;ref name="schatzman"&gt;''White Dwarfs'', E. Schatzman, Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was visiting my friend and generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With characteristic kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once that there was an extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called "possible" values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The spectral type of 40 Eridani B was officially described in 1914 by [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The white dwarf companion of [[Sirius]], [[Sirius]] B, was next to be discovered. During the nineteenth century, positional measurements of some stars became precise enough to measure small changes in their location. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel|Friedrich Bessel]] used position measurements to determine that the stars Sirius (α Canis Majoris) and [[Procyon]] (α Canis Minoris) were changing their positions periodically. In 1844 he predicted that both stars had unseen companions:&lt;ref name="fwbessel"&gt;{{cite journal
 |bibcode=1844MNRAS...6R.136B
 |title=On the variations of the proper motions of Procyon and Sirius

 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]
 |doi=10.1093/mnras/6.11.136a
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we were to regard ''Sirius'' and ''Procyon'' as double stars, the change of their motions would not surprise us; we should acknowledge them as necessary, and have only to investigate their amount by observation. But light is no real property of mass. The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing against the existence of numberless invisible ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bessel roughly estimated the period of the companion of Sirius to be about half a century;&lt;ref name="fwbessel" /&gt; [[Christian August Friedrich Peters|C. A. F. Peters]] computed an orbit for it in 1851.&lt;ref name="flammarion"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 31 January 1862 that [[Alvan Graham Clark]] observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion.&lt;ref name="flammarion" /&gt; [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter Adams]] announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since hotter bodies radiate more energy than colder ones, a star's surface brightness can be estimated from its [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]], and that from its [[stellar spectrum|spectrum]]. If the star's distance is known, its absolute luminosity can also be estimated. From the absolute luminosity and distance, the star's surface area and its radius can be calculated. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius&amp;nbsp;B and 40&amp;nbsp;Eridani&amp;nbsp;B must be very dense. When [[Ernst Öpik]] estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the [[Sun]]'s, which was so high that he called it "impossible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;blockquote&gt;We learn about the stars by receiving and interpreting the messages which their light brings to us. The message of the Companion of Sirius when it was decoded ran: "I am composed of material 3,000 times denser than anything you have ever come across; a ton of my material would be a little nugget that you could put in a matchbox." What reply can one make to such a message? The reply which most of us made in 1914 was—"Shut up. Don't talk nonsense."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Eddington pointed out in 1924, densities of this order implied that, according to the theory of [[general relativity]], the light from Sirius B should be [[gravitational redshift|gravitationally redshifted]].&lt;ref name="eddington"&gt;{{cite journal

Such densities are possible because white dwarf material is not composed of [[atom]]s joined by [[chemical bond]]s, but rather consists of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of unbound [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[electron]]s.

New research indicates that many white dwarfs—at least in certain types of galaxies—may not approach that limit by way of accretion. It has been postulated that at least some of the white dwarfs that become supernovae attain the necessary mass by colliding with one another. It may be that in [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] such collisions are the major source of supernovae. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the [[X-ray]]s produced by those galaxies are 30 to 50 times less than what is expected to be produced by type Ia supernovas of that galaxy as matter accretes on the white dwarf from its encircling companion. It has been concluded that no more than 5 percent of the supernovae in such galaxies could be created by the process of accretion onto white dwarfs. The significance of this finding is that there could be two types of supernovae, which could mean that the Chandrasekhar limit might not always apply in determining when a white dwarf goes supernova, given that two colliding white dwarfs could have a range of masses. This in turn would confuse efforts to use exploding white dwarfs as [[standard candle]]s in determining distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Mass–radius relationship and mass limit ===
The relationship between the mass and radius of white dwarfs can be derived using an energy minimization argument. The energy of the white dwarf can be approximated by taking it to be the sum of its gravitational [[potential energy]] and [[kinetic energy]]. The gravitational potential energy of a unit mass piece of white dwarf, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}}, will be on the order of {{math|−''G'' ''M'' ∕ ''R''}}, where {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]], ''M'' is the mass of the white dwarf, and {{mvar|R}} is its radius.

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;E_g \approx \frac{-G  M}{R} .&lt;/math&gt;}}

The kinetic energy of the unit mass, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, will primarily come from the motion of electrons, so it will be approximately {{math|''N'' ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∕ 2''m''}}, where {{mvar|p}} is the average electron momentum, {{mvar|m}} is the electron mass, and {{mvar|N}} is the number of electrons per unit mass. Since the electrons are [[degenerate matter|degenerate]], we can estimate {{mvar|p}} to be on the order of the uncertainty in momentum, {{math|Δ''p''}}, given by the [[uncertainty principle]], which says that {{math|Δ''p'' Δ''x''}} is on the order of the [[reduced Planck constant]], &lt;!-- something broken with {{math}} at this character, skipping it --&gt;''ħ''. {{math|Δ''x''}} will be on the order of the average distance between electrons, which will be approximately {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;−1/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, i.e., the reciprocal of the cube root of the number density, {{mvar|n}}, of electrons per unit volume. Since there are {{math|''N'' ''·'' ''M''}} electrons in the white dwarf, where {{math|''M''}} is the star's mass and its volume is on the order of {{math|''R''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{mvar|n}} will be on the order of {{math|''N'' ''M'' ∕ ''R''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="scibits"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Estimating Stellar Parameters from Energy Equipartition
 |url=http://www.sciencebits.com/StellarEquipartition
 |publisher=[[ScienceBits]]
 |accessdate=9 May 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solving for the kinetic energy per unit mass, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, we find that

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;E_k \approx \frac{N (\Delta p)^2}{2m} \approx \frac{N \hbar^2 n^{2/3}}{2m} \approx \frac{M^{2/3} N^{5/3} \hbar^2}{2m R^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The white dwarf will be at equilibrium when its total energy, {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; + ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, is minimized. At this point, the kinetic and gravitational potential energies should be comparable, so we may derive a rough mass-radius relationship by equating their magnitudes:

{{block indent|1=&lt;math&gt;|E_g|\approx\frac{GM}{R} = E_k\approx\frac{M^{2/3} N^{5/3} \hbar^2}{2m R^2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Solving this for the radius, {{mvar|R}}, gives&lt;ref name="scibits" /&gt;

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt; R \approx \frac{N^{5/3} \hbar^2}{2m GM^{1/3}}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

Dropping {{mvar|N}}, which depends only on the composition of the white dwarf, and the universal constants leaves us with a relationship between mass and radius:

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;R \sim M^{-1/3}&lt;/math&gt;}}

i.e., the radius of a white dwarf is inversely proportional to the cube root of its mass.

Since this analysis uses the non-relativistic formula {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∕ 2''m''}} for the kinetic energy, it is non-relativistic. If we wish to analyze the situation where the electron velocity in a white dwarf is close to the [[speed of light]], {{mvar|c}}, we should replace {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∕ 2''m''}} by the extreme relativistic approximation {{math|''p'' ''c''}} for the kinetic energy. With this substitution, we find

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;E_{k\ {\rm relativistic}} \approx \frac{M^{1/3} N^{4/3} \hbar c}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

If we equate this to the magnitude of {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}}, we find that {{mvar|R}} drops out and the mass, {{mvar|M}}, is forced to be&lt;ref name="scibits" /&gt;

{{block indent|&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm limit} \approx N^2 \left(\frac{\hbar c}{G}\right)^{3/2}.&lt;/math&gt;}}

[[File:ChandrasekharLimitGraph.svg|thumb|350px|right|Radius–mass relations for a model white dwarf. {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}} is denoted as M&lt;sub&gt;Ch&lt;/sub&gt;]]
To interpret this result, observe that as we add mass to a white dwarf, its radius will decrease, so, by the uncertainty principle, the momentum, and hence the velocity, of its electrons will increase. As this velocity approaches {{mvar|c}}, the extreme relativistic analysis becomes more exact, meaning that the mass&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|M}} of the white dwarf must approach a limiting mass of {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Therefore, no white dwarf can be heavier than the limiting mass {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;limit&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or 1.4 {{solar mass}}.

For a more accurate computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the [[equation of state]] which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius from the center of the star, the system of equations consisting of the [[hydrostatic equation]] together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass.&lt;ref name="chandra2" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, eq. (80)&lt;/sup&gt; Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the ''[[Chandrasekhar limit]]''—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold [[Fermi gas]] in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.&lt;ref name="chandra2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stds"&gt;{{cite web

These computations all assume that the white dwarf is non-rotating. If the white dwarf is rotating, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified to take into account the [[centrifugal pseudo-force]] arising from working in a [[rotating frame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Radiation and cooling ===
The degenerate matter that makes up the bulk of a white dwarf has a very low [[opacity (optics)|opacity]], because any absorption of a photon requires that an electron must transition to a higher empty state, which may not be possible as the energy of the photon may not be a match for the possible quantum states available to that electron, hence radiative heat transfer within a white dwarf is low; it does, however, have a high [[thermal conductivity]]. As a result, the interior of the white dwarf maintains a uniform temperature, approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K. An outer shell of non-degenerate matter cools from approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K. This matter radiates roughly as a [[black body]]. A white dwarf remains visible for a long time, as its tenuous outer atmosphere of normal matter begins to radiate at about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K, upon formation, while its greater interior mass is at 10&lt;sup&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K but cannot radiate through its normal matter shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Low-mass helium white dwarfs (mass {{solar mass|&lt; 0.20}}), often referred to as "extremely low-mass white dwarfs, ELM WDs" are formed in binary systems. As a result of their hydrogen-rich envelopes, residual hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle may keep these white dwarfs hot on a long timescale. In addition, they remain in a bloated proto-white dwarf stage for up to 2 Gyr before they reach the cooling track.&lt;ref&gt;Istrate et al. (2014), "The timescale of low-mass proto-helium white dwarf evolution" [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...571L...3I/fulltext A&amp;A Letter 571, L3]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atmosphere and spectra ===
Although most white dwarfs are thought to be composed of carbon and oxygen, [[spectroscopy]] typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either [[hydrogen]] or [[helium]] dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by [[Evry Schatzman|Schatzman]] in the 1940s, the high [[surface gravity]] is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass.&lt;ref name="wden" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kawaler"&gt;{{cite book

Although thin, these outer layers determine the thermal evolution of the white dwarf. The degenerate [[electron]]s in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature ([[isothermal]]), and it is also hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000&amp;nbsp;K and 16,000&amp;nbsp;K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000&amp;nbsp;K and 20,000,000&amp;nbsp;K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.&lt;ref name="wden" /&gt;

It classifies a spectrum by a symbol which consists of an initial D, a letter describing the primary feature of the spectrum followed by an optional sequence of letters describing secondary features of the spectrum (as shown in the adjacent table), and a temperature index number, computed by dividing 50,400&amp;nbsp;K by the [[effective temperature]]. For example:
* A white dwarf with only [[Spectroscopic notation|He I]] lines in its spectrum and an effective temperature of 15,000&amp;nbsp;K could be given the classification of DB3, or, if warranted by the precision of the temperature measurement, DB3.5.
* A white dwarf with a polarized [[magnetic field]], an effective temperature of 17,000&amp;nbsp;K, and a spectrum dominated by [[Spectroscopic notation|He I]] lines which also had [[hydrogen]] features could be given the classification of DBAP3.

The symbols ? and : may also be used if the correct classification is uncertain.&lt;ref name="villanovar4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sionspectra" /&gt;

=== Stars with low to medium mass ===
If the mass of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 {{solar mass}} like our [[sun]], its core will become sufficiently hot to fuse [[helium]] into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] via the [[triple-alpha process]], but it will never become sufficiently hot to fuse [[carbon]] into [[neon]]. Near the end of the period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the [[asymptotic giant branch]]. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a [[planetary nebula]], until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.&lt;ref name="sj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vd1"&gt;[http://www.vikdhillon.staff.shef.ac.uk/teaching/phy213/phy213_lowmass.html the evolution of low-mass stars], Vik Dhillon, lecture notes, Physics 213, University of Sheffield.

=== Stars with medium to high mass ===
If a star is massive enough, its core will eventually become sufficiently hot to fuse carbon to neon, and then to fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]], will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point the core of the star will [[gravitational collapse|collapse]] and it will explode in a [[core-collapse supernova]] which will leave behind a remnant [[neutron star]], [[black hole]], or possibly a more exotic form of [[compact star]].&lt;ref name="evo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Type Iax supernovae ===
[[Type Ia supernova#Type Iax|Type Iax supernova]], that involve helium accretion by a white dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation of this type of stellar remnant. In this scenario, the [[carbon detonation]] produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric explosion that kicks the star, often known as a ''[[zombie star]]'', to high speeds of a [[hypervelocity star]]. The matter processed in the failed detonation is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as [[iron]] falling to its core where it accumulates.&lt;ref name="ironcore"&gt;{{cite journal

A white dwarf's [[stellar system|stellar]] and [[planetary system]] is inherited from its progenitor star and may interact with the white dwarf in various ways. Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] of the central star of the [[Helix Nebula]] suggest the presence of a dust cloud, which may be caused by cometary collisions. It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X-ray emission from the central star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6357765.stm Comet clash kicks up dusty haze], BBC News, 13 February 2007.

== Habitability ==

It has been proposed that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a [[habitable zone]] at a distance of c. 0.005 to 0.02 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] that would last upwards of 3 billion years&lt;!-- see page 2 of the paper--&gt;. This is so close that any habitable planets would be [[tidally locked]]. The goal is to search for [[transit (astronomy)|transits]] of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong [[eclipse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |bibcode=2011ApJ...731L..31A

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong [[tidal force]]s that could render them uninhabitable by triggering a [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside formation from the [[accretion disk]] surrounding the white dwarf, there are two ways a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase, and then spiralling inward, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Binary stars and novae ==
If a white dwarf is in a [[binary star]] system and is accreting matter from its companion, a variety of phenomena may occur, including [[nova]]e and [[Type Ia supernova]]e.

=== Type Ia supernovae ===

{{Main|Type Ia supernova}}
The mass of an isolated, nonrotating white dwarf cannot exceed the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] of ~1.4 {{solar mass}}. This limit may increase if the white dwarf is rotating rapidly and nonuniformly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |bibcode=2004A&amp;A...419..623Y

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White dwarfs in [[binary (astronomy)|binary]] systems can accrete material from a companion star, increasing both their mass and their density. As their mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, this could theoretically lead to either the explosive ignition of [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] in the white dwarf or its collapse into a [[neutron star]].&lt;ref name="collapse" /&gt;

Accretion provides the currently favored mechanism called the ''single-degenerate model'' for [[Type Ia supernovae]]. In this model, a [[carbon]]–[[oxygen]] white dwarf accretes mass and compresses its core by pulling mass from a companion star.&lt;ref name="sniamodels" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/sup&gt; It is believed that [[compression (physical)|compressional]] heating of the core leads to [[carbon detonation|ignition]] of [[carbon burning process|carbon fusion]] as the mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit.&lt;ref name="sniamodels" /&gt; Because the white dwarf is supported against gravity by quantum degeneracy pressure instead of by thermal pressure, adding heat to the star's interior increases its temperature but not its pressure, so the white dwarf does not expand and cool in response. Rather, the increased temperature accelerates the rate of the fusion reaction, in a   [[thermal runaway|runaway]] process that feeds on itself. The [[thermonuclear]] flame consumes much of the white dwarf in a few seconds, causing a Type Ia supernova explosion that obliterates the star.&lt;ref name="osln" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sniamodels" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another possible mechanism for Type Ia supernovae, the ''double-degenerate model'', two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs in a binary system merge, creating an object with mass greater than the Chandrasekhar limit in which carbon fusion is then ignited.&lt;ref name="sniamodels" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/sup&gt;

Observations have failed to note signs of accretion leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to be because the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Ian. [http://news.discovery.com/space/dont-slow-down-white-dwarf-you-might-explode-110906.html "Don't Slow Down White Dwarf, You Might Explode."] ''Discovery Communications, LLC'' 6 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cataclysmic variables ===
{{Main|Cataclysmic variable star}}
Before accretion of material pushes a white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit, accreted [[hydrogen]]-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by [[Nuclear fusion|hydrogen fusion]]. These surface explosions can be repeated as long as the white dwarf's core remains intact. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) [[nova]]. Astronomers have also observed [[dwarf nova]]e, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of [[gravitational potential energy]] when part of the [[accretion disc]] collapses onto the star, rather than through a release of energy due to fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called [[cataclysmic variable]]s. As well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of these variables are known, including [[Polar (cataclysmic variable star)|polars]] and [[intermediate polar]]s, both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs.&lt;ref name="osln" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sniamodels" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa1"&gt;[http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/cataclysmic_variables.html Imagine the Universe!

'''Windows on Earth''' is a museum exhibit, [[website]], and exploration tool, developed by TERC, Inc. (an educational non-profit organization, previously called Technical Education Research Centers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.terc.edu/display/HOME/FAQs#FAQs-Whatdoes%22TERC%22standfor?|title=FAQs - TERC Home|website=www.terc.edu|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[Association of Space Explorers]], that enables the public to explore an interactive, virtual view of Earth from space.&lt;ref name="terc1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winearth.terc.edu/|title=Explore Earth from Space|accessdate=October 12, 2008|publisher=Technical Education Research Centers|date=2008|author=TERC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205060159/http://winearth.terc.edu/|archivedate=December 5, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the tool has been selected by NASA to help astronauts identify targets for photography from the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name="Windows on Earth Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows on Earth Website|url=http://winearth.terc.edu/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205060159/http://winearth.terc.edu/|archivedate=2008-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CASIS Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=CASIS Press Release|url=http://www.iss-casis.org/NewsEvents/PressReleases/tabid/111/ArticleID/25/ArtMID/586/CASIS-Partners-with-TERC--Association-of-Space-Explorers.aspx|access-date=2012-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808231752/http://www.iss-casis.org/NewsEvents/PressReleases/tabid/111/ArticleID/25/ArtMID/586/CASIS-Partners-with-TERC--Association-of-Space-Explorers.aspx|archive-date=2012-08-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program simulates the view of Earth as seen from a window aboard the ISS, in high-resolution, photographically accurate colors and 3D animations. The views include cloud cover, day and night cycles, night time lights, and other features that help make the exhibit realistic and interactive.&lt;ref name="terc5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winearth.terc.edu/how_works/ |title=How Windows on Earth Works |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |publisher=TERC |date=2008 |author=TERC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003013414/http://winearth.terc.edu/how_works/ |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earth Visualization Software ==
[[Image:WinEarth screen Peru coast.png|thumb|Screen capture from Windows on Earth showing the coast of Peru with three marked targets, orbital track, and the 10-minute look-ahead.]]

Windows on Earth provides the user a view of Earth from an astronaut's viewpoint, with interactive photorealistic views of Earth as if seen from an altitude of 360&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="terc5"/&gt; The program uses [http://www.geofusion.com GeoFusion's] digital Earth visualization system, which renders accurate views of Earth with terrain, satellite imagery, clouds, and other layers. The system is programmed for user interaction, allowing users to "fly" anywhere they wish to see, and zoom in or out to see details. The system's imagery is derived from [[Landsat program|Landsat]], and features 3D perspective views. Former astronaut [[Jay Apt]] assisted with the color-correction of the images, to help get the most realistic colors as seen from space.&lt;ref name="terc5"/&gt; The program is updated daily to include accurate cloud cover information.&lt;ref name="terc5"/&gt;

== Development and Outreach Partners ==
Windows on Earth was created by people from the Center for Earth and Space Science Education (CESSE) at TERC, a not-for profit math and science education company located in Cambridge, MA, in partnership with the [[Association of Space Explorers]], [http://www.geofusion.com GeoFusion's], and [http://worldsat.ca/ WorldSat International] and with funding from the [[National Science Foundation]], Informal Science Education.&lt;ref name="terc3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.terc.edu/work/860.html|title=Windows on Earth|accessdate=October 12, 2008|publisher=TERC|date=2008|author=TERC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917172107/http://www.terc.edu/work/860.html|archive-date=2008-09-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional partners include the [[Challenger Learning Center]] and [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B.

== Garriott Mission ==
Windows on Earth flew on board the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). On October 12, 2008, [[Richard Garriott]] launched aboard [[Soyuz TMA-13]] to the ISS as a [[Spaceflight participant]].&lt;ref name="Chron"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6052360.html|title=$30 million buys Austin resident a ride on Soyuz mission|accessdate=October 12, 2008|publisher=[[The Houston Chronicle]]|date=2008|author=Mark Carreau}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garriottinspace"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.space.com/news/070928_garriott_spacetourist.html | title = Former Astronaut's Son Signs on as Next Space Tourist|author=Tariq Malik|publisher= SPACE.com | accessdate = 2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garriott remained on board the station for 10 days, conducting educational and scientific programs and experiments. Earth observation was one of his prime tasks on this mission, and he used the Windows on Earth system to help him take pictures of specific targets.&lt;ref name="wbz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multimedia.wbz.com/m/audio/21089728/visit-outer-space-without-leaving-earth.htm?q=Windows+on+Earth|title=Visit outer space without leaving Earth|accessdate=October 3, 2008|publisher=WBZ Radio|date=2008|author=WBZ Radio}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terc2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://winearth.terc.edu/garriott_mission/ |title=Richard Garriott’s Mission in October, 2008 |accessdate=October 12, 2008 |publisher=TERC |date=2008 |author=TERC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003021017/http://winearth.terc.edu/garriott_mission/ |archivedate=October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the mission, Richard's photographs, along with ones taken by his astronaut father [[Owen Garriott]], who flew on [[Skylab 3]] (1973) and [[STS-9]] (1983), were made available to the public through Windows on Earth. This provides a unique opportunity for comparing areas of Earth photographed by two generations of space explorers, showing how Earth's surface (and the technology of Earth observation) has changed over 35 years, from 1973 to 2008.&lt;ref name="terc2"/&gt;

== Tool for the ISS ==
In May 2012, [[NASA]] selected Windows on Earth as the new tool to help astronauts identify targets for photography from the ISS.&lt;ref name="Windows on Earth Website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CASIS Press Release"/&gt;

'''Winter''' is the [[coldest]] [[season]] of the year in [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]] and [[temperate climate|temperate zones]] (winter does not occur in most of the [[Tropics|tropical zone]]). It occurs after [[autumn]] and before [[spring (season)|spring]] in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that [[Hemispheres of Earth|hemisphere]] being oriented away from the [[Sun]]. Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather.  When it is winter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], it is [[summer]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with [[snow]] and [[freezing]] temperatures. The moment of [[winter solstice]] is when the sun's elevation with respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the sun is at its farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole).  The day on which this occurs has the shortest day and the longest night, with [[daytime|day length]] increasing and [[nighttime|night length]] decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see [[Analemma#Earliest and latest sunrise and sunset|earliest and latest sunrise and sunset]]).

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word "winter" comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root "wend," relating to [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202154139/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=winter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |archivedate=2 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
{{See also|Effect of Sun angle on climate}}
The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, causing different latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky than the summer Sun.

During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit that hemisphere at an oblique angle. In regions experiencing winter, the same amount of [[solar radiation]] is spread out over a larger area. This effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the changes in the distance of the earth from the sun are negligible.

The manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow–prone parallels is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of precipitation. A case in point is [[Canada]], a country normally associated with tough winters. [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Great Plains]] at a relative distance from large bodies of water has a January high of {{convert|-11.3|C|F}} and a low of {{convert|-21.4|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&amp;lang=e&amp;amp;StationName=Winnipeg&amp;amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;amp;stnNameSubmit=go&amp;dCode=1&amp;dispBack=1|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1981-2010 Station Data for Winnipeg|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905075212/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=3698&amp;lang=e&amp;StationName=Winnipeg&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&amp;dCode=1&amp;dispBack=1|archivedate=5 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[Vancouver]] on the coast with a marine influence from moderating Pacific winds has a January low of {{convert|1.4|C|F}} with days well above freezing at {{convert|6.9|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&amp;lang=e&amp;StationName=Vancouver&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&amp;dCode=1|title=Canadian climate normals 1981-2010 Station Data for Vancouver|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518084829/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?stnID=889&amp;lang=e&amp;StationName=Vancouver&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;stnNameSubmit=go&amp;dCode=1|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both areas are on the [[49th parallel north]] and in the same western half of the continent. A similar effect, although with less extreme differentials, is found in Europe where in spite of the northerly latitude of the islands, the British Isles has not a single non-mountain weather station with a below-freezing mean temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate|title=UK climate - Station Map|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=8 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072823/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/climate/|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meteorological reckoning''' is the method of measuring the winter season used by [[meteorologists]] based on "sensible weather patterns" for record keeping purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Huttner |first=Paul |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/updraft/archive/2007/12/instant_meteorological_winter.shtml |title=Instant meteorological winter |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=6 December 2007 |accessdate=22 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608125101/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/updraft/archive/2007/12/instant_meteorological_winter.shtml |archivedate=8 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the start of meteorological winter varies with latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2003/s2143.htm |title=Winter's Been Here Despite What the Calendar Says |publisher=NOAA Magazine |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate=22 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716220559/http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2003/s2143.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter is often defined by meteorologists to be the three calendar months with the lowest average temperatures. This corresponds to the months of December, January and February in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and June, July and August in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The coldest average temperatures of the season are typically experienced in January or February in the Northern Hemisphere and in June, July or August in the Southern Hemisphere. Nighttime predominates in the winter season, and in some regions winter has the highest rate of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] as well as prolonged dampness because of permanent snow cover or high precipitation rates coupled with low temperatures, precluding evaporation. [[Blizzard]]s often develop and cause many transportation delays. [[Diamond dust]], also known as ice needles or ice crystals, forms at temperatures approaching {{convert|-40|C|F}} due to air with slightly higher moisture from aloft mixing with colder, surface based air.&lt;ref name="glossdia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|title=Diamond Dust|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=21 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403084329/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=3 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are made of simple ice crystals that are hexagonal in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]|url=http://eands.caltech.edu/articles/Libbrecht%20Feature.pdf|page=12|year=2001|author=Kenneth G.

As a result, the coldest January on record in 1987 was also the sunniest in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|title=Precipitation, Sunshine &amp; Radiation for January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|title=Temperature &amp; Wind - January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=SMHI|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accumulations of snow and ice are commonly associated with winter in the Northern Hemisphere, due to the large land masses there. In the Southern Hemisphere, the more maritime climate and the relative lack of land south of 40°S makes the winters milder; thus, snow and ice are less common in inhabited regions of the Southern Hemisphere. In this region, snow occurs every year in elevated regions such as the Andes, the Great Dividing Range in Australia, and the mountains of New Zealand, and also occurs in the southerly [[Patagonia]] region of South Argentina. Snow occurs year-round in [[Antarctica]].

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], some authorities define the period of '''winter''' based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the sun), regardless of weather conditions.

In [[Celtic nations]] such as Ireland (using the [[Irish calendar]]) and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on [[Halloween|All Hallows]], or [[Samhain]]. Winter ends and spring begins on [[Imbolc]], or [[Candlemas]], which is 1 or 2 February. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. (The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere and May, June and July in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].)

Also, many mainland European countries tended to recognize [[Martinmas]] or [[St. Martin's Day]] (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=saint+martin%27s+day+in+europe+start+of+winter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm4L211NvRAhUC2hoKHZPKCgUQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20martin%27s%20day%20in%20europe%20start%20of%20winter&amp;f=false|title=Folk-Taxonomies in Early English|last=Anderson|first=Earl R.|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780838639160|location=Madison, N.J.|pages=219|quote="On St. Martin's day (11 November) winter begins, summer takes its end, harvest is completed. ...This text is one of many that preserves vestiges of the ancient Indo-European system of two seasons, winter and summer."|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215060611/https://books.google.com/books?id=rYT8MPFl_egC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=saint+martin%27s+day+in+europe+start+of+winter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjm4L211NvRAhUC2hoKHZPKCgUQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20martin%27s%20day%20in%20europe%20start%20of%20winter&amp;f=false|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and [[solstice]] dates. Also, [[Valentine's Day]] (14 February) is recognized by some countries as heralding the first rites of spring, such as flowers blooming.

In [[Chinese astronomy]] and other East Asian [[Chinese calendar|calendars]], winter is taken to commence on or around 7 November, with the ''[[Jieqi|Jiéqì]]'' (known as 立冬 ''lì dōng''—literally, "establishment of winter").

The three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere and lasts through late February or early March. This "thermological winter" is earlier than the solstice delimited definition, but later than the daylight (Celtic) definition. Depending on [[seasonal lag]], this period will vary between climatic regions.

Cultural influences such as [[Christmas creep]] may have led to the winter season being perceived as beginning earlier in recent years, although high latitude countries like Canada are usually well into their real winters before the December solstice.

Since by almost all definitions valid for the Northern Hemisphere, winter spans 31 December and 1 January, the season is split across years, just like summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Each calendar year includes parts of two winters. This causes ambiguity in associating a winter with a particular year, e.g. "Winter 2018". Solutions for this problem include naming both years, e.g. "Winter 18/19", or settling on the year the season starts in or on the year most of its days belong to, which is the later year for most definitions.

==Ecological reckoning and activity==
[[File:Snowshoe hare.jpg|thumb|right|The [[snowshoe hare]], and some other animals, change color in winter.]]
Ecological reckoning of winter differs from calendar-based by avoiding the use of fixed dates.  It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term ''hibernal'' for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and autumnal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Michael Allaby | title = A Dictionary of Zoology | year = 1999 | url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | accessdate = 30 May 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602225322/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-prevernal.html | archivedate = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth.  The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.

To survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioral and morphological adaptations for [[overwintering]]:
*[[Bird migration|Migration]] is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably birds. However, the majority of birds do not migrate—the [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]] and [[European robin]], for example. Some [[butterfly|butterflies]] also migrate seasonally.
*[[Hibernation]] is a state of reduced [[metabolism|metabolic activity]] during the winter. Some animals "sleep" during winter and only come out when the warm weather returns; e.g., [[Gopher (animal)|gopher]]s, frogs, snakes, and bats.
*Some animals store food for the winter and live on it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case for [[squirrel]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[badger]]s, and [[raccoon]]s.
*Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter but changes in ways such as color and musculature. The color of the fur or plumage changes to white (in order to be confused with snow) and thus retains its [[cryptic (zoology)|cryptic]] coloration year-round. Examples are the [[rock ptarmigan]], [[Arctic fox]], [[weasel]], [[hare|white-tailed jackrabbit]], and [[mountain hare]].
*Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier coat during the winter; this improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier coat in winter made it a favorite season for [[Animal trapping|trapper]]s, who sought more profitable skins.
*Snow also affects the ways animals behave; many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. Mice and [[vole]]s typically live under the snow layer.

Some [[annual plant]]s never survive the winter. Other annual plants require winter cold to complete their life cycle; this is known as [[vernalization]]. As for [[perennial plant|perennial]]s, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly [[deciduous|deciduous trees]], usually let their upper part go dormant, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, one exception being the [[prunus mume|flowering plum]], which flowers in time for [[Chinese New Year]]. The process by which plants become acclimated to cold weather is called [[Hardening (botany)|hardening]].

==Exceptionally cold winters==
[[File:Frost Fair of 1683.JPG|right|thumb|River Thames frost fair, 1683]]
*1683–1684, "The Great Frost", when the [[Thames]], hosting the [[River Thames frost fairs]], was frozen all the way up to the London Bridge and remained frozen for about two months.  Ice was about {{convert|27|cm|abbr=on}} thick in London and about {{convert|120|cm|abbr=on}} thick in Somerset. The sea froze up to {{convert|2|mi}} out around the coast of the southern North Sea, causing severe problems for shipping and preventing use of many harbours.
*1739–1740, one of the most severe winters in the UK on record. The Thames remained frozen over for about 8 weeks. The [[Irish Famine (1740–1741)|Irish famine]] of 1740–1741 claimed the lives of at least 300,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Ó Gráda (2009). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LoN2XkjJio4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Famine: a short history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426171452/https://books.google.com/books?id=LoN2XkjJio4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq&amp;hl=en |date=26 April 2016 }}''". Princeton University Press. p.23. {{ISBN|0-691-12237-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1816 was the [[Year Without a Summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere. The unusual coolness of the winter of 1815–1816 and of the following summer was primarily due to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in Indonesia, in April 1815.  There were secondary effects from an unknown eruption or eruptions around 1810, and several smaller eruptions around the world between 1812 and 1814.  The cumulative effects were worldwide, but were especially strong in the Eastern United States, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Europe. Frost formed in May in New England, killing many newly planted crops, and the summer never recovered. Snow fell in New York and Maine in June, and ice formed in lakes and rivers in July and August. In the UK, snow drifts remained on hills until late July, and the Thames froze in September. Agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in food shortages and the worst famine of the 19th century.
*1887–1888, there were record cold temperatures in the Upper Midwest, heavy snowfalls worldwide, and amazing storms, including the [[Schoolhouse Blizzard]] of 1888 (in the Midwest in January), and the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]] (in the Eastern US and Canada in March).
*In Europe, the winters of early 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winter1947.co.uk |title=Winter 1947 in the British Isles |publisher=winter1947.co.uk |accessdate=22 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112022825/http://www.winter1947.co.uk/ |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; February 1956, 1962–1963, 1981–1982 and [[Winter of 2009–2010 in Europe|2009–2010]] were abnormally cold.  The UK winter of 1946–1947 started out relatively normal, but became one of the snowiest UK winters to date, with nearly continuous snowfall from late January until March.
*In South America the winter of 1975 was one of the strongest, with record snow occurring at 25°S in cities of low altitude, with registration of &amp;minus;17&amp;nbsp;°C (1.4&amp;nbsp;°F) in some parts of southern Brazil.
*
*In the eastern United States and Canada, the winter of [[2013–14 North American winter|2013–2014]] and the second half of February 2015 were abnormally cold.  However, the winter of [[2014–15 North American winter|2014–2015]] did have a balmy December and a normal January.

==Other historically significant winters==
*1310–1330, many severe winters and cold, wet summers in Europe – the first clear manifestation of the unpredictable weather of the [[Little Ice Age]] that lasted for several centuries (from about 1300 to 1900). The persistently cold, wet weather caused great hardship, was primarily responsible for the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]], and strongly contributed to the weakened immunity and malnutrition leading up to the [[Black Death]] (1348–1350).
*1600–1602, extremely cold winters in Switzerland and Baltic region after eruption of [[Huaynaputina]] in Peru in 1600.
*1607–1608, in North America, ice persisted on Lake Superior until June. Londoners held their first frost fair on the frozen-over River Thames.
*1622, in Turkey, the [[Golden Horn]] and southern section of Bosphorus froze over.
*1690s, extremely cold, snowy, severe winters. Ice surrounded Iceland for miles in every direction.
*1779–1780, Scotland's coldest winter on record, and ice surrounded Iceland in every direction (like in the 1690s). In the United States, a record five-week cold spell bottomed out at {{convert|-20|F}} at Hartford, Connecticut, and {{convert|-16|F}} in New York City. Hudson River and New York's harbor froze over.
*1783–1786, the Thames partially froze, and snow remained on the ground for months. In February 1784, the ''North Carolina'' was frozen in Chesapeake Bay.
*1794–1795, severe winter, with the coldest January in the UK and lowest temperature ever recorded in London: {{convert|-21|C}} on 25 January. The cold began on Christmas Eve and lasted until late March, with a few temporary warm-ups. The Severn and Thames froze, and frost fairs started up again. The French army tried to invade the Netherlands over its frozen rivers, while the Dutch fleet was stuck in its harbor. The winter had easterlies (from Siberia) as its dominant feature.
*1813–1814, severe cold, last freeze-over of Thames, and last frost fair. (Removal of old London Bridge and changes to river's banks made freeze-overs less likely.)
*1883–1888, colder temperatures worldwide, including an unbroken string of abnormally cold and brutal winters in the Upper Midwest, related to the explosion of [[Krakatoa]] in August 1883.  There was snow recorded in the UK as early as October and as late as July during this time period.
*1976–1977, one of the coldest winters in the US in decades.
*1985, Arctic outbreak in US resulting from shift in polar vortex, with many cold temperature records broken.
*2002–2003 was an unusually cold winter in the Northern and Eastern US.
*2010–2011, persistent bitter cold in the entire eastern half of the US from December onward, with few or no mid-winter warm-ups, and with cool conditions continuing into spring. [[La Niña]] and negative [[Arctic oscillation]] were strong factors. Heavy and persistent precipitation contributed to almost constant snow cover in the Northeastern US which finally receded in early May.
*2011 was one of the coldest on record in [[New Zealand]] with sea level snow falling in [[Wellington]] in July for the first time in 35 years and a much heavier snowstorm for 3 days in a row in August.
*2011–2012, one of the warmest winters. Christmas Day 2011 was the warmest Christmas in Ireland, as observed by the Armagh Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-worst-blizzards-u-s-history.php|title = Top 10 Worst Blizzards U.S. History|date = 1 February 2010|accessdate = 4 December 2014|website = Top 10 Worst Blizzards U.S. History|publisher = Ash Grant|last = Grant|first = Ash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans and winter==
Humans evolved in tropical climates, and met cold weather as they migrated into [[Eurasia]], although earlier populations certainly encountered Southern Hemisphere winters in [[Cradle of Humankind|Southern Africa]]. Micro-evolution in Caucasian, Asiatic and Inuit people show some adaptation to the climate.

===Winter and human health===
Humans are sensitive to cold, see [[hypothermia]]. [[Snowblindness]], [[norovirus]], [[seasonal depression]]; slipping on black ice and falling [[icicle]]s are other health concerns associated with cold and snowy weather. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is not unusual for homeless people to die from hypothermia in the winter.

One of the most common diseases associated with winter is [[influenza]]. Symptoms include: [[headache]], [[fever]], muscle pains, [[sinus (anatomy)|sinus]] infection, fatigue, dizziness, [[cough]], and loss of [[appetite]].

==Mythology==
[[File:Siemiginowski Allegory of Winter.jpg|thumb|right|''Allegory of Winter'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]] with [[Aeolus]]' Kingdom of the Winds, 1683, [[Wilanów Palace]]]]
In [[Persian culture]], the winter solstice is called [[Yaldā]] (meaning: birth) and it has been celebrated for thousands of years. It is referred to as the eve of the birth of [[Mithra]], who symbolised light, goodness and strength on earth.

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Hades]] kidnapped [[Persephone]] to be his wife. [[Zeus]] ordered Hades to return her to [[Demeter]], the goddess of the Earth and her mother. However, Hades tricked Persephone into eating the food of the dead, so Zeus decreed that Persephone would spend six months with Demeter and six months with Hades. During the time her daughter is with Hades, Demeter became depressed and caused winter.

In [[Welsh mythology]], [[Gwyn ap Nudd]] abducted a maiden named [[Creiddylad]]. On May Day, her lover, [[Gwythr ap Greidawl]], fought Gwyn to win her back. The battle between them represented the contest between summer and winter.

'''Women's Air Raid Defense''' (WARD) was a [[World War II]] civilian organization that worked with the military to provide [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defense]] for [[Hawaii]]. It formed in December of 1941 after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Women volunteered in order to allow men to be freed from air defense work to go onto combat roles. WARD was the only [[civilian]] organization employed by the [[military]] for the purpose to replace men in active duty.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18998464/|title=These Women Were WARDs of Oahu's Defense|last=Taylor|first=Lois|date=5 December 1991|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|access-date=2018-04-06|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disbanded after the end of WWII.

Williams.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; She was followed by Catherine Coonley.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Quarters were provided to the WARDs on Fort Shafter and the women moved into them on February 1, 1942.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the war, there were around 500 WARDs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They contracted to work a year at a time and were paid between $140 to $225 a month.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

Other WARDs were established throughout the islands: [[Maui]] on July 30, 1942; [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] on August 10, 1942 and [[Kauai]] on September 14, 1942.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
