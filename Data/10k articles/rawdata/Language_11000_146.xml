The conflict concerned the [[School struggle (Netherlands)|equalisation of payment for religious schools]]. The realisation of this necessitated a constitutional revision, which needed the support of two-thirds of both houses of parliament. Both political parties held about fifty percent of the MPs, however. The issue was forced by [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] leader [[Abraham Kuyper]], who hoped that an alliance of Catholics and Protestants would gain the necessary number of seats, but this strategy failed. The issue was finally resolved in the [[Pacification of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = EH | last = Kossmann | title = The Low Countries 1780–1940 | year = 1978 | pages = 545–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ardeshar Faramji Khabardar''' ({{lang-gu|અરદેશર ફરામજી ખબરદાર}}), also spelled '''Ardeshir Pharamji Khabardar''', was a [[Gujarati language]] poet from India. He wrote under the pen name '''Adal'''. Living in [[Bombay]] and [[Madras]], he wrote in different styles of poetry and published around forty books. He wrote [[sonnet]]s about [[Zoroastrianism]] also.

==Life==
[[File:Ardeshar Khabardar young.jpg|thumb|Khabardar|left|upright=0.7]]
Ardeshar was born in a [[Parsi]] family in [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]] on 6 November 1881. He had primary education in Daman and secondary education from New Bharda Highschool, Bombay. He started a motorcycle accessories business in Madras in 1909. He presided over [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] in 1941. He died in Madras on 30 July 1953.&lt;ref name=gsp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gujaratisahityaparishad.com/prakashan/sarjako/savishesh/Savishesh-Khabardar.html|work=[[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]]|title=Ardeshar Khabardar|accessdate=18 August 2014|language =Gujarati}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trivedī1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeṭhālāla Nārāyaṇa Trivedī|title=Love Poems &amp; Lyrics from Gujarati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnJjAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Gurjar Grantha Ratna Karyalaya|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote under several pen names, chiefly under '''Adal'''.  His other pen names are Motalal, Khojo Bhagat, Kshemanand Bhatt, Narkesarirao, Shabhunath, Shridhar, Sheshadri, Lakha Bhagat, Valkalrai Thatthakhor and Hunnarsinh Mehta. He wrote around forty books in Gujarati and two in English.&lt;ref name=gsp/&gt;&lt;ref name="KhabaradāraMaster1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aradeśara Pharāmajī Khabaradāra|author2=Dharmendra M.

His Gujarati poem, ''Jya Jya Vase Ek Gujarati, Tya Tya Sadakal Gujarat'' (Wherever a Gujarati resides, there forever is Gujarat) depicts Gujarati ethnic pride and is widely popular in Gujarat.&lt;ref name="Williams1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond Brady Williams|title=A New Face of Hinduism: The Swaminarayan Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AHI7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA170|accessdate=18 August 2014|year=1984|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-27473-9|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote in modern Gujarati instead of Parsi Gujarati. His first work was the poetry collection ''Kavyarasika'', which followed the style of [[Dalpatram]], in 1901. ''Vilasika'', published in 1905, followed the style of [[Narsinhrao Divetia]]. ''Prakashika'' (1908) is styled as the works of [[Kalapi]] and [[Kant]]. ''Bharat no Tankar'' (1909) and ''Rashtrika'' (1940) are collections of patriotic songs. He parodied and satirised ''Gujarat no Tapasvi'' and ''Brahmadiksha'' of [[Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi|Nanalal]] as ''Prabhat no Tapasvi'' and ''Kutkutdiksha'' (1920) under the pen name Motalal. ''Sandeshika'' (1925) includes patriotic songs. His ''Kalika'' (1926) is a love song in [[blank verse]] style. ''Bhajanika'' (1928), ''Darshanika'' (1931) and ''Kalyanika'' (1940) are collections of devotional songs. ''Rasachandrika'' (1929, 1941) is a collection of ''rasa'' songs in the style of Nanalal and [[Botadkar]]. ''Shriji Iranshah no Pawado'' depicts the history of [[Zorostrianism]] and ''Gandhi Bapu no Pawado'' praises [[Mahatma Gandhi]]; both are poetry in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] [[powada]] style. ''Gandhi Bapu'' (1948) also has thirty-one songs dedicated to Gandhi. His last collection, ''Kirtanika'', had seventy-five [[bhakti movement|kirtan]] songs. He also published ''Malabari na Kavyaratno'', an interpretation of poems of [[Behramji Malabari]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=gsp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trivedī1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sivasankari1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sivasankari|title=Knit India through literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PVjAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Eastwest Books|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brock1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Brock|title=Mahatma Gandhi as a Linguistic Nationalist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSYcAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=South Asia Publications|isbn=978-0-945921-30-1|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Das1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sisir Kumar Das|title=A history of Indian literature, 1911–1956: struggle for freedom : triumph and tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cehjAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-7901-798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="N.Lal1974"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shastri, P.

His only English-language poetry collection ''The Silken Tassel'' (1918) had fifty-nine poems. He wrote ''New light on the Gathas of holy Zarathushtra'' and ''Zarathushtra: 101 [[sonnet]]s'' depicting the life and teaching of [[Zoroaster]].&lt;ref name=gsp/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reddy2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sheshalatha Reddy|title=Mapping the Nation: An Anthology of Indian Poetry in English, 1870–1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_spgWetf9rIC&amp;pg=PA263|year=2012|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-441-9|pages=263–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NatarajanNelson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nalini Natarajan|author2=Emmanuel Sampath Nelson|title=Handbook of Twentieth-century Literatures of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA384|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-28778-7|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernard Stiegler''' ({{IPA-fr|stiɡlɛʁ|lang}}; born 1 April 1952) is a French philosopher. He is head of the Institut de recherche et d'innovation (IRI), which he founded in 2006 at the [[Centre Georges-Pompidou]]. He is also the founder in 2005 of the political and cultural group, Ars Industrialis, and the founder in 2010 of the philosophy school, ''pharmakon.fr'', held at [[Épineuil-le-Fleuriel]]. His best known work is ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]''.

== Influences and themes ==
Stiegler's work is influenced by, among others, [[Sigmund Freud]], [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], [[Gilbert Simondon]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Paul Valéry]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].

Key themes are technology, time, [[individuation]], [[consumerism]], [[consumer capitalism]], [[technological convergence]], [[digital revolution|digitization]], [[Americanization]], education and the future of politics and human society.

== Incarceration ==
Between 1978 and 1983 Stiegler was incarcerated for armed robbery, first at the [[:Fr:Prison Saint-Michel|Prison Saint-Michel]] in [[Toulouse]], and then at the [[:Fr:Centre de détention de Muret|Centre de détention]] in [[Muret]]. It was during this period that he became interested in philosophy, studying it by correspondence with [[Gérard Granel]] at the [[Université Toulouse II|Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail]]. His transformation in prison is recounted in his book, ''Passer à l'acte'' (2003; the English translation of this work is included in the 2009 volume, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'').

== Career ==
In 1987–88, with Catherine Counot, Stiegler commissioned an exhibition at the Centre Georges-Pompidou, entitled ''Mémoires du futur: bibliothèques et technologies''. Stiegler defended his thesis at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in 1992. He has been a Director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]], and a Professor at the [[Université de Technologie de Compiègne|Université de Technologie]] at [[Compiègne]], as well as a visiting professor at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]. He has held the positions of Director General at the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]] (INA), and Director General at the [[IRCAM|Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique]] (IRCAM).

On 1 January 2006 he commenced as Director of the Department of Cultural Development at the Centre Georges-Pompidou. He is currently Director of the Institut de recherche et d'innovation (IRI), which was created at his initiative in April 2006. The IRI is affiliated with the Department of Cultural Development.

In 2010, Stiegler opened his own philosophy school in the French town of [[Épineuil-le-Fleuriel]].

== Works ==
Stiegler has been prolifically publishing books, articles and interviews since 1994. His works include several ongoing series of books:
*'''La technique et le temps''' (3 vols.). The ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time]]'' series outlines the heart of Stiegler's philosophical project, and in particular his theses that the role of technics has been repressed throughout the history of philosophy, and that technics, as organised inorganic matter, and as essentially a form of memory, is constitutive of human temporality. The series contains extensive readings of the works of [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. It also contains his explication of the "cinematic constitution of consciousness," as well as his thesis that human beings are essentially "adoptive" and "prosthetic" creatures. Stiegler has at times mentioned further volumes of this series, but these have yet to appear. All three extant volumes have been published in English translation by Stanford University Press.
*'''De la misère symbolique''' (2 vols.). This series is concerned in particular with the ways in which cultural, symbolic and informational technologies have become a means of industrialising the formation of desire in the service of production, with destructive consequences for psychic and collective individuation. Stiegler outlines his concepts of "general organology" (a way of thinking the co-individuation of human organs, technical organs, and social organisations) and "genealogy of the sensible" (a way of thinking the historicity of human desire and aesthetics). It contains extensive readings of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]], as well as of the works of [[Alain Resnais]], [[Bertrand Bonello]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Both volumes have been published in English translation.
*'''Mécréance et Discrédit''' (3 vols.). The ''Disbelief and Discredit'' series is concerned with the way in which the industrial organisation of production and then consumption has had destructive consequences for the modes of life of human beings, in particular with the way in which the loss of ''savoir-faire'' and ''savoir-vivre'' (that is, the loss of the knowledge of how to do and how to live), has resulted in what Stiegler calls "generalised proletarianisation." In this series Stiegler makes clear his view that, in the light of the present state of the global technical system, it is not a matter of overcoming capitalism but rather of transforming its industrial basis to prevent the loss of spirit from which it increasingly suffers. In the second volume Stiegler introduces the concept of the "[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] complex," to describe the psychosocial effects of the destruction of authority—that is, the destruction of the [[Id, ego, and super-ego|superego]]—on politics and youth. The series contains extensive readings of Paul Valéry, [[Max Weber]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]], as well as analyses of the crisis of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] and the crime of [[Patricia and Emmanuel Cartier]]. The [[The Decadence of Industrial Democracies|first volume]] was published in English translation by Polity Press in 2011, the second in 2012 and the third in 2014.
*'''Constituer l'Europe''' (2 vols.). In this series Stiegler is concerned with the effects of the destruction of psychic and collective individuation on Europe. He argues for the necessity of inaugurating a new individuation process at the continental level, itself embedded in an individuation process operating at a global level. At stake, he says, is the creation of a new European "motive" which will enable the reinvention of industrial civilisation.

== Ars Industrialis ==
On 18 June 2005 Stiegler founded a political and cultural group, Ars Industrialis, the manifesto of which calls for an "industrial politics of spirit." The manifesto is signed by Stiegler and the other co-founders of the group, George Collins, [[:Fr:Marc Crépon|Marc Crépon]], [[Catherine Perret]] and Caroline Stiegler. An updated manifesto was released in 2010.

== Épineuil-le-Fleuriel ==
On 18 September 2010 Stiegler opened his own philosophy school (called ''pharmakon.fr'') in the small French town of [[Épineuil-le-Fleuriel]], in the department of [[Cher (department)|Cher]]. The school runs a course for ''[[lycée]]'' students in the region, a doctoral program conducted by videoconference, and a summer academy that involves both groups of students as well as interested inhabitants from the surrounding area. The context and themes of the school lie in Stiegler's argument that we are entering a period of post-consumerism and post-globalization. At a philosophical level, the school is engaged in research, critique and analysis in line with Stiegler's pharmacological approach.

== Cinema and television ==
Stiegler features prominently in a number of works of film and television, and has appeared on French television numerous times. Among his most significant appearances are the following:
*''[[The Ister (film)|The Ister]]'' (2004), directed by [[Daniel Ross (philosopher)|Daniel Ross]] and David Barison, a feature documentary about Heidegger in which Stiegler plays an important part.
*''An Organization of Dreams'' (2009), directed by [[Ken McMullen (film director)|Ken McMullen]], an experimental thriller inspired by Stiegler's work, and in which he appears.
*''Le temps de cerveau disponible'' (2010), directed by Jean-Robert Viallet, a documentary about television in which Stiegler is the main participant.
*''Après la gauche'' (2011), directed by Jeremy Forny, a documentary about the problems of the political Left, featuring Stiegler.

== Family ==
Stiegler's daughter Barbara (born 1971) is also a philosopher. She attended the [[École Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences Humaines|École Normale Supérieure de Fontenay-St-Cloud]], and in 2003 obtained her doctorate from the [[University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne]]. Barbara Stiegler is the author of ''Nietzsche et la biologie'' (2001) and ''Nietzsche et la critique de la chair: Dionysos, Ariane, le Christ'' (2005). She is not to be confused with the German sociologist of the same name.

A '''charity label''' is a label resembling a [[postage stamp]], sold by [[Charitable organization|charities]] to raise funds.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, James. ''Philatelic Terms Illustrated'', 4th edition, Stanley Gibbons, London, 2003, p.25. {{ISBN|0-85259-557-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally intended to be used on [[mail]], as a way of advertising the sender's support of the charity's cause.

[[Christmas Seals]] and [[Easter seals (philately)|Easter Seals]] are perhaps the two best-known types, although many kinds have been made.

While designed to look like postage stamps, they only rarely include a [[Denomination (postage stamp)|denomination]], and never the name of a country. They are distinct from [[charity stamp]]s which also include a charge for postage.

Charity labels are one of several kinds of [[cinderella stamp]].

'''Chinese Pidgin English''' (also called '''Chinese Coastal English'''&lt;ref&gt;Ansaldo, Umberto, Stephen Matthews, and Geoff Smith. "China Coast Pidgin: texts and contexts." ''Journal of Pidgin and Creole languages'' 25.1 (2010): 63-94.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Pigeon English''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20100103/00418_010.html 東方日報 亂世達觀：白鴿英語現代篇]&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|t=洋涇浜英語|s=洋泾浜英语|p=Yángjìng bāng yīngyǔ}}) is a [[pidgin]] language lexically based on English, but influenced by a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Stratum (linguistics)|substratum]]. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, there was also Chinese Pidgin English spoken in [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]]-speaking portions of [[China]]. Chinese Pidgin English is heavily influenced by a number of [[varieties of Chinese]] with variants arising among different provinces (for example in [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]).

A separate Chinese Pidgin English has sprung up in more recent decades in places such as [[Nauru]].

== History ==
English first arrived in China in the 1630s, when English traders arrived in South China. Chinese Pidgin English was spoken first in the areas of [[Macao]] and [[Guangzhou]] (City of Canton), later spreading north to Shanghai by the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Yamuna Kachru and Cecil L. Nelson, ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. [[Hong Kong University Press]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; "Yangjing Bang English" in Chinese (洋涇浜, or 洋泾浜) derives from the name of a former creek in [[Shanghai]] near [[the Bund (Shanghai)|the Bund]] where local workers communicated with English-speaking foreigners in pidgin (broken English){{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}; ([[Yangjing Bang]] has since been filled in and is now the eastern part of [[Yan'an Road]], the main east-west artery of central Shanghai).

Historically, it was a modified form of English developed in the 17th century for use as a trade language or [[lingua franca]] between the [[English people|English]] and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. Chinese Pidgin  started in [[Guangzhou]], China, after the English established their first trading port there in 1664. Pidgin English was developed by the English and adapted by the Chinese for business purposes. The term "pidgin" itself is believed by some etymologists to be a corruption of the pronunciation of the English word "business" by the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Online Etymology Dictionary |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=pidgin&amp;searchmode=or }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Pidgin continued in use until about the end of the 19th century, when Pidgin came to be looked upon by the Chinese as humiliating (because English speakers considered it ridiculous) and so preferred to learn [[standard English]] instead.

Chinese Pidgin English began to decline in the late 19th century as standard English began to be taught in the country's education system.&lt;ref name="McArthur"&gt;McArthur, Tom. (2002). ''Oxford Guide to World English''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-866248-3}} hardback, {{ISBN|0-19-860771-7}} paperback.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese Pidgin English spread to regions beyond the Chinese Coast. Many attestations of the language being spoken come from writings of Western travelers in China. Among these are scattered reports of the pidgin being spoken farther inland, such as in [[Chungking]] (Chongqing) and [[Hankow]] (Hankou), and farther north, in [[Kyong Song]] and even [[Vladivostok]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Philip, and Peter Mühlhäusler. "From business to pidgin." ''Journal of Asian Pacific Communication'' 1.1 (1990): 111&lt;/ref&gt; CPE was also taken beyond China: the large numbers of CPE speakers in [[Nauru]] influenced the shaping of [[Nauruan Pidgin English]]&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Ronald I. "California Chinese Pidgin English and its historical connections: Preliminary remarks." ''Journal of Pidgin and Creole languages'' 23.2 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that it was also taken to [[Australia]], where it altered due to the influence of Australian English and other pidgins.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Jeff. "Chinese Pidgin English in Southeastern Australia: The notebook of Jong Ah Siug" ''Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages'', 24.2, (2009):&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also reported to have been spoken in [[Singapore]] and [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Kim (2008) says that there is debate among linguists, including Baker, Mühlhäusler, and himself, about whether or not CPE was taken to California by 19th century immigrants. Many features present in California Chinese Pidgin English overlap with features of CPE, but also overlap with many other pidgins. Furthermore, some diagnostic features of CPE are missing or different from [[California]] Chinese Pidgin English. On the other hand, because many migrants came from the [[Guangdong|Canton province]] in China, where CPE was relatively well-known, it is likely that many migrants to the United States from China had knowledge of the pidgin. At the very least, it is clear that California Chinese Pidgin English should be treated as a distinct variety from CPE as spoken in Coastal China, because it has morphological and syntactic features not found in CPE.&lt;ref&gt;Kim 2008: 329-339.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
===Phonology===
Robert Hall (1944) gives the following phonemic inventory:
*Vowels: [i, ɪ, e, ɛ, œ, ɑ, ə, ɔ, o, U, u]
*Consonants: [p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ŋ, f, v, θ, ð, s, z, š, ž, č, ǧ, l, r, h, j, w]
Native speakers of English use this inventory.  Because most lexical items in CPE are derived from English, native English speakers simply use the pronunciation familiar to them.  For non-native English speakers, who were largely Cantonese speakers, [v, θ, ð, r, š, ž] are not present, because these sounds are not present in Cantonese.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Robert A. "Chinese Pidgin English grammar and texts." ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' (1944): 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall also describes a few morphophonemic alterations.  Many verbs ending in consonants may optionally add a vowel, as in [tek(i)] 'to take' and [slip(a)] 'to sleep'.  Words ending in [r] and [l], and sometimes [d], optionally omit the final consonant, as in [litə(l)] 'little' and [mo(r)] 'more'.  Certain stems also frequently lose their final consonant when before certain suffixes, as in [hwat] 'what?' ([hwasajd] 'where?,' [hwatajm] 'when?,' [hwafœšan] 'how?'), [ðœt] 'that' (ðœsajd 'there'), awt 'out' (awsajd 'outside').&lt;ref&gt;Hall 1944: 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker and Mühlhäusler point out that Hall's data was taken entirely from native speakers of English, several decades after CPE was widely used.  For this reason, they are skeptical of the data presented.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, their own presentation of phonology in CPE is largely the same as Hall's.  They state that [s] and [š] were not phonemically contrastive for Cantonese speakers.  Words ending in [f] in English often had an added [o] as in ''thiefo''.  Aside from these additions, Baker and Mühlhäusler have few revisions to make to the phonological claims Hall made.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 97-98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lexicon===
The majority of the words used in CPE are derived from English, with influences from Portuguese, Cantonese, Malay, and Hindi.

*''catchee'': fetch (English ''catch'')
*''fankuei'': westerner (Cantonese)
*''Joss'': God (Portuguese ''deus'')
*''pidgin'': business (English)
*''sabbee'': to know (Portuguese ''saber'')
*''taipan'': supercargo (Cantonese)
*''two muchee'': extremely (English ''too much'')&lt;ref&gt;Ansaldo et al. 2010: 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology and syntax===
Constructions in Chinese Pidgin English, both at the phrase level and sentence level, vary widely in taking English or Chinese structure. Generally speaking, pidgin languages have isolating morphology and so do not inflect nouns and verbs; CPE is no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Hall Jr, Robert A. "Pidgin English and linguistic change." ''Lingua'' 3 (1952): 137-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Some morphological and syntactic phenomena, which frequently appear in linguistic literature, are listed below.

====Pronouns====
Prior to 1800, pronouns conformed largely to British and American English paradigms. Over time, ''my'' came to be the only first person singular pronoun in CPE, replacing both ''I'' and ''me''. ''He'' was used for subject and non-subject referents alike (Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 104). Plural pronouns were expressed as in English by native English speakers;&lt;ref&gt;Hall 1944: 97&lt;/ref&gt; we have too little data from native Cantonese speakers to determine if they pluralized pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 104&lt;/ref&gt;

====Topic–comment====
In CPE, once a noun has been explicitly stated, it does not need to be stated again in following sentences where that item would normally be found.  This means that in a given sentence, the subject or object may be omitted.  In the example below, "very poor people" is the subject for the following clauses, although they do not explicitly state it.
*"this have very poor place and very poor people: no got cloaths, no got rice, no got hog, no got nothing; only yam, little fish, and cocoa-nut; no got nothing make trade, very little make eat"&lt;ref&gt;Keate, 1788; quoted in Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990: 100&lt;/ref&gt;
The omitted noun may also be loosely related to the predicate, rather than a subject or object.  In the sentence below, meaning 'He won't sell at that price,' the omitted "that pricee" is neither a subject nor an object.
*"(that pricee) he no sellum"&lt;ref&gt;Instructor IV.77; quoted in Ansaldo et al. 2010: 88&lt;/ref&gt;

====Copula====
A word derived from English ''have'' was the usual copula in CPE until 1930. It usually appears as ''hab'' or ''hap''. ''Belong'' is also used.  After 1830 it became most common to omit the copula entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Baker &amp; Mühlhäusler 1990: 103&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Chinese man very great rogue truly, but have fashion, no can help"
'Chinese men are real rogues but that's how it is, can't help it'&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 1748; quoted in Baker &amp; Mühlhäusler 1990: 103&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piece/piecee====
This lexical item seems to have been an influence of Cantonese grammar on CPE. Cantonese uses [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] on nouns described by a number or demonstrative. The word ''piecee'' is used where Cantonese would expect a classifier. ''Chop'' is another classifier, used only in demonstrative constructions.&lt;ref&gt;Ansaldo et al. 2010: 81&lt;/ref&gt; Places where Cantonese does not use a classifier, as with the words for 'year' and 'dollar,' likewise do not have a classifier in CPE.&lt;ref&gt;Baker &amp; Mühlhäusler 1990: 101&lt;/ref&gt;
*"You wantchee catchee one piecee lawyer"
'You will have to engage a lawyer'&lt;ref&gt;Instructor IV.32; quoted in Ansaldo et al. 2010: 81&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Thisee chop tea what name"
'What is the name of this tea?'&lt;ref&gt;Instructor VI. 15; quoted in Ansaldo et al. 2010: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on English==
{{cleanup|section|date=May 2010}}
Certain expressions from Chinese English Pidgin have made their way into [[colloquial]] English, a process called [[calque]]. The following is a list of English expressions which may have been influenced by Chinese.
* '''[[long time no see]]''' is similar to the Mandarin phrase
:({{ruby-zh-p|很|very}} {{ruby-zh-p|久|long time}} {{ruby-zh-p|不|not}} {{ruby-zh-p|見|see}} ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]]), {{ruby-zh-p|好|very}} {{ruby-zh-p|耐|long time}} {{ruby-zh-p|冇|not}} {{ruby-zh-p|見|see}} ([[Cantonese]]), {{ruby-zh-p|很|very}} {{ruby-zh-p|久|long time}} {{ruby-zh-p|不|not}} {{ruby-zh-p|见|see}} ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]]), meaning "haven't seen [you] in a long time", further meaning "we have not seen each other in a long time"). The Oxford English Dictionary states that "long time no see" originated in the United States as "a jocular imitation of broken English." .&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, ''long time no see''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''look-see'''
:({{ruby-zh-p|看|look}} {{ruby-zh-p|見|see}}) This phrase is attributed to Chinese pidgin English by the Oxford English dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, ''look-see''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''No''' ''this'' '''no''' ''that''
:No ____, no ____ predates the origin of Chinese Pidgin English,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English dictionary, ''no ___ no ____ and variants''&lt;/ref&gt; but is also a notable example of fabricated pidgin English: ({{ruby-zh-p|沒|no}} {{ruby-zh-p|票|ticket}} {{ruby-zh-p|沒|no}} {{ruby-zh-p|襯衣|shirt}}) meaning [http://www.uiweb.uidaho.edu/special-collections/papers/notickee.htm "If you don't have a laundry receipt, I won't give you your shirts"], said to be a [https://archive.is/20091126062200/http://chineselaundry.wordpress.com/2006/02/14/the-racism-of-no-tickee-no-washee/ fabricated pidgin English] inaccurately attributed to the [https://archive.is/20130201031153/http://www.redroom.com/publishedwork/chinese-laundries-tickets-survival-gold-mountain Chinese laundry] proprietors. In 1886, a [http://www.americandialect.org/americandialectarchives/oct96384.html New York City bill] cited this phrase in reference to Chinese-owned dry cleaning establishments. In 1921 a movie titled ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403355/ "No Tickee No Shirtee"]'' further popularized the saying. Another famous use of this phrase is "No money, no talk" ({{ruby-zh-p|冇|no}}{{ruby-zh-p|錢|money}}{{ruby-zh-p|冇|no}}{{ruby-zh-p|得|chance}}{{ruby-zh-p|傾|talk}} ([[Cantonese]])), which simply means "If you don't have the [[money]], don't try to bargain with me".

* ''No go'', from which is derived ''[[No-go area]]'' and later ''[[No fly zone]]'', clearly follows the grammatical logic of Chinese Pidgin English, though not necessarily based on a specific Chinese expression.

&lt;!-- 
* '''No can do'''
:''The reference of "no can do" in ''[[Long_time_no_see#Origin]]'' (at the end), directs to the whole of this article (Chinese Pidgin English) as though it was properly directing to a proper article, as it does for "[[chop chop (phrase)|chop chop]]". '' --&gt;

The relative timing of this kind of movements is also called '''alternate motion rates''' ('''AMR''') or '''sequential motor rates''' ('''SMR''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juste|first=FS|author2=Rondon, S |author3=Sassi, FC |author4=Ritto, AP |author5=Colalto, CA |author6= Andrade, CR |title=Acoustic analyses of diadochokinesis in fluent and stuttering children|journal=Clinics|date=15 May 2012|volume=67|issue=5|pages=409–414|doi=10.6061/clinics/2012(05)01|pmid=22666781 |pmc=3351255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Alternating movements'': Patient is told e.g. to pronate and supinate his hands in rapid succession, holding forearms vertically. In cerebellar diseases, the movements are irregular and inaccurate; in case of the [[Upper motor neuron lesion|pyramidal tract lesion]] the motion may be slowed or incomplete. 
* ''[[Holmes Rebound phenomenon|Stewart-Holmes rebound sign]]'': Patient tries to flex the elbow against applied resistance. When physician's grip is suddenly released, the patient should be able to deter it from rebounding. With cerebellar disease, the forearm may sway in several cycles. The patient may even strike himself if not guarded.

The '''Early Cyrillic alphabet''' is a writing system that was developed during the late ninth century on the basis of the [[Greek alphabet]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dhm0cGdrTOIC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=cyrillic+alphabet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G7ezT7mVAsbCswapmKmUBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cyrillic%20alphabet&amp;f=false Mauricio Borrero, "Russia", p. 123]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ANb4P5PXDUUC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=cyrillic+alphabet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G7ezT7mVAsbCswapmKmUBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cyrillic%20alphabet&amp;f=false World Cultures Through Art Activities, Dindy Robinson, p. 115]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QMPvbU8ccqEC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=cyrillic+script&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BrizT-aFEM3ysgao0fWTBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cyrillic%20script&amp;f=false Handbook of Scripts and Alphabets, George L.

Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 16 May. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;. The objective was to make it possible for them to have Christian service in their mother tongues, instead of in Greek, which they did not understand, and to bring them closer to the cultural influence of Christianity, the official religion of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

It was developed in the [[Preslav Literary School]] in the capital city of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in order to write the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p7n2umogAhgC&amp;pg=PA100 ''The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire, Oxford History of the Christian Church''], J. M. Hussey, Andrew Louth, Oxford University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|0191614882}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;pg=PR1 ''Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250''], Cambridge Medieval Textbooks, Florin Curta, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0521815398}}, pp. 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Cyrillic script]] is still used primarily for some [[Slavic languages]] and for East European and Asian languages that were under Russian cultural influence during the 20th century. 

Among some of the traditionally culturally influential countries using it are Bulgaria, Serbia, Russia, Ukraine.

== History ==
[[File:Birch bark alphabet of Novgorod.jpg|thumb|The Cyrillic alphabet on [[Birch bark manuscript|birch bark document]] № 591 from ancient [[Novgorod]] ([[Russia]]). Dated to 1025-1050 AD.]]
[[File:Bb199.gif|thumb|A more complete early Cyrillic [[abecedary]] (on the top half of the left side), this one written by the boy [[Onfim]] between 1240 and 1260 AD (birch bark document № 199).]]
The earliest form of manuscript Cyrillic, known as ''ustav,'' was based on Greek [[uncial]] script, augmented by [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] and by letters from the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for consonants not found in Greek.&lt;ref name=Lunt&gt;Lunt, Horace G. ''Old Church Slavonic Grammar, Seventh Edition'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glagolitic alphabet was created by the monk [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]], possibly with the aid of his brother [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], around 863.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; It was an adaptation designed to link the language of their mother, who was of Slavic origin (славянка),{{cn|date=November 2018}} and their father, who was the Greek military commander of [[Thessaloniki]], the second most important city of the [[Byzantine Empire]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Cyrillic, on the other hand, may have been a creation of Cyril's students (most notable of whom was [[Clement of Ohrid]]) in the 890s at the [[Preslav Literary School]] under Bulgarian Tsar [[Simeon the Great]] as a more suitable script for church books, though retaining the original Bulgarian symbols in Glagolitic.&lt;ref name="Cub" /&gt; An alternative hypothesis proposes that it emerged in the border regions of Greek proselytization to the Slavs before it was codified and adapted by some systematizer among the Slavs; the oldest Cyrillic manuscripts look very similar to 9th and 10th century Greek uncial manuscripts,&lt;ref name="Lunt" /&gt; and the majority of uncial Cyrillic letters were identical to their Greek uncial counterparts.&lt;ref name="Auty"&gt;Auty, R. ''Handbook of Old Church Slavonic, Part II: Texts and Glossary.'' 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; One possibility is that this systematization of Cyrillic was undertaken at the [[Council of Preslav]] in 893, when the Old Church Slavonic liturgy was adopted by the Bulgarian Empire.&lt;ref name="Auty" /&gt;

The Cyrillic alphabet was very well suited for the writing of Old Church Slavic, generally following a principle of "one letter for one significant sound", with some arbitrary or phonotactically-based exceptions.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; Particularly, this principle is violated by certain vowel letters, which represent {{IPA|[j]}} plus the vowel if they are not preceded by a consonant.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; It is also violated by a significant failure to distinguish between /ji/ and /jĭ/ orthographically.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; There was no distinction of capital and lowercase letters, though manuscript letters were rendered larger for emphasis, or in various decorative initial and nameplate forms.&lt;ref name=Cub&gt;Cubberley 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Letters served as [[Cyrillic numerals|numerals]] as well as phonetic signs; the values of the numerals were directly borrowed from [[Greek numerals|their Greek-letter analogues]].&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; Letters without Greek equivalents mostly had no numeral values, whereas one letter, [[Koppa (Cyrillic)|koppa]], had only a numeric value with no phonetic value.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt;

Since its creation, the Cyrillic script has adapted to changes in spoken language and developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages. It has been the subject of academic reforms and political decrees. Variations of the Cyrillic script are used to write languages throughout [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Asia]].

The form of the Russian alphabet underwent a change when Tsar [[Peter the Great]] introduced the [[Reforms of Russian orthography|Civil Script]] ({{lang-ru|гражданский шрифтъ|graždanskiy šrift}}, or {{lang|ru|гражданка}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|graždanka}}), in contrast to the prevailing Church Typeface, ({{lang-ru|церковнославя́нский шрифтъ| cerkovnoslavjanskiy šrift}}) in 1708.  Some letters and breathing marks which were only used for historical reasons were dropped. Medieval letterforms used in typesetting were harmonized with Latin typesetting practices, exchanging medieval forms for Baroque ones, and skipping the western European Renaissance developments.  The reform subsequently influenced [[Cyrillic]] orthographies for most other languages.  Today, the early orthography and typesetting standards only remain in use in [[Church Slavonic]].

A comprehensive repertoire of early Cyrillic characters is included in the [[Unicode]] since version 5.1 standard, which published on April 4, 2008.  These characters and their distinctive letterforms are represented in specialized computer fonts for [[Slavistics]].

{{South Slavic languages sidebar}}

In addition to the basic letters, there were a number of scribal variations, combining ligatures, and regionalisms used, all of which varied over time.

== Numerals, diacritics and punctuation ==

Each letter had [[Cyrillic numerals|a numeric value]] also, inherited from the corresponding [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter. A [[titlo]] over a sequence of letters indicated their use as a number; usually this was accompanied by a dot on either side of the letter.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; In numerals, the [[place value|ones place]] was to the left of the tens place, the reverse of the order used in modern Arabic numerals.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; Thousands are formed using a special symbol, {{Script|Cyrs|҂}} (U+0482), which was attached to the lower left corner of the numeral.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; Many fonts display this symbol incorrectly as being in line with the letters instead of subscripted below and to the left of them.

Titlos were also used to form abbreviations, especially of [[nomina sacra]]; this was done by writing the first and last letter of the abbreviated word along with the word's grammatical endings, then placing a titlo above it.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; Later manuscripts made increasing use of a different style of abbreviation, in which some of the left-out letters were superscripted above the abbreviation and covered with a [[pokrytie]] diacritic.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt;

Several [[diacritic]]s, adopted from [[Polytonic orthography|Polytonic Greek orthography]], were also used, but were seemingly redundant&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt; (these may not appear correctly in all web browsers; they are supposed to be directly above the letter, not off to its upper right):

: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а&amp;#x0308;}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''[[Umlaut (diacritic)|trema]]'', diaeresis (U+0308)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а̀}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''varia'' ([[grave accent]]), indicating stress on the last syllable (U+0300)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а́}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''oksia'' ([[acute accent]]), indicating a stressed syllable ([[Unicode]] U+0301)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а҃}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''[[titlo]]'', indicating [[abbreviation]]s, or letters used as [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s (U+0483)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а҄}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''[[kamora (diacritic)|kamora]]'' ([[circumflex accent]]), indicating [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} (U+0484); in later Church Slavonic, it disambiguates plurals from homophonous singulars.
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а҅}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''dasia'' or ''[[dasy pneuma]]'', rough breathing mark (U+0485)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а҆}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''psili'', ''zvatel'tse'', or ''[[psilon pneuma]]'', soft breathing mark (U+0486). Signals a word-initial vowel, at least in later Church Slavonic.
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а҆̀}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; Combined ''zvatel'tse'' and ''varia'' is called ''apostrof''.
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|а҆́}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; Combined ''zvatel'tse'' and ''oksia'' is called ''iso''.

Punctuation systems in early Cyrillic manuscripts were primitive: there was no space between words and no upper and lower case, and punctuation marks were used inconsistently in all manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt;

: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|·}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''[[ano teleia]]'' (U+0387), a middle dot used to separate phrases, words, or parts of words&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt;
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|.}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Full stop]], used in the same way&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt;
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|։}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]] [[full stop]] (U+0589), resembling a [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], used in the same way&lt;ref name=Lunt/&gt;
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|჻}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]] paragraph separator (U+10FB), used to mark off larger divisions
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|⁖}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; triangular colon (U+2056, added in Unicode 4.1), used to mark off larger divisions
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|⁘}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; diamond colon (U+2058, added in Unicode 4.1), used to mark off larger divisions
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|⁙}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; quintuple colon (U+2059, added in Unicode 4.1), used to mark off larger divisions
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|;}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[question mark]] (U+037E), similar to a [[semicolon]]

Some of these marks are also used in [[Glagolitic]] script.

Used only in modern texts

: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|,}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[comma]] (U+002C)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|.}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[full stop]] (U+002E)
: &lt;big&gt;{{Script|Cyrs|!}}&lt;/big&gt;&amp;nbsp; [[exclamation mark]] (U+0021)

'''Encoding''', in '''[[semiotics]]''', is the [[wikt:process|process]] of creating a [[message]] for transmission by an addresser to an addressee. The complementary process{{spaced ndash}}interpreting a message received from an addresser{{spaced ndash}}is called [[Decoding (semiotics)|decoding]].

==Discussion==
The process of message exchanges, or [[semiosis]], is a key characteristic of human life depending on rule-governed and learned [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] that, for the most part, [[Unconscious_mind|unconsciously]] guide the communication of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] between [[individual]]s. These interpretive frameworks or linking grids were termed "myths" by [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980) and pervade all aspects of [[culture]] from personal conversation to the mass media's output (for code exchange through the mass media, see [[Americanism (semiotics)|Americanism]]).

Early theorists like [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913) proposed the theory that when the addresser wishes to transmit a message to an addressee, the intended meaning must be converted into content so that it can be delivered. [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) offered a [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory that the transmission and response would not sustain an efficient [[discourse]] unless the parties used the same codes in the appropriate social contexts. But, Barthes shifted the emphasis from the ''semiotics of language'' to the exploration of ''semiotics as language''. Now, as Daniel Chandler states, there is no such thing as an uncoded message: all experience is coded. So when the addresser is planning the particular message, both [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] and [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings will already be attached to the range of signifiers relevant to the message. Within the broad framework of [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] codes, the addresser will select signifiers that, in the particular context, will best represent his or her [[value (Semiotics)|values]] and purposes. But the medium of communication is not necessarily neutral and the ability of the addressee to accurately decode the message may be affected by a number of factors. So the addresser must attempt to compensate for the known problems when constructing the final version of the message and hope that the preferred meanings will be identified when the message is received. One of the techniques is to structure the message so that certain aspects are given [[salience (semiotics)|salience]] (sometimes called ''foregrounding'') and predispose the [[audience]] to interpret the whole in the light of the particular. This relates to [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Max Wertheimer]] (1880–1943) examined the factors that determine grouping in cognitive processes:
#the fact of grouping signs together predisposes an uncritical audience to perceive the signs as similar;
#the audience prefers ''closure'', i.e. it prefers the experience to be as complete as possible and to see things as a whole even though no actual continuity or conclusion is implied; and 
#the audience prefers an everyman's version of [[Occam's Razor]], i.e. the simplest explanations and solutions. In real life that means that assumptions, inferences and prejudices can often fill in gaps. If a conclusion seems to fit the available facts, other possibilities are not considered or are disregarded, producing the suggestion that humans conserve cognitive energy whenever they can and avoid thinking.
If an addresser is writing a speech, [[rhetoric]]al [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] may be used to emphasise the elements that the audience is to focus upon and potentially perceive as predicating a particular conclusion. If images are to be selected, [[metonymy]] may indicate common associational values with the preferred meaning of the text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7898">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], a '''history monoid''' is a way of representing the histories of concurrently running computer [[process (computer science)|processes]] as a collection of [[string (computer science)|strings]], each string representing the individual history of a process. The history [[monoid]] provides a set of [[synchronization primitive]]s (such as [[lock (computer science)|locks]], [[mutex]]es or [[thread join]]s) for providing rendezvous points between a set of independently executing processes or [[thread (computing)|threads]].

History monoids occur in the theory of [[concurrent computation]], and provide a low-level mathematical foundation for [[process calculi]], such as CSP the language of [[communicating sequential processes]], or CCS, the [[calculus of communicating systems]]. History monoids were first presented by M.W. Shields.&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Shields "Concurrent Machines", ''Computer Journal'', (1985) '''28''' pp.&amp;nbsp;449–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

History monoids are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[trace monoid]]s (free partially commutative monoids) and to the [[monoid]] of [[dependency graph]]s. As such, they are [[free object]]s and are [[universal property|universal]]. The history monoid is a type of semi-abelian [[categorical product]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of monoids.

==Product monoids and projection==
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;A=(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2,\ldots,\Sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt;

denote an ''n''-tuple of [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabets]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote all possible combinations of finite-length strings from the alphabets:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A)=\Sigma_1^* \times \Sigma_2^* \times \cdots \times \Sigma_n^*&lt;/math&gt;

(In more formal language, &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[free monoid]]s of the &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. The superscript star is the [[Kleene star]].) Composition in the product monoid is component-wise, so that, for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{uv}=(u_1v_1,u_2v_2,\ldots,u_nv_n) \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Define the union alphabet to be

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2 \cup \cdots \cup \Sigma_n. \,&lt;/math&gt;

(The union here is the [[set union]], not the [[disjoint union]].) Given any string &lt;math&gt;w\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, we can pick out just the letters in some &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k^*&lt;/math&gt; using the corresponding [[string projection]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_k:\Sigma^*\to\Sigma_k^*&lt;/math&gt;. A '''distribution''' &lt;math&gt;\pi:\Sigma^*\to P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the mapping that operates on &lt;math&gt;w\in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; with all of the &lt;math&gt;\pi_k&lt;/math&gt;, separating it into components in each free monoid:

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(w)\mapsto (\pi_1(w), \pi_2(w), \ldots , \pi_n(w)). \,&lt;/math&gt;

==Histories==
For every &lt;math&gt;a\in\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the tuple &lt;math&gt;\pi(a)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''elementary history''' of ''a''. It serves as an [[indicator function]] for the inclusion of a letter ''a'' in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt;. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(a)=(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a_k=\begin{cases} 
a \mbox{ if } a\in \Sigma_k \\
\varepsilon \mbox { otherwise }.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[empty string]].  The '''history monoid''' &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the submonoid of the product monoid &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; generated by the elementary histories: &lt;math&gt;H(A) = \{ \pi(a) | a\in\Sigma \}^*&lt;/math&gt; (where the superscript star is the Kleene star applied with a component-wise definition of composition as given above). The elements of  &lt;math&gt;H(A)&lt;/math&gt; are called '''global histories''', and the projections of a global history are called '''individual histories'''.

==Connection to computer science==
The use of the word ''history'' in this context, and the connection to concurrent computing, can be understood as follows. An individual history is a record of the sequence of [[state (computer science)|states]] of a process (or [[thread (computer science)|thread]] or [[Turing machine|machine]]); the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; is the set of states of the process.

A letter that occurs in two or more alphabets serves as a [[synchronization primitive]] between the various individual histories. That is, if such a letter occurs in one individual history, it must also occur in another history, and serves to "tie" or "rendezvous" them together.

Consider, for example, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1=\{a,b,c\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2=\{a,d,e\}&lt;/math&gt;. The union alphabet is of course &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{a,b,c,d,e\}&lt;/math&gt;. The elementary histories are &lt;math&gt;(a,a)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(b,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(c,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,d)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,e)&lt;/math&gt;.  In this example, an individual history of the first process might be &lt;math&gt;bcbcc&lt;/math&gt; while the individual history of the second machine might be &lt;math&gt;ddded&lt;/math&gt;. Both of these individual histories are represented by the global history &lt;math&gt;bcbdddcced&lt;/math&gt;, since the projection of this string onto the individual alphabets yields the individual histories. In the global history, the letter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be considered to commute with the letters &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, in that these can be rearranged without changing the individual histories. Such commutation is simply a statement that the first and second processes are running concurrently, and are unordered with respect to each other; they have not (yet) exchanged any messages or performed any synchronization.

The letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; serves as a synchronization primitive, as its occurrence marks a spot in both the global and individual histories, that cannot be commuted across. Thus, while the letters &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; can be re-ordered past &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, they cannot be reordered past &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the global history &lt;math&gt;bcdabe&lt;/math&gt; and the global history &lt;math&gt;bdcaeb&lt;/math&gt; both have as individual histories &lt;math&gt;bcab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dae&lt;/math&gt;, indicating that the execution of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; may happen before or after &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. However, the letter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is synchronizing, so that &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to happen after &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, even though &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is in a different [[process (computer science)|process]] than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==
The history monoid is isomorphic to the [[trace monoid]], and as such, is a type of semi-abelian [[categorical product]] in the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of monoids.  In particular, the history monoid &lt;math&gt;H(\Sigma_1,\Sigma_2,\ldots,\Sigma_n)&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the trace monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}(D)&lt;/math&gt; with the [[dependency relation]] given by

:&lt;math&gt;D=\left(\Sigma_1\times\Sigma_1\right)\cup
\left(\Sigma_2\times\Sigma_2\right)\cup \cdots \cup
\left(\Sigma_n\times\Sigma_n\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In simple terms, this is just the formal statement of the informal discussion given above: the letters in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_k&lt;/math&gt; can be commutatively re-ordered past the letters in an alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_j&lt;/math&gt;, unless they are letters that occur in both alphabets. Thus, traces are exactly global histories, and vice versa.

'''Hyam''' is a regionally important linguistic cluster of [[Plateau languages]] in [[Nigeria]]. ''Hyam of Nok'' is the [[prestige dialect]] (Blench 2008). Writing the sociolinguistics of Hyam, Blench treats ''Sait,'' and ''Dzar'' as distinct varieties, and notes that ''Yat'' and ''Ankung'' may be viewed as separate languages, however, Hayab (2016) presents a differing opinion arguing that it is Ankung, a language called Iduya, that is not mutually intelligible to Hyam. Meanwhile, Hyam, which is spoken by the [[Ham people]] of Nigeria, popularly known as 'Jaba' in a recent study by Philip Hayab, a native of the area and a linguist who carried out in-depth research into the language, reveals that 'Jaba' has a Hausa etymology and is derogatory and should be discarded (John 2017''').'''

==Distribution==

Native Hyam speakers are found mainly in [[Jaba, Nigeria|Jaba]], [[Kachia]]
and [[Kagarko]] and also in [[Jema'a]] [[Local Government Area]]s of southern [[Kaduna]] state and in [[Keffi]] [[Local Government Area]] of [[Nasarawa]] state of [[Nigeria]].

==Dialects==

James (1998) classified the Hyam dialects according to the following sub-groups he placed under the [[Ham]] or Northern Group of the Proto-Plateau Ethno-Linguistic Cluster:
* Ham Kpop (Jaban Kwoi)
* Ham Ngat Ham (Jaban Katari)
* Ham Shambang (Samban)
* Ham Duhyah [or [[Idun language|Idun]] ] (Jaban Lungu)
* Ham Kworri ([[Chori language|Chori]])
* Ham Det (Faik/Kenyi)
* Ham Netkun/Netwho (Gbaham)
* Ham Nyakpah [or [[Nyankpa language|Nyankpa]] ] (Yeskwa)
* Ham Kong/Rhuini (Kamantan)

According to Hayab (2016:5-11), however, the [[Ham people|Ham]], aside migratory past, a subject requiring keen study, could be said to speak the following:
* Hyam Taa Ham - 'Hyam spread in [[Ham]] area' including [[Nok]], Ghikyaar, Kuscum, Har Dzyee, Shong, etc.
* Kwyeny - same as James's Hyam Kpop (spoken in ''Har Kwain'' or ''Kwoi'')
* Kyoli - the dialect of the Kworri/Kwori (also known as [[Chori language|Chori]])
* Saik
* Shamang - same as Shambang
Hayab (2016:6) added that other varieties may also include:
* Dùya/Idúyà - same as [[Idun language|Idun]]
* Gwora - Gora
* Yat
* [[Zhire language|Zhire]] - Kenyi.

Further more, Hayab (2016:8) classified these dialects into four clusters, A-D, according to their levels of intelligibility.
*Cluster A. '''Hyam Taa''', '''Kwyeny''', and '''Saik''' (all have not less than 90% phonological homogeneity in vocabulary
*Cluster B. '''Kyoli''' and '''Shamang''' (have about 50% intelligibility)
*Cluster C. '''Yat''' and [[Zhire language|Zhire]] (may be coherent with A and B. More studies needed)
*Cluster D. '''Idúyà''' [or [[Idun language|Idun]] ] and '''Gwora''' (stand in an independent category)

Again note that Hyam is the language spoken by the [[Ham| Ham people]] people.

==Phonology==
The Hyam Literacy Committee identifies the following 41/42 basic symbols in its orthography.

'''a   a̱   b   c  d   dz   e   e̱   f   g   gb   gh   h   hw   hyw   i   i̱   j   k   kh   kp   l   m   n   ng   ny   o   p   r   s   sh   t   th   thn   ts   u   v   w   y   yw   z   zh'''

==Numbers in Hyam==
Hayab (2016:66) pinpoints, stating that "available data in Hyam by Koelle (1854: appendix, 2-188) and Meek (1931:120) reveals that the Ham contest in virtually a dissimilar way from what is obtained today." He added that it is apparent that the old counting system has been replaced with a Hausa styled one, and again states that "at present, the old style with ten (which was ''kop'') now as ' '''shwak''' '. A case points is kop (ten) shows to be an incomplete number observing the evidence that ' '''mbwan shwak''' ' (11) suggests that we were a number away from ''shwak'' (twelve)." He then added that "this is because the word ' '''mbwan''' ' actually denotes ''bwat'' - short of or 'remaining'.

The above can be said to be true, considering the case of [[Tyap language|Tyap]], a related language, where the present word for ''ten'' is ''swak'', while the word "kop/kwop" is almost extinct, just as in Hyam, and only used for counting in thousands. The word "thousand" in [[Tyap language|Tyap]] is ''cyi kop/kwop'', meaning (considering the old usage of the word ''kop/kwop''), "''a hundred - ten times''" or "''100 X 10''".

These, according to Hayab (2016:66-67) are the numbers used at least 200 years ago for counting in Hyam.

[[Image:Le comté de Nice et Oneille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monaco -with Menton- was the extreme western area of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (green color) in 1664. Intemelio was spoken in this area, primarily between Ventimiglia and Sanremo.]]

'''Intemelio''' is a Ligurian dialect spoken historically from the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] to the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[Imperia]].

==History==

Since before the [[Renaissance]] the [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian language]] was spoken in all the territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] : in the western area of this republic one of its groups (spoken mainly on the coast between Monaco and [[Sanremo]]) was called ''Intemelio'' and was centered on [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intemelion.it/ascheri.pdf The counts of Ventimiglia (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the actual Italian area of [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] there it is the most renowned ''Intemelio'': the "Ventimigliese", that stretches from the coast until [[Piedmont]].

The [[Royasc]] dialect is connected to the "Ventimigliese", as a mountainous version of the ''intemelio'' that has some [[occitan]] influences.

In [[Sanremo]] the local intemelio dialect is heavily influenced by the [[Genoese dialect]].

==Current use==

Intemelio is used by nearly 10,000 people in the area of [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] of the [[province of Imperia]], but other 40,000 are able to understand it and speak a few sentences of this dialect in western [[Liguria]].

A few thousand speak fluently the local variants of Intemelio in [[France]] and [[Monaco]]: [[Monégasque dialect|Monegasque]], [[Mentonasc]] and [[Brigasc]].

==Anecdote==

The Ligurian area of [[Seborga]] speaks the "ventimigliese" dialect ''Intemelio'' and the so-called [[Principality of Seborga]] considered the possibility of using this dialect as the official language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seborga.homeip.net/seborga_menu_UK.html Seborga official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ipili''' is an [[Engan language]] of the East New Guinea Highlands in [[Enga Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]].

There are two dialects, Porgera-Paiela and Tipinini. The latter is similar to [[Enga language|Enga]].
Missionary Terrance Borchard guided translation of the New Testament in the Paiela dialect.  Working with the Ipili tribe they developed an alphabet and written language, previously spoken. He began the work in 1969 until his death in Aug. 2014.
Literacy work resulted.

They may also contain radio and radio beacons. The navigation buoy was to be monitored remotely from onshore and was designed to run for extended periods without repair. The running costs were estimated to be as little as 10% of those of a lightship.&lt;ref name=vads /&gt;

However, experience showed that it was difficult to attain the required reliability in British waters due to the high acceleration forces experienced in rough seas with 14m waves and 7 knot currents. Alternative experiments were made with platforms such as the [[Royal Sovereign Lighthouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowlands|first=David|title=Points of Reference|year=1974|journal=Design Journal|volume=310|pages=48-53|url=http://vads.ac.uk/diad/article.php?title=310&amp;year=1974&amp;article=d.310.39|ref=harv|accessdate=Jul 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automatic technology was later used successfully in more conventional lightships.

'''Kreyol''' ('''Liberian Pidgin English''', Vernacular Liberian English) is an [[English-based pidgin]] spoken in [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="sil"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lir Liberian English]: Ethnologue Report by SIL&lt;/ref&gt; It was spoken by 1,500,000 people as a second language (1984 census) which is about 70% of the population in that time. Today the knowledge of some form of English is even more widespread. It is historically and linguistically related to [[Merico language|Merico]], a creole spoken in Liberia, but is grammatically distinct from it. There are regional dialects such as the '''Kru Pidgin English''' used by the [[Kru people|Kru]] fishermen.&lt;ref name="dillard"/&gt;

Liberian Kreyol language developed from [[Liberian Interior Pidgin English]], the Liberian version of [[West African Pidgin English]] though it has been significantly influenced by [[Liberian Settler English]]. Its phonology owes much to Liberia's [[Niger–Congo languages]]. It has been analyzed having a [[post-creole continuum]].  As such, rather than being a [[pidgin]] wholly distinct from English, it is a range of varieties that extend from the highly pidginized to one that shows many similarities to English as spoken elsewhere in [[West Africa]].

Kreyol originated in Liberia among the Settlers, the free [[English language|English-speaking]] [[African American]]s from the Southern [[United States]] who emigrated to Liberia between 1819 and 1860. It has since borrowed some words from [[French language|French]] and from other West African languages.

Kreyol is spoken mostly as an intertribal [[lingua franca]] in the interior of Liberia.&lt;ref name="dillard"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical features==
Kreyol uses ''no'' for negation, ''bi'' as the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], ''fɔ'' for "to" in verbal infinitives.&lt;ref name="dillard"/&gt;

This page includes those novels which have been widely discussed in Urdu literary magazines, newspapers and have been welcomed by literary critics.

[[Rahman Abbas]] is well known and widely discussed contemporary Urdu novelist. He has written four novels i.e. 'Nakhlistan Ki Talash' (2004), '[[EK Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani]]'(2009) and 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi' (2011) and [[Rohzin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/the-journey-within/article8418331.ece|title=The journey within|last=Kidwai|first=Shafey|date=2016-03-31|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahman Abbas got National Award for his second novel 'EK Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ikokani.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=221:br-rahman-abbas-bags-national-award-for-urdu-literature&amp;catid=909:kokan-news&amp;Itemid=98|title=Br. Rahman Abbas bags National Award for Urdu Literature|last=Administrator|website=www.ikokani.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fiction Award for his third novel 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi'by Maharashtra State Urdu Sahitya Academy for year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tns.thenews.com.pk/forbidden-politics-love/|title=Of forbidden politics and love {{!}} TNS - The News on Sunday|website=tns.thenews.com.pk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These novels have raised issues of cultural identity and existential problems of contemporary Indian Muslims. Rahman Abbas has done experiment of forms in 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi' whereas in two other novels he has dealt seriously with the issues of terrorism and different forms of terrorism in sub-continent context.&lt;ref&gt;citation: name of the book- 'Fiction Par Makalama', Author- Rashid Anwar Rashid, Published by Dept of Urdu Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh 202002. (page no-321)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zauqui's novel ''Le Sans Bhi Ahesta'' was based upon psychological trauma of children who were born soon after the [[Partition of India|partition of India and Pakistan]]. It is a well crafted novel. In last few years Rahman's novel'EK Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani'' and Zauqui's novel 'Le Sans Bhi Ahesta' have been widely debated in literary magazines. Rahman's novel is a love story which also reflects how religious groups damage the composite culture of India in the name of culture of religion. On the other hand Rahma Abbas novel ''Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi'' is a novel about a man suffering from existential crisis who feels that he is held hostage by societal pressure and paradoxes. Noorul Hasian stated in his book ''Naya Afsana Naye Naam'' that both writers i.e. Zauqui and Rahman Abbas have broken conventional boundaries in search of new style and made their work readable.&lt;ref&gt;Naya Afsana Naya Naye Naam- by Noorul Hasnain published by Arishya Publication. {{ISBN|9789381029299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paigham Afaqui]]'s ''[[Paleeta]]'' (2011) was the second novel of the author of the novel ''[[Makaan]]''. The novel has received even more serious attention than Makaan which was published in 1989 and while Makaan is known as a modernist novel, Paleeta is being recognized as a post-modern-post colonial novel of significance.It is story of its central character Khalid 's death due to inhaling the agonies of the century as a poison and his resurrection in the form of an ever-growing book of consciousness published posthumously and making rage among public. The novel demonstrates not only a fresh approach to the historical reality of the century but also a technique of narrative that is unique.

Farooqi's novel ''Kai Chand The Sar-e-Asman had also got attention when it was published in 2006. Later, author translated it into English and Hindi. However, in the contemporary Urdu fiction Farooqi's novel was being considered as a burdened by documentation and stuff borrowed from history.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkiswin Sadi Mein Urdu Novel, author Rahman Abbas, Published by Arshia Publications, year of publication 2014, page no-34/35.{{ISBN|9789381029756}},&lt;/ref&gt;

Noorul Hasnain, Tarannum Riyaz, Abbus Samad, Gazanfar, and Shaista Fakhari have also published their novels during this period. Norul Hasanain's novel 'Aiwano ke khabida Chirag', Shaista Fakhri's novel 'Nadida Baharon Ke Nishan' have also got attention of Urdu fiction readers. Gazanfar's novel ''Manjhi'' and Abdus Samad's novel 'Shikast Ki Awaz' have got reviews in literary magazine.

'''Maceration''' is the [[winemaking]] process where the [[phenolic content in wine|phenolic]] materials of the grape—[[grape tannins|tannins]], coloring agents ([[anthocyanins]]) and flavor compounds—are leached from the grape skins, seeds and stems into the [[must]]. To macerate is to soften by soaking, and maceration is the process by which the red wine receives its red color, since raw grape juice (with the exceptions of [[teinturier]]s) is clear-grayish in color. In the production of white wines, maceration is either avoided or allowed only in very limited manner in the form of a short amount of skin contact with the juice prior to [[pressing (wine)|pressing]]. This is more common in the production of [[varietal]]s with less natural flavor and body structure like [[Sauvignon blanc]] and [[Sémillon]]. For [[Rosé]], red wine grapes are allowed some maceration between the skins and must, but not to the extent of red wine production.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 414-415"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Jancis |editor1-last=Robinson |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |edition=3rd |pages=414–5 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-860990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While maceration is a technique usually associated with wine, it is used with other drinks, such as [[Lambic]], [[piołunówka]], [[Campari]] and [[crème de cassis]], and also used to steep unflavored spirit with herbs for making herb-based alcohol like [[absinthe]].

==Process==
[[File:Red wine cap.jpg|left|thumb|The "cap" of grape skins being "punched down" to maximize maceration.]]
The process of maceration begins, to varying extent, as soon as the grapes' skins are broken and exposed to some degree of [[heat]]. [[Temperature]] is the guiding force, with higher temperatures encouraging more breakdown and extraction of [[phenolic content in wine|phenols]] from the skins and other grape materials. Maceration continues during the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] period, and can last well past the point when the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] has converted all sugars into alcohol. The process itself is a slow one with compounds such as the anthocyanins needing to pass through the [[cell membrane]] of the skins to come into contact with the wine. During fermentation, higher temperatures and higher [[alcohol]] levels can encourage this process with the alcohol acting as a [[solvent]] to assist in the breakdown of the [[organic compounds]] within the grape materials. This process seems to slow once the wine reaches an alcohol level of 10%.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 414-415"/&gt;

Throughout the fermentation process, [[carbon dioxide]] is released as a byproduct of the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The carbon dioxide seeks to escape from the must by rising to the top of the mixture, pushing the grape skins and other materials to the top as well. This forms what is known as a ''cap'' that is visible on top of the fermentation vessel. At this point, a very limited amount of the must comes into contact with the skins, and winemakers seek to correct this by pushing down the cap (either with equipment or the traditional method of treading with their feet) or by pumping wine out from under and over onto the cap. This process of "pumping over" or "punching down" the cap is done often throughout the fermentation process, depending on the extent of maceration the winemaker desires.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 414-415"/&gt;  An efficient and modern method of maceration is the "pneumatage process" in which compressed air or gas is sequentially injected into the juice.  The bubbles created during the pneumatage process uses gravity and the weight of the juice to circulate the wine juice with the cap of skins and grape solids allowing for greater extraction of aroma, coloring agents and tannins to diffuse into the wine juice ("must").

==Benefits==
[[File:Teinturier Agria and peeled Grenache grape.png|right|thumb|An example of the difference between a red fleshed ''teinturier'' grape (''Agria left'') and a red wine grape variety with its skin peeled off to show that its flesh and juice is naturally white (''Grenache right''). The vast majority of red wine grapes are like the Grenache on the right with the red color of wine coming from skin contact during winemaking.]]
Depending on the varietal, the process of maceration can help bring out many flavors in the wine that would otherwise be lacking. It can enhance the [[body (wine)|body]] and [[mouthfeel]] for many wines, as well as strengthen the color. Greater extraction can add to the complexity and life expectancy of the wine by developing more complex tannins that will soften over a longer period of time. With these benefits does come the risk of developing various [[wine fault]]s, such as the development of [[Acetic acid|acetic]] (or "volatile") acidity. Too much extraction can also increase the harshness of some tannins to where the wine is not very approachable to most wine drinkers.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 414-415"/&gt;

==Other processes==
One classical method of maceration is [[grape stomping]] or ''pigeage'', where grapes are crushed in vats by barefoot workers.

The process of '''cold maceration''' or [[cold soak]] is where temperatures of the fermenting must are kept low to encourage extraction by water and added [[sulfur dioxide]] rather than relying principally on heat and alcohol to act as a solvent. This technique was popular in the production of [[Burgundy wine]]s in the 1970s and 1980s but there is still some debate among [[oenologist]]s about the overall benefits to and resulting quality of the wine.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 414-415"/&gt;

[[Carbonic maceration]] is the fermentation of whole clusters of unbroken grapes in an atmosphere [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] with [[carbon dioxide]], which prevents traditional yeast fermentation. It is a process different from what is commonly referred to in winemaking as "maceration".

[[Freiherr|Baroness]] '''Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach''' ({{lang-cs|Marie von Ebner-Eschenbachová}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Marie Freifrau von Ebner-Eschenbach}}; September 13, 1830{{snd}}March 12, 1916) was an Austrian writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Freifrau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noted for her excellent [[psychological novel]]s, she is regarded—together with [[Ferdinand von Saar]]—as one of the most important [[German language|German-language]] writers of the latter portion of the 19th century.

==Biography==
She was born at the castle of the Catholic [[Dubský]] (''Dubský von Třebomyslice'') noble family in [[Troubky-Zdislavice|Zdislavice]] (present Czech Republic) near [[Kroměříž]] in [[Moravia]], the daughter of Baron (from 1843: Count) Dubsky and his wife Maria, née Baroness Vockel, who came from a Protestant-[[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] background. Marie lost her mother in early infancy, but received a careful intellectual training from two stepmothers. Despite being part of a noble family having access to her family's vast libraries, she was never actually schooled properly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=Hanna|title=The Guises of Modesty: Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's Female Artists|jstor=3189816|journal=The Johns Hopkins University Press|publisher=The South Central Modern Language Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 she married her cousin, the Austrian captain, and subsequent field-marshal, [[:de:Moritz von Ebner-Eschenbach|Moritz von Ebner-Eschenbach]]. The couple resided first in [[Vienna]], then at Louka (''Klosterbruck'') near [[Znojmo]], where her husband had a military charge, and after 1860 again in Vienna. The marriage was childless.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Marie grappled with the domestic priorities of a woman. She kept a journal and wrote letters explaining how her life constantly felt interrupted because of these tasks.&lt;ref name="wf"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodford|first1=Charlotte|title=Realism and Sentimentalism in Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's Unsühnbar|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&amp;RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=MultiTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA145161167&amp;docType=Critical+essay&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=LitRC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA145161167&amp;searchId=R3&amp;userGroupName=newpaltz&amp;inPS=true|website=The Gale Group|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that Marie may have suffered from "hysteria" based on symptoms found throughout these entries including debilitating headaches and excessive nervousness.&lt;ref name="wf"/&gt;

[[File:Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach mit ihrem Gemahl.jpg|thumb|Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach with husband Moritz von Ebner-Eschenbach, c. 1865]]
Marie began devoting herself to literary work. In her endeavours she received assistance and encouragement from [[Franz Grillparzer]] and [[Baron Eligius Franz Joseph von Münch-Bellinghausen|Freiherr von Münch-Bellinghausen]]. Her first publicized work was the drama ''Maria Stuart in Scotland'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Maria Stuart in Schottland}}), which [[Philipp Eduard Devrient]] produced at the [[Karlsruhe]] theatre in 1860.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Then came a tragedy in five acts, ''Marie Roland'', with several one-act dramas: ''Doktor Ritter'', ''Violets'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Das Veilchen}}), and ''The Disconsolate One''.

After these limited successes in the field of drama, she turned to narrative. Commencing with ''Die Prinzessin von Banalien'' (1872), she graphically depicts in ''Božena'' (Stuttgart, 1876, 4th ed. 1899) and ''Das Gemeindekind'' (Berlin, 1887, 4th ed. 1900) the surroundings of her Moravian home, and in ''Lotti, die Uhrmacherin'' (Berlin, 1883, 4th ed. 1900), ''Zwei Comtessen'' (Berlin, 1885, 5th ed. 1898), ''Unsühnbar'' (1890, 5th ed. 1900) and ''Glaubenslos?'' (1893) the life of the Austrian aristocracy in town and country.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Much of Ebner-Eschenbach's more mainstream success is accredited to Julius Rodenberg due to his publishing Ebner-Eschenbach's work in his popular periodical, Die Deutsche Rundschau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Worley|first1=Linda|title=The Making (and Unmaking) of an Austrian Icon: The Reception of Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=MultiTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=3&amp;docId=GALE%7CA180164305&amp;docType=Essay&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=LitRC&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CA180164305&amp;searchId=R1&amp;userGroupName=newpaltz&amp;inPS=true.|website=GALE Literature Research Center|publisher=Modern Australian Literature|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She also published ''Neue Erzählungen'' (Berlin, 1881, 3rd ed. 1894), ''Aphorismen'' (Berlin, 1880, 4th ed. 1895) and ''Parabeln, Märchen und Gedichte'' (2nd ed., Berlin, 1892). Von Ebner-Eschenbach's elegance of style, her incisive wit and masterly depiction of character give her a foremost place among the German women writers of her time. On the occasion of her 70th birthday the [[university of Vienna]] conferred upon her the degree of doctor of philosophy, [[honoris causa]]. An edition of Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach's ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Works) began to appear in 1893 (Berlin).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Throughout her life, she had never created literature or plays for monetary reasons, and so, in her will, she left, as to aid other writers in their own endeavors, the compensation she had received.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She died in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]].

In [[computer science]], a '''maximal pair''' is a [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(p_1, p_2, l)&lt;/math&gt;, such that, given a string &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S[p_1..p_1+l-1]=S[p_2..p_2+l-1]&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;S[p_1-1] \neq S[p_2-1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S[p_1+l] \neq S[p_2+l]&lt;/math&gt;. A '''maximal repeat''' is a string represented by such tuple. A '''supermaximal repeat''' is a maximal repeat never occurring as a proper substring of another maximal repeat. Both maximal pairs, maximal repeats and supermaximal repeats can be found in &lt;math&gt;\Theta(n+z)&lt;/math&gt; time using a [[suffix tree]],&lt;ref name="Gus97"&gt;{{cite book

'''Newari numerals''' are part of [[Newari language]]. The numbers can be represented in four different ways - in words, in numerals, by symbols or by allusion.

==Words==
As in every language in Newari also we can represent numbers in words. The way of writing can be different according to different Newari scripts but pronunciation is the same (excluding the dialects).

==Numerals==
As in every language in Newari also we can represent numbers in numerals. Numerals vary according to different Newari scripts.
The numerals of Nepal Bhasa in [[ranjana script]] goes in this way:-
[[File:Numbersinranjana.jpg|frameless|center]]

==Symbols==
Different symbols are used to represent numerals in this system. It is a unique system of numerals among Newar people. This system was mostly used in [[Malla era]].

==Allusion==
Different allusions are used to represent numerals in this system. It is also a unique system of numerals among Newars. This was also used in ancient period. In this system numbers are represented with universal truth. for example-to represent "1", there is one mouth and is a universal truth. So "म्हुतु-mhutu" meaning mouth is used for one. We can use any universal truth among many.This system is read from back.e.g.-12 is written as 21(ल्हा न्हाय्-lhaa nhya-hand nose)

A '''nightcore''' edit is a [[remix]] track that speeds up the pitch and tempo of its source material by 10-30%. The name is derived from Nightcore, a Norwegian duo who released pitch-shifted versions of [[Trance music|trance]] and [[eurodance]] songs, but now refers to any sped-up music labelled as "nightcore". When nightcore is on a site like Youtube it would most likely have an Anime Image in the Background.

==2000s: Origins==
The Nightcore term was first used in 2002 as the name for a school project by Norwegian DJ duo '''Thomas S. Nilsen''' and '''Steffen Ojala Søderholm''', known by their stage name as DJ TNT and DJ SOS respectively. The name Nightcore means "we are the core of the night, so you'll dance all night long", stated in their website named "''Nightcore is Hardcore''".&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hemsida.net/steffie/nightcore/biography.html|title=:!: Nightcore is Hardcore :!: biography|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070902142730/http://www2.hemsida.net/steffie/nightcore/biography.html|archivedate=2007-09-02|accessdate=2016-10-03|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were influenced by pitch-shifted vocals in German group [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]]'s hardcore songs "[[Nessaja]]" and "[[The Logical Song#Scooter version|Ramp! (The Logical Song)]]", stating in an interview that "There were so few of these kinds of artists, we thought that mixing music in our style would be a pleasure for us to listen to" and "Nightcore has become a style of music, a way to make the music happier – 'happy hardcore' as they say."&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesupersuper.com/featured/nightcore-interview/|title=NIGHTCORE INTERVIEW &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; SUPERSUPER!

The duo set a template of a track in the style: a 25% sped-up (commonly to around 160 to 180 [[tempo (music)|beats per minute]]) of a [[trance (music)|trance]] or [[eurodance]] song.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; The nightcore music has been compared to [[happy hardcore]] and [[wonky (music)|bubblegum bass]] due to its fast tempos, energetic feel and high-pitched vocals.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "DanceMusicNW"&gt;Harshman, Heath (July 25, 2015).

Nightcore's works started appearing on services such as [[LimeWire]] and [[YouTube]] around the mid-2005. The first nightcore track to appear on the latter site was "Dam Dadi Doo" by the duo in 2006. Only two of the project's albums have surfaced on the Internet.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; One of the first people to distribute nightcore music on [[YouTube]] was a user going by the name Maikel631, starting in 2008. He first uploaded around 30 original tracks by Nightcore on the website. In 2009, he found a "new" nightcore track and the technique to make material in the style: {{quote|I came to the realization that Nightcore songs could be made by everyone, using reasonably simple audio software. I was at least one of the first people to really use that knowledge to make Nightcore edits. oShyGuyzo did this before me with Nightcore II. Another channel which I followed and started exploring fan-made Nightcore around the same time was Nasinocinesino.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt;}}

==2010s: Popularity==
The first nightcore edit of a non-dance track was that of a track by rock band [[Evanescence]], uploaded on YouTube in 2011. From there, the music rose in popularity with more people applying the nightcore treatment to more non-dance genres such as [[pop music]] and [[hip-hop]]. Many of the pioneer uploaders of nightcore including Maikel631 have called these non-dance edits "fake".&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; The nightcore scene then crossed over to [[Soundcloud]] with the help of artist lilangelboi, who had released around ten to fifteen edits on the service before being signed to Manicure Records. The head of Manicure, Tom "Ghibli" Mike, recalled, "I just got totally obsessed with it. I put up that one he did, "Light", we had him up here to DJ a few parties, and then he moved here. That was totally how nightcore became a thing for us."&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; The label's #MANICURED playlist consisted of nightcore renditions of [[K-pop]] and [[electro house]] tracks, a few of them also incorporating production techniques outside of pitch-shifting and speeding up the source material, such as "Mile High" by Chipped Nails and Ponibbi and "Fave Hours" by F I J I.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt;

By the mid-2010s, the nightcore scene had garnered attention from musicians such as [[Djemba Djemba]], Maxo and Harrison, [[Nina Las Vegas]], [[Ryan Hemsworth]], [[Lido (musician)|Lido]], Moist Breezy, and PC Music founders Danny L Harle and A. G. Cook.&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; Harle and Cook have claimed nightcore to be influences in interviews,&lt;ref name = "NESTHQ"/&gt; the former saying in an interview, {{quote|From the second I first heard it, it's been so intensely emotional for me to listen to.

A '''peak land value intersection''' is the region within a [[town|settlement]] with the greatest [[land value]] and commerce. As such, it is usually located in the [[central business district]] of a [[town]] or [[city]], and has the greatest density of transport links such as [[road]]s and [[Rail transport|rail]]. Other hallmarks indicating a PLVI are tall buildings (in order to maximise the use of land) and a relatively great number of pedestrians.

This model is the urban equivalent of von Thünen's rural land use model in that both are based upon locational rent. The main assumption is that in a [[free market]] the highest bidder will obtain the use of the land. The highest bidder is likely to be the one who can obtain the maximum profit from that site and so can pay the highest rent. Competition for land is keenest in the city centre.

The most expensive or 'prime' sites in most cities are in the [[central business district|CBD]], mainly because of its accessibility and the shortage of space there. Shops, especially department stores, conduct their business using a relatively small amount of ground space, and due to their high rate of sales and turnover they can bid a high price for the land (for which they try to compensate by building upwards and by using the land intensively). The most valuable site within the CBD is called the peak Land value intersection or PLVI. Competing with retailers are offices, which also rely upon good transport systems and, traditionally, proximity to other commercial buildings (this concept does not have the same relevance in centrally planned economies).

One basis of this model is 'the more accessible the site, the higher its land value'. Rents will therefore be greater along main routes leading out of the city and along outer ring roads. Where two of these routes cross, there may be a secondary or subsidiary land value peak. Here the land use is likely to be a small suburban shopping parade or a small industrial estate.

'''Palaka''' (or 'Kpalaga') is a central [[Senufo languages|Senufo]] language spoken by approximately 8,000 people in northern [[Ivory Coast]]. It is bordered to the south by [[Djimini language|Djimini]], a southern Senufo language, and to the west by [[Nyarafolo language|Nyarafolo]], another Senufo language. North and east of the Palaka area live [[Dyula people|Dioula]] people.

Palaka constitutes a separate branch of the Senufo languages on its own, being rather different from them in morphology and phonology. It has been tentatively linked to [[Nafaanra language]], an isolated Senufo language spoken in [[Ghana]]. Palaka has been separated from the other Senufo languages at least since the fourteenth century AD.

'''Litterfall''', '''plant litter''', '''leaf litter''', '''tree litter''', '''soil litter''', or '''duff''', is dead [[plant]] material (such as [[leaf|leaves]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[Needle (botany)|needles]], [[twig]]s, and [[cladode]]s) that have fallen to the ground. This [[detritus]] or dead organic material and its constituent nutrients are added to the top layer of soil, commonly known as the litter layer or [[O horizon]] ("O" for "organic"). Litter has occupied the attention of ecologists at length for the reasons that it is an instrumental factor in ecosystem dynamics, it is indicative of ecological [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]], and may be useful in predicting regional [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] and [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]].

== Characteristics and variability ==
[[File:Western Hemlock litter.JPG|thumb|left|Plant litter, mainly western hemlock, ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'', in [[Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest]], Washington, United States]]

Litterfall is characterized as fresh, undecomposed, and easily recognizable (by species and type) plant debris. This can be anything from leaves, cones, needles, twigs, bark, seeds/nuts, logs, or reproductive organs (e.g. the [[stamen]] of flowering plants). Items larger than 2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter are referred to as [[coarse woody debris|coarse litter]], while anything smaller is referred to as fine litter or litter. The type of litterfall is most directly affected by [[ecosystem]] type. 
For example, leaf tissues account for about 70 percent of litterfall in forests, but woody litter tends to increase with forest age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=W. M. Lonsdale |year=1988 |title=Predicting the amount of litterfall in forests of the world |journal=[[Annals of Botany]] |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=319–324 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087560}}&lt;/ref&gt; In grasslands, there is very little aboveground [[perennial]] tissue so the annual litterfall is very low and quite nearly equal to the net primary production.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger"&gt;Schlesinger, William H. Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change. 2nd Edition. Academic Press. 108, 135, 152–158, 180–183, 191–194. (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[soil science]], soil litter is classified in three layers, which form on the surface of the O Horizon. These are the L, F, and H layers:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soil Classification|url=http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/soil200/classification/soil_horizon.htm|work=Faculty of Land and Food Systems|publisher=The University of British Columbia|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Unbulleted list
| L - organic horizon characterized by relatively undecomposed plant material (described above).
| F - organic horizon found beneath L characterized by accumulation of partly decomposed organic matter.
| H - organic horizon below F characterized by accumulation of fully decomposed organic matter mostly indiscernible
}}

The litter layer is quite variable in its thickness, decomposition rate and nutrient content and is affected in part by [[seasonality]], plant species, climate, soil fertility, elevation, and [[latitude]]. The most extreme variability of litterfall is seen as a function of seasonality; each individual species of plant has seasonal losses of certain parts of its body, which can be determined by the collection and classification of plant litterfall throughout the year, and in turn affects the thickness of the litter layer. In tropical environments, the largest amount of debris falls in the latter part of dry seasons and early during wet season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. V. Spain |year=1984 |title=Litterfall and the standing crop of litter in three tropical Australian rainforests |journal=[[Journal of Ecology]] |volume=72 |pages=947–961 |jstor=2259543}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this variability due to seasons, the decomposition rate for any given area will also be variable.

[[File:Litterfall-Latitude.gif|thumb|Litter fall in the North American Baldcypress Swamp Network, Illinois to Louisiana, 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwrc.usgs.gov/special/bald-cypress/results.htm |title=Litter Fall in the North American Baldcypress Swamp Network, Illinois to Louisiana, 2003 |publisher=Nwrc.usgs.gov |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Latitude also has a strong effect on litterfall rates and thickness. Specifically, litterfall declines with increasing latitude. In tropical rainforests, there is a thin litter layer due to the rapid decomposition,&lt;ref name = Packham&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Packham  | first1 = J.R.  | last2 = Harding  | first2 = D.J.L.  | last3 = Hilton  | first3 = G.M.  | last4 = Stuttard  | first4 = R.A.  | title = Functional Ecology of Woodlands and Forests  | publisher = [[Chapman &amp; Hall]]  | year = 1992  | location = London  | pages = 133–134, 246–247, 265  | isbn = 0412439506}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[boreal forests]], the rate of decomposition is slower and leads to the accumulation of a thick litter layer, also known as a [[Humus|mor]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; Net primary production works inversely to this trend, suggesting that the accumulation of organic matter is mainly a result of decomposition rate.

Surface detritus facilitates the capture and infiltration of rainwater into lower soil layers. Soil litter protects soil aggregates from raindrop impact, preventing the release of clay and silt particles from plugging soil pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chanasyk|first=D.S.|author2=Whitson, I.R. |author3=Mapfumo, E. |author4=Burke, J.M. |author5=Prepas, E.E. |title=The Impacts of Forest Harvest and Wildfire on Soils and Hydrology in Temperate Forests: A Baseline to Develop Hypotheses for the Boreal Plain|journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering Science|year=2003|volume=2|pages=S51–S62|doi=10.1139/S03-034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Releasing clay and silt particles reduces the capacity for soil to absorb water and increases cross surface flow, accelerating soil [[erosion]]. In addition soil litter reduces [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]] by preventing soil from losing moisture and providing cover preventing soil transportation.

Organic matter accumulation also helps protect soils from [[wildfire]] damage. Soil litter can be completely removed depending on intensity and severity of wildfires and season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ice|first=George G.|author2=Neary, D.G. |author3=Adams, P.W. |title=Effects of Wildfire on Soils and Watershed Processes|journal=Journal of Forestry|year=2004|volume=102|issue=6|pages=16–20(5)|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3511_s12/readings/Fire_Watersheds_JForestry.pdf|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regions with high frequency wildfires have reduced vegetation density and reduced soil litter accumulation. Climate also influences the depth of plant litter. Typically humid tropical and sub-tropical climates have reduced organic matter layers and horizons due to year round decomposition and high vegetation density and growth. In temperate and cold climates, litter tends to accuculate and decompose slower due to a shorter growing season.

==Net primary productivity==
Net [[primary production]] and litterfall are intimately connected. In every terrestrial ecosystem, the largest fraction of all net primary production is lost to [[herbivores]] and litterfall.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Due to their interconnectedness, global patterns of litterfall are similar to global patterns of net primary productivity.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

==Habitat and food==
Litter provides [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for a variety of organisms.

===Plants===
[[File:Oxalis acetosella 5724.jpg|thumb|Common wood sorrel (''[[Oxalis acetosella]]'') in [[Ivanovo Oblast]], Russia]]
Certain plants are specially adapted for germinating and thriving in the litter layers. For example, bluebell (''[[Hyacinthoides non-scripta]]'') shoots puncture the layer to emerge in spring. Some plants with [[rhizome]]s, such as common wood sorrel (''[[Oxalis acetosella]]'') do well in this habitat.&lt;ref name = Packham/&gt;

===Detritivores and other decomposers===
[[File:Svampe i Marselisborgskoven.jpg|thumb|left|Fungi in the forest floor ([[Marselisborg Forests]] in Denmark)]]
[[File:Eutropis multifasciata in leaf litter.JPG|thumb|A skink, ''[[Eutropis multifasciata]]'', in leaf litter in [[Sabah]], Malaysia]]
Many organisms that live on the forest floor are [[decomposers]], such as [[fungi]]. Organisms whose diet consists of plant detritus, such as [[earthworm]]s, are termed [[detritivore]]s. The community of decomposers in the litter layer also includes [[bacteria]], [[amoeba]], [[nematode]]s, [[rotifer]], [[springtail]]s, [[cryptostigmata]], [[Enchytraeidae|potworms]], insect [[larva]]e, [[Mollusca|mollusks]], [[Oribatida|oribatid mite]]s, [[woodlouse|woodlice]], and [[millipede]]s.&lt;ref name = Packham/&gt; Their consumption of the litterfall results in the breakdown of simple carbon compounds into [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and releases inorganic [[ions]] (like [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) into the soil where the surrounding plants can then reabsorb the nutrients that were shed as litterfall. In this way, litterfall becomes an important part of the nutrient cycle that sustains forest environments.

As litter decomposes, nutrients are released into the environment.  The portion of the litter that is not readily decomposable is known as [[humus]]. Litter aids in soil moisture retention by cooling the ground surface and holding moisture in decaying organic matter. The flora and fauna working to decompose soil litter also aid in [[soil respiration]]. A litter layer of decomposing [[biomass]] provides a continuous energy source for macro- and micro-organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bot|first=Alexandra|title=The Importance of Soil Organic Matter|year=2005|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organizations of the United Nations|location=Rome|isbn=92-5-105366-9|pages=Chapter 3|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0100e/a0100e00.htm#Contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Larger animals===
Numerous [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, and even some [[mammal]]s rely on litter for shelter and forage. Amphibians such as [[salamander]]s and [[caecilian]]s inhabit the damp [[microclimate]] underneath fallen leaves for part or all of their life cycle. This makes them difficult to observe. A [[BBC]] film crew captured footage of a female caecilian with young for the first time in a documentary that aired in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Land Invaders| series = [[Life in Cold Blood]] | credits = Writer David Attenborough, Director Scott Alexander, Producer Hilary Jeffkins | network = BBC | station = BBC One | airdate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some species of birds, such as the [[ovenbird]] of eastern North America for example, require leaf litter for both foraging and material for [[nest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Dunn  | first1 = Jon  | last2 = Garrett  | first2 = Kimball    | title = Warblers  | publisher = [[Peterson Field Guides]]  | location = New York  | year = 1997  | page = 451  | isbn = 0-395-78321-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes litterfall even provides energy to much larger mammals, such as in [[boreal forest]]s where [[lichen]] litterfall is one of the main constituents of wintering [[deer]] and [[elk]] diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richard L. Ward  |author2=C. Les Marcum  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=Lichen litterfall consumption by wintering deer and elk in western Montana |journal=[[Journal of Wildlife Management]] |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=1081–1089 |jstor=3803347 |doi=10.2193/0022-541X(2005)069[1081:LLCBWD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nutrient cycle ==
During leaf [[senescence]], a portion of the plant’s nutrients are reabsorbed from the leaves. The nutrient concentrations in litterfall differ from the nutrient concentrations in the mature foliage by the reabsorption of constituents during leaf senescence.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt; Plants that grow in areas with low nutrient availability tend to produce litter with low nutrient concentrations, as a larger proportion of the available nutrients is reabsorbed. After senescence, the nutrient-enriched leaves become litterfall and settle on the soil below.

[[File:litter-nutrient cycle2.gif|frame|A budget for organic matter in a mature (120-year-old) Scots pine [[monoculture]] (SWECON site). Based on data from Andersson et al.(1980). Units are in kg of organic matter per ha. Att. -attached; Surf. -surface; min. -[[mineral]]; and veg. -[[vegetation]]&lt;ref&gt;Breymeyer, A.I., B. Berg, S.T. Gower, &amp; D.

Vol. 56: Global Change: Effects on Coniferous Forests and Grasslands Carbon Budget, Ch. 3. (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Litterfall is the dominant pathway for nutrient return to the soil, especially for [[nitrogen]] (N) and [[phosphorus]] (P). The accumulation of these nutrients in the top layer of soil is known as [[immobilization (soil science)|soil immobilization]]. Once the litterfall has settled, decomposition of the litter layer, accomplished through the leaching of nutrients by rainfall and [[throughfall]] and by the efforts of detritivores, releases the breakdown products into the soil below and therefore contributes to the [[cation]] exchange capacity of the soil. This holds especially true for highly weathered tropical soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. Chave, D. Navarrete, S. Almeida, E. Álvarez, L. E. O. C. Aragão, D. Bonal, P. Châtelet, J. E. Silva-Espejo, J.-Y. Goret, P. von Hildebrand, E. Jiménez, S. Patiño, M. C. Peñuela, O. L. Phillips, P. Stevenson &amp; Y. Malhi |year=2009 |title=Regional and seasonal patterns of litterfall in tropical South America |journal=[[Biogeosciences]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=43–55 |doi=10.5194/bg-7-43-2010 |url=http://frutos.uniandes.edu.co/pagina/Documentos/Pdf/Chave%20Litterfall%2009.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leaching (agriculture)|Leaching]] is the process by which cations such as [[iron]] (Fe) and [[aluminum]] (Al), as well as organic matter are removed from the litterfall and transported downward into the soil below. This process is known as [[podzolization]] and is particularly intense in boreal and cool temperate forests that are mainly constituted by [[coniferous]] pines whose litterfall is rich in [[natural phenol|phenolic compounds]] and [[fulvic acid]].&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

By the process of biological decomposition by [[microfauna]], bacteria, and fungi, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, nutrient [[Chemical element|elements]], and a decomposition-resistant organic substance called [[humus]] are released. [[Humus]] composes the bulk of organic matter in the lower soil profile.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

The decline of nutrient ratios is also a function of decomposition of litterfall (i.e. as litterfall decomposes, more nutrients enter the soil below and the litter will have a lower nutrient ratio). Litterfall containing high nutrient concentrations will decompose more rapidly and [[asymptote]] as those nutrients decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Scott D. Bridgham |author2=John Pastor |author3=Charles A. McClaugherty |author4=Curtis J. Richardson |last-author-amp=yes |year=1995 |title=Nutrient-use efficiency: a litterfall index, a model, and a test along a nutrient-availability gradient in North Carolina peatlands |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=145 |issue=1 |pages=1–21 |url=http://ceeb.uoregon.edu/Bridgham/pubpdfs/art_5.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1086/285725 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813080603/http://ceeb.uoregon.edu/Bridgham/pubpdfs/art_5.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing this, ecologists have been able to use nutrient concentrations as measured by [[remote sensing]] as an index of a potential rate of decomposition for any given area.&lt;ref&gt;Melillo, J.M., &amp; J.R. Gosz. “[http://www.icsu-scope.org/downloadpubs/scope21/Chapter06.html Interactions of Biogeochemical Cycles in Forest Ecosystems]” Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE). Vol. 21: The Major Biogeochemical Cycles and Their Interactions, Ch. 6. (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, data from various forest ecosystems shows an inverse relationship in the decline in nutrient ratios to the apparent nutrition availability of the forest.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

Once nutrients have re-entered the soil, the plants can then reabsorb them through their [[root]]s. Therefore, nutrient reabsorption during senescence presents an opportunity for a plant’s future net primary production use. A relationship between nutrient stores can also be defined as:

:annual storage of nutrients in plant tissues + replacement of losses from litterfall and leaching = the amount of uptake in an ecosystem

==Collection and analysis==
The main objectives of litterfall sampling and analysis are to quantify litterfall production and chemical composition over time in order to assess the variation in litterfall quantities, and hence its role in nutrient cycling across an environmental gradient of [[climate]] (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Jeffrey A. “Measuring Litterfall Flux.” West Virginia Wesleyan College (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecologists employ a simple approach to the collection of litterfall, most of which centers around one piece of equipment, known as a '''litterbag'''. A litterbag is simply any type of container that can be set out in any given area for a specified amount of time to collect the plant litter that falls from the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] above.
[[Image:Litterbags.jpg|thumb|Litterfall and [[throughfall]] collectors at beech stand in Thetford, East Anglia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/fr/INFD-75PJ9E |title=Spatial variations of nitrogen deposition and its effect on forest biochemical processes |publisher=Forest Research |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Litterbags are generally set in random locations within a given area and marked with [[GPS]] or local coordinates, and then monitored on a specific time interval. Once the samples have been collected, they are usually classified on type, size and [[species]] (if possible) and recorded on a spreadsheet.&lt;ref&gt;Estrella, Stephanie. “Standard Operating Procedures for Litterfall Collection, Processing, and Analysis: Version 2.0.” Washington State Department of Ecology. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; When measuring bulk litterfall for an area, ecologists will weigh the dry contents of the litterbag. By this method litterfall flux can be defined as:

:litterfall (kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; yr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) = total litter mass (kg) / litterbag area (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Bastrup-Birk, A., &amp; Nathalie Bréda. “[http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/526/overview Report on Sampling and Analysis of Litterfall]” United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution: International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

The litterbag may also be used to study decomposition of the litter layer. By confining fresh litter in the mesh bags and placing them on the ground, an ecologist can monitor and collect the decay measurements of that litter.&lt;ref name = Packham/&gt; An [[exponential decay]] pattern has been produced by this type of experiment: &lt;math&gt;\frac{X}{X_o} = e^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;X_o&lt;/math&gt; is the initial leaf litter and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant fraction of detrital mass.&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

The mass-balance approach is also utilized in these experiments and suggests that the decomposition for a given amount of time should equal the input of litterfall for that same amount of time.
:litterfall = ''k''(detrital mass)&lt;ref name="Schlesinger" /&gt;

For study various groups from edaphic fauna you need a different mesh sizes in the litterbags &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Castro-Huerta, R., Falco, L., Sandler, R., Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Change due to invasive earthworms===
{{Main|Earthworms as invasive species|Invasive earthworms of North America}}
In some regions of Australia and North America, earthworms have been introduced where they are not native. Non-native earthworms have led to environmental changes by accelerating the rate of decomposition of litter. These changes are being studied, but may have negative impacts on some inhabitants such as salamanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Maerz  | first1 = John C.  | last2 = Nuzzo  | first2 = Victoria A.  | last3 = Blossey  | first3 = Bernd  | title = Declines in Woodland Salamander Abundance Associated with Non-Native Earthworm and Plant Invasions  | journal = Conservation Biology  | volume = 23  | issue = 4  | year = 2009  | url= http://faculty.bennington.edu/~kwoods/classes/forests/fall11/readings11/Maerz%20et%20al%202009%20ConsBiol.pdf  | accessdate = 28 April 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01167.x | pages=975–981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forest litter raking ===
This thin, delicate layer of organic material can be easily affected by humans. For instance, forest litter raking as a replacement for straw in husbandry is an old non-timber practice in forest management that has been widespread in Europe since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Three objectives of historical ecology: the case of litter collecting in Central European forests |author= Bürgi, M., Gimmi, U. |year= 2007 |doi= 10.1007/s10980-007-9128-0 |journal= Landscape Ecology |volume= 22 |pages= 77–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Soil carbon pools in Swiss forests show legacy effects from historic forest litter raking |author= Gimmi, U., Poulter, B.,  Wolf, A., Portner, H., Weber, P., Bürgi, M. |year= 2013 |doi= 10.1007/s10980-012-9778-4 |journal= Landscape Ecology |volume= 28 |issue= 5 |pages= 385–846}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, an estimated 50 Tg dry litter per year was raked in European forests, when the practice reached its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Reconstructing European forest management from 1600 to 2010 |author= McGrath, M.J. |year= 2015 |doi= 10.5194/bg-12-4291-2015 |journal= Biogeosciences |volume= 12 |issue= 14 |pages= 4291–4316|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This human disturbance, if not combined with other degradation factors, could promote podzolisation; if managed properly (for example, by burying litter removed after its use in animal husbandry), even the repeated removal of forest biomass may not have negative effects on pedogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Consequence of litter removal on pedogenesis: A case study in Bachs and Irchel (Switzerland) |author= Scalenghe, R, Minoja, A.P., Zimmermann, S., Bertini, S. |year= 2016 |doi= 10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.02.024 |journal= Geoderma |volume= 271 |pages= 191–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2014 WGT 265 Umbra Et Imago.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wax play]] done on a bound woman's genitals at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] festival, Germany, 2014]]

'''Play''', within [[BDSM]] circles, is any of the wide variety of "[[Kink (sexual)|kinky]]" activities. This includes both physical and mental activities, covering a wide range of intensities and levels of social acceptability. The term originated in the BDSM club and party communities, indicating the activities taking place within a [[BDSM#Scenes|scene]]. It has since extended to the full range of BDSM activities.

Play can take many forms. It ranges from light "getting to know you" sessions where participants discover each other's likes and dislikes to extreme, extended play between committed individuals that know each other's [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]] and are willing to push or be pushed at their boundaries. While physical activities are better known and more infamous, it also includes 'mental play' such as erotic hypnosis and mind games.

BDSM play is usually the primary topic of [[Consent_(BDSM)#Negotiation|negotiation]], especially for casual players and limited scenes. Most BDSM clubs and local communities offer classes and materials about negotiating play scenes. Play safety is a major topic of discussion and debate within BDSM communities.

==Categories of play==
Play is broken down into two broad categories, physical and mental. Physical play is better known and consists of the typical activities the average person thinks of as BDSM. As the BDSM scene matures and gains greater mainstream tolerance, mental play is becoming an increasingly noteworthy part of the community.

===Physical BDSM===
Physical BDSM encompasses all "[[Kink (sexual)|kinky]]" activities that are carried out physically. Two of the best known examples are flogging and bondage. Extensive classes and workshops teach technical skills to carry out these activities competently, as well as safety considerations and protocols. This is the type of play most often seen in BDSM clubs and in media representations of kink. While often associated with sadism and masochism, many activities are not focused on or even involve pain. Non-painful sensation play and elaborate bondage done mainly for aesthetic purposes are prominent examples.

===Mental BDSM===
Mental BDSM is the collection of activities intended to create a psychological impact, often without a physical component. Recreational hypnosis is the most prominent example, with a well-developed international community. Another noteworthy but controversial example is the 'mind fuck', wherein a state confusion and/or psychological conflict is intentionally created. While mental 'players' have considerably less documented material to study, an active Internet community and classes offered through local groups and conventions provide many learning opportunities.

==Types of play==
Participants in BDSM typically recognizes different types of play, based on their intensity and social acceptability. These distinctions can be rather arbitrary and variant. What is considered edge play for a particular couple or local community may be merely heavy play, or even light play, for others.

===Light play===
Light play consists of activities that are considered mild and/or carry little social stigma. This especially includes BDSM elements commonly practiced by [[vanilla sex|"vanilla" couples]]. Light [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], slapping, and casual spanking are examples of light play.

===Heavy play===
Heavy play indicates elements that are intense and/or carry substantial social stigma. The bulk of activities undertaken by BDSM participants would be considered heavy play or as bordering on heavy play. Examples of heavy play includes caning, suspension bondage, and erotic hypnosis.

===Edge play===
{{Main|Edgeplay}}
[[Edgeplay]] is a term used for types of play that "push the edge." They usually involve a risk of physical or emotional harm. Breath play, knife play, gun play and blood play are all types of edge play. In males, restriction of flow of urine and semen may contribute to the development of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] and [[erectile dysfunction]].{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Edge play can also literally refer to playing with an edge, for example knives, swords and other implements. It is sometimes used to describe activities that challenge the boundaries of the participants.

This type of play generally falls under the umbrella of [[Risk-aware consensual kink|RACK]] (Risk Aware Consensual Kink).

==Safety and consent==
{{see also|Safe, sane and consensual|Consent (BDSM)}}
[[Safe, sane and consensual|Safety]] and [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] in play are paramount considerations within the BDSM community. Various models of consent and negotiation are employed. Most participants consider it important to take responsibility for the safety of their partners. In addition, consent is typically what they consider to distinguish BDSM activities from [[domestic violence|abuse]] (or more specifically, [[intimate partner violence]]).

A '''Postal tax stamp''' refers to a stamp which raises revenue for charity or war related projects.&lt;ref&gt;Cabeen,  Richard McP.; ''The Standard Handbook of Stamp Collecting'', Rev.Ed. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Postal tax stamps are similar to [[semi-postal]]s, except their use is mandatory instead of voluntary. They are used to show payment of a compulsory tax on mailing letters and parcels. The taxes often go to a charitable institution or fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Klug | first = Janet | title = Inexpensive postal tax stamps offer a collecting challenge | work = Refresher Course | publisher = [[Linn's Stamp News]] | date = | url = http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/inexpensive_20080728/refreshercourse.aspx | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postal tax stamp originated in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].  Many Balkan nations and some [[Latin America]]n nations have been the most prolific issuers of postal tax stamps.

'''Proto-Anatolian''' is the [[proto-language]] from which [[Anatolian languages]] emerged. As with all other proto-languages, no attested writings have been found; the language has been reconstructed by applying the [[comparative method]] to all the attested Anatolian languages as well as other [[Indo-European languages]].

==Phonology==
For the most part, Proto-Anatolian has been reconstructed on the basis of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], the best-attested Anatolian language. However, the usage of [[Hittite cuneiform]] writing system limits the enterprise of understanding and reconstructing Anatolian phonology, partly from the deficiency of the adopted Akkadian cuneiform syllabary to represent [[Hittite phonology|Hittite phonemes]] and partly from Hittite scribal practices.

It is especially pertinent to what appears to be confusion of voiceless and voiced dental stops, in which signs -dV- and -tV- are employed interchangeably in different attestations of the same word.&lt;ref name="Luraghi 1998:174"&gt;Luraghi 1998:174&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in the syllables of the structure VC, only the signs with voiceless stops are usually used. Distribution of spellings with single and geminated consonants in the oldest extant monuments indicates that the reflexes of [[Proto-Indo-European phonology|Proto-Indo-European]] voiceless stops were spelled as double consonants and the reflexes of PIE voiced stops as single consonants. This regularity is the most consistent in the case of dental stops in older texts;&lt;ref name="Luraghi 1998:174"/&gt; later monuments often show irregular variation of this rule.

===Vowels===
Common Anatolian preserves the PIE vowel system basically intact. Some&lt;ref&gt;Lauraghi 1998:174&lt;/ref&gt; cite the merger of PIE */o/ and */a/ (including from *h₂e) as a Common Anatolian innovation, but according to Melchert&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 1993:244&lt;/ref&gt; that merger was a secondary shared innovation in Hittite, Palaic and Luvian, but not in Lycian. Concordantly, Common Anatolian had the following short vowel segments: */i/, */u/, */e/, */o/ and */a/.

Among the long vowels, */eː/ &lt; PIE *ē is distinguished from */æː/ &lt; PIE *eh₁, with the latter yielding ''ā'' in Luwian, Lydian and Lycian.&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 2015:10&lt;/ref&gt; Melchert (1994) had also earlier assumed a contrast between a closer mid front vowel */eː/ &lt; PIE *ey (yielding Late Hittite ''ī'') and a more open */ɛː/ &lt; PIE *ē (remaining Late Hittite ''ē''), but the examples are few and can be accounted for otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 2015:9&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of the opposition between long and short vowels is not entirely clear, but it is known for certain that it does not keep  the PIE contrast intact, as Hittite spelling varies in a way that makes it very hard to establish whether vowels were inherently long or short. Even with older texts being apparently more conservative and consistent in notation, there are significant variations in vowel length in different forms of the same lexeme.&lt;ref&gt;Lauraghi 1998:192&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thus suggested by Carruba (1981) that the so-called ''[[scriptio plena]]'' represents not long vowels but rather stressed vowels, reflecting the position of free [[PIE accent]]. Carruba's interpretation is not universally accepted; according to Melchert, the only function of ''scriptio plena'' is to indicate vowel quantity; according to him the Hittite ''a''/''ā'' contrasts inherits diphonemic Proto-Anatolian contrast, */ā/ reflecting PIE */o/, */a/ and */ā/, and Proto-Anatolian */a/ reflecting PIE */a/. According to Melchert, the lengthening of accented short vowels in open syllables cannot be Proto-Anatolian, and the same goes for lengthening in accented closed syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 1994:76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consonants===
One of the more characteristic phonological features common to all Anatolian languages is the lenition of the Proto-Indo-European voiceless consonants (including the sibilant *s and the laryngeal *ḫ) between unstressed syllables and following long vowels. The two can be considered together as a lenition rule between unstressed [[mora (linguistics)|moras]], if long vowels are analyzed as a sequence of two vowels.&lt;ref name="Melchert 2015:7"&gt;Melchert 2015:7&lt;/ref&gt; All initial voiced stops in Anatolian eventually merge with the plain voiceless stops; Luwian, however, shows different treatment of *G- and *K-,{{clarify|date=July 2016}} showing that this was a late areal development, not a Proto-Anatolian one.&lt;ref&gt;Melchert 2015:9&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Anatolian is the only daughter language of Proto-Indo-European to retain the laryngeal consonants. The letter ‹ḫ› represents the laryngeal *h₂ and probably but less certainly also *h₃.&lt;ref name="Fortson 2009:172"&gt;Fortson 2009:172&lt;/ref&gt; The sequences *h₂w and *h₃w yield a labialized laryngeal *ḫʷ.&lt;ref name="Melchert 2015:7"/&gt;

In addition to the laryngeals, Common Anatolian is also the only daughter to preserve the three-part velar consonant distinction from Proto-Indo-European. The best evidence for this comes from its daughter language, [[Luwian language|Luwian]].&lt;ref name="Fortson 2009:172"/&gt;

The voiced aspirated stops lost their aspiration over time and merged with the plain voiced stops. The liquids and nasals are inherited intact from Proto-Indo-European, and so is the glide *w. No native Proto-Anatolian words begin with *r-. One possible explanation is that it was true in Proto-Indo-European as well. Another is that it is a feature of languages from the area of Proto-Anatolian's daughter languages.&lt;ref name="Fortson 2009:172"/&gt;

==Morphology==
According to Fortson, Proto-Anatolian had two verb conjugations. The first, the ''mi-conjugation'' was clearly derived from the familiar Proto-Indo-European present tense endings. The second, the ''ḫi-conjugation'' appears to be derived from the Proto-Indo-European perfect. One explanation is that Anatolian turned the perfect into a present tense for a certain group of verbs while another, newer idea is that the ''ḫi'' verbs continue a special class of presents which had a complicated relationship with the Proto-Indo-European perfect.&lt;ref&gt;Fortson 2009: 173&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈpˠɑːd̺.ɾˠɪɡʲiːnʲ nʲiː u.a.l̺ˠaxˠɑːinʲ}}) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] singer, songwriter, academic and former [[news presenter|newsreader]]&lt;ref name="linkedin"&gt;[https://archive.is/20121128015124/http://ie.linkedin.com/pub/p%C3%A1draig%C3%ADn-n%C3%AD-uallach%C3%A1in/b/960/892 Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin] at [[LinkedIn]]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[County Louth]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="hyde"&gt;[http://www.roscommonarts.com/hyde/archive/contribut05.htm Douglas Hyde Conference biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191158/http://www.roscommonarts.com/hyde/archive/contribut05.htm |date=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Pádraigín was born in an [[Irish language|Irish]]-speaking household to Pádraig Ó hUallacháín and Eithne Devlin from Cullyhanna, Co.Armagh. Her father, a teacher, writer and song collector collected older songs from the Oriel area and in Rannafast, and encouraged Pádraigín and her siblings to sing.&lt;ref name="arts tonight"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2011/pc/pod-v-19121126m24sartstonight-pid0-1584048.mp3 Arts Tonight Interview] at [[RTÉ Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pádraigín attended school at St Louis, [[County Monaghan]] before beginning a degree course at the [[University of Ulster]]

==Career==

===1976–1980: RTÉ and Teaching===

In August 1976, Pádraigín became a television [[news presenter|newsreader]] at [[RTÉ]], Ireland's national broadcaster. She also researched and presented numerous radio programmes in English and in Irish for [[RTÉ Radio]].&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

Pádraigín left RTÉ in 1980 to become a school teacher in [[Athlone]], [[County Westmeath]].&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

===1999–2004: Recording===

In 1994, Pádraigín recorded her first full-length album with Garry Ó Briain. ''[[A Stór is a Stóirín]]'' was released on the acclaimed [[Gael-Linn Records|Gael Linn]] label and featured 36 songs for all ages, with an emphasis on songs suitable for primary school children.&lt;ref name="gaellinnstor"&gt;[https://siopa.gael-linn.ie/sites/gael-linnEN/Products/music/spiritualcefcd166-a-stor-is-a-stoirin A Stór Is A Stóirín] at [[Gael Linn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's [[Channel 4]] commissioned music videos for a number of songs on the album, featuring dramatisations of the lyrics as well as performances from Pádraigín. The videos later became regular features on [[TG4|TnaG]] (Ireland's newly launched Irish language television channel) between 1996 and 1998. That same year, she also featured on the television programme ''Light, Darkness and Colour''.

With the album's popularity growing, Pádraigín began the recording of her second album, again with Gael Linn. In 1995, Ní Uallacháin released ''[[An Dara Craiceann|An Dara Craiceann: Beanath the Surface]]''. It featured unaccompanied [[sean-nós song|sean-nós]] songs and songs set to music, including the works of Irish poet [[Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill]].&lt;ref name="daracraiceann"&gt;[http://www.irishsong.com/music/an-dara-craiceann/ An Dara Craiceann] at IrishSong.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Pádraigín's third album, ''[[When I Was Young (album)|When I Was Young]]'', was a collaboration between Garry Ó Briain (with whom she had collaborated on her first album), and her husband, folk singer [[Len Graham (singer)|Len Graham]], and was released on the Gael Linn label in 1999. Two years later, Pádraigín released fourth album, ''[[An Irish Lullaby|An Irish Lullaby: Suantraí]]'', under the [[Shanachie Records|Shanachie]] label in the United States. The recording featured collaborations with Len Graham, Garry Ó Briain, [[Máire Breatnach]], harpist [[Helen Davies]], [[fiddle]]r [[Nollaig Casey]] and [[Uilleann pipes|Uilleann piper]] Ronan Browne.&lt;ref name="hotpress"&gt;[http://www.hotpress.com/archive/480228.html An Irish Lullaby] review at [[Hot Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pádraigín left teaching in the Summer of 1999 to become a full-time musician and composer and began her doctorate at the University of Ulster.&lt;ref name="linkedin" /&gt;

===2002–2010: A Hidden Ulster===

Pádraigín released her fifth album, ''[[An Dealg Óir|An Dealg Óir: The Golden Thorn]]'' in 2002. The track-list consisted mainly of songs from southeast Ulster, [[Kingdom of Oriel|Oriel]] in particular. At the time, Pádraigín was studying the traditions, songs and people of the area. The album was again released on the Gael Linn label and features influential Irish musicians and singers, including Steve Cooney, [[Liam O'Flynn]], [[Liam Ó Maonlaí]] and [[Máire Breatnach]].

The following year, Ní Uallacháin's book, ''[[A Hidden Ulster|A Hidden Ulster: People, songs and traditions of Oriel]]'' was published with Four Courts Press, featuring 540 pages of rare songs, their histories, biographies of authors, collectors and scribes and documentation of folk traditions in Oriel from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name="fourcourts"&gt;[http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=22 A Hidden Ulster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529045841/http://www.fourcourtspress.ie/product.php?intProductID=22 |date=29 May 2012 }} at [[Four Courts Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; Television and radio programmes and series were produced, based on 'A Hidden Ulster' and featuring Ní Uallacháin on [[RTÉ Radio 1]], [[TG4]], [[RTÉ1]] and on [[BBC radio]].&lt;ref name="nuacht"&gt;[http://www.irishsong.com/news/padraigin-on-tv-and-radio-%E2%80%93-a-hidden-ulster/ Pádraigín on TV and radio – 'A Hidden Ulster']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="songsfrom"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/radio1/songsfromahiddenulster/ Songs from a Hidden Ulster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812235619/http://www.rte.ie/radio1/songsfromahiddenulster/ |date=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Hidden Ulster'' was met with critical acclaim and featured in the [[Times Literary Supplement]] as a Book of the Year, and [[Irish Times]] Books of the Year list.&lt;ref name="tls"&gt;[http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/tlssearch.do?querystring=Uallach%C3%A1in&amp;sectionId=1797&amp;p=tls Uallacháin search] at Times Literary Supplement&lt;/ref&gt; After the book's publication in 2003, Pádraigín was awarded ''Gradam Shean-Nós Cois Life'' in 2003 for her contribution to the Irish song tradition, and became the first traditional artist to be awarded a ''Major Arts Award'' from the [[Arts Council of Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name="heaneycentre"&gt;[http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SeamusHeaneyCentreforPoetry/Staff/DrPadraiginNiUallachain/ Dr. Pádraigín Ní Uallacháin], Seamus Heaney Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ''A Hidden Ulster'' was shortlisted for the 2005 [http://www.scottisharts.org.uk/DownloadPublication.aspx?pub=4692 Michaelis-Jena Ratcliff Prize] in Folklore and Folklife. That same year, Pádraigín was named Traditional Singer in Residence at the [[Seamus Heaney|Seamus Heaney Centre for Poetry]] at [[Queen's University Belfast]].

Pádraigín released her sixth album, ''[[Áilleacht|Áilleacht: Beauty]]'' in 2005. It is a collection of newly written and composed songs in Irish. ''Áilleacht'' garnered enthusiastic reviews and praise from both press and academics, with poet [[Louis de Paor]] stating:

{{Quote|text=This is a deceptively sophisticated composition in which a profound emotional disturbance is articulated apparently without artifice, impressing itself on the listener as though it were actual and direct speech. It is a fitting conclusion to a substantial and deeply satisfying piece of work.|sign=Louis de Paor|source=The Journal of Music,&lt;ref name="ceadcainte"&gt;[http://journalofmusic.com/article/394 Cead Cainte : Louis de Paor]&lt;/ref&gt; January 2006 edition}}

Pádraigín performed songs from the album on [[BBC Northern Ireland|BBC NI]] and [[RTÉ]], alongside other performers to celebrate the publication of ''An Leabhar Mór: The Great Book of Gaelic'', which was launched in Ireland and Scotland over a period of months in the countries various cities. Pádraigín also contributed a song to the album that accompanied the book.&lt;ref name="leabharmor"&gt;[http://www.en.gaelic-arts.com/multimedia/audio/songs-of-the-leabhar-mor An Leabhar Mór] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420092339/http://www.en.gaelic-arts.com/multimedia/audio/songs-of-the-leabhar-mor |date=20 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–Present: Songs of the Scribe===

In November 2011, Pádraigín released her first album on the Ceoltaí Éireann label, ''[[Songs of the Scribe]]''. As Traditional Singer in Residence at the Seamus Heaney Centre she collaborated with poets [[Ciaran Carson]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] on editing and translating song-poems from ancient Irish manuscripts, written by Irish [[scribes]] and scribe-poets. To record the album, Pádraigín travelled to [[St. Gallen, Switzerland]] to read the Irish manuscripts that had been removed from the country for safe-keeping in the event of Viking attack. ''Songs of the Scribe'' features all new compositions for poems and [[marginalia]] in [[Old Irish]] and in English. ''Songs of the Scribe'' received a positive reception and remained on the Celtic Note album charts for seven months between March and September 2012.&lt;ref name="IMMCharts"&gt;[http://www.irishmusicmagazine.com/charts/ Irish Music Charts] at [[Irish Music (magazine)|Irish Music magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The recording of ''Songs of the Scribe'' and Ní Uallacháin's visit to St. Gallen saw Ní Uallacháin begin work on a new creative album with fiddler/producer Dónal O'Connor based on older writings, including lore surrounding Irish Goddess [[Brigid]]. Pádraigín is also researching for a new book on the songs from the Irish [[Kingdom of Bréifne]].

[[LET THE FAIRIES IN]], Pádraigín's latest album of children's songs was released in September 2012.
CEOLTAÍ OIRIALLA - Songs of Oriel - a double CD of renewed songs by her of her native Oriel with and without accompaniment was released in 2017.
her most recent project was the renewal of Oriel music and song online, www.orielarts.com which was funded by the Arts Council of Ireland 

==Awards==
She is the first recipient of a Mayor Arts Award for a traditional musician from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland,
Gradam Sean-Nós Cois Life,
Gradam TG4 Award for outstanding contribution to traditional music

==Personal life==
Pádraigín lives in Glendesha, [[County Armagh]] and has two sons, Eoghan and Macdara https://www.facebook.com/MacdaraJewellery/. Pádraigín is a sister of the late [[Eithne Ní Uallacháin]] and aunt to Eithne's son [[Dónal O'Connor]], a producer and member of Irish traditional group [[At First Light]], uileann piper Finnian Ó Conchubhair and film director Feilimí O'Connor.

In [[logic]], '''{{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}}''' ({{langnf||[[Latin]]|"reduction to absurdity"|links=no}}), also known as '''{{lang|la|argumentum ad absurdum}}''' ([[Latin]] for "argument to absurdity") or the '''''appeal to extremes''''', is a form of argument that attempts either to disprove a statement by showing it inevitably leads to a ridiculous, absurd, or impractical conclusion, or to prove one by showing that if it were not true, the result would be absurd or impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=reductio ad absurdum|work=Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged|edition=12th|year=2014|orig-year=1991|accessdate=October 29, 2016|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/reductio+ad+absurdum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/r/reductio.htm |work = The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title = Reductio ad absurdum |author = Nicholas Rescher |accessdate = 21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traced back to [[classical Greek philosophy]] in Aristotle's ''[[Prior Analytics]]''&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; ({{lang-grc-gre|ἡ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον ἀπόδειξις||demonstration to the impossible}}, 62b), this technique has been used throughout history in both formal mathematical and philosophical reasoning, as well as in debate.

The "absurd" conclusion of a ''reductio ad absurdum'' argument can take a range of forms, as these examples show:
* The Earth cannot be flat; otherwise, we would find people falling off the edge.
* There is no smallest positive [[rational number]] because, if there were, then it could be divided by two to get a smaller one.
The first example argues that denial of the premise would result in a ridiculous conclusion, against the evidence of our senses. The second example is a mathematical [[proof by contradiction]] which argues that the denial of the premise would result in a [[contradiction|logical contradiction]] (there is a "smallest" number and yet there is a number smaller than it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howard-Snyder|first1=Frances|last2=Howard-Snyder|first2=Daniel|last3=Wasserman|first3=Ryan|title=The Power of Logic|date=30 March 2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=0078038197|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek philosophy==
This technique is used throughout [[Greek philosophy]], beginning with [[Presocratic]] philosophers. The earliest Greek example of a {{lang|la|reductio}} argument is supposedly in fragments of a satirical poem attributed to [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] (c. 570 – c. 475 BCE).&lt;ref name="Daigle"&gt;{{cite web | last = Daigle | first = Robert W. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The reductio ad absurdum argument prior to Aristotle | work = Master's Thesis | publisher = San Jose State Univ. | date = 1991 | url = http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1228&amp;context=etd_theses | format = | doi = | accessdate =August 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticizing [[Homer]]'s attribution of human faults to the gods, he states that humans also believe that the gods' bodies have human form. But if horses and oxen could draw, they would draw the gods with horse and oxen bodies. The gods cannot have both forms, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, the attribution of other human characteristics to the gods, such as human faults, is also false.

The earlier dialogues of [[Plato]] (424–348 BCE), relating the debates of his teacher [[Socrates]], raised the use of {{lang|la|reductio}} arguments to a formal dialectical method ({{lang|la|elenchus}}), now called the [[Socratic method]]&lt;ref name="Bobzien"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bobzien | first = Suzanne | title = Ancient Logic | work = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher = The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University | date = 2006 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/#NonModSyl | format = | doi = | accessdate = August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is taught in [[law school]]s.   Typically Socrates' opponent would make an innocuous assertion, then Socrates by a step-by-step train of reasoning, bringing in other background assumptions, would make the person admit that the assertion resulted in an absurd or contradictory conclusion, forcing him to abandon his assertion. The technique was also a focus of the work of [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE).

Greek mathematicians proved fundamental propositions utilizing reductio ad absurdum.&lt;ref name= "Euclid"&gt;{{cite web | last= Joyce | first= David | title = Euclid's Elements: Book I | work = Euclid's Elements | publisher = Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Clark University | date = 1996 | url = https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/elements/bookI/propI6.html | format = | doi = | accessdate = December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid of Alexandria]] (mid-3rd – mid-4th centuries BCE) and [[Archimedes of Syracuse]] (c. 287 – c. 212 BCE) are two very early examples.

==Principle of non-contradiction==
Aristotle clarified the connection between contradiction and falsity in his [[principle of non-contradiction]], which states that a proposition cannot be both true and false.&lt;ref name="Ziembiński"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.  Therefore if a proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and its negation &lt;math&gt;\lnot Q&lt;/math&gt; (not-''Q'') can both be derived logically from a premise, it can be concluded that the premise is false. This technique, called [[proof by contradiction]] has formed the basis of {{lang|la|reductio ad absurdum}} arguments in formal fields like [[logic]] and mathematics.

[[File:Hydeparkapril87.jpg|thumb|Speaker's Corner, April 1987]]

A '''Speakers' Corner''' is an area where [[public speaking|open-air public speaking]], debate, and discussion are allowed. The original and most noted is in the northeast corner of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in [[London]], [[England]].  Historically there were a number of other areas designated as Speakers' Corners in other parks in London (e.g., [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], [[Finsbury Park]], [[Clapham Common]], [[Kennington Park]], and [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]). More recently, they have been set up in other British cities, and there are also Speakers' Corners in other countries.

==Hyde Park==
[[File:Speakers Corner London - a speaker.JPG|thumb|"One world" speaker supporting a [[world government]]]]
[[File:Speaker's Corner Speaker.jpg|thumb|A [[Christian]] speaker at Speakers' Corner (2010)]]

Speakers here may talk on any subject, as long as the police consider their speeches lawful, although this right is not restricted to Speakers' Corner only. Contrary to popular belief, there is no immunity from the law, nor are any subjects proscribed, but in practice the police intervene only when they receive a complaint.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} On some occasions in the past, they have intervened on grounds of [[profanity]].&lt;ref&gt;Huggon, Jim:  Speakers' Corner: An Anthology. London: Kropotkin's Lighthouse Publ. 1977&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though Hyde Park Speakers' Corner is considered the paved area closest to [[Marble Arch]],&lt;ref&gt;Hyde Park Regulation, 1955. Statutory Instruments 1955, No. 1750. Clause 1(1), where the "footway at the junction of the North and East Carriage Drives" is described as "known as Speakers' Corner"&lt;/ref&gt; legally the public speaking area extends beyond the [[Reform Tree]] and covers a large area from Marble Arch to [[Victoria Gate (Hyde Park)|Victoria Gate]], then along [[the Serpentine]] to Hyde Park Corner and the Broad Walk running from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased from: Hyde Park Regulation, 1955. Statutory Instruments 1955 No. 1750. Clause 1(1), where "the public speaking area" is defined. A 1997 revision of the Regulation has a slightly more restricted definition of the area.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public riots broke out in the park in 1855, in protest over the Sunday Trading Bill, which forbade buying and selling on a Sunday, the only day working people had off. The riots were (rather sanguinely) described by [[Karl Marx]] as the beginning of the English revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humphreys|first1=Rob|last2=Bamber|first2=Judith|title=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxCN57GotDkC&amp;pg=PA287|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-093-0|pages=287–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement used Hyde Park as a point of assembly for workers' protests, but no permanent speaking location was established. The [[Reform League]] organised a massive [[Reform League#Hyde Park demonstration of 1866|demonstration in 1866]] and then [[Reform League#Hyde Park demonstration of 1867|again in 1867]], which compelled the government to extend the franchise to include most [[working class|working-class]] men.

The riots and agitation for democratic reform encouraged some to force the issue of the "right to speak" in Hyde Park. The Parks Regulation Act 1872 delegated the issue of permitting public meetings to the park authorities (rather than central government). Contrary to popular belief,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} it does not confer a statutory basis for the right to speak at Speakers' Corner. Parliamentary debates on the Act illustrate that a general principle of being able to meet and speak was not the intention, but that some areas would be permitted to be used for that purpose.

Since that time, it has become a traditional site for public speeches and debate, as well as a major site of protest and assembly in Britain. There are some who contend that the tradition has a connection with the [[Tyburn]] gallows, where the condemned man was allowed to speak before being hanged.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Speakers' Corner is often held up to demonstrate [[freedom of speech]], as anyone can turn up unannounced and talk on almost any subject, although always at the risk of being [[heckler|heckled]] by regulars. The corner was frequented by [[Karl Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[George Orwell]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Walter Rodney]], [[Ben Tillett]], [[Marcus Garvey]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]], and [[William Morris]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}  Lord Justice Sedley, in ''[[Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions]]'' (1999), described Speakers' Corner as demonstrating "the tolerance which is both extended by the law to opinion of every kind and expected by the law in the conduct of those who disagree, even strongly, with what they hear."  The ruling famously established in English case law that freedom of speech could not be limited to the inoffensive but extended also to "the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome, and the provocative, as long as such speech did not tend to provoke violence", and that the right to free speech accorded by [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 10]] of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] also accorded the right to be offensive. Prior to the ruling, prohibited speech at Speakers' Corner included [[obscenity]], [[blasphemy]], [[Lèse-majesté|insulting the queen]], or inciting a [[breach of the peace]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Milly|title=It's Speakers' Corner, but not as we know it|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/its-speakers-corner-but-not-as-we-know-it-1346856.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=12 May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eibl|first=Ralf|title=London -- Diatribe Alive And Well At Speakers' Corner|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930228&amp;slug=1687918|work=Deutsche Presse Agentur|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=28 February 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, for instance, a combination of park by-laws, use of the Highways Acts and use of venue licensing powers of the [[London County Council]] made it one of the few places where socialist speakers could meet and debate.

==Outside London==

===Official===

====Nottingham====
The first official Speakers' Corner outside London opened in [[Nottingham]] in 2009. It was officially inaugurated by [[Jack Straw]], the UK Justice Secretary, on 22 February 2009. The designated space occupied a new landscaped extension to the city's [[Old Market Square]], at the junction of King Street and Queen Street. The large paved space includes the new statue of [[Brian Clough]], the former manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who forged ties between the two cities which were famous for local rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speakerscornertrust.org/speakers-corner-projects/uk-projects/nottingham/|title=Nottingham - Speakers Corner Trust|website=www.SpeakersCornerTrust.org|access-date=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lichfield, Staffordshire====

Speakers Corner [[Lichfield]] was launched in May 2009, with the help of the Speakers’ Corner Trust, to much applause. Hundreds of people joined in the celebrations which featured over 30 speeches, musical and dance performances, as well as star appearances from BBC’s Jo Malin and former [[Coronation Street]] Star Chris Walker.

Today Speakers’ Corner is a site for events and activities, as well as a destination for all the community to visit and have their say on topics close to their hearts.

Since the launch, a plaque has been unveiled at the site, along with a code of conduct. Plans for the site include a stone plaque marking the spot, as well as a series of annual events.

====Worthing, West Sussex====
The [[Sussex]] coastal town of [[Worthing]] has had its own Speakers' Corner at Splash Point on the town's seafront since the [[Victorian era]].  A sign today marks the "stand for delivering sermons and public speeches", while another sign close by marks the site by the old Fish Market where the [[Salvation Army]] has preached the Gospel since 1886.  The Speakers' Corner fell into disuse in the late 20th century and is now being reinstated.  As part of the Government's ''Sea Change'' programme, being run by the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]], the area will benefit from a £500,000 grant to re-landscape the area around Splash Point and see a revival of the Speakers' Corner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/title,60447,en.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716142005/http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/title%2C60447%2Cen.html |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers' corner comprises a dais accessible by steps and a ramp providing a platform from which speakers address the crowd or passers by.&lt;ref name="CPSplashPointDesign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craftpegg.com/page6sp.html|title=Splash Point Design|year=2009|publisher=Craft:Pegg|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is due for completion by October 2010.&lt;ref name="WBCSplashPointRegeneration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthing.gov.uk/news/features/splashpointregeneration/|title=Splash Point Regeneration|year=2010|publisher=Worthing Borough Council|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unofficial===

====Leeds====
[[Leeds]] is known to have its own Speakers' Corner, at Victoria Gardens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speakerscornerleeds.org.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929151606/http://speakerscornerleeds.org.uk/ |archivedate=29 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[the Headrow]], in front of the [[Leeds City Art Gallery]], Central Library and Henry Moore Sculpture Centre building. It is a pivotal point in Leeds for justice and anti-war marches, most of which gather and terminate here, as well as for war memorial services due to the location of Leeds's Municipal Cenotaph.

==== Newcastle ====
The stepped base of [[Grey's Monument]] is used as a stage by assorted musicians, preachers and activists. Verbal clashes between left-wing and right-wing groups are frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/english-defence-league-clashes-refugee-10959512|title=English Defence League clashes with refugee rights campaigners in Newcastle|last=Kelly|first=Mike|date=2016-02-27|work=Chronicle Live|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/edl-march-in-newcastle-and-demand-repatriation-of-immigrants-after-er-referendum-vote_uk_576fccc4e4b0d2571149ca30|title=The EDL Marched In Newcastle Calling For The Repatriation Of Immigrants|date=2016-06-26|work=HuffPost|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/far-right-protesters-filmed-attacking-7251264|title=Racists who believe 'Hitler was right' filmed attacking busker|last=Thompson|first=Craig|date=2016-01-26|work=Daily Mirror|access-date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

===Australia===
There is a Speakers' Corner in [[the Domain]] in [[Sydney]], established in 1878. The speakers talk every Sunday afternoon from 2&amp;nbsp;pm until 5&amp;nbsp;pm, and have a website. Official outdoor "free" speech first appeared in the hustings and hanging grounds of Hyde Park Sydney in 1874. Free speech in this form was banned following a serious riot between Catholics and Orangemen. However, following the formalisation of free speech in Speakers' Corner in London it was decided in 1878 that The Domain would be the place for free speech in Sydney.

In 'Diary of a Voyage to Australia, New Zealand and other lands' (published 1896), Robert Roberts notes that "On the west side [of a particular location] is a feature peculiar to Sydney in all the world - a preaching park. There are of course, parks in other cities where open-air spouting is practiced on Sundays, such as Hyde Park, in London : but there is no city in the world where a park on such a scale is used by all classes of religious people. It is a wooded enclosure, like a nobleman's park in England, kept in capital order, both as regards the turf under foot, and the tall and noble trees that give shelter overhead from the sun."  "All the sects and denominations use it. There is none of the sense of infra dig that associates itself with out-door preaching in England.""Every denomination has its own tree." "The various religious bodies hold their meetings sufficiently apart to make no interference one with the other. It is a sort of weekly babel of religious tongues - recognised and patronised by the whole community"

Other Speakers' Corners are found outside [[Parliament House, Queensland|Parliament House]], in [[King George Square]], and at [[Brisbane Powerhouse|The Powerhouse]] in [[Brisbane]]. In [[Melbourne]], Speakers' Corner was originally held in [[Birrarung Marr]] where the original site is still visible. This site has lost some popularity over the years and Speakers' Corner (Now called "Speakers' Forum") is currently held outside the [[State Library of Victoria]] on Sunday afternoon from 3&amp;nbsp;pm.

===Canada===
[[File:Speakers corner.jpg|thumb|Speakers' Corner in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]]]]
Dedicated by the [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]] on 12 April 1966, Speakers' Corner in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] is located on the north shore of [[Wascana Centre|Wascana Lake]]. It serves as a constant reminder of the notion of free speech and assembly and a tribute to [[Saskatchewan]] people who have upheld that heritage. The two lanterns framing the south entrance to the main plaza formed part of the Cumberland Screen at the entrance to Speakers' Corner in London. The podia on the main plaza are from the exterior columns of the Old City Hall (1908–1965) and symbolise free speech in democracy at the municipal level of government. Six paper [[birch]] trees were taken from [[Runnymede]] Meadow in [[Windsor Great Park]], near [[Windsor Castle]]. It was there that [[John of England|King John]] signed [[Magna Carta]] on 15 June 1215. The ten gas lamps surrounding the corner come from King Charles Street which runs from Whitehall to St. James Park, London, near the Houses of Parliament.  They were erected in 1908 during the reign of [[Edward VII]], whose [[Royal Cypher|royal cypher]] E.R. VII appears on the base of each lamp.

[[Kitchener, Ontario]] has a small area designated as Speakers' Corner on the northwest corner of King and Frederick Streets. It existed already since the mid-1980s.

=== Indonesia ===
Mass demonstration and speeches are traditionally held on the Hotel Indonesia roundabout [[Selamat Datang Monument]]. This venue however, is located the middle of Jakarta's main boulevard and commercial district, thus causing a severe traffic jam when a rally is held. To accommodate this, Jakarta's provincial government built a small park on the northwestern corner of the [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]], across the [[Istana Merdeka]], Indonesia's presidential palace. Officially named 'Taman Pandang Istana' (Palace-View Park), this park is known commonly as 'Taman Unjuk Rasa' (Demonstration Park).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://travel.detik.com/domestic-destinations/d-3337665/usai-demo-jangan-lupa-berfoto-di-taman-unjuk-rasa-yang-happening|title=Usai Demo, Jangan Lupa Berfoto di Taman Unjuk Rasa yang Happening|last=Prakoso|first=Johanes Randy|work=detikTravel|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
As a tribute to democracy and freedom of speech, in Lajatico, Pisa there a small area designated as Speakers' Corner ("L'angolo del parlatore") on a corner of the Vittorio Veneto main square. It is opened for the public to speak on Sundays (9 to 11 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.). The first speaker was the mayor Alessio Barbarfieri, who highlighted the importance of the acts of speaking and listening for a good and effective local governance.

===Malaysia===
The first Speakers' Square in [[Malaysia]] was established at the [[Esplanade, Penang|Esplanade]], [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]] on 4 May 2010. It is opened for the public to speak on Wednesday and Sunday (6.00&amp;nbsp;pm to 10.00&amp;nbsp;pm). The first speaker was Tan Seng Hai who shared his views on preventing Ascot Sports [[Sendirian Berhad|Sdn. Bhd.]] from conducting betting activities in the Penang state.

'''''Conditions for use of Speakers' Square'''''
* All speakers are prohibited from using loudspeakers, megaphones, or any other public address system
* Anyone who uses the Speakers' Square to make speeches does so at his or her own risk
* The Penang State Government and the [[Penang Island City Council|City Council of Penang Island]] will not be responsible for any prosecution or legal action by the Police or civil proceedings

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there is a permanently designated speakers' corner called the [[Spreeksteen]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Lawfully, every person has the freedom of speech as a matter of right. The 'Spreeksteen' is open for free speech 24-hours a day, and was established to allow complete free speech. The 'Spreeksteen' has been located in the [[Oosterpark (Amsterdam)|Oosterpark]] in Amsterdam since 5 May 2005, and has been erected by a citizens action after the brutal murder of film-maker and columnist [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]. Plans for bringing the Amsterdam Speakers' Corner online with a permanent camera and microphone are in a phase of installation. In the meantime the speakers are filmed with a hand-held camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spreeksteen.nl |title=Spreeksteen.nl |publisher=Spreeksteen.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spreeksteen was involved in controversy when they allowed [[Michiel Smit]], a far-right activist, to speak on 1 October 2006. [[Antifascism|Antifascist]] demonstrators used noise to prevent Smit from being heard (as happens often when there is a public demonstration of the far-right).

===New Zealand===
[[File:Auckland-Albert-Park-Speakers-Corner.jpg|thumb|Speakers' Corner in Auckland]]
There is a Speakers' Corner in [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]] in [[Auckland]] at Princes Street, opposite to the [[University of Auckland]].

===Singapore===
{{Main article|Speakers' Corner, Singapore}}
[[File:Deserted Speakers' Corner - Singapore (gabbe).jpg|thumb|left|An empty Speakers' Corner in [[Singapore]]]]

The Speakers' Corner in [[Singapore]] was opened on 1 September 2000, to allow Singapore citizens to speak freely. They are exempted from the need to obtain a police permit as long as they meet the terms and conditions of use.

The Speakers' Corner is located in [[Hong Lim Park]], a popular venue for many election rallies and political speeches in the 1950s and '60s. Hong Lim Park is centrally located, well-served by public transport and is sited in a high public density area.

In 2004, public exhibitions and performances were added to the list of exempted activities at the Speakers' Corner.

From 1 September 2008, Singapore citizens can also organise or participate in demonstrations at Speakers' Corner without having to obtain a police permit. With this latest change in policy to allow the venue to be used freely as an outdoor demonstration site, coupled with the liberalisation on the use of sound amplification and the extension of operating hours of the venue, the Speakers' Corner aims to address the genuine desire by some Singaporeans for lawful outdoor demonstrations and processions as a means of political expression.

Singapore citizens who wish to hold a speech, exhibition/performance or demonstration at the Speakers' Corner can register with the National Parks Board, which manages Hong Lim Park. Online registration is available on the website.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Woodford Square in [[Port of Spain]], [[Trinidad]], is also known as "The University of Woodford Square", so named by the first prime minister of Trinidad [[Eric Williams]], who gave many speeches here. Another nickname, "People's Parliament", comes from the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1970s.  Flanked by Trinidad's Parliament and Halls of Justice the Square still plays host to speeches of a highly topical and political nature.

In the southeast corner of the square, a blackboard lists the day's discussion as well as other important information. The speakers' topics are divided by interest and known as "classes".

===Thailand===
An area was set up in [[Bangkok]] in the 1930s, and quickly became known as Hyde Park, to enable freedom of speech and the airing of political views in [[Thailand]].  The area was shut down after student rioting and the lethal intervention of the army and it is not discussed openly today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In 1955, Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]] had visited London as part of an international tour. He became impressed with the 'Speakers' Corner' in Hyde Park. Upon his return to Thailand a 'Hyde Park' space for free speech and assembly was instituted at the Phramane Grounds in Bangkok. The experiment was well received and effectively stimulated political debate. The experiment was not appreciated by the government though, and in February 1956 restrictions were imposed on the Phramane 'Hyde Park'. However, during this period the Hyde Park Movement Party had evolved, upholding the legacy of the Hyde Park experiment.&lt;ref name="rose181"&gt;Rose, Saul. ''Socialism in Southern Asia''.

=== United States ===
[[File:Elon University USA Speakers Corner.jpg|thumb|[[Elon University]]'s Speakers Corner]]

[[Tom L. Johnson]], the radical reforming Mayor of [[Cleveland]] (1901–1909), dedicated the north-west quadrant of Public Square to Free Speech, as in Hyde Park. Speeches and meetings there were common in the early part of the century; Anarchist Emma Goldman addressed a large crowd there in 1908. Today the site remains the traditional place for rallies and demonstrations in Cleveland, around Mayor Johnson's statue.

The [[History of the University of California, Berkeley#1960s and the Free Speech Movement|University of California at Berkeley]] had a free speech area in front of Sproul Plaza until 1964. [[University_of_Missouri|The University of Missouri]] hosts a Speaker's Corner, referred to as "Speaker's Circle". There are only two such locations in the entire state of Missouri.  

As a result of winter semesters visits to England and Hyde Park, Elon College (now known as [[Elon University]]) created a Speakers' Corner on campus. No persons from outside the university may speak without a permit. Students are free to speak at any time as long as they don't use amplification, do not disrupt others, do not damage property (including the lawn itself) and do not cause dangerous conditions (stakes may not be planted in the ground without the approval of Physical Plant due to electrical/water lines, etc.).

See also [[Washington Square Park (Chicago)]] regarding the history of Bughouse Square in Chicago, known as a free speech site from the 1910s to the 1960s.

The pedestrian-only area of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House in Washington, D.C. has become a de facto speaker's corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-the-white-house-fence-jumper-and-the-consequences-of-budget-cuts/2014/09/22/def1143a-429f-11e4-b437-1a7368204804_story.html|title=Dana Milbank: The White House fence jumper and the consequences of budget cuts|first=Dana|last=Milbank|date=22 September 2014|publisher=|access-date=1 January 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistent with the principles of the first amendment, ad hoc public speaking is generally legal in all public places in Washington DC, although organized demonstrations require police permits.  

Inspired by Speakers' Corner, [[Karl Dean]], the Mayor of [[Nashville]], designated a space for live music in the south-west corner of [[Centennial Park (Nashville)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/4391/Phase-One-Renovations-to-Centennial-Park-Complete|title=Phase One Renovations to Centennial Park Complete|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, calling it [[Musicians Corner]].

{{Property law}}

'''Strata management''', sometimes known as "body corporate management", is a specialist area of [[property management]] involving the day-to-day operation and management of a property that is jointly owned and comprises multiple units, common areas and common facilities. It is derived from an Australian concept of property law called [[strata title]] applied to the administration of common ownership in apartment buildings on multiple levels, or strata. Emerging markets in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, the Philippines and India have adopted the Australian system. It is one of the fastest growing forms of housing in the United States today, similar to [[common-interest development]] (CID), a category that includes planned unit developments of single-family homes, known as [[homeowner association]]s (HOAs), condominiums, and cooperative apartments. Federally-subsidized financing provided by two government-sponsored enterprises [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] via uniform financial instruments—mortgages that oblige the borrower to honour covenant restrictions of the collective-property regime with PUD or condo riders. Such provisions however are only enforceable where statutes recognise their validity. Common expense liabilities are often subordinated as junior liens in bankruptcy courts, with the bank retaining senior title.

The successful management of such developments requires the establishment of a [[strata title]] system to provide a framework for ownership, and guidelines to manage developments with multiple users and owners.

Many jurisdictions adopt the concept of jointly-owned property. Owners in these types of schemes automatically become members of an owners' or community association. These associations ultimately bear responsibility for the maintenance and management of common areas such as lobbies and corridors, and shared leisure facilities such as swimming pools and gyms. They are also responsible for running the administrative and financial aspects of the property.

The strata manager's role is to work with the owners' corporation and executive committee to successfully control, manage, maintain and administer the property and to create an appropriate community environment and includes tasks such as:

* General accounting
* Budgeting
* Invoicing of levies/service charges
* Arrears collections
* Financial reporting
* Contract management
* Meeting preparation
* Communication with property stakeholders
* Coordination of maintenance tasks
* Enforcement of rules/by-laws
* Issuance of notices, orders and certificates
* General secretarial tasks

==Strata management in New South Wales, Australia==
Strata management in New South Wales, Australia is currently governed by legislation including the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 and the Strata Schemes Management Regulation 2010.&lt;ref name="FT045"&gt;Strata Living, FT045, May 2015, NSW Government Fair Trading&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2015 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/About_us/Have_your_say/Reform_of_strata_laws.page]&lt;/ref&gt; the New South Wales Parliament passed the "Strata Schemes Management Act 2015"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Strata Schemes Development Act 2015"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssda2015279/]&lt;/ref&gt; which largely replace the previous Acts governing strata management. Together, the Acts establish over 90 key reforms with the aim of simplifying strata laws. The majority of these reforms commenced on 30 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/About_us/Legislation/Changes_to_legislation/Major_changes_to_strata_laws.page]&lt;/ref&gt; Some major changes include strengthening accountability of strata managers, quicker and simpler approval process for resolving disputes including renovation requests, tenant participation in meetings (scheme with over 50% tenants), electronic means for voting on motions, ability to fine unauthorised car parking, removing property developer's authority and influence in formulating Owners Corporation which can bind owners, guidelines to deal with construction defects, curbing practice of proxy farming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/About_us/Legislation/Changes_to_legislation/Major_changes_to_strata_laws.page/ NSW Fair Trading (Major Changes)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

All Schemes must review their current by-laws by 30 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/ftw/About_us/Legislation/Changes_to_legislation/Major_changes_to_strata_laws.page/&lt;/ref&gt;

A strata scheme is a building, or collection of buildings, where individual each own a small portion known as a 'lot' but where there is also common property (e.g. external walls, windows, roofs, driveways, foyers, fences, lawns and gardens). Every owner shares the ownership of the common property. Strata schemes apply to residential developments, commercial, industrial, mixed use, hotel and retirement villages.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

Lot owners own the inside of the unit but not the main structure of the building. Usually the four main walls, the ceiling and roof and the floor are common property. The dividing walls within the lot, floor coverings, and fixtures such as baths, toilet bowls and bench tops are all the property of the lot owner.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

The key concept is that the lot owner effectively owns the airspace (and anything included in the airspace) inside the boundary walls, floor and ceiling of the lot. Airspace can extend to balconies and courtyards.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

===Key aspects of strata management===

====Inspection of records====
Lot owners and prospective purchasers with written permission from a lot owner, can inspect the books and records of a strata scheme for a fee in accordance with section 108 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. There are companies which specialise in inspecting the books and records and can organise a 'strata search' inspection.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

Lot owners and prospective purchasers with written permission from a lot owner, can also request a certificate containing basic information about the strata scheme in accordance with section 109 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996, including the levies to be paid, outstanding levies and any special by-laws made by the owners corporation in the past two years.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Financial management====
An owners corporation is responsible for the same type of expenses as a conventional householder. These include utilities, building insurance and repair and maintenance. To cover the costs of expenses, the law requires that each owners corporation establishes an administrative fund and a sinking fund and raises levies from owners in accordance with section 76 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. All levies must be charged in proportion to the unit entitlements of each lot in accordance with section 78 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. Levies must be decided at each annual general meeting.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

The administrative fund is for day-to-day recurrent expenses, whereas the sinking fund is for the costs of future capital expenses.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

From July 2009, each owners' corporation is required to have a ten-year sinking fund plan. Developing a ten-year sinking fund plan means that future repairs and maintenance are anticipated well in advance.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

If the owners corporation has to pay a debt that was not budgeted for in either fund estimates, a special levy must be agreed at a general meeting and paid to the administrative fund in accordance with section 76 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

An unpaid levy incurs interest at the rate of 10% simple interest a year if not paid within one month after it is due.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Insurance====
The owners corporation is responsible for making sure all necessary insurance policies are in place in accordance with section 83 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. The building must be valued every five years in accordance with section 85 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Record keeping====
The owners corporation must keep certain records for at least 5 years including minutes of its meetings, correspondence, proxies and financial records.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Strata roll====
The owners corporation must prepare and keep a strata roll in accordance with section 96 of the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996 including the name and addresses of all lot owners, tenants, mortgagees, the original owner and the managing agent, the units of entitlement, insurance details and the by-laws for the strata scheme.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Repairs and maintenance====
The owners corporation must repair common property and lot owners must repair anything in their lot. However, this can be difficult as it is not always clear what is common property and what belongs to the lot owner.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

Starting 30 November 2016, cosmetic changes to the lot will not require the owners' corporation's approval. Minor and major renovations, including changes to floorboards or changes to the structural and external appearance of the building will still require approval of 50% (general resolution) and 75% (special resolution) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ssma2015242/ Strata Schemes Management Act 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

====By-laws====
There is no mandatory set of by-laws. Some model by-laws are set out in legislation, others are set by the original owner. By-laws can be added, changed or repealed at a general meeting if the motion passes.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Strata managing agents====
The owners corporation can engage a strata managing agent to work on behalf of all owners to help manage the strata scheme by entering into a managing agency agreement, which outlines their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of a managing agent can only be decided by a majority vote at a general meeting in accordance with section 27 as the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. Agents carry out some or all of the functions or duties or powers of the owners corporation including administrative matters such as calling meetings and collecting levies.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Executive committee====
The owners corporation must elect an executive committee which can make many of the day-to-day decisions about running the strata scheme on its behalf rather than deciding matters purely at general meetings however the owners corporation can overrule executive committee decisions or limit what they can make decisions about. The executive committee is elected at each annual general meeting. It can have between one and nine members. Once elected, the members decide who is to hold the office-bearers positions of chairperson, secretary and treasurer. Executive committee members can be elected if they are an owner, a company nominee or a person who is not an owner but who is nominated by an owner who is not standing for election.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Types of meetings====

=====First annual general meeting=====
The first annual general meeting must be held within two months of the end of the initial period, which is once one third of the total units of entitlement have been sold and the lot owner information is recorded on the strata roll. The agenda includes deciding the insurance cover, accounting records, election of the executive committee, by-laws and the appointment of the strata managing agent and caretaker. Notice of the meeting must be given to each owner of a lot at least seven days before the meeting. If notices are being mailed, an additional four working days must be allowed for postage.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

=====Annual general meetings=====
The annual general meeting agenda includes confirming previous minutes, a copy of the financial statements, information about insurance policies, appointing auditors and election of the executive committee. The notice period is the same as first annual general meetings.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

=====Extraordinary general meetings=====
Any general meeting of the owners corporation that is not an annual general meeting is called an extraordinary general meeting. These meetings can be held when necessary. The notice period is the same as first general meetings.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Executive committee meetings====
The executive committee agenda is held after the annual general meeting includes confirming previous minutes, appointing the office bearers and general day-to-day matters that arise. Notice of the meeting must be placed on the notice board 72 hours before the meeting. If the owners corporation does not have a notice board or the strata scheme is considered a large strata scheme, the meeting notice must be given to all lot owners. The notice can be given by email.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

====Resolving disputes====
When disputes cannot be resolved informally, there is a more formal process of dispute resolution set out by the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996. Owners corporations, owners or residents can take action through mediation, adjudication and the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal.&lt;ref name="FT045"/&gt;

'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.

Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.

In simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them.  (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In one general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture.  In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially.  If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue; [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide de facto standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman &amp; Littlefield International&lt;/ref&gt; Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

A '''tripartite language''', also called an '''ergative–accusative language''', is one that treats the agent of a [[transitive verb]], the patient of a transitive verb, and the single argument of an [[intransitive verb]] each in different ways.  This contrasts with [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] and [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] languages. If the language has [[morphological case]], the arguments are marked in this way:

* the ''agent'' of a transitive verb takes the [[ergative case]]
* the ''object'' of a transitive verb takes the [[accusative case]]
* the single argument of an intransitive verb takes the [[intransitive case]]

==Examples==
In this [[Nez Perce language|Nez Perce]] intransitive sentence, the intransitive argument has no suffix and the verb carries the third person agreement prefix ''hi-'':
:{|
|- 
| Hi-páayn-a || háama 
|-
| {{sc|3nom}}-arrive-{{sc|asp}} || man.{{sc|intr}} 
|-
|colspan=2|"The man arrived." &lt;ref name=Rude1986&gt;Rude, Noel. 1986. Topicality, transitivity, and the direct object in Nez Perce. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'' 52:124-153.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}
In a transitive sentence with two third person arguments, the agent is marked with ''-n(i)m'', the patient with ''-ne'', and the verb with the third person on third person transitive agreement marker ''pée-'':
:{|
|-
| Háama-nm || pée-'wi-ye || wewúkiye-ne
|-
| man-{{sc|erg}} || {{sc|3tr}}-shoot-{{sc|asp}} || elk-{{sc|acc}}
|-
|colspan=3|"The man shot the elk."&lt;ref name=Rude1986/&gt;{{rp|126}}
|}

The [[Ainu language|Ainu language of northern Japan]] also shows tripartite marking in its pronominal prefixes, with the first person ''Ku='' being the ergative form, ''=an'' being the intransitive form and ''=en='' being the accusative form. Ainu also shows the [[passive voice]] formation typical of nominative-accusative languages and the [[antipassive]] of ergative-absolutive languages. Like Nez Percé, the use of both the passive and antipassive is a trait of a tripartite language.

Tripartite languages are rare. Besides Native American Nez Perce, they include the Vakh dialects of the [[Khanty language]], [[Wangkumara language|Wangkumara]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and, in its singular pronouns, [[Kala Lagaw Ya language|Kalaw Lagaw Ya]]. [[Yazghulami language|Yazghulami]] is tripartite, but only in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[constructed language]]s, especially [[engineered language]]s, use a tripartite case system or tripartite adposition system, notably the fictional [[Na'vi language]] featured in the 2009 movie [[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]].

A '''use of force continuum''' is a standard that provides [[law enforcement officers]] and [[civilians]] with guidelines as to how much [[use of force|force]] may be used against a resisting subject in a given situation. In some ways, it is similar to the [[U.S. military]]'s escalation of force (EOF). The purpose of these models is to clarify, both for law enforcement officers and civilians, the complex subject of [[use of force]]. They are often central parts of law enforcement agencies' use of force policies. Various [[criminal justice]] agencies have developed different models of the continuum, and there is no universal or standard model.&lt;ref&gt;Stetser, 2001, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, each different agency will have their own use of force policy. Some agencies may separate some of the hand-to-hand based use of force. For example, take-downs and pressure point techniques may be one step before actual strikes and kicks. Also, for some agencies the use of aerosol pepper spray and electronic control devices (TASER) may fall into the same category as take-downs, or the actual strikes.

The first examples of use of force continuum were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Stetser, 2001, pp. 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Early models were depicted in various formats, including [[graphics|graphs]], semicircular "[[gauge (engineering)|gauges]]", and linear progressions. Most often the models are presented in "stair step" fashion, with each level of force matched by a corresponding level of subject resistance, although it is generally noted that an officer need not progress through each level before reaching the final level of force. These progressions rest on the premise that officers should escalate and de-escalate their level of force in response to the subject's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stetser, 2001, p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the use of force continuum is used primarily as a training tool for law enforcement officers, it is also valuable with civilians, such as in [[Criminal procedure|criminal trials]] or [[Hearing (law)|hearings]] by police review boards. In particular, a [[graphics|graphical]] representation of a use of force continuum is useful to a [[jury]] when deciding whether an officer's use of force was reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;Grossi, 2um006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example model==
While the specific progression of force varies considerably (especially the wide gap between empty hand control and [[deadly force]]) among different agencies and jurisdictions, one example of a general use of force continuum model cited in a U.S. government publication on use of force is shown below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/176330-2.pdf#page=13 |title=Garner and Maxwell|page= 37|format=PDF&lt;!-- PDF is excerpted from larger document --&gt;|website=ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Officer presence – the professionalism, uniform, and utility belt of the law enforcement officer and the marked vessel or vehicle the officer arrives in. The visual presence of authority is normally enough for a subject to comply with an officer's lawful demands. Depending on the totality of the circumstances, a call/situation may require additional officers or on scene officers may request assistance in order to gain better control of the situation and ensure a more safe environment for all involved. It also will depend on the circumstances of the situation. For example, depending on how many people are at the scene with the officer, a larger presence may be required. However, if 10 officers arrive at a scene with only a single suspect, the public may perceive the situation as an excessive use of officer presence within the use of force continuum. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/pages/continuum.aspx|title = The Use-of-Force Continuum|date = August 4, 2009|accessdate = |website = |publisher = National Institution of Justice Statistics|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Use of Force, Security Guards, use of force, Chris McGoey, security guards expert|url = http://www.crimedoctor.com/use-of-force.htm|website = crimedoctor.com|accessdate = 2015-04-17|first = Chris|last = McGoey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Use- of Force |format=PDF|url = http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/Use-of-Force.pdf|website = cops.usdoj.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Verbal commands/cooperative controls – clear and understandable verbal direction by an officer aimed at the subject. In some cases, it is necessary for the officer to include a consequence to the verbal direction so that the subject understands what will happen if the subject refuses to comply with the officer’s direction. The verbal command and the consequence must be legal and not considered excessive according to the continuum. For example, an officer could not order a disabled person in a wheel chair to stand up or be sprayed by Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Pepper Spray.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Use- of Force |format=PDF |url = http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/Use-of-Force.pdf|website = cops.usdoj.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Empty-hand submission techniques, PPCT – Pressure Point Control Tactics, Control Tactics, techniques – a level of force that has a low probability of causing soft connective tissue damage or bone fractures. This would include joint manipulation techniques, applying pressure to pressure points and normal application of hand-cuffs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/pages/continuum.aspx|title = The Use-of-Force Continuum|date = August 4, 2009|accessdate = |website = |publisher = National Institute of Justice|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Hard control Techniques/Aggressive response techniques – the amount of force that has a probability of causing soft connective tissue damage or bone fractures or irritation of the skin, eyes, and mucus membranes. This would include kicks, punches, stuns and use of aerosol sprays such as oleoresin capsicum (OC) pepper spray. Some models split these techniques between empty hand, soft control and intermediate weapon techniques but only include 5 levels of the continuum.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pss.cc/uofm.htm|title = The Use of Force Paradigm for Enforcement and Corrections|date = |accessdate = |website = pss.cc |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/pages/continuum.aspx|title = The Use-of-Force Continuum|date = August 4, 2009|accessdate = |website = |publisher = National Institute of Justice Statistics|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Intermediate weapons – an amount of force that would have a high probability of causing soft connective tissue damage or bone fractures. (e.g. [[expandable baton]], [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]], [[pepper spray]], [[Taser]], [[beanbag round]]s, rubber fin stabilized ammunition, [[Mace (spray)]], [[police dogs]], etc.) Intermediate weapon techniques are designed to impact muscles, arms and legs, and intentionally using an intermediate weapon on the head, neck, groin, knee caps, or spine would be classified as deadly or lethal force.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
# Lethal force/Deadly force – a force with a high probability of causing death or serious bodily injury. Serious bodily injury includes unconsciousness, protracted or obvious physical disfigurement, or protracted loss of or impairment to the function of a bodily member, organ, or the mental faculty. A firearm is the most widely recognized lethal or deadly force weapon, however, an automobile or weapon of opportunity could also be defined as a deadly force utility.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The U.S. Navy teaches a six-step model: Officer presence, Verbal commands, Soft controls, Hard controls, Intermediate Weapons, and Lethal force.  Hard controls includes the use of tools such as hand-cuffs, while soft controls equates to empty hand above, describing techniques where the officer may engage a resisting detainee.  When escalating, voluntary submission to cuffs is a viable way to prevent the need for empty hand submission techniques which place the officer and the detainee at physical risk.  When de-escalating, hard controls (i.e.: cuffs and isolation in the rear seat of a cruiser) gives officers a reasonable and achievable goal after altercation with a detainee during which higher levels of force may have been required.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.crimedoctor.com/use-of-force.htm|title = Use of Force|date = |accessdate = |website = crimedoctor.com |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://marinecorpsconceptsandprograms.com/programs/fire-support/escalation-force-non-lethal-effects|title = Escalation of Force - Non-Lethal Effects|date = |accessdate = |website = marinecorpsconceptsandprograms.com |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject classifications ==
In all use of force continuum models, the actions of the subject is classified in order for the officer to quickly determine what level of force is authorized and may be necessary to apprehend or compel compliance from the individual. Listed below are examples of how subjects are classified.
* Passive compliant – a person who recognizes the authority of the officers presence and follows the verbal commands of the officer.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/Use-of-Force.pdf|title = Use of Force|date = |accessdate = |website = cops.usdoj.gov |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The (Original) Use of Force Model|url = http://www.pss.cc/uofm.htm|website = pss.cc|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Passive resistor – a person who refuses to follow the verbal commands of the officer but does not resist attempts by officers to take positive physical control over them.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;
* Active resistor – a person who does not follow verbal commands, resists attempts by the officer to take positive physical control over them, and does not try to inflict harm on the officer.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;
* Active aggressor – a person who does not follow verbal commands, resists attempts by the officer to take positive physical control over them and attempts to cause harm to the officer or others.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;
Generally, the passive subjects and active resistors fall under levels 1–3 of the use of force continuum, while active aggressors fall under levels 4–6. The officers are trained to apply the proper measure of force within the continuum based on the actions and classification of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/Use-of-Force.pdf|title = Use of Force|date = |accessdate = |website = cops.usdoj.gov |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasonableness standard==
The [[United States Supreme Court]], in the case of ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'', 490 U.S. 386, (1989), held that when engaged in situations where the use of force is necessary to effect an arrest, or to protect an officer's life or that of another, a law enforcement officer must act as other reasonable officers would have acted in a similar, tense, rapidly evolving situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Faulkner|first= S. |year=2007|title= Response to resistance - Defining what is objectively reasonable |url=http://www.responsetoresistance.com/|website=responsetoresistance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such situations, once known as use of force incidents, are now commonly referred to as response to resistance incidents, because a law enforcement officer must respond to resistance offered by another. In order to determine what actions officers find reasonable in similar situations, some experts utilize surveys with law enforcement officers, who are provided with certain scenarios to determine what actions they would take if placed in certain situations. Knowing what other officers and citizens deem reasonable helps to craft a solid response to resistance continuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsetoresistance.com/ |last=Faulkner|first= S. |year=2007|title= Response to resistance - Defining what is objectively reasonable|website=responsetoresistance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shaihu Usman dan Fodio''', born '''Usuman ɓii Foduye''', (also referred to as {{lang-ar|عثمان بن فودي}}, '''Shaikh Usman Ibn Fodio''', '''Shehu Uthman Dan Fuduye''', '''Shehu Usman dan Fodio''' or '''Shaikh Uthman Ibn Fodio''') (15 December 1754, [[Senegal]] – 20 April 1817, [[Sokoto]])&lt;ref&gt;Hunwick, John O. 1995. "Arabic Literature in Africa: the Writings of Central Sudanic Africa (pp.&lt;/ref&gt; was a religious teacher, writer and [[Islamic]] promoter, and the founder of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. Dan Fodio was one of a class of urbanized ethnic [[Fulani]] living in the [[Hausa States]] in what is now northern [[Nigeria]].  He was a leader who followed the [[Sunni]] [[Maliki school]] of [[Fiqh|Jurisprudence]] and the [[Qadiri]] branch of [[Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://themuslim500.com/profile/saadu-abubakar-iii-sultan-sokoto The Muslim 500: "Amirul Mu’minin Sheikh as Sultan Muhammadu Sa’adu Abubakar III"] retrieved May 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;.

A teacher of the [[Maliki]] school of [[law]], he lived in the city-state of [[Gobir]] until 1802 when, motivated by his [[reformist]] ideas and suffering increasing repression by local authorities, he led his followers into exile. This exile began a political and social revolution which spread from Gobir throughout modern [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and was echoed in a [[jihad]] movement led by the [[Fula people|Fula]] ethnic group across West Africa. Dan Fodio declined much of the pomp of rulership, and while developing contacts with religious reformists and jihad leaders across Africa, he soon passed actual leader ship of the Sokoto state to his son, [[Muhammed Bello]].

Dan Fodio wrote more than a hundred books concerning [[religion]], [[government]], [[culture]], and [[society]]. He developed a critique of existing African Muslim elites for what he saw as their greed, paganism, violation of the standards of [[Sharia]] law, and use of heavy taxation. He encouraged literacy and scholarship, for women as well as men, and several of his daughters emerged as scholars and writers. His writings and sayings continue to be much quoted today, and are often affectionately referred to as '''Shehu''' in Nigeria. Some followers consider dan Fodio to have been a [[mujaddid]], a divinely inspired "reformer of Islam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/islam/hunwick.html John O. Hunwick. ''African And Islamic Revival'' in ''Sudanic Africa: A Journal of Historical Sources'' : #6 (1995)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Fodio's uprising was a major episode of a movement described as the [[Fula jihads|Fulani hegemonies]] in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpulaaku.net/defte/jsuretcanale/hist_essays/shsph_171819.html|title=Suret-Canale, Jean. "The Social and Historical Significance of the Fulɓe Hegemonies in the Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries." In ''Essays on African History: From the Slave Trade to Neocolonialism." translated from the French by Christopher Hurst. C. Hurst &amp; Co., London., pp. 25-55|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed the jihads successfully waged in [[Futa Bundu]], [[Futa Tooro]], and [[Fouta Djallon]] between 1650 and 1750, which led to the creation of those three Islamic states. In his turn, the Shehu inspired a number of later West African jihads, including those of [[Seku Amadu]], founder of the [[Masina Empire]], El Hadj [[Umar Tall]], founder of the [[Toucouleur Empire]] (who married one of dan Fodio's granddaughters), and [[Modibo Adama]], founder of the [[Adamawa Emirate]].

==Early life and training==
Dan Fodio was a [[Fulani people|Fulani]] descendant of a torodbe family that was well established in Hausaland.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620352/Usman-dan-Fodio Britannica Encyclopedia: "Usman dan Fodio"] retrieved May 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, Ira M. A History of Islamic Societies. 3rd ed. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2014. pg 469&lt;/ref&gt; He was well educated in classical Islamic science, philosophy, and theology. He also became a revered religious thinker. His teacher, Jibril ibn 'Umar, argued that it was the duty and within the power of religious movements to establish an ideal society free from oppression and vice. Jibril was a North African Muslim ''[['alim|alim]]'' who gave his apprentice a broader perspective of Muslim reformist ideas in other parts of the Muslim world. Jibril b. Umar was known as an uncompromising opponent of corrupt practices and a stuanch proponent of Jihad. He begain his intinerant preaching as a [[Mawlānā#Africa|mallam]] in 1774-1775. Inspired by Jibril b. Umar, Uthman Dan Fodio criticized the [[Hausa Kingdoms]] for their unjust and illegal taxes, confiscations of property, compulsory military service, bribery, gift taking and the enslavement of other Muslims. Dan Fodio also criticized the Hausa rulers for condoning paganism, worshipping fetishes, and believing in the power of talismans, divination, and conjuring. He also insisted on the observance of [[Maliki]] Law in the commercial, criminal, and personal sectors. Uthman also denounced the mixing of men and women, pagan customs, dancing at bridal feasts, and inheritance practices contrary to [[Islamic Law]].

Uthman was also very influenced by the [[Mushahada]] or mystical visions he was having. In 1789 a vision led him to believe he had the power to work miracles, and to teach his own mystical ''wird'', or litany. His litanies are still widely practiced and distributed in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/DalailuShehu "Dalailu Shehu Usman Dan Fodio." Internet Archive. Accessed May 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Fodio later had visions of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], the founder of the Qadari Sufi Brotherhood, an ascension to heaven, where he was initiated into the [[Qadiriyya]] and the spiritual lineage of the Prophet. His thological writings dealt with concepts of the renewer "[[mujaddid]] and the role of the [[Ulama]] in teaching history, and other works in Arabic and Fulbe. Many people regarded him as the [[Mahdi]] (messiah) come in fullfilment of popular prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, pg 469&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Fodio broke from the royal court and used his influence to secure approval for creating a religious community in his hometown of [[Degel]] that would, dan Fodio hoped, be a model town. He stayed there for twenty years, writing, teaching, and preaching. As in other Islamic societies, the autonomy of Muslim communities under [[Ulama]] leadership made it possible to resist the state and the state version of Islam in the name of Sharia and the ideal caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, pg 469&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fulani War==
[[Image:Sokoto caliphate.png|thumb|Sokoto Caliphate, 19th century]]

Uthman Dan Fodio's appeal to justice and morality rallied the outcasts of Hausa society. He found his followers among the Fulbe and Fulani. The Fulbe and Fulani were primarily cattle pastoralists. These pastoralist communities were led by the clerics living in rural communities who were Fulfude speakers and closely connected to the pastoralists. The Fulani would later hold the most important offices of the new states. Hausa peasants, runaway slaves, itinerant preachers, and others also responded to Uthaman's preaching. His jihad served to integrate a number of peoples into a single religio-political movement.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, pg 470&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, [[Yunfa]], the ruler of [[Gobir]] and one of dan Fodio's students, turned against him, revoking Degel's autonomy and attempting to assassinate dan Fodio. Dan Fodio and his followers declared hijrah and fled into the western grasslands of [[Gudu]], where they turned for help to the local Fulani nomads. Uthman's followers at this time entitled him [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] and ''sarkin muslim'' - head of the Muslim community. The rulers of Gobir forbade Muslims to wear turbans and veils, prohibited conversions, and ordered converts to Islam to return to their old religion.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Tanbih al-ikhwan ’ala ahwal al-Sudan'' (“''Concerning the Government of Our Country and Neighboring Countries in the Sudan''”) Usman wrote: “The government of a country is the government of its king without question. If the king is a Muslim, his land is Muslim; if he is an unbeliever, his land is a land of unbelievers. In these circumstances it is obligatory for anyone to leave it for another country”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9074522/Usman-dan-Fodio Usman dan Fodio: Encyclopædia Britannica Online].&lt;/ref&gt; Usman did exactly this when he left Gobir in 1802. Yunfa then turned for aid to the other leaders of the Hausa states, warning them that dan Fodio could trigger a widespread jihad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africandiasporastudies.com/downloads/bahia_slave_revolt.pdf ''The Islamic Slave Revolts of Bahia, Brazil: A Continuity of the 19th Century Jihaad Movements of Western Sudan?'', by Abu Alfa Muhammed Shareef bin Farid, Sankore' Institute of Islamic African Studies, www.sankore.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115174503/http://www.africandiasporastudies.com/downloads/bahia_slave_revolt.pdf |date=15 January 2007 }}.&lt;br /&gt;
Also see Lovejoy (2007), below, on this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usman dan Fodio was proclaimed ''[[Amir al-Muminin]]'' or Commander of the Faithful in Gudu. This made him a political as well as religious leader, giving him the authority to declare and pursue a jihad, raise an army and become its commander. A widespread uprising began in Hausaland. This uprising was largely composed of the Fulani, who held a powerful military advantage with their cavalry. It was also widely supported by the Hausa peasantry, who felt over-taxed and oppressed by their rulers. Usuman started the jihad against [[Gobir]] in 1804.

At the time of the war Fulani communications were carried along trade routes and rivers draining into the [[Niger River|Niger]]-[[Benue River|Benue]] valley, as well as the delta and the lagoons. The call for jihad reached not only other Hausa states such as [[Kingdom of Kano|Kano]], [[Daura Emirate|Daura]], [[Katsina Emirate|Katsina]], and [[Zazzau|Zaria]], but also [[Borno Empire|Borno]], [[Gombe Emirate|Gombe]], [[Adamawa Emirate|Adamawa]], [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]]. These were all places with major or minor groups of Fulani ''alims''.

By 1808 Uthman had defeated the rulers of [[Gobir]], [[Kano]], [[Katsina]], and other [[Hausa Kingdoms]].Usman Dan Fodio was defeated by Ibadan warlords in Yorubaland as far as the forest zone.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, pg 470&lt;/ref&gt; After only a few years of the [[Fulani War]], Dan Fodio found himself in command of the hausa state, the [[Fulani Empire]]. His son [[Muhammed Bello]] and his brother Abdullahi carried on the jihad and took care of the administration. Dan Fodio worked to establish an efficient government grounded in Islamic law. After 1811, Usman retired and continued writing about the righteous conduct of the Muslim religion. After his death in 1817, his son, Muhammed Bello, succeeded his as ''amir al-mu’minin'' and became the ruler of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], which was the biggest state south of the Sahara at that time. Usman’s brother Abdullahi was given the title Emir of [[Gwandu]] and was placed in charge of the Western Emirates, [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]]. Thus all Hausa states, parts of Nupe and Fulani outposts in [[Bauchi]] and [[Adamawa Emirate|Adamawa]] were all ruled by a single politico-religious system. By 1830 the jihad had engulfed most of what are now northern Nigeria and the northern Cameroons. From the time of Usman dan Fodio to the British conquest at the beginning of the twentieth century there were twelve caliphs.

The [[Sokoto Caliphate]] was a combination of an Islamic state and a modified Hausa monarchy. [[Muhammed Bello]] introduced Islamic administration, Muslim judges, market inspectors, and prayer leaders were appointed, and an Islamic tax and land system was instituted with revenues on the land considered ''kharaj'' and the fees levied on individual subjects called [[jizya]], as in classical Islamic times. The Fulani cattle-herding nomads were sedentarized and converted to sheep and goat raising as part of an effort to bring them under the rule of Muslim law. Mosques and Madrassahs were built to teach the populace Islam. The state patronized large numbers of religious scholars or [[Mawlānā#Africa|mallam]]s. [[Sufism]] became widespread. Arabic, Hausa, and Fulfulde languages saw a revival of poetry and Islam was taught in Hausa and Fulfide.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, pg 470&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious and political impact==
[[File:The Foundations of Justice for Legal Guardians, Governors, Princes, Meritorious Rulers, and Kings (The Administration of Justice for Governors, Princes and the Meritorious Rulers) WDL9666.pdf|thumb|''The Foundations of Justice for Legal Guardians, Governors, Princes, Meritorious Rulers, and Kings'' (Usman dan Fodio)]]

Many of the Fulani led by Usman dan Fodio were unhappy that the rulers of the Hausa states were mingling Islam with aspects of the traditional regional religion. Usman created a theocratic state with a stricter interpretation of Islam. In ''Tanbih al-ikhwan ’ala ahwal al-Sudan'', he wrote: “As for the sultans, they are undoubtedly unbelievers, even though they may profess the religion of Islam, because they practice polytheistic rituals and turn people away from the path of God and raise the flag of a worldly kingdom above the banner of Islam. All this is unbelief according to the consensus of opinions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/biography/viewentry.php?id=1807|title=Salaam Knowledge|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Islam outside the Arab World'', David Westerlund wrote: “The jihad resulted in a federal theocratic state, with extensive autonomy for emirates, recognizing the spiritual authority of the caliph or the sultan of Sokoto.”&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Steed and David Westerlund.  ''Nigeria'' in David Westerlund, Ingvar Svanberg (eds). Islam Outside the Arab World.  London: Palgrave Macmillan, 1999. {{ISBN|0-312-22691-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usman addressed in his books what he saw as the flaws and demerits of the African non-Muslim or nominally Muslim rulers. Some of the accusations he made were corruption at various levels of the administration and neglect of the rights of ordinary people. Usman also criticized heavy taxation and obstruction of the business and trade of the Hausa states by the legal system.

== Family ==
Usman dan Fodio was described as well past 6 feet, lean and looking very much like his mother Sayda Hauwa. His brother Abdullahi dan Fodio (1761-1829) was also over 6 feet in height and was described as looking more like their father Muhammad Fodio, with a darker skin hue and a portly physique later in his life.

In Rawd al-Janaan (The Meadows of Paradise), Waziri Gidado dan Laima (1777-1851) listed Dan Fodio's wives as:

His first cousin '''Maymuna''' with whom he had 11 children, including Aliyu (1770s-1790s) and the twins Hasan (1793- November 1817) and [[Nana Asma'u]] (1793-1864). Maymuna died sometime after the birth of her youngest children.

'''Aisha dan Muhammad Sa'd.''' She was also known as "Gaabdo" (Joy in Fulfulde) and as "Iyya Garka" (Hausa for Lady of the House/Compound). Iyya Garka was famed for her Islamic knowledge and for being the matriarch of the family. She outlived her husband by many decades. Among others, she was the mother of:

* Muhammad Sa'd (1777-before 1804). Eldest surviving son of Shehu dan Fodio, he was noted for his intellectual pursuits and his early death. 
* Khadija (c.1778-1856). Preceptor to her sister Asma’u and Aisha al-Kammu, wife to her brother [[Muhammad Bello]]. She was married to the scholarly Mustafa (c.1770-1855), the chief secretary to Shaykh Usman dan Fodio. By him, she was the mother of the Sheikh Abdul Qadir dan Tafa (1803-1864), a Sufi, Islamic cleric and historian
* Muhammad Sambo (c.1780-1826). A Qadiri Sufi Scholar, Sambo was the first to pledge allegiance to his younger brother Bello when the latter became Caliph in 1817.
* Muhammad Buhari (1785-1840). Buhari was a scholar and a lieutenant to the Sultans of Sokoto. He was Sarkin of the ribat of [[Tambuwal]], and was famous for his campaigns in Nupe along with the Emirs of Gwandu. Muhammad Buhari is the great-grandfather of Sultan [[Ibrahim Dasuki]].

'''Hauwa''', known also as "Inna Garka" (Mother of the House in Hausa) and Bikaraga. She was described as being prone to asceticism. Among her children were

* [[Muhammad Bello]] (1781-1837), the second Sultan of Sokoto. Author of a chronicle of the Fulani Jihad (Infaq al-Maysur) and a notable scholar.
* [[Abu Bakr Atiku]] (1783-1842), the third Sultan of Sokoto. Atiku was known for having inherited many of his father's esoteric secrets. He ruled between 1837 and 1842 and died following the failed siege of [[Tsibiri]]
* Fatima (1787-1838), also known as "Mo 'Inna" (Inna's child, to distinguish her from another Fatima). She was married to Sarkin Yaki Aliyu Jedo, generalissimo of the Sokoto armies.

'''Hajjo''', by whom he was the father of Abdul Qadir  (1807-1836) who was known as one of the best poets of Sokoto. Abdul Qadir died from battle wounds during Sultan Bello's last campaign, in Zamfara. He was buried at Baraya Zaki.

'''Shatura''', by whom he was the father of [[Ahmadu Rufai]] (1812-1873). Rufai was Sarkin of [[Silame]] and later became Sultan of Sokoto (1867-1873).

By his unique concubine '''Mariyatu''', Sheykh Dan Fodio was father to:
* Amina
* Ibrahim Dasuki
* Hajara
* ''Uwar Deji'' Mariyam (c.1808- fl. 1880s). Mariyam dan Shehu was a scholar like her sister Khadija, Fatima and Asma'u. Following the latter's death, she led the Yan Taru movement which promoted women's education. She was first married to Muhammad Adde dan Waziri Gidado, with whom she had two daughters. Following the latter's early death, she married the Emir of Kano Ibrahim Dabo (r. 1819-1846). She had no children in her second union. Mariyam wielded much influence following her return to Sokoto in the later 1840s. She was an influential counselor to her nephews who became Sultans, and often served as liaison in their dealings with Kano.  In the 1880s during the rule of Sultan Umar dan Ali dan Bello (r. 1881-1892), she penned a letter to her stepson Emir Muhammad Bello (r. 1883-1893) of Kano, rebuking the pretensions of her grand-nephew Hayatu dan Sai'd dan Sultan Bello (1840-1898), who was promoting mass emigration to Adamawa, as "amil" of the Sudanese Mahdi [[Muhammad Ahmad]].

'''Vyloppilli Sreedhara Menon''' (11 May 1911 – 22 December 1985) (also written as '''Vailoppilli''')was an [[India]]n poet of [[Kerala]]. He was born on 11 May 1911 in Kaloor in the [[Ernakulam district]]. He took his High School education from St. Albert's High School, Ernakulam and Bachelor Degree in Science from Maharajas College, Ernakulam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.keralasahityaakademi.org/sp/Writers/PROFILES/Vailoppilli/Html/Vailopillygraphy.htm | title=Vailoppilli Sreedhara Menon - Biography | publisher=Kerala Sahitya Academy | language=ml | accessdate=6 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, he became a teacher in government service.

He started writing under the pen name 'ahmed riaz' and his first collection, ''Kannikkoythu'' (Maiden Harvest), which  came out in 1947,  attracted the attention of critics with its innovative style which broke from the Romantic tradition. He was associated with Samastha Kerala Sahithya Parishath, the biggest forum for Malayalam writers at that time, for more than 10 years. He represented Kerala in the national poets' meetings held at [[Delhi]] (1951 and 1969) and [[Bangalore]] (1965). In 1970 he toured the [[Soviet Union]]. He was the first President of [[Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham]], a forum of progressive writers led by leftist intellectuals and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Sahithyakara Directory; Kerala Sahithya Academy, [[Thrissur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered by literary historians as one of the major voices in Malayalam poetry who marked the transition from the [[romantic poetry|Romantic]] to the [[History of poetry#Modern developments|modern]] era. A scientific insight into the historical roots of social  evolution and a deeper understanding of the psychological undercurrents of the human mind characterise his poetry. His mastery of the medium is evident in all his poems both lyrical and narrative.&lt;ref&gt;''Kairaliyude Kadha'', N. Krishna Pillai, NBS, [[Kottayam]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics consider the long poem ''Kudiyozhikkal'' (Eviction of the tenant) as his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]. In the prefatory lines to the poem the poet says: ''"Punchiri! Ha, Kuleenamam kallam. Nenchu keeri njan nerinekkattaam"''&lt;!-- is such punctuation as " ," correct in Malayalam?  in English it obviously isn't --&gt; (The smile! Oh, It's but a noble lie. Let me tear open my chest and show you the truth). The poem is a ruthless self-examination of a middle class land owner who realizes that the future belongs not to himself but to his poor tenant whom he despises at heart.&lt;ref&gt;''Malayala Kavitha Sahithya Charithram'', Dr. [[M. Leelavathy]], [[Kerala Sahithya Academy]], [[Thrissur]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Vyloppillikkavitha Sameeksha'', The State  Institute of Languages, [[Trivandrum]]&lt;/ref&gt; For an English translation of ''Kudiyozhikkal'' and other poems see ''Selected Poems of Valoppilli Sreedhara Menon'' by P.K.N.Panicker; Authorspress - 2015, {{ISBN|978-93-5207-076-3}}.

He died on 22 December 1985 and his body was cremated on the banks of the river [[Bharathappuzha]] (also called Nila), as he had wished.

The article included 13 specific steps humanity could take to transition to sustainability.

==History==
In late 1992, the late [[Henry W. Kendall]], a former chair of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) board of directors, wrote the first warning '''"World Scientists' Warning to Humanity"''', which begins: "Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course." A majority of the [[Nobel Prize]] laureates in the sciences signed the document;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ucs-statement.txt |title=Textfile containing the Warning and a list of selected signatories |publisher=stanford.edu |accessdate=2011-08-26}} (Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/61DcmWeQM)&lt;/ref&gt; about 1,700 of the world's leading [[scientists]] appended their signature.

It was sometimes offered in opposition to the [[Heidelberg Appeal]]—also signed by numerous scientists and Nobel laureates earlier in 1992—which begins by criticizing "an irrational [[ideology]] which is opposed to scientific and [[Industrialisation|industrial progress]], and impedes economic and social development." This document was often cited by those who oppose theories relating to [[climate change]].

However, the [[Heidelberg Appeal]] offers no specific recommendations and is not an indictment of [[environmental science]]: "We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific [[ecology]] for a universe whose [[Natural resource|resources]] must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved. But we herewith demand that this stock-taking, monitoring and preservation be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational pre-conceptions."

In contrast, the UCS-led [[petition]] contains specific recommendations: "We must, for example, move away from [[fossil fuels]] to more benign, inexhaustible [[energy]] sources to cut [[greenhouse gas]] [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] and the [[pollution]] of our [[air pollution|air]] and [[water pollution|water]].  ...  We must stabilize population."

'''Zay''' (also '''Lak'i''', '''Laqi''') is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch spoken in [[Ethiopia]]. It is one of the [[Gurage languages]] in the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian Semitic]] group. The Zay language has around 5,000 speakers known as the [[Zay people|Zay]], who inhabit [[Gelila, Ethiopia|Gelila]] and the other five islands and shores of [[Lake Zway]] in the southern part of the country.

Zay is an unwritten language.  Most speakers are multilingual in [[Oromo language|Oromo]], [[Amharic]], and additional [[Gurage languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, R. (2006). "The Zay Language (East-Gurage, Ethiopia)". Mainz University.&lt;/ref&gt; The language is geographically concentrated around Lake Zway; specifically, in Herera, [[Meki]], [[Ziway]], and the five islands: Fundurro Island (Famat or Getesemani Island) the smallest island; Tsedecha Island (Aysut Island), next to the biggest island; Debre-Tsion Island, the largest island; Gelila Island; and Debre Sina Island. It is an [[endangered language]], with speakers migrating to the mainland adopting the Oromo language, and increasing use of Oromo by the younger generations on the Zay islands.

Zay is 70% lexically similar with the [[Silt'e language]], and 60% with [[Harari language|Harari]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Linda; Netzley, Jillian; &amp; Mohammed, Hussein (2011). "A Sociolinguistic Survey Report of the Zay People in Ethiopia". SIL Electronic Survey Reports 2011-046: 43, 2011-046&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
The word order of Zay is [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] (subject–object–verb). Attributive [[adjective]]s precede the [[noun]]s they modify. Possessives also precede nouns.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Richard J. (1990). "Notes on the Zayse Language". Hayward, Richard J.(ed.). London: School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.&lt;/ref&gt; Zay is a  [[pro-drop language]], with required subject-marking on the verb.

Zay has been greatly affected by contact it has had with the Oromo language. This contact has created a significant amount of lexical and grammatical change in Zay.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, R. (2006). "The Zay Language (East-Gurage, Ethiopia)". Mainz University.&lt;/ref&gt;
