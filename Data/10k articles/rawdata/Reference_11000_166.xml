The '''''Antidotarium Nicolai''''', also known as the ''Antidotarium parvum'' or small antidotarium, was a late 11th{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=208}} or early 12th-century Latin book with about 150 recipes for the creation of medicines from plants and minerals. It was written in the circles of the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]], the center of European medical knowledge in the High Middle Ages. It was based in part on the ''Antidotarium'' of [[Constantine the African]], an 11th-century work also written in Salerno which was itself partially a translation of older Arabic works.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=198}} It has been called "without doubt one of the most influential medical texts in medieval literature",{{sfn|Garcia-Ballester|1994|p=28}} "the essential [[pharmacopeia]] of the Middle Ages"{{sfn|Hunt|1990|p=14}} and "the bible of medieval practical pharmacy".{{sfn|Wallis|1990|p=174}} It was often coupled with the ''[[Circa instans]]'', another 12th-century compendium of less complex medicines.{{sfn|Glick|2014|169}}

==Contents==
The oldest versions of the book contain some 115 recipes, while later versions can go to 175 recipes; most versions have about 150 descriptions of medicines. These recipes are not new inventions but a selection of existing recipes from the 11th-century ''[[Antidotarium magnum]]'' and other works. They are listed alphabetically. The book has little information on how medicines should technically be prepared, but focuses on ingredients, including their sequence and the quantities needed, and the manner in which they should be administered. The quantities were much reduced and standardized compared to older works. It introduces new names for many of the medicines, with etymological explanations: they are either named after the main ingredient, after the main effect they have, or after the supposed inventor of them. Much of this information was taken from the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]].{{sfn|Hunt|1990|p=14}}

==Author and origin==
The author of the ''Antidotarium Nicolai'' is unknown and has been the subject of a lot of speculation; even whether the writer was called Nicolaus or used a pseudonym is not certain. Suggestions include a doctor from Salerno, a professor at the Schola Medica, or a Salernian physician called Nicolò Aversano. Estimates of the date also vary from the eleventh century until the mid-thirteenth century. Some experts even claim that there were multiple works with the same name, including a French one from the 15th century written by Nicolas de Farnham.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=231}}

The ''Antidotarium Nicolai'' is first mentioned in 1244, in the ''Speculum Naturale'' of [[Vincent of Beauvais]]; all known manuscript copies of the ''Antidotarium'' date to the middle of the 13th century or later.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=231}} A twelfth-century commentary on the book, the ''Expositio super Antidotarium Nicolai'' may have been written by [[Mattheus Platearius]], who died in 1161. This commentary was printed in Venice in 1549.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=241}} [[Gilles de Corbeil]] (ca. 1140 – ca. 1224), a French royal physician, wrote ''De laudibus et virtutibus compositorum medicaminum'', partly based on the Antidotarium.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=258}} Jean de St. Amand, medecin at the University of Paris in the 13th century, also wrote a "Expositio supra Antidotarium Nicolai".{{sfn|Garcia-Ballester|1994|p=112}} These works are only known through later manuscripts and printings though.

==Influence==
The ''Antidotarium'' is credited with having introduced the Salernian version of the [[apothecaries' system]] of weights, with 20 granum making 1 scrupulum.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=232}}

The book was used as a textbook at the [[University of Paris]] by 1270 and in [[Montpellier]] by 1309. It was used as the official pharmaceutical guide in Naples and Sicily at the end of the 12th century, and in Ypres in the late 13th century. It was translated into Italian, French (once in the 14th, once in the 15th century), Hebrew (at least 17 different translations), Spanish, Arabic and Middle Dutch (at least five manuscripts known, one dated 1351). It was printed in 1471 in Venice and reprinted at least 8 times before 1500.{{sfn|Prioreschi|2003|p=234}}{{sfn|Van den Berg|1917|p=XVIII}} It was in use until the 18th century.{{sfn|Glick|2014|169}}

'''Bell-Booth Group Ltd v Attorney-General''' [1989] 3 NZLR 148 is a leading New Zealand case regarding the legal concept of owing a duty of care in tort for negligence, which in this case was for defamation.

==Background==
The Bell-Booth Group marketed in New Zealand a fertiliser called "[[Maxicrop]]". Unfortunately, this fertiliser did not materially improve the growth of plants.

The [[Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand)|Ministry of Agriculture]] conducted a trial on this fertiliser, which was partially funded by Bell-Booth, although it was agreed that this funding gave them no legal benefits.

Ultimately, the MAF trials found no material benefit to plant growth, and they released this information via the consumer affairs TV show [[Fair Go]], which finally aired after several episodes were prevented from screening due to a court injunction.

As a result, sales of Maxicrop plummeted, and Bell-Booth sued both MAF and the New Zealand Broadcasting Commission for defamation, where the High Court awarded general damages of $25,000 against MAF.

Bell-Booth's contention is even though the 135-day trial revealed that Maxicrop "didn't work", that MAF owed them a [[duty of care]] for the trial research results to be released to them first, in order to take steps to mitigate any financial losses, rather than being released immediately to the public, via Fair Go, as they did.

MAF appealed.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's earlier award of $25,000 in general damages, as MAF owed a duty of care to the agriculture industry, and the public in general and not to Bell-Booth.

[[Image:Print Shop, Shelburne Museum, Shelburne VT.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Print Shop&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Ben Lane Print Shop''' is a demonstration site at [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]] in the United States.

==History==
In 1955 the Museum constructed the '''Ben Lane Printing Shop''' as a working exhibit. A variety of presses and other equipment demonstrate daily the [[printing]] process. The shop also hosts educational programs for children and adults, while manufacturing items for the Museum. 

Today the building accommodates a typical, small-town printing shop from the first half of the 20th century. Although larger printing businesses of the period adopted the modern process of [[offset lithography]], the new technology arrived slowly to rural areas. Subsequently a press, such as the Ben Lane Printing Shop, continued to use moveable-type letterpress production similar to that devised by [[Johann Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century.

'''The Ben Lane Printing Shop''' houses the type of equipment that a proprietor and his successors would accumulate in adapting their press to a half-century’s technological advancements. In the first decades of the 20th century print shops continued to use old-fashioned presses for specific purposes. In the case of the Ben Lane Printing Shop, even an 1820s vintage hand press remained in occasional service. Likewise, the Cotrell newspaper press, manufactured in 1871, rolled on a regular basis, as did a treadle-operated Dorman job press of the same vintage for smaller work. Although printers still utilized racks of wood and metal type, a complicated and often cantankerous Linotype machine fulfilled many of the shop’s composition requirements. The final addition of a high-speed Heidelberg press with automatic inking and paper feed operated quickly and efficiently and dramatically increased output.

==The name==
The Museum named its printing shop in honor of Benjamin Battles Lane (1897–1987) whose father, Frank, founded the Lane Press of [[Burlington, Vermont]] in 1904. Ben Lane served as president and general manager of Lane Press from 1928-1961. His support enabled the Museum to install this exhibit and open it to the general public as a living tribute to a centuries-old craft.

==Printing==
Prints, which are created by using a press and metal plate system, made possible the production of multiple copies of the same image. In the late 18th century America, the local silversmith with a talent for engraving on metal often worked with the town printer to produce printed pictures for the general public. Letterpresses and printing procedures are demonstrated in the Museum’s Print Shop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19807">'''Bokklubben World Library''' ({{lang-no|Verdensbiblioteket}}) is a series of classical books, mostly novels, published by the [[Norwegian Book Club]] since 2002. It is based on a list of the hundred best books, as proposed by one hundred writers from fifty-four different countries, compiled and organized in 2002 by the Book Club. This list endeavors to reflect world literature, with books from all countries, cultures, and time periods.

Each writer had to select his or her own list of ten books.  The books selected by this process and listed here are not ranked or categorized in any way; the organizers have stated that "they are all on an equal footing," with the exception of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' which was given the distinction "best literary work ever written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evene.fr/livres/selection/les-100-meilleurs-livres-de-tous-les-temps.php? |title=Les 100 meilleurs livres de tous les temps |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] is the author with the most books on the list, with four. [[William Shakespeare]], [[Franz Kafka]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]] each have three.

==Breakdown by language, gender==

Eleven of the books included on the list are written by women, eighty-five are written by men and four have unknown authors.  This breakdown is similar to other lists, such as [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde's'' 100 Books of the Century]], which was voted for by 17,000 people from the general public and contains twelve books by women.

Twenty-six of the one hundred voting writers had English as their first language,&lt;ref&gt;See table in article.  22 come from Ireland, UK, US, and Trinidad and Tobago; 4 come from India but are all from the minority of Indians with English as their primary language.&lt;/ref&gt; which may be a factor in the list having so many (29) books written in English.  Again, this phenomenon was visible in ''Le Monde's'' list, with 49 French books.

The chronicle was most probably authored between 1519 and 1542,&lt;ref name="Nikodem"/&gt; though some parts continued to be added until 1574.&lt;ref name=Rowell/&gt; Authors of the chronicle are not known. The text highlights achievements of the [[Goštautai]] and [[Olshanski]] families, particularly to [[Jonas Goštautas]].&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt; Therefore, scholars concluded that it was sponsored by a member of these families. Scholars proposed [[Grand Chancellor of Lithuania|Grand Chancellor]] [[Albertas Goštautas]], Bishop [[Paweł Holszański]], and Duke [[Olelkovich]].&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt;

[[Aleksander Bychowiec]], a 19th-century Polish noble and historian, discovered the chronicle in 1830 and it is now known by his name. [[Teodor Narbutt]] studied, copied and published it in full in 1846 under the title ''Pomniki do dziejów litewskich''.&lt;ref name=Jonynas/&gt; The original 159-page manuscript went missing soon after Narbutt's publication and the chronicle is known only from Narbutt's copy. Because of that, earlier researcher were skeptical of the chronicle's authenticity.&lt;ref name=Jonynas/&gt; The chronicle was also published in 1907 in the volume 17 of the ''[[Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles]]''.&lt;ref name=Ukraine/&gt; A Lithuanian translation was published in 1971.

In 2011, Lithuanian historians discovered a fragment (about one-fifth of the original) of a chronicle that is essentially identical to the Bychowiec Chronicle at the {{illm|National Archives in Kraków|pl|Archiwum Narodowe w Krakowie}} and published it in 2018.&lt;ref name=Gudmantas/&gt;

==Content==
Narbutt claimed that the reverse of the last page said that it is a Lithuanian chronicle translated from the [[Ruthenian language]] into Polish. In fact, it is in Ruthenian transcribed in the Polish alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://litopys.org.ua/psrl3235/lytov01.htm#bychov ПРЕДИСЛОВИЕ (ПСРЛ, ТОМ 32, 1975)]&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicle is missing a beginning and an end. The first page was reconstructed by editors of the ''Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles'' using the writings of [[Maciej Stryjkowski]].&lt;ref name=Jonynas/&gt; The chronicle ends in the middle of a sentence describing the 1506 [[Battle of Kletsk]].&lt;ref name=Jonynas/&gt; In addition to being positively biased towards [[Lithuanian nobility]], particularly the [[Goštautai]] family, the chronicle also pays closer attention to Catholic affairs,&lt;ref name=Rowell/&gt; particularly the [[Franciscans]]. The legend of the [[Franciscan martyrs of Vilnius]] was first recorded in the chronicle.&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt;

The content can be broadly divided into three parts: legendary, historical, and contemporary.&lt;ref name=Jonynas/&gt; The legendary section elaborated on the [[Palemonids]] legends, tracing genealogy of Lithuanian nobility back to Apolon or Palemon, a 5th-century noble from the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt; The historical section describes historical events using other chronicles as a source. This section is often confused and contradictory. It rarely dates events and mixes them according to the theme; the reconstruction of proper chronology would be impossible without other sources. This section is not considered reliable.&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt; The contemporary section describes events during the chronicler's life, particularly the reign of [[Alexander Jagiellon]] (1492–1506). This section is considered valuable and reliable.&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt;

The Bychowiec chronicle used many medieval documents as its sources, primarily earlier versions of [[Lithuanian Chronicles]], which in turn used other chronicles, including the [[Galician–Volhynian Chronicle]]. After about 1446, the chronicle became an independent source, using notes made during the reign of Alexander Jagiellon.&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt; The chronicles probably had access to notes or chronicles of [[Jonas Goštautas]] as his activities in 1440–53 are particularly detailed.&lt;ref name=Jucas/&gt;

Although one of the least reliable Slavonic chronicles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perfecky|first1=George|title=The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle as a source of the Bykhovets' Chronicle|journal=Studia Ucrainica|date=1984|volume=2|pages=111–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bychowiec chronicle is generally believed to have used many medieval documents as its sources. The research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perfecky|first1=George|title=A Note on the Relationship of the Bykhovets Chronicle to the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle|journal=Harvard Ukrainian Studies|date=1981|volume=5|issue=September|pages=351–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perfecky|first1=George|title=Ukrainian Vernacular Features in the Byelorussian Bykhovets Chronicle|journal=Journal of Ukrainian Studies|date=1984|issue=Winter|pages=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the comparative text analysis, however, attempted to prove that a very important source of the Bychowiec manuscript was, in fact, the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle only, possibly in a copy or in excerpts that differed slightly from the versions which we know now.

'''''Ciubotaru v. Moldova''''' (application No. 27138/04) was a case decided by [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2010. Ciubotaru sought to have his ethnicity changed from [[Moldova]]n to [[Romania]]n on his birth and marriage certificates, which Moldova refused. The Court found that Moldova's procedure for changing ethnicity of record violated [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8 (right to private life)]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].

==Background==
In 2002, when applying to have his old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] identity card replaced with a Moldovan one, Mr. Ciubotaru submitted that his ethnicity was Romanian. As he was told that his application would not be accepted unless he indicated Moldovan ethnicity, as in his and his parents' Soviet documents, he complied.

Afterwards he requested the relevant State authority to change his ethnic identity entry from “Moldovan” to “Romanian”. His request was refused with the argument that since his parents had not been recorded as ethnic Romanians in their birth and marriage certificates, it was impossible for him to be recorded as an ethnic Romanian. He was advised to search the archives for traces of Romanian origin of his ancestors. Appeals to domestic courts were refused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (Paras. 6-13)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==

The Court found for Ciubotaru. The Court explained that it understood that authorities should be able to refuse a claim to change ethnicity of record when the claim is based purely on unsubstantiated subjective grounds. However, Moldova's legal requirements created insurmountable barriers on an individual wishing to record an ethnicity other than the ethnicity that Soviet authorities defined for the individual's parents. The Court also found that Ciubotaru's claim was based on more than merely subjective grounds, as Ciubotaru could produce objectively verifiable links with [[Romanians|Romanian ethnic groups]]. Evidence such as language, name, and empathy cannot be relied on under Moldovan law in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (Paras. 57-58)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court concluded, that the procedure of changing ethnicity record violated Article 8 (right to private life) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and ordered Moldova to pay the applicant 5,000 [[Euros]].

==Concurrence==

Judge Mijović filed a concurring opinion, pointing that ''I consider self-identification primarily as a matter of personal perception rather than a matter based on objective grounds, and that is why I do not share the Chamber's reasoning in the judgment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867119&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Judgment (concurring opinion of Judge Mijović)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">The '''Common Sense''' series included thirteen political books published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] in the [[United Kingdom]] during the early 1960s. They were intended to provide a general objective background on a particular topic and were addressed at the general reader who did not have specialised knowledge of the field. They were generally well received.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">A '''DNS sinkhole''', also known as a '''sinkhole server''', '''Internet [[sinkhole]]''', or '''Blackhole DNS'''&lt;ref name="BlackholeDNS"&gt;{{cite news | first=pfsense.org | title=BlackholeDNS: Anyone tried it with pfsense? | author=kevross33 | date=November 22, 2011 | url=http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=43298.0;wap2 | access-date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] server that gives out false information{{clarify|date=December 2016}}, to prevent the use of a [[domain name]].

==Operation==
A sinkhole is a [[DNS]] provider that supplies systems looking for DNS information with false results, allowing an attacker to redirect a system to a potentially malicious destination. DNS sinkholes have also historically been used for [[#Applications|non-malicious purposes]].

When a computer visits a DNS source to [[Domain_Name_System#Address_resolution_mechanism|resolve]] a domain name, the provider will give a result if possible, and if not, it will send the resolution system to a higher-level provider to try again. The higher a DNS Sinkhole is in this chain, the more requests it will receive, and the more impactful it will be.

===Network-level disabling===
A sinkhole is a standard DNS server that has been configured to hand out non-routable addresses for all domains in the sinkhole, so that every computer that uses it will fail to get access to the real website.&lt;ref name="DNS Sinkhole - SANS Institute"&gt;{{cite news | first=sans.org | title=DNS Sinkhole - SANS Institute | author=Kelly Jackson Higgins | date=October 2, 2012 | url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/dns/dns-sinkhole_33523 | access-date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher up the DNS resolution chain the sinkhole is, the more requests it will block as it will supply answers to a greater number of lower NS servers that in turn will serve a greater number of clients. Some of the larger botnets have been made unusable by [[TLD]] sinkholes that span the entire Internet.&lt;ref name="Conficter Hand off"&gt;{{cite news | first=darkreading.com | title=Microsoft Hands Off Nitol Botnet Sinkhole Operation To Chinese CERT | author=Kelly Jackson Higgins | date=October 2, 2012 | url=http://www.darkreading.com/risk/microsoft-hands-off-nitol-botnet-sinkhole-operation-to-chinese-cert/d/d-id/1138455 | access-date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNS Sinkholes are effective at detecting and blocking malicious traffic, and are used to combat bots and other unwanted traffic.

===Host-level disabling===
By default, the local [[Hosts (file)|hosts file]] on a [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Unix]] or [[Linux]] computer is checked before DNS servers, and can also be used to block sites in the same way.

== Applications ==
Sinkholes can be used both constructively, as has been done for the containment of the [[WannaCry cyber attack|WannaCry]] and [[Avalanche (phishing group)|Avalanche]] threats,&lt;ref&gt;https://gist.github.com/rain-1/989428fa5504f378b993ee6efbc0b168&lt;/ref&gt; and destructively, for example disrupting DNS services in a [[Denial-of-service attack|DoS]] attack.

One use is to stop [[botnet]]s, by interrupting the DNS names the botnet is programmed to use for coordination. The most common use of a hosts file-based sinkhole is to block [[ad serving|ad serving sites]].&lt;ref name="Hosts based ad block"&gt;{{cite news | first=someonewhocares.org | title=How to make the Internet not suck (as much) | author=Dan Pollock | date=October 11, 2012 | url=http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/ | access-date=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad serving can also be blocked using a locally running DNS server on your computer or on your local network effectively blocking Ads for all devices on the network.&lt;ref name="Blocking Internet Ads Using DNS Sinkhole"&gt;https://blog.technitium.com/2018/10/blocking-internet-ads-using-dns-sinkhole.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delights for ladies.gif|thumb|Title page of the 1609 edition of [[Sir Hugh Plat]]'s ''Delightes for Ladies'']]
'''''Delightes for Ladies''''' is a book of recipes and household hints for women, written by [[Sir Hugh Plat]] (perhaps best remembered for ''Floreas Paradise'') and published in [[London]] in 1600 by Peter Short.  Its full title is '' Delightes for ladies: to adorn their persons, tables, closets, and distillatories with beauties, banquets, perfumes and waters''.  A successful book in its day, some of the recipes have survived to be in relatively common use even 400 years later, in particular the various mixed alcoholic beverages.

==Modern editions and references==
*''Delightes for Ladies'' has not been frequently reprinted.  However, a few printings were made in the early 1900s by Crosby Lockwood &amp; Son Ltd, a London publisher.  These printings featured a new introduction.

''Delights for Ladies'' was reprinted in the United States by Trovillion Private Press in 1939 and a second limited edition printing of 498 copies took place by the same publisher in the summer 1942 on W.&amp; A. Ash-White Arak paper at the Sign of the Silver Horse, which is at Herrin in Illinois, U.S.A. for Violet and Hal W. Trovillion with all copies signed, numbered and type distributed.  These printings featured the addition of a glossary and table.

*''Delightes for Ladies'' was edited into ''A Collection of Medieval and Renaissance Cookbooks'', a compendium compiled by Duke Cariadoc of the Bow and The Duchess Diana Alena, published in 1991.
*An essay on ''Delightes for Ladies'' by garden historian [[Malcolm Thick]] entitled "A Close Look at the Composition of Sir Hugh Plat’s Delightes for Ladies" was published in ''The English Cookery Book - Historical Essays'' ({{ISBN|1-903018-36-6}})

== Transcription and publishing ==
During the transcription of the Dečani chronicle from the original manuscript, the transcriber did not only simply transcribe it, but also interpreted the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starinar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7hDAQAAMAAJ|year=1909|page=134|quote=Кад је пак прешисивач Дечанског летописа са старијег рукописа једном напустио прави задатак прешисивачев , па се латио тумачења догађаја , који је раније био само констатован , није се задржао на простом довођењу у везу ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Dungeon Master's Guide II''''' is a [[book]] of [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s for the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons v3.5|3.5 edition]] of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' seminal [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]].

== Contents ==

Like the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'', this book focuses on providing [[Dungeon Master]]s with assistance in running the game. It provides advice on aspects of running the game as well as complex pregenerated characters (often using [[List of Prestige Classes|Prestige Classes]]).

=== Player types ===

The ''Dungeon Master's Guide II'' introduces Dungeon Masters to various types of people who enjoy the ''D&amp;D'' game, and it explains what they enjoy.

Examples include:

* Brilliant planner—A leader-type who is happiest when planning for the night's adventure
* Cool guy—Player who likes to get cool powers and cool weapons
* Lurker—Someone who is happiest when left to his own devices
* Outlier—An oddball player who likes to see his character lose, seeing it as a victory more than a defeat
* Psychodramatist—A player who likes exploring the background of his or her character, and would love to have a session centered on that character

== Publication history ==

The book was written by [[Jesse Decker]], [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]], [[Chris Thomasson]], [[James Jacobs (game designer)|James Jacobs]], and [[Robin D. Laws]], and was published in June 2005. Cover art is by [[Matt Cavotta]], with interior art by [[Kalman Andrasofszky]], [[Mitch Cotie]], [[Ed Cox (artist)|Ed Cox]], [[Steve Ellis (comics)|Steve Ellis]], [[Wayne England]], [[Emily Fiegenschuh]], [[Randy Gallegos]], [[Brian Hagan]], [[Ginger Kubic]], [[Raven Mimura]], [[William O'Connor (artist)|William O'Connor]], [[Michael Phillippi]], [[Vinod Rams]], [[Wayne Reynolds]], Dan Scott, [[Ron Spencer]], [[Arnie Swekel]], and [[Franz Vohwinkel]].

David Noonan explained that this book offers words of wisdom on how to manage a game or even a whole campaign more creatively, and broadens the scope of adventuring to include more city and campaign-based material. He "wanted this book to have something for players too. Thus, the ''DMG II'' contains more magic items, plus some new rules elements designed for players, such as teamwork benefits and PC organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ps/20050606a| title=Product Spotlight: Dungeon Master's Guide II| date=June 6, 2005| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=August 1, 2013| last=Carroll| first=Bart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dungeon Master's Guide II'' was followed by the ''[[Player's Handbook II]]''.

== Reception ==
The reviewer from ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' commented that: "The ''Dungeon Master's Guide II'' is a supplementary volume intended to make the referee's job easier, but it achieves only mixed results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=5599]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emolument''' is a [[crowdsourced]] [[salary]] comparison website created in 2012 by Thomas Drewry, Olivier Beau de Loménie and Alice Leguay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://startups.co.uk/tech-pitch-emolument-com/|title=Tech Pitch: Emolument.com|publisher= Startups.co.uk|date=March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows its contributors to compare their salary to aggregated entries of other Emolument users, in order to help them negotiate a salary raise, evaluate an offer of employment or change locations.

As of September 2015, Emolument.com had gathered 100,000 entries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/facebook-google-or-linkedin-which-tech-company-offers-the-best-salary-10168343.html|title=Facebook, Google or LinkedIn: Which tech company offers the best salary?|publisher= [[The Independent]]|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of them automatically and manually verified in order to preserve the accuracy of the data, according to the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.emolument.com/info/faq|title=Emolument FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Emolument.com is opened to all industries, it is mostly used by [[Finance]], [[Consultancy]] and [[Technology|Tech]] professionals and therefore is often used as a source by newspapers for studies on Banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/careers/city-careers-in-finance|title=What's it really like to work in the City?|publisher= [[The Guardian]]|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tech firms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/213378/these-tech-companies-pay-best-junior-salaries-linkedin-amazon-microsoft|title=These tech companies offer the best junior salaries: Linkedin, Amazon, Microsoft |publisher= [[City A.M.]]|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Consultancy companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/fastft/293113/bankers-beat-consultants-race-high-wage|title=Bankers beat consultants in race for high wages|publisher= [[Financial Times]]|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emolument.com also regularly publishes league tables of best paying universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/11342557/Want-to-attend-the-top-university-by-graduate-pay-Thatll-be-67750.html|title=Want to attend the top university by graduate pay? That'll be £67,750|publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Emolument announced it had raised £1.4 million in funding from 10 angel investors, enabling it to pursue an aggressive user acquisition strategy targeted at financial and professional services globally to further establish Emolument.com as the leading user-generated remuneration data platform in these sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emolument.com raises $1.4 mln|url = https://www.pehub.com/2015/07/emolument-com-raises-1-4-mln/|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Erzulie Fréda'' [[Dahomey]], the [[Rada loa|Rada]] aspect of Erzulie, is the Haitian African spirit of love, beauty, jewelry, dancing, luxury, and flowers. She wears three [[wedding ring]]s, one for each husband - [[Damballa]], [[Agwe]] and [[Ogoun]]. Her symbol is a heart, her colours are pink, blue, white and gold, and her favourite sacrifices include jewellery, perfume, sweet cakes and liqueurs. Coquettish and very fond of beauty and finery, Erzulie Freda is femininity and compassion embodied, yet she also has a darker side; she is seen as jealous and spoiled and within some Vodoun circles is considered to be lazy. During ritual possession, she may enter the body of either a man or a woman. She enjoys the game of flirtation and seduces people without distinguishing between sexes.
In [[Christian iconography]] she is often identified with the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Mater Dolorosa]], as well as another loa named Metres Ezili. She is conceived of as never able to attain her heart's most fervent desire. For this reason she always leaves a service in tears. Common syncretizations include Iyalorde Oxum as she relates to the Yoruba Vodu goddess of erotic love, gold and femininity.

==Èrzulie Dantòr==

Erzulie Dantòr is the Queen of the Petro nation and the mother of "Ti Jean Petro", she is often depicted as a fearsome black woman, protectively holding "Ti Jean Petro" in her arms. She is a particularly fierce protector of women, children and the neglects of society. She is the Lwa Pwen, in contrast with Èrzuli Freda who will bless you with material riches, Èrzulie Dantòr will give you the Spiritual Knowledge needed to navigate through this material reality. Èrzulie Dantòr's wealth lasts and can be passed on from one generation to another, whereas Èrzuli Freda, in any of her jealous fits, can deprive overnight of the gains she helped you to achieve.   

She is often portrayed to resemble the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], as she is represented as being dark-skinned with two scars on her face. Her colours are red, black and blue. Her favourite sacrifices include black pigs, ''griot'' ([[Haitian cuisine|seasoned fried pork]]), blood (seven stabs of the sword), and [[Rhum agricole|rum]].

Ti Jean Petro is her son and Jean Petro is her lover or husband.

[[File:Fortune g500 cover06.jpg|thumb|The July 24, 2006 issue of ''Fortune'', featuring its Fortune 500 list]]

The '''Fortune 500''' is an annual list compiled and published by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine that ranks 500 of the largest [[United States]] [[Joint-stock company#Closely held corporations and publicly traded corporations|corporations]] by total revenue for their respective fiscal years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://beta.fortune.com/fortune500/ |title=Fortune 500 |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list includes [[publicly held company|publicly held companies]], along with [[Privately held company|privately held companies]] for which revenues are publicly available. The concept of the Fortune 500 was created by Edgar P. Smith, a ''Fortune'' editor, and the first list was published in 1955.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Edgar Smith, 69, Dies; Retired Time Executive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/12/obituaries/edgar-smith-69-dies-retired-time-executive.html|website=New York Times |accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1955 Full list|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1955/|website=Fortune |publisher=Fortune 500|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fortune 500 is more commonly used than its subset Fortune 100 or superset [[Fortune 1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Sean|title=Fortune 100: Everything You've Ever Wanted to Know About This Popular Annual Ranking|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/06/03/fortune-100-everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-a.aspx|website=The Motley Fool|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The original Fortune 500 was limited to companies whose revenues were derived from manufacturing, mining, and energy exploration.  At the same time, ''Fortune'' published companion "Fortune 50" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues). ''Fortune'' magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies.  With the change came 291 new entrants to the famous list including three in the Top 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Groves |first=Martha |date=26 April 1995 |title=Service Now Counts with Fortune 500 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-26/business/fi-59111_1_fortune-services-companies |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freakazoid!''''' is an American [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] created by [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Paul Dini]] and developed by [[Tom Ruegger]] for the [[Kids' WB]] programming block of [[The WB]]. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character, Freakazoid, a manic, insane superhero who battles with an array of super villains. The show also features mini-episodes of adventures of other bizarre superheroes. The show was produced by [[Amblin Television]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. The cartoon was the third animated series produced by the collaboration of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] during the [[Modern animation in the United States|animation renaissance]] of the 1990s.

[[Bruce Timm]], best known as a major principal of the [[DC animated universe]], originally intended it to be a straightforward superhero action-adventure cartoon with comic overtones, but [[executive producer]] [[Steven Spielberg]] asked series producer and writer [[Tom Ruegger]] and the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' team to turn ''Freakazoid!'' into a flat-out comedy.&lt;ref name="comedy"&gt;Lenburg, p. 638&lt;/ref&gt; The show is similar to fellow Ruegger-led programs such as ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and the humor is unique in its inclusions of [[slapstick]], [[fourth wall|fourth wall firings]], [[parody]], [[surreal humor]] and pop cultural references.

The series was one of the first to debut on the new [[Kids' WB]] Saturday morning block of [[The WB]], on September 9, 1995. The series lasted for two seasons, finishing with 24 episodes, the final one broadcast on June 1, 1997. Although the series originally struggled in the ratings, reruns on [[Cartoon Network]] and a fan following have elevated the series to become a [[Cult following|cult hit]].&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt; Warner Brothers even flirted with the idea of renewing the series for a third season, but deemed it too expensive. The show also ranked #53 on [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Animated Series list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=53. Freakazoid|url=http://www.ign.com/top/animated-tv-series/53.html|work=Top 100 Animated Series|publisher=IGN|accessdate=13 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The show's title character is the superhero alter ego of [[geek]]y 16-year-old (later changed to 17-year-old) Dexter Douglas who attends [[Harry Connick, Jr.|Harry Connick]] High School. His name is a parody of various superheroes' alliterative names (e.g. Bruce Banner, Peter Parker). Dexter gained his abilities from a [[computer bug]] activated by a "secret key sequence" that must be typed (a reference to the [[Pentium FDIV bug]]). The sequence of keys is ''"@[=g3,8d]\&amp;fbb=-q]/hk%fg"'' (the quotes are included), as seen when Roddy MacStew types the combination in "[[Integrated circuit|The Chip]] (Act 2)". The bug manifests when the user presses Delete after entering the string, and was first activated when Dexter's [[cat]] crawled onto the keyboard. Becoming absorbed into his computer and instantly gaining all the information on the [[Internet]], Freakazoid has enhanced [[physical strength|strength]] and [[endurance]], extraordinary speed and [[agility]], and negligible amounts of [[sanity]]. These changes make him a powerful and fearsome force for upholding [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and righteousness, unless he gets distracted by something like a bear riding a motorcycle. He has a base called the Freakalair, a parody of [[the Batcave]], built by his mute butler, Ingmar. The Freakalair contains a "Hall of Nifty Things to Know" and even a [[mad scientist]] lab. His greatest weakness, as he once explained to Armando Guitierrez, is that he can be imprisoned in a cage with [[graphite]] bars charged with [[negative ions]]. He also expresses a great aversion to "[[sewer gas|poo gas]]".

Peripheral powers come and go: Freakazoid once developed [[telekinesis]] triggered by anger that was never mentioned again after the episode, and once crossed the globe to yell at a Tibetan monk for raking too loudly, but apologizes to him later in the same plot. He also has the ability to assume the form of [[electricity]] and cover long distances instantaneously, although he just as often simply sticks his arms forward and runs while making swooshing sounds with his mouth, pretending to fly.

Dexter can change into and out of Freakazoid at will with the words "Freak out!" and "Freak in!". When not in Freakazoid mode, Dexter looks and acts completely normal, and his family is unaware that anything has happened to him. Freakazoid spends this time in an area of Dexter's brain called the Freakazone, where he reflects, has profound thoughts, and watches reruns of ''[[The Rat Patrol]]''.

While the show's setting is set around [[Washington, D.C.]], the locale often varies with the show's humor, taking Freakazoid to locations around the world as needed.

==Characters==
* '''Freakazoid''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&amp;nbsp;– The protagonist of the series. He was once [[geek]]y 16-year-old computer ace named '''Dexter Douglas''' (voiced by [[David Kaufman (actor)|David Kaufman]]) who became Freakazoid from an overloaded Pinnacle chip inside his computer. He attends [[Harry Connick, Jr.|Harry Connick]] High School. To transform into Freakazoid, Dexter says "Freak out!". To change back into Dexter, Freakazoid says "Freak in!". Dexter and Freakazoid sometimes identify as separate identities, and other times consider themselves to be the same person. Catchphrase:  "Aw, nut bunnies!"

===The Douglas family===
* '''Duncan Douglas''' (voiced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0340359/ Googy Gress])&amp;nbsp;– Dexter's older brother. He is a bully towards Dexter, and is portrayed as a caricature of a high school jock.
* '''Debbie Douglas''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&amp;nbsp;– Dexter's mother. She has no clue that her son is Freakazoid, and is in general blithe and clueless. Her lines often involve morose subjects delivered in a cheery tone, a parody of a stereotypical domestic mother.
* '''Douglas Douglas''' (voiced by [[John P. McCann]])&amp;nbsp;– Dexter's father. An automobile dealer who thinks a goblin lives in the gas tank of his car. Occasionally used for laughs as a stereotypical technologically inept father figure.
* '''Mr. Chubbikins''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&amp;nbsp;– The Douglas' [[morbid obesity|morbidly obese]] cat that was formerly named Mr. Chubbskins. He jumped on Dexter's keyboard while chasing a butterfly, accidentally typing in the key sequence which activated the Pinnacle chip's flaw, turning Dexter into Freakazoid.

===Allies===
* '''Sgt. Mike Cosgrove''' (voiced by [[Edward Asner]])&amp;nbsp;– A heavyset, gruff [[police|cop]] with a heart of gold, who is friends with Freakazoid and several other characters. He speaks in a gruff [[monotone (disambiguation)|monotone]] and shows very little enthusiasm for anything. By pointing at something and saying "Cut it out", he has the almost supernatural ability to get people to stop whatever they are doing on command, no matter what they may be doing at the time, be it panicking at the sight of a villain, stealing a television, or attempting to capture Cosgrove and Freakazoid (in the ''[[Animaniacs]]'' comic series, he even once managed to get [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]] to "Cut it out", something many had tried, and failed, to do). Cosgrove also possesses the odd power of finding Freakazoid no matter where he is by driving his police car to that particular location. He often interrupts Freakazoid's heroic endeavors to ask him to visit various entertainments, such as the "Honey Harvest Festival" or "a bear riding a motorcycle" which Freakazoid always enthusiastically agrees to, no matter what he is doing at the time. During this visit, Cosgrove inevitably reveals important information about the plot of the episode, including the villain's location or evil deeds. Freakazoid then rushes off to foil the villain's scheme, leaving Cosgrove to enjoy the attraction for himself. Sgt. Cosgrove also resembles his voice actor.
* '''Roddy MacStew''' (voiced by [[Craig Ferguson]])&amp;nbsp;– Freakazoid's mentor, and expositionist; an ill-tempered Scotsman who once worked for Guitierrez. He first found that the Pinnacle chip was flawed. In the continuation of ''The Chip'' (detailing how Freakazoid gained his powers) he was trapped in the Internet. He was later kicked out of the Internet by Guitierrez and resumed his mentor role. Favorite word: "Crud!"
* '''Steff''' (voiced by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746617/ Tracy Rowe])&amp;nbsp;– Freakazoid's perky blonde girlfriend; her real name is Stephanie. She discovers Freakazoid's secret identity when Cosgrove accidentally points it out aloud in ''Mission: Freakazoid''.
* '''Hans''' (voiced by [[Larry Cedar]])&amp;nbsp;– A mysterious agent with a Western European accent, who takes Freakazoid to Professor Heiney's lab.
* '''Professor Heiney''' (voiced by [[Ed Gilbert (actor)|Ed Gilbert]])&amp;nbsp;– A scientist, with a lab in the mountains, who Freakazoid often goes to for help. He does research on monsters, zaps them and is often attacked by them at his lab.
* '''Ingmar'''&amp;nbsp;– Freakazoid's mute butler, in charge of the maintenance of the Freakalair (according to Freakazoid, he constructed it himself from scratch). He quit in ''Mission: Freakazoid'' to become a [[rodeo clown]] and was replaced by Professor Jones. A [[parody|take-off]] on Bernardo, the mute manservant of [[Zorro]] and [[Batman]]'s butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]].
* '''Professor Jones''' (voiced by [[Jonathan Harris]])&amp;nbsp;– A snooty, cowardly manservant, essentially recreating his role as Doctor Zachary Smith from ''[[Lost in Space]]'' (every time Jones appears in a scene, someone asks him if he was "on a TV show with a robot"). He is the replacement to the Freakalair's previous butler, and old friends with him. Does not get along with Cosgrove well and gets little respect from Freakazoid, or anyone else.
* '''[[Joe Leahy]]''' (voiced by himself)&amp;nbsp;– The show's very vocal announcer, who sometimes gets more involved than the job usually requires.
* '''Freakazette'''&amp;nbsp;– Only mentioned in the first episode for a brief verse during the "Freakazoid and Friends" theme song (which plays to the same theme as ''[[Animaniacs]]'').
* '''Foamy the Freakadog''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&amp;nbsp;– A vicious, rabid dog which Freakazoid had freed from the pound. Foamy is painted blue, has a Freakazoid costume (complete with hair), and is prone to maul and/or beat Freakazoid to a pulp even on their missions.
* '''Handman''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&amp;nbsp;– Freakazoid's brief "right hand man". He is quite literally just a painted face on Freakazoid's hand who has great difficulty pronouncing Freakazoid's name correctly. Fell in love with and married Freakazoid's left hand.
* '''Expendable Lad'''&amp;nbsp;– Freakazoid's brief sidekick from the start of ''And Fanboy was his Name''. He was taken to the hospital due to injuries sustained from Milk Man's attack that gave him a bruised [[clavicle]]. Expendable Lad was subsequently released from the service of Freakazoid.
* '''[[Norm Abram]]'''&amp;nbsp;– He was kidnapped by The Lobe to make a wooden instrument to destroy Freakazoid, but got free and helped turn the tables against Lobe and his villain allies. Abram supplied his own voice and trademark line for the episode.
* '''[[Leonard Maltin]]'''&amp;nbsp;– He was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico during the episode ''Island of Dr. Mystico'', while Maltin was giving his opinion of the same episode. Freakazoid points out that Mystico's prisoners all have superpowers, and Mr. Maltin's is that he knows every movie ever made. Maltin provided his own voice for the episode.
* '''[[Henry Kissinger]]''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]])&amp;nbsp;– A politician who was kidnapped by Dr. Mystico's "orangu-men". In the show, he speaks in a low, groggy, incomprehensible mumble. He is briefly mentioned in one episode after his only appearance.

===Enemies===
''Freakazoid!'' features a number of campy villains and enemies, including:

* '''The Lobe''' (voiced by [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]])&amp;nbsp;– Freakazoid's archenemy. He is a supergenius whose entire head appears to be a giant brain. Despite his high intellect, he has very low self-esteem, once even having a scheme foiled by Freakazoid simply insulting the plan, despite actually being impressed by it. No background information of any kind is given for The Lobe; not even his real name is revealed.
* '''Cobra Queen''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&amp;nbsp;– Audrey Manatee is a former [[shoplifting|shoplifter]] whose encounter with an experimental cosmetic left in the sun too long transformed her into a cobra woman, with command over [[snake]]s and other [[reptile]]s. In later episodes, Cave Guy and Cobra Queen are a couple. She has a lair in the sewers, and often complained about the lack of light until Freakazoid suggested getting [[Japanese lantern]]s. He defeated her when she faints while trying to say "Silly Sally Sells Sappy Seashells in Seattle" (he later wonders how that worked). Cobra Queen also shows up as part of the team in ''Mission: Freakazoid''. She seems to be offended when compared to [[Sylvester the Cat]].
* '''Cave Guy''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] impersonating [[Jim Backus]])&amp;nbsp;– A thuggish blue [[caveman]] with upper-class diction, education, and taste who speaks in a stereotypical [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] tone (see [[Locust Valley lockjaw]]). His real name is Royce Mumphry and he subscribes to ''[[The New Yorker]]''. He also seems to have an odd fear of [[Klingons]] (possibly because of the made-up language they use).
* '''Longhorn''' (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]])&amp;nbsp;– Formerly Jubal "Bull" Nixon, he was once an employee of the "Johnny Cat" cat litter company until he turned to a life of crime. Because he was searched for by law enforcement so frequently, he had [[plastic surgery]] to turn himself into a humanoid [[Texas Longhorn]]. Freakazoid points out that this did not prevent him from showing up on ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' every week). He loves [[country music]] and, despite being a lousy songwriter, is determined to get a recording contract in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. He also owns a massive truck, nicknamed "Bessie Mae", which is outfitted with all kinds of devices.
** '''Turk''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]])&amp;nbsp;– Longhorn's sidekick.
* '''Armondo Guitierrez''' (voiced by [[Ricardo Montalbán]])&amp;nbsp;– The eyepatch-wearing man whose company Apex Microchips (not to be confused with [[Apex Digital]]) designed the faulty Pinnacle chip responsible for Freakazoid's creation as well as Freakazoid's first enemy. Physically, Guitierrez resembles [[Ricardo Montalbán]], who provides the character's voice as well. At times, he shows similarities to [[Khan Noonien Singh]] from ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''; also played by Montalban. One of his recurring jokes is demanding others to laugh with him. When he fell to his supposed doom, he asked Freakazoid to scream with him. Originally a normal human being, he briefly gains powers similar to Freakazoid's by exploiting the Pinnacle chip's flaw. By "Hero Boy," he appears as a cyborg in a hooded robe to cover his cybernetic side caused by Freakazoid knocking him into a cyber-pit. He hates being called a weenie to which he will angrily respond "I am not a weenie! It is YOU who are the weenie!." In "Normadeus," Guitierrez is among the villains invited by Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid. Lobe commented that he never got an opportunity to be in the same room as Guitierrez before.
** '''Jocko''' - Armando Guitierrez' henchman.
* '''Candle Jack''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&amp;nbsp;– A supernatural villain with a burlap sack over his head, called "the Boogeyman, the for-real one" in the series. He [[Kidnapping|abducts]] anyone who says his name and ties them up with rope, apparently because "he's a nut." Although he prides himself on being scary, he has a weakness for pie and also seems to enjoy watching ''[[F Troop]]''. During "Island of Dr. Mystico," Freakazoid and Cosgrove have him chase around and scare Professor Jones.
* '''Waylon Jeepers''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]])&amp;nbsp;– A creepy little man originally from Venice Beach, CA who created the [[Medusa]] Watch, which has the power to turn people (and pigeons) into stone. He has also created a similar device that turned [[beaver]]s into gold, and once summoned the demon, ''Vorn the Unspeakable'', with the help of a book entitled ''How to Summon Monsters the E-Z Way.'' His schemes seem to deeply infuriate Freakazoid and Jeepers is the shown to be the only villain Freakazoid genuinely does not like (whereas the rest of the villains appear to have a friendly relationship with Freakazoid off-battle), once going on a long (and unscripted) rant. His name is a play on the name of famous country guitarist [[Waylon Jennings]].
* '''Invisibo''' (voiced by [[Corey Burton]] impersonating [[Vincent Price]])&amp;nbsp;– Real name Ahmon Kor-Unch. An invisible, smart-mouthed [[pharaoh]] who is only visible via the [[Anubis]] staff he carries. While he was sealed away inside a sarcophagus, Duncan pushing Dexter into his sarcophagus resulted in the sarcophagus' seal being broken, enabling Invisibo to be free to resume his crime spree. Freakazoid gave Invisibo his name because "you're invisible and it's my show and we already had a [[title card]] made up and it makes me happy!" Invisibo accepts the name, saying it has a "somewhat sinister ring to it." Freakazoid defeated Invisibo by destroying his staff and locking him back into his sarcophagus which is taken away by the authorities. In "Normadeus," Invisibo regained his invisible abilities and is among the villains invited by Lobe to witness the destruction of Freakazoid where Lobe gave him a party hat to be visible.
* '''The Nerdator''' (voiced by [[Aron Kincaid]])&amp;nbsp;– A man who planned to kidnap all the [[nerd]]s in the world (which also included [[Steven Spielberg]]) and absorb their knowledge to become a "Super-Nerd". His plan succeeded until Freakazoid convinced him of the downsides of being a nerd. Nerdator discontinued his plot. He was last seen kidnapping "good-looking, but vapid airheads". His character design is a parody of the [[Predator (alien)|Predator]].
* '''Vorn the Unspeakable''' (voiced by [[Richard Moll]])&amp;nbsp;– A demon summoned by Jeepers, who bears a resemblance to [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu]].
* '''Arms Akimbo''' (voiced by [[John Schuck]] impersonating [[Edward G. Robinson]])&amp;nbsp;– A spoiled [[model (person)|model]] turned [[extortion]]ist who, after years of posing, was left with his arms frozen in a jaunty pose, hands on hips. When fighting, he strikes with his oversized elbows. His first appearance is in a local shop selling "oops insurance", a form of [[protection racket]]eering which mainly consists of him breaking something of value (or causing a building to detonate spectacularly), before comically following it up with a small "oops".
* '''Milk Man'''&amp;nbsp;– Only shown/mentioned in the episode ''And Fanboy was his Name''. Shown on a news report in a pitched battle with Freakazoid and his then-[[sidekick]], Expendable Lad. As the name implies, he uses milk as his theme.
* '''Deadpan''' (voiced by [[Bebe Neuwirth]])&amp;nbsp;– A plain-looking (almost blank-faced) female supervillain with a monotonous voice. She is a [[shapeshifter]] who once tried to conquer Washington by transforming into Freakazoid, but this plan was quickly foiled when the real Freakazoid appeared immediately after and nonchalantly pointed her out. She had only one appearance in the cold opening for ''The Wrath of Guitierrez''.
* '''Mary Beth''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]])&amp;nbsp;– Cosgrove's former girlfriend, cosmetics executive, and monster. She is short tempered and when angered, turns green and develops a deep raspy voice, and often lights candles by shooting flame from her nose. Her plan to steal Freakazoid's hero essence to remain immortal is foiled and, as a result, she shrivels, dies, and becomes a pile of dust. Her name is a play off of the cosmetics giant [[Mary Kay]].
* '''Janos Ivnovels''' (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]])&amp;nbsp;– The ruthless dictator of Vuka Nova and minister of state security. He is responsible for capturing Freakazoid's family (and a mime) and imprisoning them in the High-Security Wing of Chesky Beresch Prison, the toughest prison in Europe. His subordinate Colonel Anton Mohans and him were defeated after Freakazoid and his friends rescued the Douglas Family (and the mime). Janos and Anton were last seen being tortured by the mime and his pals. He is a one-time villain, having appeared in ''Mission: Freakazoid!''.
** '''Colonel Anton Mohans''' (voiced by [[Larry Cedar]])&amp;nbsp;– A vicious thug who finds it relaxing when Janos tortures his prisoners.
* '''Dr. Mystico''' (voiced by [[Tim Curry]])&amp;nbsp;– A mad scientist who turns orangutans into human-like beings (and vice versa) in parody of H. G. Wells's ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]''. He seeks to take over the world, though he always seems to say Cleveland instead. He has a white cat, similar to [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. His first name may actually be Wendell, since he once says, ''"They called me mad, insane, Wendell!"''. He also bears a striking resemblance to his voice actor Tim Curry.
* '''Kid Carrion''' (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]])&amp;nbsp;– A zombie cowboy who was never named, and only appeared in "Relax-o-Vision" and "The Lobe". He can be seen in the opening credits standing next to Candle Jack. He bears a passing resemblance to the revamped version of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] from [[Bruce Timm]]'s ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', yet seems to be a parody of the villain Tex Hex from the 1987 [[Filmation]] cartoon series ''[[Bravestarr]]''.
* '''Eye-of-Newt'''&amp;nbsp;– A strange one-eyed creature with a hairstyle resembling [[Newt Gingrich]]'s; his name is a reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' ("Eye of newt and toe of frog..."). He has no dialogue and is a background villain, although it seems he is frequently recaptured by heroes like Freakazoid or the Huntsman.

===Other characters===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Fanboy]] --&gt;
A few characters fall somewhere in the space between "enemies" and "allies" to land squarely in the category of "nuisances."

* '''Mo-Ron/Bo-Ron''' (voiced by [[Stan Freberg]])&amp;nbsp;– An obese and dimwitted [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the [[planet]] Barone's. His name was later changed to ''Bo-Ron'', to appease network censors' concerns that use of the word [[Moron (psychology)|moron]] might be offensive.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In one episode Lord Bravery refers to him as "Mo-Ron or... Bo-Ron, whatever." Is a parody of Ro-Man, the ridiculous-looking monster from the notoriously bad science fiction film ''[[Robot Monster]]''. His first appearance was when he tried to deliver Earth an ”important message”, only to forget what it was. This message turned out to be a comet heading towards Earth which caused everybody to flee the area. He also appeared in an episode that was a parody of ''[[E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]''.
* '''Fanboy''' (voiced by [[Stephen Furst]])&amp;nbsp;– An obese, acne-stricken, socially awkward [[Fan (aficionado)#Fanboy|fanboy]] (hence his name) and would-be sidekick to Freakazoid who obsesses about numerous comic books, TV shows, and movies from ''[[The Black Hole]]'' to ''[[Star Wars]]''. Fanboy's age is never specified. He could be anywhere between his late teens to early thirties. He bumped into [[George Takei]] at a comic book shop and gave chase, causing Takei to run into traffic and nearly getting hit by three cars.
* '''[[Bill Clinton]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) and '''[[Hillary Clinton]]''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) make frequent cameos in the show, partly because Dexter Douglas lives in [[Washington, D.C.]]
* '''[[Barbra Streisand]]''' also makes a number of appearances, most notably in the episode "Dexter's Date", which features a parody of ''[[Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!]]''.
* '''Hero Boy''' (voiced by [[John P. McCann]])&amp;nbsp;– The title character from Freakazoid's favorite TV show that is first shown in the episode of the same name. Hero Boy has no powers (save for flying) and his black and white show is a parody of the [[animated series]] [[Astro Boy (1960s)|Astro Boy]]. Hero Boy has the catchphrase "I must succeed!", though he is invariably shrugged off by the monsters he fights including the giant ones when his pathetic fighting techniques (consisting of weakly pounding on the enemies) fail miserably.
* '''[[Steven Spielberg]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]])&amp;nbsp;– The show's executive producer. His most notable appearance was in part of an episode where Freakazoid, The Brain from ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and Wakko Warner from ''[[Animaniacs]]'' get into a disagreement over which of their shows he likes best (only for Spielberg to ask, "Who are you people?"). In "The Nerdator", Steven Spielberg is among the nerds that are captured by Nerdator. During this time, he was directing a sequel to ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' called ''E.T. Returns''.
* '''[[Paul Harvey]]''' (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]])&amp;nbsp;– A loud, obnoxious man who often interrupts the story to give background information on a villain (as seen in episodes featuring Cobra Queen and Longhorn), or to describe, rather than show, the ending of an episode (demonstrated in "Candle Jack"). He is a parody of the radio personality of the same name, and even borrows the catchphrase "the rest of the story" from the real Harvey.
* '''Lonnie Tallbutt''' (voiced by [[Mitch Schauer]] in human form, [[Jim Cummings]] in werewolf form)&amp;nbsp;– A [[werewolf]] that begs Dexter for help. His name is a combination of that of [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] and Lawrence Talbot, the character Chaney played in the 1941 movie ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]''. He is prone to grabbing people's shirt collars and yelling "You don't understand!"

[[File:Emmitt-Nervend.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The elusive Emmitt Nervend, who is often only seen briefly between frames of animation on the show.]]
* '''Emmitt Nervend''' – A short, hunchbacked man with straw-like hair and a frozen grimace who usually shows up at least once an episode, always in the opening credits, but usually in the background. He stands looking at the camera (as pictured), never saying a word. Sometimes things happen to him directly, like him standing outside a restaurant collecting donations while dressed as Santa Claus and ringing a bell, birds pecking his head, or laser beams shooting just above his head. The [[end credits]] will often contain a credit revealing how many times Emmitt can be found in a particular episode. His appearance was drawn by [[Mitch Schauer]].
* '''Weena Mercator as The Hopping Woman'''&amp;nbsp;– A person acknowledged whenever credits are used in an episode. Note that no episode or sketch has ever featured a hopping woman. Her name also appears with multiple spellings. "Mercator" in "Dance of Doom" and "Mercatur" in "The Cloud."

===Mini-segments===
''Freakazoid!'' also features several mini-segments, primarily during the first season. Each of these have their own theme songs, title cards and cast, and only rarely "cross over" into the continuity of the main show. These segments include:

* '''Lord Bravery'''&amp;nbsp;– Nigel Skunkthorpe (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]] impersonating [[John Cleese]]) is a superhero from the United Kingdom in an outfit slightly resembling that of a [[Rome|Roman]] soldier. He does not do much in the way of superheroism; in fact, he is very snooty, cynical and unwilling to do unpleasant tasks in the course of his duties such as entering a sewer to perform a rescue. Likewise, he gets little respect and recognition as a superhero from the general public and even his wife and mother-in-law, with whom he lives, and is generally a laughing stock of superheroes. At one point he loses his name due to a trademark dispute with a bakery of the same name, after which he changes his name to ''Lord Smoked Meats and Fishes''. Has been mistaken for a party clown. His theme song is delivered in the style of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s song "A British Tar".
* '''The Huntsman'''&amp;nbsp;– The Huntsman (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a good guess at what [[Robin Hood]] would be like if portrayed by [[Charlton Heston]]. He can never find enough crime to fight and secretly suspects that the police are hiding crimes from him because they do not trust him (it is also possible that he was so good at being a superhero that his villains simply gave up). He was once a hunter called Marty Feeb who saved a chunky [[elf]] from being eaten by a [[crow]]. The elf rewarded Marty Feeb with a magic sack of corn. Upon eating it, he was granted strength, speed, and shining teeth, and became the Huntsman. He also has a brother called Hector Feeb, who he claims lives in a [[townhouse]]. Huntsman can be summoned by a policeman blowing into the Horn of Urgency on top of the local police station, and his battle cry is "Into action!". When he appears before Lt. Artie King (voiced by [[Dorian Harewood]]), the Huntsman is told in those two episodes that either a rookie mistakenly blew the horn or the blowing of the horn was a false alarm. Possibly a parody of comic character [[Green Arrow]]. His trademark phrase is "Darn, the luck, darn!" His sketches are often themed around beginning with a lengthy, overly heroic opener, with a title that would indicate an action-oriented episode, that ends up being a short anticlimactic skit of the Huntsman not being needed. In one of his episodes, it was mentioned that he had fought Lobe and Cave Guy, and he is shown fighting Cave Guy and Candle Jack in his opening. Huntsman was once seen as the umpire during the ''Superheroes/Villain All-Star Benefit Softball Game''. When Freakazoid, Arms Akimbo, and Cave Guy both asked his opinion on a play, he responded that he had looked away to have some berry water and did not see if the play was an out or a safe.
* '''The Lawn Gnomes'''&amp;nbsp;– Baffeardin (voiced by [[Clive Revill]]), Huska (voiced by [[Carl Ballantine]]), Honna (voiced by [[Rose Marie]]), and Quist (voiced by [[Larry Gelman]]) are a group of gnomes-turned-lawn gnomes that come to life at night in a parody of the ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' animated series. Infamous for their mischief back in A.D. 995, they were advised by the Great Mystic Gnome (voiced by [[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) to change their ways before it gets worse for them. After planning to do so in a week, the four gnomes were cursed to become stone by day by the powerful wizard Rathgar (voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]) after they played a prank on him and previously attacked his younger Viking brother Erik the Large (also voiced by Maurice LaMarche). They would revert at night during which time they were given the opportunity to mend their ways to fight evil alongside mankind, after which the curse would be lifted. During this one-time sketch, Freakazoid did his commentary on it.
* '''Toby Danger'''&amp;nbsp;– A (somewhat) loving parody of ''[[Jonny Quest]]'', featuring the voices of [[Scott Menville]], [[Don Messick]] (in his last role before he died), and [[Granville Van Dusen]] (all of whom provided voices for ''JQ''), that was originally written by [[Tom Minton]] as a twelve-minute stand-alone short for ''[[Animaniacs]]'', but slotted into ''Freakazoid!'' after that series was greenlighted and had an eight-minute opening. The completed twelve-minute '''Toby Danger''' storyboard was trimmed by director Eric Radomski to fit into the available ''Freakazoid!'' time slot.
* '''Fatman and Boy Blubber'''&amp;nbsp;– The misadventures of two morbidly obese superheroes (voiced by Marc Drotman and [[Paul Rugg]] respectively), in a parody of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series. Their only segment involves them coming to the aid of Louis, an overweight boy who loves sweet buns and is being tormented by bullies. After attempting to capture the bullies, and failing due to their extreme lack of physical fitness, Fatman and Boy Blubber deliver a pseudo-inspirational speech to Louis about their own struggles with being overweight, and how they often end up eating fast food and snacks instead of having sensible meals. When Louis asks what the point of the speech is, Fatman changes the subject to ask if Louis has any more sweet buns in his lunchbox; the hero then tries to confiscate the food (it is unclear whether he is attempting to prevent Louis from gaining more weight, or simply wants the sweet bun for himself), and begins beating Louis up with Boy Blubber when the boy refuses to give it to them. Fatman also makes an appearance during "Hero Boy" where it is revealed the episode is also a storybook being read by Fatman to children.

==Production==

===Voicing===
The voice actors of the show ''Freakazoid!'' included various actors from other television series and films. [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Maurice LaMarche]], [[Jeff Bennett]], and [[Frank Welker]], who all provided voices in the series ''[[Animaniacs]]'', were on ''Freakazoid!''.  Actors [[Ed Asner]], [[Ricardo Montalbán]], [[Larry Cedar]], [[Jonathan Harris]], and [[Stephen Furst]] also provided voices for the series. Also, writers [[John P. McCann]] and [[Paul Rugg]] (who played Freakazoid) added voices themselves.

Casting for the show had been difficult for the ''Freakazoid!'' staff, as no lead character had been found even after extensive auditions.&lt;ref name="Rugg"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Rogers| first =Brett| year =1996| title =Freaking Out With Paul Rugg| periodical =Animato!| publisher =| issue =36| url =http://members.aol.com/baltohoya/rugg.htm| accessdate =2007-06-29| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;| deadurl =bot: unknown| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071104024703/http://members.aol.com/baltohoya/rugg.htm| archivedate =2007-11-04| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, when writer [[Paul Rugg]] was brought to demonstrate the voice in a recording session, he ended up filling the role, as he said: "I went in there and did it. Then they played it for [[Steven Spielberg]] and he said 'Yep! Fine, sure, great,' and then I panicked ... and I had to do it."&lt;ref name = "Rugg"/&gt;  Rugg played the role of Freakazoid through the entire series run.

==Controversy with Mike Allred's ''Madman''==

Cartoonist [[Mike Allred]] has criticized the show and its lead character as [[plagiarism]] of his [[comic book]] ''[[Madman (Image Comics)|Madman]]'',&lt;ref name="madman"/&gt; asserting that the title characters share several personality traits, and wear similar costumes featuring a chest emblem including an exclamation mark. During the short run of the show, Allred remained relatively silent on the subject, but in 2003, he responded to a question about the show on the message board of his official website:

{{quote|text=[Show creator] [[Bruce Timm]] was kind enough to tell me that ''Madman'' was a direct inspiration for the show, with comics open and referred to when developing the show.

Stupidly, I was flattered; happy to inspire anything. But when the show came out, with no acknowledgement or credit or any kind of compensation, I slowly became annoyed as everyone and their uncle confronted me with "there's this cartoon that's ripping off ''Madman''" and "you oughta sue".

I simply wrote a friendly letter to [show producer] [[Steven Spielberg]] telling him his production was a direct lift of my creation, I had no intention of creating ripples, I just wanted him to know that I knew. No one replied, which is fine. And to be honest, ''Madman'' is an amalgam of a half a dozen other influences. So who am I to complain (the exclamation mark on the chest still kinda urks ''[sic]'' me a little though. A little too close for comfort).&lt;ref name="madman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicscommunity.com/boards/allred/?noframes;read=9834 |title=Re: Freakazoid |first=Mike |last=Allred |work=Mike Allred Message Board |date=2003-11-07 |accessdate=2007-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728122015/http://www.comicscommunity.com/boards/allred/?noframes%3Bread=9834 |archivedate=July 28, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Humor==
The humor in ''Freakazoid!'' relied heavily on [[slapstick]], [[parody]] and pop cultural references. Due to the series being [[metafiction]], much of the series was self-aware humor (i.e. [[Fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]]); for instance, after the first appearance of the Freakmobile, the show goes immediately into an impromptu commercial for a toy version, and later in the episode, Freakazoid addresses an audience, congratulating the staff on how hard they have worked to make the show [[toyetic]]. A typically strange running gag involves a repeated credit for "Weena Mercator as the Hopping Woman", though no such character appears in any episode. Her credit is usually preceded by a number of other fictional names and followed by a fictional director. The show also incorporated humor aimed at the then-newly founded [[The WB|WB Network]], such as questioning the meaning of the initials "WB", e.g., "Weird Butt" or "Wet Bananas" instead of Warner Bros.

''Freakazoid!'' made frequent use of [[stock footage]], including the peaceful scene of a field of flowers ("Relax-O-Vision"), numerous people screaming ("Scream-O-Vision"), traditionally dressed [[Bavaria]]ns dancing and slapping each other, a [[Frank "Cannonball" Richards|man being shot in the belly with a cannonball]] and a man wrestling a bear.

[[Cameo appearance]]s were also a major element of the show's humor. At various times, ''Freakazoid!'' hosted appearances by characters from other [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] such as ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'' and even an insinuation appearance of the ''[[Batman]]'' from Bruce Timm's [[Batman: The Animated Series|animated version]], which has a similar drawing style (its concept of old movie-style title cards at the beginning of each episode was also replicated in ''Freakazoid!''). Portrayals of many celebrities (including producer [[Steven Spielberg]]) and guest appearances by such figures as [[Jack Valenti]], [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Mark Hamill]] as themselves were also commonplace. [[Norm Abram]] had an entire episode, "Normadeus", built around him. One original character, a bizarre-looking man named Emmitt Nervend, plays no role whatsoever other than enabling a ''[[Where's Waldo? (video game)|Where's Waldo]]''-esque hunt for his constant cameos (complete with the number of his appearances announced in the closing credits).

One of the show's longest cameo appearances was when [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot#Wakko Warner|Wakko]] (from ''[[Animaniacs]]'') and [[List of Animaniacs characters#Pinky and the Brain|Brain]] (from ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'') appeared in a scene in which they argue with Freakazoid over which of their shows is [[Steven Spielberg]]'s favorite, with Freakazoid arguing that his show was the favorite because "we got a memo". (''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' was not represented in the discussion as it was on [[Nickelodeon]] at the time, while the others were on [[Kids' WB]].) However, when the trio confronts Steven over the issue, he simply replies: "Who are you people?".

==History==

===Creation===
''Freakazoid'' was created by animator [[Bruce Timm]], who had previously produced ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and [[Paul Dini]], who was a story editor for ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"&gt;
{{cite video| people = [[Tom Ruegger]], [[Bruce Timm]] | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid: Season 1. Special Features: The Original Freak | medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Home Video | date = 2008 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Timm was called upon by [[Steven Spielberg]], who Timm said "liked" Timm's ''Batman'' series, to help create a new superhero show.&lt;ref name=Timm&gt;{{Cite news| last =Lamken | first = Saner | year =2000 | title = The Ever-Lovin' Blue-Eyed Timm! Bruce Timm Interviewed by Brian Saner Lamken | periodical = Comicology | publisher = TwoMorrows| issue= 1 | url =http://www.twomorrows.com/comicology/articles/01timm.html| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060604020156/http://www.twomorrows.com/comicology/articles/01timm.html| archivedate =2006-06-04| accessdate=| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a meeting with Spielberg, Timm said that Spielberg had "really liked" the idea for the series,&lt;ref name=Timm/&gt;  after which Timm and Dini created the character Freakazoid, an edgy superhero with a manic personality.  Timm came up with the name for the character naturally, as he recalled, "The name 'Freakazoid' just kind of jumped out of me, I don't even know where from. I said 'Oh, yeah, 'Freakazoid', that might be an interesting name.'"&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;

Timm originally created ''Freakazoid'' to be a serious "adventure show" with some comedic undertones.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;  However, his initial idea for the series did not come to be, as he stated:

{{quote|text=I don't mind that it's not on my résumé. [Laughs] I bailed on it really early. It started out as an adventure show, but it ended up turning into more and more of a comedy show; every time we'd have a meeting with Steven, the concept would kinda [sic] change, and it kept leaning more and more towards zany comedy. It really started out almost like [[Spider-Man]], on that level of, like, a teenage superhero. And it reached a point where it became a comedy with the ''Tiny Toon Adventures''/''[[Animaniacs]]'' kind of humor. (...) I don't have anything against that; I just don't have a flair for it, so I bailed—I just hung out here while my staff had to do the show. [Laughs]&lt;ref name=Timm/&gt;}}

After Timm left the series, [[Tom Ruegger]], who developed other Spielberg series ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' and ''Animaniacs'', was brought in to redevelop the series Timm had created "from the ground up".&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt; Ruegger's version of the series used some of Timm's designs and concepts, but Timm said that the series was "radically altered" to become the comedy series that was more to Spielberg's liking.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;

Ruegger then began writing stories for the series, and came up with a pile of very short segments. Spielberg liked what Ruegger had written, but wanted longer stories for the series as well.  Ruegger then asked writers [[John P. McCann|John McCann]] and [[Paul Rugg]] to come onto the series to write longer, more elaborate stories for the series and, according to Rugg, "(...) figure out what this [''Freakazoid!''] was going to be, and the answer was like, 'We didn't know', and still don't".&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;

===Premiere, cancellation, and syndication===
{{Main|List of Freakazoid! episodes}}
''Freakazoid'' premiered on [[Kids' WB]]'s Saturday lineup on September 9, 1995.&lt;ref name="comedy"/&gt;  During its run, ''Freakazoid'' came across problems of appealing to its target demographic, young children.  [[Tom Ruegger]] said that ''Freakazoid'' had done poorly in ratings because the audience that the series gathered was older than the target audience.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;  Also, ''Freakazoid'' ran into timeslot problems. Writer [[John P. McCann|John McCann]] said that the timeslot of the series changed frequently: "They put it at eight o' clock in the morning, 3:30 in the afternoon, they shifted it all around; we couldn't even find it, and we wrote the thing".&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;  The series ran on [[Kids' WB]] until February 14, 1997, when it was canceled due to poor ratings, airing only one complete season and part of a second season.&lt;ref name="comedy"/&gt; The series won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Special Class Animated Program.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/freakazoid/cast/201491|title= Freakazoid! on WB: 1995, TV Show |publisher = TV Guide|accessdate=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugg said the series' demise was the result of a combination of people not understanding the series, timeslot changes, appealing to the wrong demographics, and that "(...) there aren't a lot of [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen boxes]] in federal prisons.  Had there been, I'm telling you, we'd still be on the air today".&lt;ref name="dvdint1"/&gt;  [[Bruce Timm]] said that the series still has a cult following of fans who ask him questions about the series whenever they meet him.

However, the show was later picked up by [[Cartoon Network]] and was rebroadcast from April 5, 1997 until March 29, 2003.&lt;ref name="comedy"/&gt; The series had a total number of 24 episodes.  In 2006, ''Freakazoid!'' was one of the shows scheduled to be broadcast on the AOL broadband channel, [[In2TV]].&lt;ref name="in2tv"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1220659,00.html |title= AOL to Launch New Video Portal |work= Time Warner Newsroom |publisher= Time Warner |date= 2006-07-31 |accessdate= 2007-06-29 |deadurl= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070802060125/http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1220659,00.html |archivedate= 2007-08-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gray219.png|thumb|upright|An illustration from the American 1918 edition]]
'''''Gray's Anatomy''''' is an [[English language]] textbook of [[human anatomy]] originally written by [[Henry Gray]] and illustrated by [[Henry Vandyke Carter]]. Earlier editions were called '''''Anatomy: Descriptive and Surgical''''' and '''''Gray's Anatomy: Descriptive and Applied''''', but the book's name is commonly shortened to, and later editions are titled, ''Gray's Anatomy''. The book is widely regarded as an extremely influential work on the subject, and has continued to be revised and republished from its initial publication in 1858 to the present day. The latest edition of the book, the 41st, was published in September 2015.

== Publication history ==
[[File:Henry Gray bw photo portrait.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Gray]]]]

=== Origins ===
The [[English people|English]] anatomist [[Henry Gray]] was born in 1827. He studied the development of the [[Endocrine|endocrine glands]] and [[spleen]] and in 1853 was appointed Lecturer on Anatomy at [[St George's Hospital Medical School]] in [[London]]. In 1855, he approached his colleague [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] with his idea to produce an inexpensive and accessible anatomy textbook for medical students. Dissecting unclaimed bodies from workhouse and hospital [[mortuary|mortuaries]] through the [[Anatomy Act]] of 1832, the two worked for 18 months on what would form the basis of the book. Their work was first published in 1858 by [[John William Parker]] in London.&lt;ref name=Gray1858&gt;{{citation |year=1858 |author1=Gray, Henry  |author2=Carter, Henry Vandyke |title=Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical |url=https://archive.org/stream/anatomydescript09graygoog#page/n7/mode/2up |place=London |publisher=John W. Parker and Son |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was dedicated by Gray to [[Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet]].
An imprint of this English first edition was published in the United States in 1859, with slight alterations.&lt;ref name=Richardson2005&gt;{{citation |year=2005 |author=Richardson, Ruth |chapter=A Historical Introduction to Gray's Anatomy |chapter-url= http://www.graysanatomyonline.com/content/0443066760/suppfiles/HistoricalIntro.pdf |title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice |edition=39th (electronic version) |editor=Susan Standring |page=4 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Elsevier Churchill Livingston |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USedition1859&gt;{{citation |year=1859 |author1=Gray, Henry  |author2=Carter, H.V |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/06220300R |title=Anatomy, descriptive and surgical |place=Philadelphia |publisher=Blanchard and Lea |accessdate=16 October 2011 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;(Per [[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] holdings). Note: This is not the 'American' edition. American rights had yet to be purchased. It is an American publication of the English edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gray prepared a second, revised edition, which was published in the United Kingdom in 1860, also by J.W. Parker.&lt;ref name=Moore2008&gt;{{citation |date=30 March 2008 |author=Moore, Wendy |title=Gray's Anatomy celebrates 150th anniversary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583282/Grays-Anatomy-celebrates-150th-anniversary.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BriefHistoryGrays&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.coursewareobjects.com/marketing/standringtimeline.pdf |title= A brief history of Gray's Anatomy |publisher= ElsevierHealth|accessdate= 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gray died the following year, at the age of&amp;nbsp;34, having contracted [[smallpox]]&lt;ref name=Moore2008/&gt; while treating his nephew (who survived). His death had come just three years after the initial publication of his ''Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical''.
Even so, the work on his much-praised book was continued by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Poynter, F. N.

[[Longman]]'s publication reportedly began in 1863, after their acquisition of the J.W. Parker publishing business.&lt;ref name="LongmanPublication"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www-stage.pearsoned.com/about/history.htm#1800 |title=Longman's 1863 publication of ''Gray's Anatomy'' |work=Pearson Education: History |publisher=[[Pearson Education]] |accessdate=16 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309033200/http://www-stage.pearsoned.com/about/history.htm#1800 |archive-date=9 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with the publication date of the third British edition of ''Gray's Anatomy.''&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritish"&gt;{{citation| title=Gray's Anatomy | editors=Roger Warwick &amp; Peter L. Williams | edition=35th | publisher= Longman |location=London|year=1973}} p. iv (Previous Editions and Editors – listings)&lt;/ref&gt; Successive British editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' continued to be published under the Longman, and more recently [[Churchill Livingstone]]/[[Elsevier]] imprints, reflecting further changes in ownership of the publishing companies over the years.

=== American editions ===
The full American rights were purchased by Blanchard and Lea, who published the first of twenty-five&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This count excludes the previously mentioned 1859 US publication of the English first edition.&lt;/ref&gt; distinct American editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' in 1862, and whose company became [[Lea &amp; Febiger]] in 1908. Lea &amp; Febiger continued publishing the American editions until the company was sold in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehistory.org/hqda/html/v37/v37n2p063.html#LEA Lea &amp; Febiger] in Tredyffrin East Town Historical Society ''History Quarterly'' Digital Archives, pp. 68–70 (Source: April 1999, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 63–70)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first American publication was edited by Richard James Dunglison, whose father [[Robley Dunglison]] was physician to [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jeffline.jefferson.edu/AISR/Forum/03/09/articles/grays.html "Gray's Anatomy: The Jefferson Years"] in ''Jeffline Forum'', September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dunglison edited the next four editions. These were: the ''Second American Edition'' (February 1862); the ''New Third American from the Fifth English Edition'' (May 1870); the ''New American from the Eighth English Edition'' (July 1878); and the ''New American from the Tenth English Edition'' (August 1883). [[William Williams Keen|W. W. Keen]] edited the next two editions, namely: the ''New American from the Eleventh English Edition'' (September 1887); and the ''New American from the Thirteenth English Edition'' (September 1893).

In September 1896, reference to the English edition was dropped and it was published as the ''Fourteenth Edition'', edited by Bern B. Gallaudet, F. J. Brockway, and J. P. McMurrich, who also edited the ''Fifteenth Edition'' (October 1901). There is also an edition dated 1896 which does still reference the English edition stating it is "A New Edition, Thoroughly Revised by American Authorities, from the thirteenth English Edition" and edited by [[Thomas Pickering Pick|T. Pickering Pick]], F.R.C.S. and published by Lea Brothers &amp; Co., Philadelphia and New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Henry Gray's Anatomy Descriptive and Surgical, 1896 13th edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sixteenth Edition'' (October 1905) was edited by J. C. DaCosta, and the ''Seventeenth'' (September 1908) by DaCosta and [[Edward Anthony Spitzka|E. A. Spitzka]]. Spitzka edited the ''Eighteenth'' (Oct. 1910) and ''Nineteenth'' (July 1913) editions, and in October 1913, R. Howden edited the ''New American from the Eighteenth English Edition''.  The "American" editions then continued with consecutive numbering from the Twentieth onwards, with [[Warren Harmon Lewis|W. H. Lewis]] editing the 20th (September. 1918), 21st (August 1924), 22nd (August 1930), 23rd (July 1936), and 24th (May 1942). C. M. Gross edited the 25th (August 1948), 26th (July 1954), 27th (August 1959), 28th (August 1966), and 29th (January 1973). Carmine D. Clemente edited and extensively revised the 30th edition (October 1984).&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy30thAmerican"&gt;{{citation| title=Gray's Anatomy | editor=Carmine D. Clemente | edition=30th | publisher= Lea &amp; Febiger |location=Philadelphia |year=1985|isbn=0-8121-0644-X }} pp. vi–ix&lt;/ref&gt; With the sale of Lea &amp; Febiger in 1990, the 30th edition was the last American Edition.

=== Discrepancies in numbering of American and British editions ===
Sometimes separate editing efforts with mismatches between British and American edition numbering led to the existence, for many years, of two main "flavours" or "branches" of ''Gray's Anatomy'': the U.S. and the British one. This can easily cause misunderstandings and confusion, especially when quoting from or trying to purchase a certain edition. For example, a comparison of publishing histories shows that the American numbering kept roughly apace with the British up until the 16th editions in 1905, with the American editions either acknowledging the English edition, or simply matching the numbering in the 14th, 15th and 16th editions. Then the American numbering crept ahead, with the 17th American edition published in 1908, while the 17th British edition was published in 1909. This increased to a three-year gap for the 18th and 19th editions, leading to the 1913 publication of the ''New American from the Eighteenth English'', which brought the numbering back into line. Both 20th editions were then published in the same year (1918). Thereafter, it was the British numbering that pushed ahead, with the 21st British edition in 1920, and the 21st American edition in 1924. This discrepancy continued to increase, so that the 30th British edition was published in 1949, while the 30th and last American edition was published in 1984.&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy35thBritish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GraysAnatomy30thAmericanvii"&gt;Carmine D. Clemente (1985) p. vi (American Editions of Gray's Anatomy – listings)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Currently available editions ==
[[File:Gray190.png|thumb|upright|An illustration from the American 1918 edition]]
The newest, 41st edition of ''Gray's Anatomy'' was published on 25 September 2015 by [[Elsevier]] in both print and online versions, and is the first edition to have enhanced online content including anatomical videos and a bonus ''Gray's'' imaging library. The 41st edition also has 24 specially invited online commentaries on contemporary anatomical topics such as advances in [[Electron microscope|electron]] and [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescent microscopy]]; the neurovascular bundles of the [[Prostate|prostate]]; [[Stem cells|stem cells]] in [[Regenerative medicine|regenerative medicine]]; the anatomy of facial aging; and technical aspects and applications of [[Diagnostic Radiology|diagnostic radiology]].

All editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' previous to the 39th were organized by [[systemic anatomy]] (i.e. there were separate sections for the body's entire [[skeletal system]], entire [[circulatory system]] and entire [[nervous system]], etc.). The editors of the 39th edition acknowledged the validity of both approaches but switched to regional anatomy by popular demand.&lt;ref name=Grays39eIntroduction&gt;{{citation |year=2004 |title=Gray's Anatomy vol.39e Introduction |url=http://www.graysanatomyonline.com/content/0443066760/suppfiles/HistoricalIntro.pdf |isbn=0-443-06676-0 |accessdate=21 March 2012 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; See p. 9, bottom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older, out-of-copyright editions of the book continue to be reprinted and sold, particularly on the internet. However it is not always clear which (British or American) edition these books are republications of. Many seem to be [[reprint]]s of the 1901 (probably U.S.) edition.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Additionally, there are several sites where various older versions can be read online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henry Gray |url=https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15399118W/Anatomy_descriptive_and_surgical |title=Anatomy, descriptive and surgical |publisher=Open Library |date= |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/ |title=Gray, Henry. 1918.

Although older editions may serve historic and artistic uses because their companion illustrations and anatomical [[cross section (geometry)|cross sections]] are renowned for their rustic and often haunting presentation, they may no longer represent an up-to-date understanding of human anatomy.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Depending on the version at hand, even the suitability of reprints and online versions for artistic purposes may be compromised due to limitations in resolution and reproduction quality.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Gray wrote ''Gray's Anatomy'' with an audience of [[medical student]]s and [[physician]]s in mind, especially [[surgery|surgeon]]s. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy appears to have been to make each edition come close to containing a ''fully comprehensive'' account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in a [[metaphor]]ical and physical sense. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0443045607 Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Medicine and Surgery (British Edition. 38th Ed) (Hardcover)] Amazon&lt;/ref&gt; – the highest page count of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages.&lt;ref name=35thEdDescription&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/grays-anatomy/oclc/2973401 Description of 35th Edition (1973) at WorldCat] Retrieved 21 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The current 41st edition has 1,584 pages.
Newer editions of ''Gray's Anatomy'' – and even several recent older ones – are still considered to be the most comprehensive and detailed textbooks on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-04-10-gray%27s-new-look_x.htm 'Gray's Anatomy' is back after major surgery], By Glenn O'Neal, Posted 4/10/2005, USATODAY.com&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite previous efforts to keep ''Gray's Anatomy'' readable by students, when the 39th edition was published, students were identified as a secondary market for the book,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170212012802/http://www.graysanatomyonline.com/content/0443066760/suppfiles/HistoricalIntro.pdf "cf. page 11"]. {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and companion publications such as ''[[Gray's Anatomy for Students]]'',&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Written by Richard L. Drake, Wayne Vogl and Adam W. M. Mitchell&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gray's Atlas of Anatomy'' and ''Gray's Anatomy Review'' have also been published in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.elsevierhealth.com/dsresults.jsp?lid=1&amp;sid=959&amp;orderby=copyright_desc&amp;searchtype=quicksearch&amp;pageid=55|title=US Elsevier Health Bookshop|website=www.us.elsevierhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems''' is a notable [[mineral]] and [[Gemstone|gem]] collection within the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==History==
The museum's first [[mineralogy]] exhibit consisted of about 550 specimens loaned by Professor Gustave Guttenberg, then purchased after his death in 1896 to become the core of the museum's collection. In subsequent decades, it was augmented primarily by gifts, including [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s 1904 donation of the notable mineral collection of William W. Jefferis of [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]] (about 12,000 specimens), and a donation in 1902 of 2,600 gems from John L. Lewis, President of the Lewis Foundry &amp; Machine Company located in Groveton, Pennsylvania. The museum also acquired [[ore]]s and [[metal]]s representing Pittsburgh industries, including [[tin]], [[lead]], [[copper]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]], as well as local [[steel]] products, oil-bearing rock, crude [[petroleum]], [[coal]], [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], and [[graphite]]. Starting in 1969, trustee [[Henry Hillman|Henry L. Hillman]] provided substantial donations for purchasing new specimens and building the current exhibit hall, which opened in 1980, and was expanded and remodeled from 2006-2007.

==Collections==
Hillman Hall contains more than 1,300 specimens arranged in the following major sections:

* Lithology and Processes - illustrates the processes that create and transform [[Rock (geology)|rock]]s and [[mineral]]s.
* Crystallography - exhibits that explain [[crystal]]s and [[crystallography]].
* Mineral Properties - physical properties of a variety of [[mineral]]s.
* Fluorescence and Phosphorescence - displays of mineral [[fluorescence]] and [[phosphorescence]].
* Locality Suites - illustrates the diversity of mineral species that come from a single geographic environment and how they impacted civilizations.
* Pennsylvania Minerals and Gems - specimens representing some of the finest minerals and [[Gemstone|gem]]s from Pennsylvania.
* Systematic Collection - exhibiting minerals in systematic groupings by chemical classification according to Dana's System of Mineralogy.
* Masterpiece Gallery - an esthetic collection of notable mineral specimens from around the world.
* Wertz Gallery - the museum's [[Gemstone|gem]] collection, containing 17 permanent exhibits that display nearly 530 pieces, including a breathtaking Birthstones exhibit.

[[File:Deal Hoodeners, 1909.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hoodeners in [[Deal, Kent]] in 1909]]
'''Hoodening''' ({{IPAc-en|ʊ|d|.|ɛ|n|ɪ|ŋ}}), also spelled '''''hodening''''' and '''''oodening''''', is a [[tradition|folk custom]] found in [[Kent]], a county in [[South East England|south-eastern]] [[England]]. The tradition entails the use of a wooden [[hobby horse]] known as a '''hooden horse'''  that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a [[sackcloth]]. Originally, the tradition was restricted to the area of [[East Kent]], although in the twentieth century it spread into neighbouring [[West Kent]]. It represents a regional variation of a "hooded animal" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.

As recorded from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, hoodening was a tradition performed at [[Christmas]] time by groups of farm labourers. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, a man in female clothing known as a "Mollie", and several musicians. The team would then carry the hooden horse to local houses and shops, where they would expect payment for their appearance. Although this practice is extinct, in the present the hooden horse is incorporated into various Kentish [[Mummers play]]s and [[Morris dance]]s that take place at different times of the year.

The origins of the hoodening tradition, and the original derivation of the term ''hooden'', remain subject to academic debate. An early suggestion was that ''hooden'' was related to the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pre-Christian]] god [[Woden]], and that the tradition therefore originated with pre-Christian religious practices in the early medieval [[Kingdom of Kent]]. This idea has not found support from [[History|historians]] or [[Folkloristics|folklorists]] studying the tradition. A more widely accepted explanation among scholars is that the term ''hooden'' relates to ''hooded'', a reference to the sackcloth worn by the individual carrying the horse. The absence of late medieval references to such practices and the geographic dispersal of the various British hooded animal traditions—among them the [[Mari Lwyd]] of south Wales, [[The Broad (folk custom)|the Broad]] of the [[Cotswolds]], and the [[Old Ball]], [[Old Tup]], and [[Old Horse]] of northern England—have led to suggestions that they derive from the regionalised popularisation of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century fashion for hobby horses among the social elite.

The earliest textual reference to the hoodening tradition comes from the first half of the eighteenth century. Scattered references to it appeared over the next century and a half, many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had died out in many parts of Kent. Aware of this decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as ''The Hooden Horse'' in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the [[First World War]], the custom was revived in an altered form during the mid-twentieth century, when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into some modern Kentish folk traditions.

==Description==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="I remember as a child being taken out on Christmas Eve to the High Street in Deal where the shops would be open very late, and it was the only time Deal children were allowed out in the evening, parents were very strict. As we would be looking at the lighted shops, and listening to the people selling their wares, a horrible growl, and a long horse's face would appear, resting on our shoulder and when one looked round, there would be a long row of teeth snapping at us with its wooden jaws. It was frightening for a child. Usually, there would be a man leading the horse, with a rope, and another covered over with sacks or blankets as the horse."|source=— Naomi Wiffen of [[Edenbridge, Kent|Edenbridge]], early 1980s.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=17}} }}

Surviving sources testify to the fact that while there was some variation in the hoodening tradition as it was practiced by different individuals in different parts of East Kent, it was nevertheless "on the whole remarkably uniform".{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=86}} The hooden horse, which was at the centre of the tradition, was usually made out of a wooden horse's head affixed to a pole about four feet long, with a hinged jaw that was moved by a string.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=86}} This horse was then carried aloft by an individual who was concealed beneath a dark cloth.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=86-87}} As part of the hoodening custom, a team of "hoodeners", consisting of between four and eight men, would carry the horse through the streets. This team included the horse operator, a "Groom", "Driver", or "Waggoner" who carried a whip and led the  horse by a bridle, a "Jockey" who would attempt to mount the horse, a "Mollie" who was a man dressed as a woman, and one or two musicians.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=86}} All of the men were farm labourers, usually being those who worked with horses.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=87}} 

The team performed the custom at Christmas time, and usually on [[Christmas Eve]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=87}} The team would arrive at people's houses where they would sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with a broom while chasing any girls present.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=87}} Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=87}} Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave to repeat the process at another house.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=87}}

==Regional distribution==

Historians have catalogued 33 recorded instances of the hoodening tradition extant in Kent prior to the twentieth-century revival.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=87}} These are clustered in a crescent shape along the eastern and northern coasts of the county,{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=90}} and all were found within the area historically defined as [[East Kent]], the tradition being unknown in neighbouring [[West Kent]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=54–55}} More specifically, the folklorist Percy Maylam noted that there were no records of the tradition having been found west of [[Godmersham]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=54–55}} This region was "a well populated area" during the period in which the hoodeners were active,{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=90}} and Maylam noted that all of the areas in which the tradition was found contained the East Kentish dialect.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=55}} The folklorist E. C. Cawte analysed the historical distribution of the hoodeners and found that it did not correspond with the areas of early Anglo-Saxon settlement in Kent,{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=92–93}} nor did it accord with the county's coal mining areas.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=93}} He concluded that "there is no apparent reason why the custom did not spread further afield".{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=93}}

Hoodening was part of a wider "hooded animal" tradition that Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=210}} Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=210, 212}} In South Wales, the [[Mari Lwyd]] tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=94–109}} In an area along the border between [[Derbyshire]] and [[Yorkshire]], the [[Old Tup]] tradition featured groups knocking on doors around Christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat's head.{{sfnm|1a1=Cawte|1y=1978|1pp=110–117|2a1=Hutton|2y=1996|2p=87}} The folklorist [[Christina Hole]] drew parallels between hoodening and the [[Christmas Bull]] tradition recorded in [[Dorset]] and [[Gloucestershire]].{{sfn|Hole|1995|p=148}} In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions—the Padstow [['Obby 'Oss festival]] and [[Minehead Hobby Horse]]—which take place not at Christmas time but on [[May Day]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=157–177}}
Although the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|pp=93–94}} In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's [[Morris dance]] tradition, which became a "nation-wide craze" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into "a set of sharply delineated regional traditions".{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=94}}

==Etymology and origins==

Maylam noted that most nineteenth-century sources describing the tradition had spelled the word as ''hoden'', but that he favoured ''hooden'' because it better reflected the pronunciation of the word with its [[long vowel]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=22}} He added that "the word 'hooden' rhymes with 'wooden' and not with 'sodden' as some writers appear to think".{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=22}} Given this pronunciation, Cawte suggested that ''oodening'' was a better spelling for the tradition's name.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=88}} Maylam also noted that none of the hoodeners with whom he communicated were aware of the [[etymology]] of the term, and that similarly they were unaware of the tradition's historical origins.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=81}}

The term ''hoodening'' is thus of unknown derivation.{{sfn|Doel|Doel|2003|p=35}} One possible explanation for the origin of ''hooden'' was that it had emerged as a mispronunciation of ''wooden'', referring to the use of the wooden horse.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=81}} Maylam was critical of this idea, expressing the view that such a mispronunciation was unlikely to emerge from the Kentish dialect.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=81}} A second possibility is that the name ''hooden'' was a reference to the hooded nature of the horse's bearer.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=81–82}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] deemed this to be the "simplest" derivation,{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=83}} while folklorists Cawte and [[Charlotte Sophia Burne]] also considered it the most likely explanation.{{sfnm|1a1=Burne|1y=1910|1p=249|2a1=Cawte|2y=1978|2p=89}} Maylam was also critical of this, suggesting that the cloth under which the carrier was concealed was too large to be considered a hood.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=81–82}}
In his ''History of Kent'', the antiquarian [[Alfred John Dunkin]] suggested that ''Hodening'' was a corruption of ''Hobening'', and that it was ultimately derived from the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''hopp'', meaning horse.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=31}} Maylam opined that Dunkin's argument could be "ignored", stating that it rested on the erroneous assumption that ''Hodening'' began with a short vowel.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=31}}

Maylam concluded that the hoodening tradition was "a mutilated survival" of a form of Morris dance.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=85}} Noting that some medieval Morris dancers had incorporated games devoted to the English folk hero [[Robin Hood]] into their custom, he suggested that ''hoodening'' might have originally been a reference to Robin Hood.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=85–91}} This idea was challenged by Burne, who noted that in his legends, Robin Hood was always depicted as an archer rather than a horse-rider, thus questioning how he had come to be associated with the hooden horse.{{sfn|Burne|1910|p=248}} She further noted that the medieval games devoted to Robin Hood all took place in May rather than at Christmas, as hoodening did.{{sfn|Burne|1910|p=248}} Cawte also criticised Maylam's argument, noting that there was no evidence of Morris dancing in Kent prior to the twentieth century, and that neither hoodening nor Robin Hood had a particularly close association with the Morris dance to start with.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|pp=88–89}}

===Possible Early Medieval origins===

[[File:Flag of Kent.svg|thumb|right|The folklorist Geoff Doel suggested a possible connection between the hooden horse and the white horse which appears as a symbol of Kent on the county flag (pictured).]]

In 1807, an anonymous observer suggested that the term ''hoden'' was linked to the Anglo-Saxon god [[Woden]], and that the tradition might be "a relic of a festival to commemorate our Saxon ancestors landing in Thanet".{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=28}} In 1891, it was suggested that the custom had once been known as "Odining", a reference to the early medieval Scandinavian god [[Odin]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=38}} The author of this idea further suggested that the custom had begun either with the ritual wearing of the skins of horses sacrificed to Odin, or as an early Christian mockery of such Odinic practices.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=39}} 

Maylam noted that he was initially attracted to the idea that the term ''hodening'' had derived from ''Woden''—an [[Old English]] name that he thought a more likely origin than the [[Old Norse]] ''Odin''—but that upon investigating this possibility found "no sufficient evidence" for it.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=82–83}} He added that it would seem unlikely that the ''W'' would be lost from ''Woden'' in the Kentish dialect, citing the example of [[Woodnesborough]], a Kentish village whose name is often interpreted as having derived from ''Woden'' and which clearly retains its use of ''W''.{{sfnm|1a1=Maylam|1y=2009a|1p=83|2a1=Cawte|2y=1978|2p=88}} He concluded that "one feels that the theory is based on inferences and analogies not strong enough for a foundation to carry the building erected on them".{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=103}} The idea of linking the tradition to Woden was also dismissed as unlikely by both Burne and Cawte.{{sfnm|1a1=Burne|1y=1910|1p=248|2a1=Cawte|2y=1978|2p=88}}

Believing it likely that the hoodening tradition "substantially pre-dates" its earliest textual appearances,{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=13}} the folklorist Geoff Doel suggested the possibility that it had originated as a Midwinter rite to re-energise the vegetation. As evidence for this claim, Doel noted that other English winter folk customs, such as the [[Apple Wassail]], have also been interpreted in this manner.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=14}} He also suggested that the use of the horse in the tradition may have some connections to either the use of [[White horse of Kent|the white horse as the symbol of Kent]], and the use of [[Hengist and Horsa]] (meaning "stallion" and "horse" in Old English) as prominent characters in the origin myths of the early medieval Kingdom of Kent.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|pp=14–15}}

==Recorded appearances==

===Early textual references===

[[File:Mari Lwyd (wiki).jpg|thumb|The earliest surviving descriptions of hoodening claim that the hooden horse contained a horse's skull, akin to this modern example of the [[Mari Lwyd]], a Welsh hobby horse.]]

The oldest known textual reference to hoodening comes from the ''Alphabet of Kenticisms'', a manuscript authored by [[Samuel Pegge]], an [[antiquarianism|antiquary]] who served as the vicar of Godmersham in Kent from 1731 to 1751.{{sfnm|1a1=Maylam|1y=2009a|1p=27|2a1=Cawte|2y=1978|2p=87}} After Pegge died, the manuscript was obtained by the palaeographer [[Frederic Madden|Sir Frederic Madden]], and after his death it was purchased by the [[English Dialect Society]], who published it in 1876.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=27}} In this manuscript, Pegge noted simply that "Hoodening (huod.ing) is a country masquerade at Christmas times", comparing it to [[Mummers play|Mumming]] and the [[Winster Guisers]] of [[Derbyshire]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=27}}

The earliest known textual description of the tradition is provided by a letter that was published in a May 1807 edition of ''[[European Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=28}} The letter had been written by an anonymous individual who was describing an encounter with the hoodeners on a visit to the Kentish coastal town of [[Ramsgate]] in [[Thanet District|Thanet]]:

:I found they begin the festivities of Christmas by a curious procession: a party of young people procure the head of a dead horse, which is affixed to a pole about four feet in length; a string is affixed to the lower jaw; a horse-cloth is also attached to the whole, under which one of the parts gets, and by frequently pulling the string, keeps up a loud snapping noise, and is accompanied by the rest of the party, grotesquely habited, with hand-bells; they thus proceed from house to house, ringing their bells, and singing carols and songs; they are commonly gratified with beer and cake, or perhaps with money. This is called, ''provincially'', a Hodening.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=28}}

Later commenting on this source, Maylam highlighted that its author did not appear to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=28}} As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=28}} At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=28}}

The anonymously authored account was repeated almost verbatim in a range of other publications in the coming decades, giving its description far wider exposure.{{sfnm|1a1=Maylam|1y=2009a|1pp=28–31|2a1=Cawte|2y=1978|2p=87}} The first printed reference to the hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in Mackenzie E. C. Walcott's ''Guide to the Coast of Kent'', published in 1859, where he referred to a "curious custom [which] used to prevail" in Ramsgate.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=32}} Maylam later suggested that the Ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838, for he had interviewed elderly town residents in the early twentieth century and while several were aware that it had once taken place in the town, none could recall it happening in their own lifetime.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=50}}

===Later nineteenth-century===

Many years after the event, the Kentish antiquarian [[J. Meadows Cooper]] related that while sitting in a pub on the outskirts of [[Margate]] on [[Boxing Day]] 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=50}} Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown, near Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=50–51}} Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse that had appeared in [[Herne, Kent|Herne]] and [[Swalecliffe]] but which had been discontinued in the 1860s,{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=52}} another that was active from Wingate Farm House in [[Harbledown]] during the 1850s,{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=52}} and one that had been active at [[Evington]] but which had ceased by the 1860s.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=54}} He found another based at [[Lower Hardres]] that had been active from at least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=52–53}}
In a January 1868 edition of the ''[[Kentish Gazette]]'', an anonymous author mentioned that hoodening had taken place in [[Minster, Swale]] on the Christmas Eve of 1867. The author noted that the tradition featured [[Christmas carol|carol singing]] and the ringing of [[handbell]]s, which were accompanied by the appearance of a hooden horse; they expressed surprise at this latter event because they had thought that the horse was "as extinct as the [[megatherium]]".{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=33}}

[[File:Sarre Hoodeners, 1905.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Hoodeners from Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, Kent, as photographed in June 1905]]

In their 1888 ''Dictionary of the Kentish Dialect'', W. D. Parish and W. F. Shaw claimed that ''Hodening'' was a term used in Kent to refer to a custom involving the singing of carols, but that in the past ''Hoodening'' had been applied to "a mumming or masquerade" involving the hooden horse.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=35}} They added that they had gained information on this older custom in 1876 from the Reverend H. Bennett Smith of [[St Nicholas-at-Wade]], who had in turn learned from a retired farmer in his parish that "the farmer used to send annually round the neighbourhood the best horse under the charge of the wagoner, and that afterwards instead, a man used to represent the horse, being supplied with a tail, and with a wooden figure of a horse's head, and plenty of horse hair for a mane... The custom has long since ceased."{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=35}}

Parish and Shaw did not mention what time of year the tradition took place or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=11}} Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=11}} He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the [[past tense]], indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying at the time of writing.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=11}} Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=35}}

In December 1889, a letter written by a resident of St. Lawrence named Charles J. H. Saunders appeared in the ''[[Bromley Record]]''. Saunders stated that he had conversed with many elderly residents of Thanet on the subject of hoodening, and that they informed him that the custom had been discontinued around fifty years previously, after a woman in [[Broadstairs]] was so scared by the hooden horse that she died.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=36–37}} He added that a horse's skull was rarely used, "owing to the difficulty procuring one", and that the wooden head was thus typically used as a replacement.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=36}} He stated that the hoodening company typically consisted of a "Jockey" who placed himself on the back of the individual carrying the horse, and that it was the "sport" that bystanders attempted to throw him off, resulting in violence. The horse and jockey were also accompanied by two singers, two attendants, and an individual dressed as an "old woman" carrying a broom; when the company knocked on people's doors, it was the old woman's job to sweep the inhabitants feet away with her broom and to chase any girls until being paid off with money or refreshments.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=36}} He was of the opinion that the custom had been restricted to the Isle of Thanet, noting that locals informed him that it had been carried out in Ramsgate, St. Lawrence, Minster, St. Nicholas, [[Acol, Kent|Acol]], [[Monkton, Kent|Monkton]], and [[Birchington-on-Sea|Birchington]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=36}} Contradicting this were several letters published in the ''[[Church Times]]'' in January 1891 which attested to the continuing practice of the hooden horse tradition at both Deal and Walmer.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=37–38}}

===Percy Maylam's investigations===

Percy Maylam was born into a farming family in 1865 at Pivington Farm in [[Pluckley]], and in 1890 became a solicitor of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] before working as a solicitor at [[Canterbury]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009b|p=7}} As well as being a keen cricketer and coin collector, Maylam was an amateur historian and in 1892 joined the [[Kent Archaeological Society]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009b|p=7}} During the 1880s, Maylam came upon the hoodening tradition and began undertaking research into it, searching for textual references to the tradition in books, periodicals, and newspapers, and interviewing those involved in three extant traditions, at St Nicholas-at-Wade, [[Walmer]], and [[Deal, Kent|Deal]].{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=12}} He expressed the opinion that "in these days Kent possesses so few genuine popular customs of this kind that we cannot afford to be indifferent to those still in existence. This is my excuse for my attempt to record the custom as now existing before it is utterly lost to us."{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=22}} 

[[File:Walmer hoodeners, 1907.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hoodeners from Walmer Court Farm, Walmer, in March 1907]]

The period in which Maylam conducted his research was one that was witnessing increased interest in the recording of Britain's rural folk culture, in particular by members of the professional classes—of which Maylam was a member—in part due to the fear that such traditions were rapidly dying out.{{sfn|Doel|2009a|pp=12–13}} Such folklore collecting was encouraged by [[The Folklore Society]], with whom Maylam was associated, and also by the widely read book ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', a work of comparative folkloristics authored by the anthropologist [[James Frazer]].{{sfn|Doel|2009a|pp=12–13}} Maylam published his research in 1909 as ''The Hooden Horse'', in an edition limited to 303 copies.{{sfn|Maylam|2009b|p=7}} The book was reviewed in the journal ''Folklore'' by Burne, who described it as "an admirable piece of work, careful, thorough, unambitious, and complete in itself".{{sfn|Burne|1910|p=246}} Cawte later described it as "unusually good",{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=85}} while Fran and Geoff Doel regarded it as "a very enlightened piece of Edwardian folk research".{{sfn|Doel|Doel|2003|p=38}}

Maylam concluded that at the time, there was only one hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit [[Sarre, Kent|Sarre]], Birchington, and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=48}} The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=24}} In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=48}} On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30&amp;nbsp;pm, accompanied by two musicians—one playing the [[tambourine]] and the other the [[concertina]]—and a man named Robert Laming who led the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=25}} Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=25}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="This is an admirable piece of work, careful, thorough, unambitious, and complete in itself. Mr. Maylam has all the humour and sympathy and unfeigned enjoyment of his informants' society and doings that go to the making of a genuine [folklore] collector, and adds to them the skill in weighing and marshalling evidence that belongs to his legal training; and he has left no point untouched that could serve to throw light on his subject."|source=— Charlotte Sophia Burne, 1910.{{sfn|Burne|1910|pp=246–247}} }}

Maylam also interviewed those involved in the hoodening tradition at Deal, whom he encountered in the summer of 1909. One elderly gentleman, Robert Skardon, related that his father had once led the town's hoodening troupe, in which he personally carried the head, his father the drum, his "Uncle John Beaney" the [[fiddle]], and "old Harry Chorner" the [[piccolo]]. For many years they had included a man dressed in woman's clothing, who was known as a "Daisy" rather than a "Mollie", but that this had been discontinued.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=49}} Skardon had given up the tradition many years previously, and the hooden horse itself had come into the possession of Elbridge Bowles of [[Great Mongeham]], who continued to lead a hoodening troupe after Christmas each year, visiting Deal as well as the neighbouring villages of [[Finglesham]], [[Ripple, Kent|Ripple]], [[Tilmanstone]], [[Eastry]], and [[Betteshanger]].{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=49}} Maylam was also informed that at the time of Britain's involvement in the [[Second Boer War]], the horse had been decorated with military equipment.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=49}} The fourth hooden horse that Maylam encountered was owned by the men who worked at George Goodson's farm in Fenland, Word, near [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. They informed him that it had been made by a farm hand in [[Cleve, Kent|Cleve]], Monkton, before being brought to Word when one of the Cleve farm workers relocated there.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|p=48}}

Maylam believed that the custom—as a "natural and spontaneous observance" among the people—was clearly going to die out, expressing his hope that the hooden horses could be preserved in Kentish museums and brought out for specially arranged public processions so as to maintain their place in Kentish culture.{{sfn|Maylam|2009a|pp=55–56}} In later life, Maylam focused his attentions on exploring his family history, privately publishing ''Maylam Family Records'' in 1932, before dying in 1939.{{sfn|Maylam|2009b|p=7}} In the century following his death, Maylam's book on hoodening became difficult to obtain and expensive to purchase, and so to mark the centenary of its first publication, it was republished in 2009 by [[The History Press]], under the altered title of ''The Kent Hooden Horse''.{{sfn|Maylam|2009b|p=8}} Writing an introductory article for the second publication, Doel, a specialist in Kentish folklore, praised Maylam's book as a "classic study" which was "impressive for its separation of fact from speculation as to the origins and significance of the custom."{{sfn|Doel|2009a|p=12}}

===Twentieth-century revival===

Writing in 1967, the folklorist Barnett Field claimed that at some point after Maylam's book was published, hoodening had "died out. The Horses were hung up in the stables, and when the tractors came, were taken out and burnt on the bonfire."{{sfn|Field|1967|p=204}} Doel and Doel later suggested that it was the impact of the [[First World War]] which effectively ended the tradition.{{sfn|Doel|Doel|2003|p=38}} Field noted that the first revival of the custom after the war took place at the 1936 [[Kent District Folk-Dance Festival]] at [[Aylesford]].{{sfn|Field|1967|p=204}} A new horse was specially created for this festival, and was modelled on an older example that had been used at Sarre.{{sfn|Field|1967|p=204}} The hobby horse had not previously had any connection with Morris dancing, although was adopted as a [[totemism|totem]] animal for several Morris sides after the [[Second World War]].{{sfn|Doel|Doel|2003|p=39}} This revival in the usage of the horse was heavily influenced by Maylam's book.{{sfn|Doel|Doel|2003|p=39}} The Aylesford horse was adopted by the [[Ravensbourne Morris Men]], a Morris troupe based in the West Kentish village of [[Keston]], in 1947.{{sfn|Field|1967|p=204}} The Ravensbourne Morris's hoodening tradition is the earliest known variant of the custom to exist in West Kent,{{sfn|Doel|2009b|p=111}} although there are accounts of a hooden horse being located at Balgowan School in the West Kentish town of [[Beckenham]] during the 1930s.{{sfn|Doel|2009b|pp=110, 111}} At the 1945 celebration marking British victory in the Second World War, a horse was brought out in Acol; this instance has been described as "a kind of missing link between tradition and revival" because the horse had been used as part of the historical hoodening tradition up until the mid-1920s.{{sfn|Doel|2009b|p=110}}

Barnett Field (1912–2000) as born at [[Wych Cross]] in the [[Ashdown Forest]] and subsequently educated at [[Tunbridge Wells]]. He trained as a banker before working as manager of the [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] and [[Folkestone]] branches of the [[Westminster Bank]] until his retirement in 1979.{{sfn|Frampton|2001|p=91}} Field and his wife, Olive Ridley, had a keen interest in folk dances; she established the [[Folkestone National Folk Dance Group]] in 1950, and he founded the [[East Kent Morris Men]] in 1953.{{sfn|Frampton|2001|p=91}} Field constructed a hooden horse for the group to use, based in large part on the Deal horse photographed for Maylam's book, and unveiled it at the Folkestone celebrations for the [[Coronation of Elizabeth II|Coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in June 1953.{{sfnm|1a1=Field|1y=1967|1p=204|2a1=Frampton|2y=2001|2p=91}} After this, it came to be used by both the East Kent Morris Men and the Folkestone District National Dance Group's Handbell Ringers, who took it with them for performances in various parts of continental Europe, including Austria, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia, developing what came to be known as "handbell hoodening".{{sfnm|1a1=Field|1y=1967|1pp=202, 204|2a1=Frampton|2y=2001|2p=91}} The Handbell Ringers also brought out the horse to accompany them as they went around in public collecting money for charity at Christmas time.{{sfnm|1a1=Field|1y=1967|1p=204|2a1=Frampton|2y=2001|2p=91}}

[[File:Hooden Horses at the Clock Tower (geograph 5502334).jpg|left|thumb|Hooden horses at the Clock Tower in Broadstairs as part of Broadstairs Folk Week 2017]]

From 1954, the horse was also brought out for a [[Whitsun]] celebration in which it was paraded from [[Charing]] to the [[village green]] at [[Wye, Kent|Wye]]. A special service was held in the Charing Church, in which the Morris Men danced in the [[chancel]] and through the aisle, while the [[vicar]] put a bridle on the horse itself.{{sfn|Field|1967|p=205}} The horse was also brought out for a July 1956 ceremony in which The Swan Inn, a pub at [[Wickhambreaux]], was officially renamed as The Hooden Horse; present were the East Kent Morris Men, the Handbell Ringers, and the Ravensbourne Morris Men.{{sfnm|1a1=Field|1y=1967|1p=204|2a1=Hole|2y=1995|2p=167|3a1=Frampton|3y=2001|3p=91}} This venture led to the groups establishing a new folk custom, "hop hoodening", which was derived in part from an older hop-picking ceremony found in the Weald area. Their new custom involved the different groups joining together on a tour around the villages of East Kent, beginning at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and going through Ramsgate, [[Cliftonville]], and [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] before ending in a [[barn dance]] at Wickhambreaux.{{sfnm|1a1=Field|1y=1967|1p=204|2a1=Frampton|2y=2001|2p=91}}

In October 1957, Field was introduced to Jack Laming of Walmer, who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in the century. Laming taught Field more about the historical hoodening tradition, and together they unearthed an old hooden horse that was stored at Walmer's Coldblow Farm; this artefact was later placed on display at [[Deal Maritime and Local History Museum]].{{sfn|Frampton|2001|p=92}} In June 1961 Field and his wife established the first Folkestone International Folklore Festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs; it continued for 28 years.{{sfn|Frampton|2001|p=92}}

Since the end of the Second World War, the hooden horse's use has been revived in [[Whitstable]], where it is often brought out for the [[Jack in the Green]] festival each May,{{sfn|Doel|2009b|p=111}} and is owned by a group called the Ancient Order of Hoodeners.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=83}} Since 1981, the Tonbridge Mummers and Hoodeners have made use of a horse, incorporating it into a play specially written for the purpose by Doel and Nick Miller.{{sfn|Doel|2009b|p=111}}
An annual conference of hoodeners was also established; initially meeting at the Marsh Gate Inn near Herne Bay, it subsequently moved to Simple Simon's in Canterbury.{{sfn|Doel|2009b|p=112}} A member of the St. Nicholas-at-Wade hoodeners, Ben Jones, established a website devoted to the tradition.{{sfn|Doel|2009b|p=112}} At the prompting of local residents, in December 2014 a pub named The Hungry Horse, located on the corner of Haine Road and Nash Road in Broadstairs, was renamed as The Hoodening Horse after the folk custom.{{sfn|Archer|2014}} Commenting on the Kentish revival of hoodening, Hutton suggested that its success was due largely to the desire of many Kentish folk to culturally distinguish themselves from neighbouring London.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=83}}

The '''Hyde Park Barracks Museum''' is a brick building and [[Compound (enclosure)|compound]] designed by convict architect [[Francis Greenway]] between 1818 and 1819; originally built at the head of [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] (1819) to house [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] men and boys.

The site is managed by the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]] as a [[museum]] open to the public for a modest fee. The site is listed on [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045722|Hyde Park Barracks|hr=00190|fn=S90/01189; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Commonwealth Heritage List]], and is inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] as one of 11 pre-eminent [[Australian Convict Sites]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories and Histories|url=http://www.hht.net.au/discover/highlights/articles/barracks_world_heritage_listing|website=Sydney Living History Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as amongst "the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts."&lt;ref name="WorldHeritage02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Convict Sites|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1306|website=World Heritage Convention|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Convict Sites|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/australian-convict-sites-world%20heritage-nomination|website=Department of the Environment|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Image:HydeParkBarracksDrawingHardyWilson1914.jpg|Hyde Park Barracks in a 1914 drawing by [[William Hardy Wilson]]|thumb|upright|left]]

Constructed by convict labour by order of Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]], the Barracks is one of the most familiar works of the accomplished colonial England-born, Australian architect [[Francis Howard Greenway]]. As the principal male convict barracks in [[New South Wales]] it provided lodgings for convicts working in government employment around Sydney until its closure in mid-1848.

It has had many occupants since then.  It was an Immigration Depot for single female immigrants seeking work as domestic servants and awaiting family reunion from 1848 to 1886 and also a female asylum from 1862 to 1886.  From 1887 to 1979 law courts and government offices were based at the Barracks. Construction began in 1817.

== Museum ==
In 1991, Hyde Park Barracks underwent conservation and adaptation work by award-winning architects Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and conservation architects [[Clive Lucas|Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners]]. The completed project won the [[Australian Institute of Architects]] national Lachlan Macquarie Award in 1992. Now, the newly installed Hyde Park Barracks is a museum operated by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.  Tourists who visit the building discover the daily lives of convicts and other occupants through exhibitions on Sydney's male convict labour force, Australia's convict system, an innovative soundscape, excavated artefacts, exposed layers of building fabric and the complex's rooms and spaces.

In June 2015, [[Mark Speakman]] the [[Minister for the Environment (New South Wales)|Minister for the Environment of New South Wales]] announced Unlocking Heritage, a two-year program aimed at giving children the opportunity to experience Sydney's living museums. This program will allow students to wear convict clothing and sleep in the Barrack's hammocks. A million dollars has been allocated for this program. Museum director Mark Goggin thinks that children will learn more about history if they can experience it hands-on, '"Particularly for the kids to wear the convict shirts, eat the gruel, sleep over with their mates in hammocks and imagining what life was like 200 years ago."' The program is starting out with children and hoping to expand to adult participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donegan|first1=John|title=Sydney's Hyde Park Barracks site of student sleepover as museum receives funding injection|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-12/new-funding-to-make-sydney-living-museums-more-accessible/6538892|publisher=702 ABC Sydney|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Heritage listing ==
In July 2010, at the 34th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the Hyde Park Barracks and ten other Australian sites with a significant association with convict transportation were inscribed as a group on the World Heritage List as the [[Australian Convict Sites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = UNESCO World Heritage Centre – World Heritage Committee inscribes seven cultural sites on World Heritage List |work = UNESCO World Heritage Centre website | publisher = United Nations | date = 31 July 2010 | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/642 | accessdate = 17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The listing explains that the 11 sites present "the best surviving examples of large-scale convict transportation and the colonial expansion of European powers through the presence and labour of convicts". Of the 11 sites the [[Great North Road, Australia|Old Great North Road]], [[Old Government House, Parramatta|Old Government House]] at Parramatta and [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]] are also within the Sydney region.

== Operations ==
According to the Living Museum website, the fees for admission as of 2015 are $10 for adult admission, $5 for children or commissions, $20 for families (two adults and two children) and free to members.  Group and school tours are available by phoning the museum. Hours of operation are 10am – 5pm daily. Closed on Christmas and Good Friday. The Hyde Barracks are one fourth of the Sydney Living History Museum series. The other three are the [[Susannah Place Museum]], the [[Museum of Sydney]] and the Justice &amp; Police Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Living Museums – Hyde Park Barracks Museum|url=http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/hyde-park-barracks-museum|website=Sydney Living Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pass can be purchased at any of the locations that will enable visitors to visit all four locations at a discounted price. Adults $18, Children and Concessions $9. The pass is valid for three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney Museums Pass|url=http://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/sydney-museums-pass|website=Sydney Living Museums|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Revolutionary People's Guerrilla Forces''' (IRPGF) was a [[collective]] of anarchist fighters from around the world. Its formation was announced on 31 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author1=Vice Staff |title=Greek Anarchists Are Helping Kurdish Forces Fight ISIS |work=[[Vice Media|Vice]] |date=2017-06-02 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_nz/article/gypbv4/greek-anarchists-are-helping-kurdish-forces-fight-isis |accessdate=2018-03-31 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the group, their goals were to defend the social revolution in [[Rojava]] in northern Syria, and spread anarchism. The group announced its dissolution on 24 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/IRPGF/status/1044124788833353728&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRPGF are part of the [[International Freedom Battalion]] since April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Siria, quei ragazzi venuti da mezzo mondo a combattere l'Isis|url=http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2017/06/02/news/siria_international_freedom_battalion-167037636/|website=[[la Repubblica]]|accessdate=30 June 2017|language=it|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=В Рожаве создана новая организация партизан-анархистов {{!}} Новости Курдистана|url=http://kurdistan.today/v-rozhave-sozdana-novaya-organizaciya-partizan-anarxistov/|website=kurdistan.today|accessdate=30 June 2017|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish media have described them as a terrorist organization and part of the network of the outlawed [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bumerang etkisi: BATI'nın beslediği anarşistler PKK çatısı altında terörize oluyor|url=http://www.ehamedya.com/bumerang-etkisi-batinin-besledigi-anarsistler-pkk-catisi-altinda-terorize-oluyor_1808.html|website=EHA MEDYA|accessdate=30 June 2017|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Batı'nın karşısındaki terör tehdidi – Son Dakika Dünya Haberleri {{!}} STAR|url=http://www.star.com.tr/dunya/batinin-karsisindaki-teror-tehdidi-haber-1203591|website=Star.com.tr|accessdate=30 June 2017|language=tr-TR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
The IRPGF were created on 31 March 2017 with the purpose of defending the Revolution of Rojava and collaborating with the [[People's Protection Units]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They also intend to advance anarchism in the Syrian region of Rojava and, according to them, to defend ''"social revolutions and social struggles"'' all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nueva unidad kurda en Siria promete revolución en Turquía y EEUU - - HispanTV.com|url=http://www.hispantv.com/noticias/siria/341108/kurdos-sirios-revolucion-eeuu-turquia|accessdate=10 July 2017|agency=[[HispanTV]]|date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement was broadcast on video by the IRPGF in social networks along with a written statement specifying their objectives. In the video one can see several guerrilla fighters with their faces covered, carrying [[AK-47]] rifles, [[RPG-7]] rocket launchers, Soviet [[PK machine gun]]s and explosives.&lt;ref name="former" /&gt; In the same video a fighter reads a statement; behind him are flags of the IFB. A black flag with the [[enclosed A]], an Antifascist Action flag and [[Communist symbolism#Red and black flag|the Red and Black flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nace la guerrilla anarquista "IRPGF" en Rojava para luchar por la revolución en Kurdistán y el mundo – Ruptura Colectiva (RC)|url=http://rupturacolectiva.com/nace-la-guerrilla-anarquista-irpgf-en-rojava-para-luchar-por-la-revolucion-en-kurdistan-y-mundo/|website=Ruptura Colectiva|accessdate=10 July 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ideology ===
The guerrillas' ideology was [[anarchist communism]]. Among its objectives was to defend the [[Rojava Revolution]] against the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], the different jihadist groups of the [[Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army]], and the [[Turkish occupation of northern Syria|Turkish occupation in Syri]]a. The fighters say that their objectives are not constrained to [[Rojava]], but they also have intentions to help in the struggles and social revolutions around the world. They also adhere to horizontal principles in their organization and ''"the struggle against all kinds of oppression"'' such as sexism, racism and classism, abolition of the State, capitalism and patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nace la guerrilla anarquista "IRPGF" en Rojava para luchar por la revolución en Kurdistán y el mundo – Kaos en la red {{!}}Kaos en la red|url=http://kaosenlared.net/nace-la-guerrilla-anarquista-irpgf-en-rojava-para-luchar-por-la-revolucion-en-kurdistan-y-el-mundo/|website=kaosenlared.net|accessdate=10 July 2017|language=es-ES|quote=Estamos comprometidos antifascistas, anticapitalistas, antiimperialistas, contra todas las formas del patriarcado y las jerarquías.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affiliation ==
The group was a part of the [[International Freedom Battalion]] since April 2017, and they are the second anarchist group to join after the Greek unit [[Revolutionary Union for Internationalist Solidarity|RUIS]]. They participate frequently in the campaign activities of the brigade in social networks.

On 29 May, the IRPGF issued a statement in tribute to the commander of the [[United Freedom Forces]] Mehmet Kurnaz (Ulaş Bayraktaroglu), who was killed in combat on the Raqqa Front while fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. They define him as a true friend of IRPGF. On the 31st of the same month, the IRPGF sent representatives and speakers to the City of Derek (Canton of Cizîrê) at the funeral ceremony to four martyrs of the International Freedom Battalion and the People's Protection Units, Mehmet Kurnaz (Ulaş Bayraktaroglu) commander of the United Freedom Forces, Muzaffer Kandemir (fighter) of the United Freedom Forces, Elî Mihemed Mizil (Şêr Zagros) and Nimet Tûrûg (Baran Cudi) of the People's Protection Units.

== Armed struggle and involvement in the Syrian Civil War==
Their public presence has also been confirmed at multiple martyr ceremonies in Rojava over the past few months. Having fought alongside with the three most recent martyrs of the International Freedom Battalion, they were present at the funeral ceremonies for DKP leader and United Freedom Forces (BÖG) commander Ulaş Bayraktaroğlu, Tufan Eroğluer (Hasan Ali) from BÖG and Ayşe Deniz Karacagil (Destan Temmuz) from MLKP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Four martyrs of Raqqa operation laid to rest|url=https://anfenglish.com/rojava/martyrs-of-raqqa-operation-laid-to-rest-20268|accessdate=6 June 2017|agency=ANF News|date=1 June 2017|location=Derik, Cizire|language=en|quote=(Multimedia—Photography and video in which the IRPGF flag is observed in the formation of the IFB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ajansı|first1=Etkin Haber|title=Bayraktaroğlu ve Rakka şehitleri son yolculuğuna uğurlandı Haber Detay|url=http://www.etha.com.tr/Haber/2017/06/01/guncel/bayraktaroglu-ve-rakka-sehitleri-son-yolculuguna-u/|website=ETHA|accessdate=30 June 2017|date=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[https://twitter.com/TheBaseBK @TheBaseBK]|title=Four martyrs of Raqqa operation laid to rest|url=https://twitter.com/TheBaseBK/status/870720710070722560|language=en|date=2 June 2017|accessdate=8 June 2017|quote="Four martyrs of #Raqqa operation laid to rest." @IRPGF and other groups paying homage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2017, the IRPGF announced from [[Raqqa|Raqqa City]] the formation of [[The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army]] (TQILA),{{refn|Pronounced {{Audio-IPA|Tequila(town)Pronunciation.ogg|[teˈkila]|}} like the word [[Tequila]].}} along with a statement explaining the purposes of its formation in which the response to [[Persecution of gay and bisexual men by ISIL|persecution of LGBT persons by ISIL]] is highlighted as one of the main motivations of the group. The testimonial image of its formation, in which fighters posed alongside a sign with the motto "These faggots kill fascists" and two flags – one belonging to the recent group and an [[LGBT flag]] – that was quickly viralized by several western media that, surprised by the unit's creation, echoed the event with large repercussions.{{refn|Newspapers both digital and physical, echoed the news such as [[HuffPost]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esteban|first1=Nacho|title=TQILA, un mal trago para la homofobia|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.es/nacho-esteban/tqila-un-mal-trago-para-la-homofobia_a_23045767/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[HuffPost]]|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Matt|title=Armed militia of gay men named The Queer Insurrection and Liberation Army are fighting homophobic Isis in Syria|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4097885/armed-militia-of-gay-men-named-the-queer-insurrection-and-liberation-army-are-fighting-homophobic-isis-in-syria/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newsweek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Jack|title=First LGBT Unit 'Created to Fight ISIS' in Syria|url=http://www.newsweek.com/first-lgbt-unit-created-fight-isis-syria-its-name-queer-insurrection-641148|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[Newsweek]]|date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Independent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the LGBT anarchists who've gone to Syria to fight Isis|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/lgbt-syria-isis-fight-rights-anarchists-queer-insurrection-islamic-state-a7859756.html|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[The Independent]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York Post]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lapin|first1=Tamar|title=LGBT soldiers are going after ISIS in Syria|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/25/lgbt-soldiers-are-going-after-isis-in-syria/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[New York Post]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euronews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LGBT army unit established to take on ISIL|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/07/26/lgbt-army-unit-established-to-take-on-isil|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[Euronews]]|date=25 July 2017|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[El Confidencial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borja|first1=Rodrigo|title=La milicia LGTB que desafía al ISIS en Siria: "Estos maricas asesinan fascistas"|url=https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2017-07-27/milicia-lgbt-siria-maricas-asesinan-fascistas_1421347/|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=[[El Confidencial]]|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.}}

Despite being part of the International Freedom Battalion several media erroneously reported that TQILA could be an official unit of the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] which caused confusion. Following the impact of this mistaken information Mustafa Bali, media director of the SDF, denied such information alleging that there is an LGBT brigade within the coalition, but does not deny the existence of the same which, indeed, belongs to the International Freedom Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=LGBT unit not officially part of SDF, says Kurdish official|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/lgbt-unit-not-officially-part-sdf-says-kurdish-official-1358340404|accessdate=28 July 2017|agency=Middle East Eye|date=26 July 2017|language= |quote=TQILA, which announced on Twitter its acronym name is pronounced "tequila", is a part of the IRPGF, an anarchist unit and a sub-group of the International Freedom Battalion of foreign fighters formed to assist the SDF.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean Hani''' (1917-2012) was a French philosopher and [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] author, and a professor of Greek civilization and literature at the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Amiens]].

==Life and Works==
Very little is known about Jean Hani's personal life other than his year of birth. [[Jean Borella]]'s mention of the author's modesty and his older age "studious retirement" seem to agree with this scarcity of information.&lt;ref name="borellahani"&gt;"Regard sur l'œuvre de Jean Hani" in ''Connaissance des Religions'', Dec. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1917, Hani proved a bright secondary student, pursuing his university studies in Classical Literature, and finally obtaining a doctorate with a dissertation about the influence of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] on the thought of [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref name=hanithese&gt;''La religion Egyptienne dans la pensée de Plutarque'', Paris, Les belles lettres, 1976. Library record at Paris Sorbonne IV, 1971, Worldcat ref. 490686029&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a lecturer at the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Amiens]], he founded the Centre de Recherches sur l'Antiquité Classique, and he led for many years a Séminar of History of Greek religion.&lt;ref name=borellahani/&gt; After his retirement, in addition to his prolific activity as an author of [[Traditionalist School|Traditional]] works, he became a frequent collaborator of journals like [[:fr:Connaissance des religions|''Connaissance des Religions'']] and [[:fr:Vers la tradition|''Vers la tradition'']]. Hani has been praised for his studies on Christian symbolism, particularly on the mass&lt;ref&gt;''The Divine Liturgy: Insights Into Its Mystery'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the esoterism of Christian architecture.&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolism of the Christian Temple'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three kinds of works may be discerned within Hani's production: works of Classical philology, works dealing with history of religions and works dealing with traditional and sacred symbolism. The first group is represented by his annotated translations of [[Plutarch]], published partly within the well-known [[Collection Budé]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarque, ''Oeuvres morales Tome VIII : Traités 42-45''. He also collaborated in Plutarque, ''Oeuvres morales Tome II : Traités 10-14''.&lt;/ref&gt; The second group is represented by his doctoral dissertation mentioned above.&lt;ref name="hanithese"/&gt; And the third group includes works like ''Le Symbolisme du temple chrétien'' (1962), ''Les Métiers de Dieu'' (1975), ''La Divine liturgie'' (1981) and ''La Royauté sacrée'' (1984)&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;See bibliography below.&lt;/ref&gt; where his mastery of traditional hermeneutics and exegesis is firmly established. These books have been translated into English and several other European languages.&lt;ref name="biblio"/&gt;

According to [[Jean Borella]],&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt; the principles expounded in ''Le Symbolisme du temple chrétien'' have already been put into practice in the establishment of some contemporary monastic foundations.{{examples|date=October 2011}} Borella also considers Hani to be the first author in academia to successfully marry [[René Guénon|Guénon]]'s insights to the contemporary study of Hellenistic religions and Christianity.&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt;

'''''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang''''' is a 2005 American [[neo-noir]] [[black comedy]] [[crime film]] written and directed by [[Shane Black]] (in his directorial debut), and starring [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Val Kilmer]], [[Michelle Monaghan]] and [[Corbin Bernsen]]. The script is partially based on the [[Brett Halliday]] novel ''Bodies Are Where You Find Them'', and interprets the classic [[hardboiled]] literary genre in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] fashion. The film was produced by [[Joel Silver]], with [[Susan Downey]] (credited as Susan Levin) and Steve Richards as executive producers.

Shot in [[Los Angeles]] between February 24 and May 3, 2004, the film debuted at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 14,&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4254587/year/2005.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang|accessdate=December 12, 2009|work=Festival Cannes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a limited release in cinemas on October 21, 2005.

==Plot==
At a Los Angeles party, Harry Lockhart recounts recent events. Fleeing a botched burglary in New York City, Harry's friend is shot, forcing Harry to evade police by ducking into an audition. Harry unintentionally impresses the producers with an outburst of remorse they mistake for [[method acting]], and is sent to Los Angeles to take a [[screen test]] for the role of a detective. At a Hollywood party, Harry meets private investigator Perry van Shrike, hired to give Harry on-the-job experience for his role, and party host Harlan Dexter, a retired actor who recently resolved a ten-year feud over his wife's inheritance with his daughter, Veronica. He also encounters his childhood crush Harmony Lane but wakes up in bed with her hostile friend. He runs over to Harmony's place at 6 a.m. to apologize.

During a stakeout, Perry and Harry witness a vehicle being dumped in a lake and are spotted by the apparent killers. Perry realizes there's something in the trunk of the car and shoots the lock in a rescue attempt but accidentally hits the female corpse inside as well. They cannot report the body because it appears Perry killed her.

Harmony contacts Harry, explaining that her sister Jenna came to Los Angeles, stole Harmony's credit cards, and later killed herself. Believing Harry is a detective, Harmony asks him to investigate Jenna's death as a murder. After she leaves, Harry discovers the lake corpse in his bathroom and a planted pistol. Harry and Perry dump the corpse, later identified as Veronica Dexter by police. Harry discovers it was Harmony's credit card that was used to hire Perry to come to the lake, tying Jenna to their case. He goes to see Harmony, who accidentally slams the door on his finger, cutting it off, and she takes him to the hospital.

At a party where Harmony is working, Harry is abducted, beaten, threatened, and ordered to cease the investigation by the killers from the lake and then let go. While taking Harry back to the hospital, Harmony sees the killers heading to Perry's stakeout. Realizing that Perry is heading into a trap, she leaves Harry in her car and rushes off to the stakeout, where she saves Perry, and one of the killers gets shot to death by a food-cart operator. A pink-haired girl, affiliated with the killers, steals Harmony's car and unwittingly drives an unconscious Harry to her safe house. The remaining lake killer arrives and shoots her; Harry recovers the pistol and shoots the killer. His finger has fallen off again, so he puts it on ice, but a dog jumps up and eats it. Harmony meets Harry at his hotel where she reveals she had told Jenna that Harlan Dexter was her real father. They quarrel in bed, when Harmony reveals she had previously slept with Harry's best friend, and he throws her out, being careful not to slam her fingers in the door.

After Harmony disappears following a lead, Harry and Perry investigate a private health clinic owned by Harlan Dexter. Perry realizes Veronica Dexter was incarcerated there by Harlan so an impostor could drop her court case. The pair capture a guard to question him but accidentally kill him and then are captured by Dexter. He reveals he now plans to cremate his daughter's corpse to remove any remaining evidence. Harry calls Harmony, who had not actually disappeared but had simply gone to work. Harmony steals the van containing the coffin. Harry and Perry escape, but Harmony crashes the van. Perry is incapacitated in the ensuing shootout; Harry manages to kill Dexter and his thugs but is also shot.

Waking in a hospital, Harry finds that Perry and Harmony are fine. Perry reveals Harmony's sister was not murdered but committed suicide. Jenna had escaped her [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusive]] father in Indiana and located Dexter, believing him to be her real father. She accidentally witnessed Dexter having sex with Veronica's impostor, the pink-haired girl. Believing this father was also [[incest]]uous, Jenna commissioned Perry and committed suicide.

Perry travels back to Harmony's hometown and confronts Jenna's father, who is now bed-ridden, slapping him multiple times and calling him an animal. When the old man berates Perry for attacking a helpless old man, Perry says simply, "Yeah, that's right. Big tough guy," and leaves.

Having lost the movie role to [[Colin Farrell]], Harry gets a job working for Perry.

==Production==
Following the bad critical reception of ''[[The Long Kiss Goodnight]]'' and a rejection letter from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], Shane Black decided he would attempt something out of the action genre.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Following the example of [[James L. Brooks]], Black attempted to make a romantic comedy, "a quirky story of two kids in L.A."

I have to put a murder in it.'" - and rework the screenplay, adding the character of detective "Gay" Perry,&lt;ref name=gq/&gt; who Black said was an attempt to break stereotypes, as he had never seen "the gay guy who kicks down the door, shoots everyone and bails your ass out before."&lt;ref name=prem/&gt; Old detective novels were a major influence, with Black saying he tried to re-invent the genre "using realistic characters, in a modern setting but with the spirit of 1950s and 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/awards/black-back-in-onscreen-action-1117931441/Black|title=Review: 'Black'|first=Jordan|last=Mintzer|date=1 August 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crime plot drew from [[Brett Halliday]]'s ''Bodies Are Where You Find Them'', and Black homaged [[Raymond Chandler]] by splitting the film into chapters named after Chandler's books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film4.com/special-features/interviews/shane-black-on-kiss-kiss-bang-bang Shane Black on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[principal photography]] begun, the title became ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' because Black felt it was a "blunt and austere title" that described how the plot was "half romantic comedy and half murder mystery."&lt;ref name=chud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chud.com/5030/interview-shane-black-kiss-kiss-bang-bang/|title=INTERVIEW: SHANE BLACK (KISS KISS, BANG BANG)|date=9 November 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve a [[neo-noir]] look, Black screened 1960s films of the genre to cinematographer [[Michael Barrett (cinematographer)|Michael Barrett]] and production designer Aaron Osborne, such as ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' and ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]''. Osborne in particular drew inspiration from the detective book covers by illustrator Robert McGuinness, who was also brought in to draw the covers for the fictional Johnny Gossamer novels that appear in the film.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.thecia.com.au/reviews/k/kiss-kiss-bang-bang-production-notes.rtf|title=''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' production notes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hollywood party that opens the film was filmed in Black's own Los Angeles mansion.&lt;ref name=gq&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/shot-callers-shane-black-the-nice-guys|title=The Real Reason Why Iron Man 3 Scrapped Its Female Villain|first=Zach|last=Baron|date=16 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' was screened out of competition at the 2005 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/comfy-fest-nest-1117921324/|title=Comfy fest nest|first=Alison|last=James|date=19 April 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's premiere happened at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Chinese Theatre]] on October 17, as the opener of the [[Hollywood Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=prem&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/scene/markets-festivals/kiss-and-tell-time-2-1117931302/|title='Kiss' and tell time|first=Maressa|last=Brown|date=20 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' was released on DVD June 13, 2006.

===Box office===
The film opened on October 21 in the United States, with a [[limited release]]. From its release until mid-November, the film's distribution increased every weekend due to its favorable critical reviews. It stayed in release in the United States until early January.&lt;ref name="mojoopening"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (2005) - Weekend Box Office|work=Box Office Mojo| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=kisskissbangbang.htm|accessdate=April 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned a total of $4,243,756 in the United States.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt; ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' grossed far more outside the United States, accounting for just over 70% of the film's worldwide gross, accumulating $11,541,392.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt; The film ended up earning $15,785,148 worldwide, earning back its budget.&lt;ref name="mojo"/&gt; Downey was disappointed at the low box office intake, but said ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang''  "ended up being my calling card to ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''," as his performance attracted director [[Jon Favreau]]. That film marked Downey's career resurrection, and Black would even be brought in to co-write and direct the sequel ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 85% based on 174 reviews and an average rating of 7.5/10. The critical consensus reads, "Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and spot-on performances in this dark, eclectic neo-noir homage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kiss_kiss_bang_bang/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)] ''Rotten Tomatoes''&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score 72 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kiss-kiss-bang-bang|title=Kiss Kiss Bang Bang|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Russell (author)|Mike Russell]] of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' observed that "This is one of Downey's most enjoyable performances, and one of Kilmer's funniest. It's a relationship comedy wrapped in sharp talk and gunplay, a triumphant comeback for Black, and one of the year's best movies".&lt;ref name=oregonlive&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't miss the 'Kiss' |work=OregonLive.com |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/entertainment/1131575115286180.xml&amp;coll=7|accessdate=January 27, 2006|author=Mike Russell|authorlink=Mike Russell (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Otto, an [[IGN]] critic, wrote that "It takes a bunch of genres and twists them into a blender, a pop relic that still feels current...one of the best times I've had at the movies this year."&lt;ref name="otto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang Review|work=[[IGN]] |url=http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/660/660049p1.html|accessdate=January 27, 2006|author=Jeff Otto}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was voted "Overlooked Film of the Year" by the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society on December 20, 2005.

[[Roger Ebert]]'s review of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' was a mixed 2.5 out of 4 stars. He wrote that the film "contains a lot of comedy and invention, but doesn't much benefit from its clever style. The characters and plot are so promising that maybe Black should have backed off and told the story deadpan, instead of mugging so shamelessly for laughs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/kiss-kiss-bang-bang-2005|title=Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang|author=Roger Ebert|date=20 October 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' with music by [[John Ottman]] was released on October 18, 2005.

{{about||open source video games|List of open source video games|commercial games which were released as freeware without source code|List of commercial video games released as freeware}}
This is a '''list of commercial video games with [[Source-available software|available source code]]'''. The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.

== Motivation ==
Commercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware]].

== Description ==
In several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[Sourceforge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. In some cases when a game's source code is not available by other means, the game's community "reconstructs" source code from compiled [[binary file]]s through time-demanding [[reverse engineering]] techniques. 
Source code availability in whatever form allows the games' communities to study how the game works, make modifications, and provide technical support themselves when the official support has ended, e.g. with [[unofficial patch]]es to fix bugs or [[source port]]s to make the game compatible with new [[Computing platform|platforms]].

Troubling admissions have surfaced over the years concerning video game preservation. When questions concerning re-releases of certain game titles are brought up during interviews with developers, for example, these developers would reveal issues of game production material being lost or destroyed. Certain game titles could not see a re-release due to various issues. One story began to circulate of source code being lost altogether for a well-known RPG, preventing its re-release on a new console.'' |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=January 10, 2013 |date=January 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422061043/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6271/where_games_go_to_sleep_the_game_.php?print=1 |archivedate=April 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1up2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=bubble-bobble&amp;page=detail&amp;id=343 |quote=''In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganization - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports.'' |publisher=Arcade History |title=Bubble Bobble |date=September 11, 2012 |accessdate=January 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930080731/http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=bubble-bobble&amp;page=detail&amp;id=343 |archivedate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5028197/sega-cant-find-the-source-code-for-your-favorite-old-school-arcade-games |first=Adam |last=Barenblat |publisher=Kotaku |title=Sega Can't Find The Source Code For Your Favorite Old School Arcade Games |accessdate=December 1, 2013 |date=July 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220054955/http://kotaku.com/5028197/sega-cant-find-the-source-code-for-your-favorite-old-school-arcade-games |archivedate=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-hd-was-made-from-incomplete-code-228158.phtml Silent Hill HD was made from incomplete code] on [[Destructoid]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016115830/http://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-hd-was-made-from-incomplete-code-228158.phtml |date=October 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gameoverviews.com/oh-my-silent-hill-hd-collections-sucked-because-konami-lost-the-source-code/ oh-my-silent-hill-hd-collections-sucked-because-konami-lost-the-source-code] on gameoverviews.com (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconera.com/2013/06/25/kingdom-hearts-1-data-is-lost-square-had-to-recreate-everything-for-hd/ kingdom-hearts-1-data-is-lost-square-had-to-recreate-everything-for-hd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101001527/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/06/25/kingdom-hearts-1-data-is-lost-square-had-to-recreate-everything-for-hd/ |date=2017-01-01 }} on siliconera.com (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; On the closure of [[Atari]] in [[Sunnyvale, California]] in 1996, the original source code of several milestones of video game history (like [[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]] or [[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]) were thrown out as trash.&lt;ref name="atari1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Atari-7800-Source-Code,news-4187.html |title=Atari 7800 Source Code Rescued – Atari released the source code for the 7800 console and games |accessdate=January 9, 2012 |date=July 7, 2009 |first=Kevin |last=Parrish |publisher=tomsguide.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422035825/http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Atari-7800-Source-Code%2Cnews-4187.html |archivedate=April 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atari2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/7800/games/ |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090706155155/http://www.atarimuseum.com//videogames//consoles//7800//games// |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 6, 2009 |title=7800 Games &amp; Development |quote=''These games were rescued from Atari ST format diskettes that were thrown out behind 1196 Borregas when Atari closed up in 1996.

When much time and manual work is invested it is however still possible to recover or restore a source code variant which replicates the program's functions accurately from the binary program. Techniques used here are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]] and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but a diverging version as a binary program does not contain all information originally carried in the original source code. Comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information. The here given in [[Top-down and bottom-up design|"bottom up" development methodology]] re-created source-code of games is able to replicate the behaviour of the original game exactly ("clock-cycle accurate", "pixel-per-pixel accurate"), unlike [[game engine recreation]]s which are often made in top down methodology resulting in general [[game engine]]s and not accurately representing the original game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2570">'''Láir Bhán''' is a [[hobby horse]] that was part of a [[tradition|folk custom]] found in parts of Ireland, particularly in the area of [[County Kerry]], in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The Irish term "Láir Bhán" translates as "White Mare".{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=153}} This meaning is identical, and pronounced similarly to, the [[Manx language|Manx]] hobby horse custom known as the ''Laare Vane''.{{sfnm|1a1=Peate|1y=1963|1p=95|2a1=Cawte|2y=1978|2p=156}} It also has parallels with the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name of the ''[[Mari Lwyd]]'', a hobby horse found in southern Wales, which has been translated as "Grey Mare".{{sfn|Peate|1963|p=95}}

Most records of the tradition come from [[County Kerry]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=155}} There are various reported instances in which the Láir Bhán accompanied the [[Wren Boys]] during their Christmas time activities.{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=155}}

An example of a Láir Bhán is in the collection of the [[National Museum of Ireland]].{{sfn|Cawte|1978|p=155}}

Although the origins of the hooded animal traditions in the British Isles are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Hutton|1996|pp=93–94}} In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's [[Morris dance]] tradition, which became a "nation-wide craze" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into "a set of sharply delineated regional traditions".{{sfn|Hutton|1996|p=94}}

The '''Portable Document Format''' ('''PDF''') is a [[file format]] developed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] in the 1990s to present [[document]]s, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of [[application software]], [[Computer hardware|hardware]], and [[operating system]]s.&lt;ref name="pdf-ref-1.7"&gt;Adobe Systems Incorporated, [https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf PDF Reference, Sixth edition, version 1.23 (30&amp;nbsp;MB)], Nov 2006, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/warnock_camelot.pdf|title=The Camelot Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[PostScript]] language, each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, including the text, [[font]]s, [[vector graphics]], [[raster images]] and other information needed to display it. PDF was standardized as an [[open format]], ISO 32000, in 2008, and no longer requires any royalties for its implementation.

Today, PDF files may contain a variety of content besides flat text and graphics including logical structuring elements, interactive elements such as annotations and form-fields, layers, [[rich media]] (including video content) and three dimensional objects using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]], and various other data formats.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The PDF specification also provides for encryption and [[digital signatures]], file attachments and metadata to enable workflows requiring these features.

== History and standardization ==

{{Main|History of the Portable Document Format (PDF)}}

[[Adobe Systems]] made the PDF specification available free of charge in 1993. In the early years PDF was popular mainly in [[desktop publishing]] [[workflow]]s, and competed with a variety of formats such as [[DjVu]], [[Envoy (WordPerfect)|Envoy]], Common Ground Digital Paper, Farallon Replica and even Adobe's own [[PostScript]] format.

PDF was a [[proprietary format]] controlled by Adobe until it was released as an [[open standard]] on July 1, 2008, and published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] as ISO 32000-1:2008,&lt;ref name="iso-standard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51502 |title=ISO 32000-1:2008 – Document management – Portable document format – Part 1: PDF 1.7 |publisher=Iso.org |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orion |first=Egan |title=PDF 1.7 is approved as ISO 32000 |work=[[The Inquirer]] |publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |date=2007-12-05 |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2007/12/05/pdf-approved-iso-32000 |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004627/http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2007/12/05/pdf-approved-iso-32000 |archivedate=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at which time control of the specification passed to an ISO Committee of volunteer industry experts. In 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO 32000-1 granting [[royalty-free]] rights for all patents owned by Adobe that are necessary to make, use, sell, and distribute PDF compliant implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/pdf/pdfs/ISO32000-1PublicPatentLicense.pdf |title=Public Patent License, ISO 32000-1: 2008 – PDF 1.7 |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDF 1.7, the sixth edition of the PDF specification that became ISO 32000-1, includes some proprietary technologies defined only by Adobe, such as [[XFA|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) and [[JavaScript]] extension for Acrobat, which are referenced by ISO 32000-1 as [[normative]] and indispensable for the full implementation of the ISO 32000-1 specification. These proprietary technologies are not standardized and their specification is published only on Adobe’s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2013:0224:FIN:EN:PDF |title=Guide for the procurement of standards-based ICT – Elements of Good Practice, Against lock-in: building open ICT systems by making better use of standards in public procurement |quote=Example: ISO/IEC 29500, ISO/IEC 26300 and ISO 32000 for document formats reference information that is not accessible by all parties (references to proprietary technology and brand names, incomplete scope or dead web links). |publisher=European Commission |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-meeting-n603"&gt;{{citation |url=http://pdf.editme.com/files/pdfREF-meetings/ISO-TC171-SC2-WG8_N0603_SC2WG8_MtgRept_SLC.pdf |title=ISO/TC 171/SC 2/WG 8 N 603 – Meeting Report |quote=XFA is not to be ISO standard just yet. ...

On July 28, 2017, ISO 32000-2:2017 (PDF 2.0) was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/news/ref2199.html|title=The worldwide standard for electronic documents is evolving|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO 32000-2 does not include any proprietary technologies as normative references.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/63534.html|title=ISO 32000-2 – Document management -- Portable document format -- Part 2: PDF 2.0|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical foundations ==
The PDF combines three technologies:
* A subset of the [[PostScript]] page description programming language, for generating the layout and graphics.
* A [[font embedding|font-embedding]]/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with the documents.
* A structured storage system to bundle these elements and any associated content into a single file, with [[data compression]] where appropriate.

=== PostScript ===
[[PostScript]] is a [[page description language]] run in an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] to generate an image, a process requiring many resources. It can handle graphics and standard features of [[programming language]]s such as &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as &lt;code&gt;lineto&lt;/code&gt; remain.

Often, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.

As a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:
* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.
* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.
* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied with).

== Technical overview ==

=== File structure ===

A PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.
A PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as &lt;code&gt;%PDF-1.7&lt;/code&gt;. The format is a subset of a COS ("Carousel" Object Structure) format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/|title=In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML|author=Jim Pravetz|work=jimpravetz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''
* Numbers
* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (&lt;code&gt;(...)&lt;/code&gt;), may contain 8-bit characters.
* Names, starting with a forward slash (&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (&lt;code&gt;[...]&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;)
* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary
* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object
Furthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.

Objects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;endobj&lt;/code&gt; keywords. An index table, also called the cross-reference table and marked with the &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt; keyword, follows the main body and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams''. This technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''.

At the end of a PDF file is a trailer introduced with the &lt;code&gt;trailer&lt;/code&gt; keyword. It contains

* A dictionary
* An offset to the start of the cross-reference table (the table starting with the &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt; keyword)
* And the &lt;code&gt;%%EOF&lt;/code&gt; [[end-of-file]] marker.

The dictionary contains

* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog''
* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table
* And other optional information.

There are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not "optimized") and linear ("optimized"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called "optimized" or "web optimized" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.&lt;ref name="pdf-ref"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].

=== Imaging model ===
The basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.

PDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:
* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system
* The ''[[clipping path]]''
* The ''[[color space]]''
* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency

==== Vector graphics ====
As in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[Bézier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.

PDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). &lt;!-- Pictures desperately needed here! --&gt;

==== Raster images ====
[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters
* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]
* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact
* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})
* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification
* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters
* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard
* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6
* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4
* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5

Normally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.

==== Text ====
Text in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.

===== Fonts =====
A font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. &lt;!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up ---&gt;

===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====
Fourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:
* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)
* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)
* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)
* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]
* [[Zapf Dingbats]]
These fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts – Definition|work=About.com Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.&lt;ref name="aquarium"&gt;[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]&lt;/ref&gt; Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.

===== Encodings =====
Within text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.

For large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.

==== Transparency ====
The original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.

The transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of "group" or "layer" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects,
but they are not part of the imaging model.

=== Interactive elements ===

PDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.

'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.

'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.

PDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in PDF specification:&lt;ref name="iso32000"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management – Portable Document Format – Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF – PDF Knowledge – Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733 |title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm? |year=2008 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.
* '''[[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA)''' forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification. Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tips/topic_tip2.html |title=Migrating from Adobe Acrobat forms to XML forms |accessdate=2010-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006151011/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tips/topic_tip2.html |archivedate=2010-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; XFA was deprecated from PDF with PDF 2.0.

==== AcroForms ====
AcroForms were introduced in the PDF 1.2 format. AcroForms permit using objects (''e.g.'' [[text box]]es, [[Radio button]]s, ''etc.'') and some code (''e.g.'' [[JavaScript]]).

Alongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The "submit" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action’s ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):&lt;ref name="iso32000" /&gt;
* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)
* Forms Data Format (FDF)
* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the "XML" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4)
* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values). (defined in PDF 1.4)

AcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The external files may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/325/325874.html |title=Using Acrobat forms and form data on the web |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xfdf"&gt;{{citation |url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfdf_2.0.pdf |format=PDF |title=XML Forms Data Format Specification, version 2 |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223042129/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/xfdf_2.0.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fdf-exchange"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/fdf_data_exchange.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDF Data Exchange Specification |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text ([[comma-separated values|CSV]]/[[delimiter-separated values|TSV]]) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.&lt;ref name="iso32000" /&gt;

The Forms Data Format (FDF) is based on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.

Beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to define a container for annotations that are separate from the PDF document they apply to. FDF typically encapsulates information such as [[X.509]] certificates, requests for certificates, directory settings, timestamp server settings, and embedded PDF files for network transmission.&lt;ref name="fdf-exchange" /&gt; The FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf, filename extension .fdf and on Mac OS it uses file type 'FDF'.&lt;ref name="iso32000" /&gt;

XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary – such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.&lt;ref name="xfdf" /&gt; The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.

As of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 – Document management – XML Forms Data Format – Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 – Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.

XFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.

==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====
In PDF 1.5, [[Adobe Systems]] introduced a proprietary format for forms; Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1 / PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).

=== Logical structure and accessibility ===

A "tagged" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and accessibility. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including assistive technology (AT), is uneven at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate

An ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.

===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===
With the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.
Basically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.

=== Security and signatures ===

A PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication. However, since a SHA-1 collision was discovered making use of the PDF format, digital signatures using SHA-1 have been shown to be insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shattered.io/|title=SHAttered – We have broken SHA-1 in practice|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemypdf.com/|title=FreeMyPDF.com – Removes passwords from viewable PDFs|work=freemypdf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.

Even without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission "protections" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html |title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker |author= Jeremy Kirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Usage rights ====
Beginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:&lt;ref name="iso32000" /&gt;
* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data
* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats
* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats
* Submit form data
* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates
* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field
* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations

For example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.&lt;ref name="iso32000" /&gt;

=== File attachments ===

PDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.

=== Metadata ===
PDF files can contain two types of metadata.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.

In PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.

=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===

PDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.

PDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.

PDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.

=== Default display settings ===
PDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914|title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &amp;gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.

== Intellectual property ==

Anyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|work=adobe.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical issues ==

=== Accessibility ===
PDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more. Some software can automatically produce tagged PDFs, but this feature is not always enabled by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Export_as_PDF#PDF.2FA-1a |title=LibreOffice Help – Export as PDF |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oooninja.com/2008/01/generating-pdfa-for-long-term-archiving.html |title=Exporting PDF/A for long-term archiving |date=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[screen reader]]s, including [[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]], [[Window-Eyes]], Hal, and [[Kurzweil Educational Systems|Kurzweil 1000 and 3000]] can read tagged PDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/tip-of-the-week-adobe-readers-read-aloud-feature/ |title=Tip of the Week: Adobe Reader’s ‘Read Aloud’ Feature |accessdate=2010-04-24 | work=The New York Times | date=2009-04-10 |first=J.D. |last=Biersdorfer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/pdfs/accessing-pdf-sr.pdf |format=PDF |title=Accessing PDF documents with assistive technology: A screen reader user's guide |publisher=Adobe |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, tagged PDFs can be re-flowed and magnified for readers with visual impairments. Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.

One of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.

[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289-1 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.

=== Viruses and exploits ===
{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}
PDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus "Peachy"], 15 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

From time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson – SecurityNow Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.

On March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|work=PCMAG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
A PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:
* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])
* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines
* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image
* Multimedia objects in the document

In later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.

PDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF – 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.&lt;ref name="3d#1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3d#2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat3d/ |title=Acrobat 3D Developer Center |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.

== Software ==
{{Details|List of PDF software}}
PDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.

There are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2) |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.

[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws® 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].

=== Editing ===
{{Expand section|date=July 2010|reason=[[hybrid PDF]], a variant of [[LibreOffice]] isn't mentioned}}
[[Adobe Illustrator]] reads and writes PDF as a semi-native format. With multipage documents, a dialog opens enabling the user to select a single page to edit. Editing paragraphs of text typically disturbs line justification and paragraph wrapping, as multiline text is converted to individual lines. In a multipage document, only the page being edited can be re-saved.

[[Inkscape]] version 0.46 and later allows PDF editing of a single page through an intermediate translation step involving [[Poppler (software)|Poppler]], then the document can be exported again as PDF.

[[Scribus]] allows opening and editing multi-page PDF, then the document can be exported again as PDF.

[[LibreOffice]] Draw (using a plugin PDFimport) can open and edit multi-page PDF, then the document can be exported again as PDF.

[[Serif PagePlus]] can open, edit and save existing PDF documents, as well as publishing of documents created in the package.

Enfocus PitStop Pro, a plugin for Acrobat, allows manual and automatic editing of PDF files,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfocus.com/product.php?id=855|title=Preflight and edit PDF files in Acrobat|work=enfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the free Enfocus Browser makes it possible to edit the low-level structure of a PDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfocus.com/product.php?id=4530|title=Enfocus product overview – online store|work=enfocus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dochub]], is a free online PDF editing tool that can be used without purchasing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DocHub|url = http://www.dochub.com|website = DocHub|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foxit_Software#Foxit_PhantomPDF|Foxit]] PhantomPDF is a proprietary PDF editor with an extensive set of advanced features for editing, converting and protecting PDF documents.

=== Conversions ===
Documents saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be converted back and forth from many other formats such as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Microsoft Office formats, 
* Rich Text Format, 
* Open office,
* WordPerfect, 
* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, 
* Windows Metafile,
* Enhanced Metafile,
* Graphics Interchange Format,
* Microsoft HD Photo File,
* JPEG File Interchange,
* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,
* Portable Network Graphics,
* Tagged Image File,
* HyperText Markup Language,
* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,
* Scalable Vector Graphics,
* Microsoft Outlook, Text,
* XML Paper Specification,
* Extensible Markup Language,
* Silverlight XPS Document,
* Extensible Application Markup Language 
etc.

Companies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]], libraries for developer to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides [[Adobe PDF Library]], companies such as [[PDFTron Systems]], [[Apache PDFBox]], [[Foxit Software]], PDFLib &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pdflib.com/products/pdflib-family/overview/|title=The PDFlib Product Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide similar SDKs.

=== Annotation ===
{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}
[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. Another GPL-licensed application native to the unix environment is Xournal. Xournal allows for annotating in different fonts and colours, as well as a rule for quickly underlining and highlighting lines of text or paragraphs. Xournal also has a shape recognition tool for squares, rectangles and circles. In Xournal annotations may be moved, copied and pasted. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs.

For mobile annotation, '''iAnnotate PDF''' (from Branchfire) and [[GoodReader]] (from Aji) allow annotation of PDFs as well as exporting summaries of the annotations.

There are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats, e.g., [[A.nnotate]], '''crocodoc''', WebNotes.

In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required. Some programs that accept ink input from the mouse may not be responsive enough for handwriting input on a tablet. Existing solutions on the PC include '''PDF Annotator''' and [[Qiqqa]].

=== Other ===
Examples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.

In 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip|title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.

Many commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] "For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs." (last checked on 2009-02-10).&lt;/ref&gt; The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.

PDF was selected as the "native" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.

In 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the [[Open Source Development Labs]] Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the [[CUPS|Common Unix Printing System]] and desktop application projects such as [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PDF as Standard Print Job Format|url=http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format|website=The Linux Foundation|publisher=[[Linux Foundation]]|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. Currently, all PDF capable printers also support PostScript, but most PostScript printers do not support direct PDF printing.

The [[Free Software Foundation]] once considered one of their [[High priority free software projects|high priority projects]] to be "developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard."&lt;ref&gt;On 2014-04-02, a note dated 2009-02-10 referred to [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] as a source. Content of the latter page, however, changes over time.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Goals_and_Motivations |title=Goals and Motivations |authors=GNUpdf contributors| publisher=''GNUpdf'' |date=2007-11-28 |website=gnupdf.org |accessdate=2014-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, however, the '''GNU PDF''' project was removed from the list of "high priority projects" due to the maturation of the [[Poppler (software)|Poppler library]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNU PDF project leaves FSF High Priority Projects list; mission complete! |url=http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/gnu-pdf-project-leaves-high-priority-projects-list-mission-complete|date=2011-10-06|first=Matt|last=Lee|publisher=Free Software Foundation|website=fsf.org|accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has enjoyed wider use in applications such as [[Evince]] with the [[GNOME]] desktop environment. Poppler is based on [[Xpdf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://poppler.freedesktop.org/ Poppler homepage] "Poppler is a PDF rendering library based on the xpdf-3.0 code base." (last checked on 2009-02-10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/README-XPDF Xpdf license] "Xpdf is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or 3." (last checked on 2012-09-23).&lt;/ref&gt; code base. There are also commercial development libraries available as listed in [[List of PDF software]].

The [[Apache PDFBox]] project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]] is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents. PDFBox is licensed under the [[Apache License]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdfbox.apache.org/ The Apache PDFBox project] . Retrieved 2009-09-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5649">The '''Pali Text Society''' is a [[text publication society]] founded in 1881 by [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] "to foster and promote the study of [[Pāli]] texts".

Pāli is the language in which the texts of the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]] is preserved. The Pāli texts are the oldest collection of Buddhist scriptures preserved in the language in which they were written down.

The society first compiled, edited, and published [[Latin script]] versions of a large corpus of Pāli literature, including the [[Pāli Canon]], as well as commentarial, [[exegesis|exegetical texts]], and histories. It publishes translations of many Pāli texts. It also publishes ancillary works including dictionaries, concordances, books for students of Pāli and a journal.

==History==
Thomas William Rhys Davids was one of three British civil servants who were posted to [[Sri Lanka]], in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the others being [[George Turnour]], and [[Robert Caesar Childers]] (1838–1876). At this time Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then [[Ceylon]]) was struggling under the weight of foreign rule and intense missionary activity by [[Christians]]. It was an administrative requirement that all civil servants should be familiar with the language, literature, and culture of the land in which they were posted, so the three men studied with several scholar monks where, along with an introduction to Sinhala culture and language, they became interested in Buddhism.

The ''Pāli Text Society'' was founded on the model of the [[Early English Text Society]] with Rhys Davids counting on support from a lot of European scholars and Sri Lankan scholar monks. The work of bringing out the Roman text editions of the Pāli Canon was not financially rewarding, but was achieved with the backing of the Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka who underwrote the printing costs.

Childers published the first Pāli-English dictionary in 1874. This was superseded in 1925 by the new dictionary which had largely been compiled by T.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Rhys Davids over 40&amp;nbsp;years, but was finished by his student [[William Stede]]. Currently another dictionary is being compiled by [[Margaret Cone]], with the first of three volumes (A - Kh) published in 2001.

By 1922, when T.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Rhys Davids died, the ''Pāli Text Society'' had issued 64&amp;nbsp;separate texts in 94&amp;nbsp;volumes exceeding 26,000 &amp;nbsp;pages, as well a range of articles by English and European scholars.

== Fragile Palm Leaves ==
In 1994 the Pāli Text Society inaugurated the Fragile Palm Leaves project, an attempt to catalogue and preserve Buddhist [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s from Southeast Asia. Prior to the introduction of printing presses and Western papermaking technology, texts in Southeast Asia—including the Pali scriptures—were preserved by inscription on specially preserved leaves from palm trees. The leaves were then bound together to create a complete manuscript.

While palm-leaf manuscripts have likely been in use since before the 5th century&amp;nbsp;CE, existing examples date from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century and later, with the largest number having been created during the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palitext.com/subpages/project.htm The Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the materials used and the tropical climate, manuscripts from earlier eras are generally not found intact in palm-leaf form, and many manuscripts have been badly damaged. During the colonial era, many palm-leaf manuscripts were disassembled and destroyed, with individual pages of texts being sold as decorative ''objets d'art'' to Western collectors.

The Pāli Text Society created the Fragile Palm Leaves project to collect, catalogue, and preserve these artifacts, including scanning them into electronic formats in order to make them available to researchers without threatening their preservation. In 2001 the project was formalised as a nonprofit in [[Thailand]] as the [[Fragile Palm Leaves Foundation]].

'''Parnell Square''' ({{Irish place name|Cearnóg Parnell|no_translate=yes}}) is a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[town square|square]] sited at the northern end of [[O'Connell Street]], and west of [[Mountjoy Square]], in the city of [[Dublin]] (now Dublin 1), Ireland.

Formerly named ''Rutland Square'', it was renamed after [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846–1891), as was [[Parnell Street]], which forms the southern side of the square. Surrounded on three sides by terraces of original intact [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian houses]], much of the southern part of the square and its centre is taken up by extensions of the [[Rotunda Hospital]]. The [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] is located along the northern side of this area. Its main entrance is on the eastern side of the square, with a smaller entrance on the northern side of the square.

In the south easterly corner of the square, where it meets with O'Connell Street, is sited the [[Gate Theatre]], and the Ambassador and Pillar Room venues. Entertainments were originally developed here as part of the Rotunda Hospital scheme by [[Bartholomew Mosse]] as a revenue engine to pay for the running of what was Europe's first lying-in maternity hospital. Extensive pleasure gardens, subsequently forming the body of the square, were located to the rear of the hospital in the original development.

The [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery|Hugh Lane Gallery]] is on the north side of the square. It was erected in cut stone by [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|Lord Charlemont]] to a design by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] during the Georgian period. On this side also is the [[Dublin Writers Museum]] and the Irish Writers' Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writerscentre.ie Irish Writer's Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt; The striking [[Gothic Revival]] Findlater's Church ([[Abbey Presbyterian Church, Dublin|Abbey Presbyterian Church]]) just up from the gallery on the same side was erected in the 1860s by Alexander Findlater, at his own expense, and which he presented to the [[Presbyterian]] congregation. One of Dublin's most acclaimed{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} restaurants, Michelin Star since 2007, ''Chapter One'', is located on the northern side of Parnell Square between the [[Hugh Lane Gallery]] and the Writers Museum. On the south side of the square is Conway's bar (now closed), outside of which [[Pearse]] surrendered to the [[British Army]] after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. The political party [[Sinn Féin]] has its Dublin head office and shop on the western side of the square.  The western side also is known for offices of a number of [[Irish Congress of Trades Unions|trades unions]] and other organisations.  Also on the western side is the St. Martin's Apostolate office, which includes a small basement chapel.  The St. Martin's Apostolate office is well known in Dublin for its moving [[Nativity scene|crib]] that is open to the public each Christmas.

==Famous historic residents and events==
[[File:Dublin September 2009 061 b pt.jpg|thumb|200px|Dublin Writers' Museum]]

No 5 – Birthplace of [[Oliver St John Gogarty]] (1878–1957); writer, surgeon, and senator. A friend of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and the writers [[WB Yeats]] and [[James Joyce]], Gogarty was unwillingly immortalised as [[Buck Mulligan]] in the ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. From the early 1920s until the early 1930s No 5 served as headquarters of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]], the governing party.

No 9 Cavendish Row – Dr [[Bartholomew Mosse]] (1713–1759); Philanthropist and surgeon. Mosse lived here, having originally hailed from Portlaoise. He founded the Rotunda Hospital, located in the square and which was built to designs of [[Richard Cassels]] between 1751 and 1757. The emergence of Parnell Square as a square is largely attributable to the pleasure gardens him as he laid out pleasure gardens to pay for the hospital.

No. 14 Parnell Square was the headquarters of Conradh na Gaeilge in the 1940s and 1950s and perhaps into the 1960s. The Ard-chraobh of the Gaelic League was in this building.

No 25 Parnell Square, Gaelic League building. This building is of great significance during the period surrounding the War of Independence as it was here on 9 September 1914 that a meeting held by Supreme Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) with selected others agreed to rise up against the British before the Great War, subsequently known as the [[First World War]], would be finished: In attendance were [[Eamonn Ceannt]], [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Thomas Clarke]], [[James Connolly]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[John MacBride]], [[Sean MacDermott]], Sean McGarry, William "Bill" O'Brien, [[Seán T. O'Kelly]], [[Padraig Pearse]], [[Joseph Plunkett]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

No 29 – 30 Parnell Square – Formerly Vaughan's Hotel; a favourite hiding and meeting place for Michael Collins.

[[File:Let's Dance Memorial Parnell Square 1.jpg|thumb|right|Let's Dance memorial to the [[Miami Showband killings]] on Parnell Square North]] 
No 41 Parnell Square – this building was formerly the Irish National Forester's Hall. Prior to 1916 it was used for drilling both by the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) and the Volunteers; on the eve of the outbreak of the [[Easter Rising]] [[Éamon de Valera]] assembled the 3rd Battalion here. In 1922, subsequent to the Treaty and prior to the Civil War, the IRB again met here in a failed attempt at achieving consensus on the Treaty; among the attendees were Michael Collins, [[Harry Boland]], [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] – all of whom, with the exception of O'Duffy, were dead by the end of the [[Irish Civil War]].

No 44 Parnell Square – The [[Kevin Barry]] memorial hall is the current headquarters of [[Sinn Féin]].

No 46 Parnell Square – Formerly the Headquarters of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], the Irish language league, this was the venue where [[Thomas MacDonagh]] assembled the 2nd Battalion the Sunday night on the eve of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. In August 1917, the meetings that led to the National Executive of the [[Irish Republican Army]] being established were also here, with persons present including Éamon de Valera, [[Thomas Ashe]], [[Cathal Brugha]], and Michael Collins. Subsequently on 19 September 1919, in the company of [[Richard Mulcahy]], Michael Collins set up his famous "Squad", composed of top-level operatives – men who would ultimately be involved with highest priority missions, such as the elimination of the British "G Men" agents in 1920.

No 58 Parnell Square – The Sinn Féin Bookshop and the offices of the ''[[An Phoblacht]]'' newspaper.

In June 2015, plans were revealed for the development of the northern side of Parnell Square into a cultural district. The street will be turned into a pedestrian space, the city's main library will move to the former Coláiste Mhuire buildings, a new auditorium will be built, and the gardens attached to the Rotunda Hospital will be opened up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/parnell-square-cultural-quarter-green-light-for-60m-project-1.2237898|title=Parnell Square cultural quarter?

In 1998, Routledge became a subdivision and imprint of its former rival, [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] (T&amp;F), as a result of a £90 million acquisition deal from [[Cinven]], a venture capital group which had purchased it two years previously for £25 million.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The firm originated in 1836, when the London  bookseller [[George Routledge]] published an unsuccessful guidebook, ''The Beauties of Gilsland'' with his brother-in-law W H (William Henry) Warne as assistant. In 1848 the pair entered the booming market for selling inexpensive imprints of works of fiction to rail travellers, in the style of the German [[Tauchnitz]] family, which became known as the "Railway Library".&lt;ref name=railwaylibrary&gt;{{cite web
|title= Yellowbacks: III – Routledge's Railway Library
|url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/yellow/yellow3.html
|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venture was a success as railway usage grew, and it eventually led to Routledge, along with W H Warne's Brother [[Frederick Warne]], to found the company, '''George Routledge &amp; Co.''' in 1851.&lt;ref name=UCL&gt;{{cite web
|title= UCL Library Services: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul Ltd Archives – 1850–1984 |url=http://archives.ucl.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27ROUTLEDGE%27&amp;dsqDb=Catalog
|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;	
The following year in 1852, the company gained lucrative business through selling reprints of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], (in the public domain in the UK) which in turn enabled it to pay author [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] £20,000 for a 10-year [[lease]] allowing sole rights to print all 35 of his works &lt;ref name=railwaylibrary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland (2009:527,553).&lt;/ref&gt; including 19 of his novels to be sold cheaply as part of their "Railway Library" series.
&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=24184|title=Routledge, George|year=2004|last=Barnes|first=James J.|last2=Barnes|first2=Patience P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Routledge stand at Senate House History Day 2018.jpg|thumb|Routledge stand at Senate House History Day 2018]]
The company was restyled in 1858 as '''Routledge, Warne &amp; Routledge''' when George Routledge's son, Robert Warne Routledge, entered the partnership. Frederick Warne eventually left the company after the death of his brother W.H. Warne in May 1859 (died aged 37).&lt;ref name=censusrecord&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining rights to some titles, he founded [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in 1865, which became known for its [[Beatrix Potter]] books.&lt;ref name=ketupa&gt;{{cite web
|title=ketupa.net – Taylor and Francis Informa
|url= http://ketupa.net/tfinforma.htm
|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1865, George Routledge's son [[Edmund Routledge]] became a partner, and the firm became '''George Routledge &amp; Sons'''.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite web|title=Routledge, George (DNB00)|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Routledge,_George_%28DNB00%29|website=DNB|accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1899 the company was running close to bankruptcy. Following a successful restructuring in 1902 by scientist [[Sir William Crookes]], banker [[Arthur Ellis Franklin]], [[William Swan Sonnenschein]] as managing director, and others, however, it was able to recover and began to acquire and merge with other publishing companies including J. C. Nimmo Ltd. in 1903. In 1912 the company took over the management of '''Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Co.''', the descendant of companies founded by [[Charles Kegan Paul]], Alexander Chenevix Trench, [[Nicholas Trübner]], and George Redway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lucile Project,"PUBLISHER: Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Company; Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Company, London" |url=http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/lucile/publishers/kegan/kegan.htm |website=University of Iowa|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early 20th-century acquisitions brought with them lists of notable scholarly titles, and from 1912 onward,  the company became increasingly concentrated in the academic and scholarly publishing business under the imprint "Kegan Paul Trench Trubner", as well as reference, fiction and mysticism. In 1947, George Routledge and Sons finally merged with Kegan Paul Trench Trubner (the umlaut had been quietly dropped in the First World War)  under the name of '''Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul'''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin (1987),&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[C.K Ogden]] and later [[Karl Mannheim]] as advisers the company was soon particularly known for its titles in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and the [[social sciences]].

In 1985, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul joined with [[Associated Book Publishers]] (ABP),&lt;ref&gt;Whipp (1992:47)&lt;/ref&gt; which was later acquired by [[International Thomson]] in 1987. Under Thomson's ownership, Routledge's name and operations were retained, and, in 1996, a [[management buyout]] financed by the European [[private equity]] firm [[Cinven]] saw Routledge operating as an independent company once again. Just two year later, Cinven and Routledge's directors accepted a deal for Routledge's acquisition by [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] (T&amp;F), with the Routledge name being retained as an imprint and subdivision.&lt;ref&gt;Clark &amp; Phillips (2008:xvi); Cope (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, T&amp;F became a division within [[Informa plc]] after a merger. Routledge continues as a primary publishing unit and imprint within Informa's 'academic publishing' division, publishing academic [[humanities]] and [[social science]] books, journals, reference 
works and digital products. Routledge has grown considerably as a result of [[organic growth]] and acquisitions of other publishing companies and other publishers' titles by its parent company.&lt;ref name="T&amp;F"&gt;[http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/taylorfrancis.htm ''Academic Publishing Industry: A Story of Merger and Acquisition''] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67OtiNRT5?url=http://www.ulib.niu.edu/publishers/TaylorFrancis.htm |date=4 May 2012 }} - Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis"&gt;[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="informa2015"&gt;{{cite web |title= Results for 12 months to 31st December 2015|url= http://www.informa.com/Documents/Investor%20Relations/2016/FY2015/20160210%20FY%20Results%20Statement%20-%20Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanities and social sciences titles acquired by T&amp;F from other publishers are [[Rebranding|rebranded]] under the Routledge [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]].&lt;ref name="Taylor &amp; Francis"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35327">'''Source criticism''' (or '''information evaluation''') is the process of evaluating an [[information source]], i.e. a document, a person, a speech, a fingerprint, a photo, an observation, or anything used in order to obtain knowledge. In relation to a given purpose, a given information source may be more or less valid,  reliable or relevant. Broadly, "source criticism" is the interdisciplinary study of how information sources are evaluated for given tasks.

== Meaning ==

Problems in translation: The Danish word "kildekritik" like the Norwegian word "kildekritikk" and the Swedish word "källkritik" derived from the German "Quellenkritik" and is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886). Hardtwig writes: "His [Ranke's] first work ''Geschichte der romanischen und germanischen Völker'' von 1494&amp;ndash;1514 (History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514) (1824) was a great success. It already showed some of the basic characteristics of his conception of Europe, and was of historiographical importance particularly because Ranke made an exemplary critical analysis of his sources in a separate volume, ''Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber'' (On the Critical Methods of Recent Historians). In this work he raised the method of [[textual criticism]] used in the late eighteenth century, particularly in classical philology to the standard method of scientific historical writing" (Hardtwig, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;12739).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The larger part of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries would be dominated by the research-oriented
conception of historical method of the so-called
Historical School in Germany, led by historians as
Leopold Ranke and Berthold Niebuhr. Their conception
of history, long been regarded as the beginning
of modern, 'scientific' history, harked back to the
'narrow' conception of historical method, limiting the
methodical character of history to source criticism" (Lorenz, 2001).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bible studies dominate the use of "source criticism" in America (cf. Hjørland, 2008). The term is thus relatively seldom used in English about [[historical method]]s and [[historiography]] (cf. Hjørland, 2008). This difference between European and American use of "source criticism" is somewhat strange considering the influence of Ranke on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. It has been suggested that differences in the use of the term are not accidental but due to different views of the historical method.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the German/Scandinavian tradition this subject is seen as important, whereas in the Anglo-American tradition it is believed that historical methods must be specific and associated with the subject studied, for which reason there is no general field of "source criticism"{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

In the Scandinavian countries and elsewhere source evaluation (or information evaluation) is also studied interdisciplinarily from many different points of view, partly caused by the influence of the Internet. It is a growing field in, among other fields, [[library and information science]]. In this context source criticism is studied from a broader perspective than just, for example, history or biblical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2012). Methods for evaluating information sources: An annotated catalogue. Journal of information science. 38(3), 258-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balin, A. &amp; Grafstein, A. (2010). The critical assessment of research: Traditional and new methods of evaluation. Oxford: Chandos Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
The following principles are cited from two Scandinavian textbooks on source criticism, Olden-Jørgensen (1998) and Thurén (1997) written by historians:
* Human sources may be relics (e.g. a fingerprint) or narratives (e.g. a statement or a letter). Relics are more credible sources than narratives.
*  A given source may be forged or corrupted; strong indications of the originality of the source increases its reliability.
*  The closer a source is to the event which it purports to describe, the more one can trust it to give an accurate description of what really happened
* A [[primary source]] is more reliable than a [[secondary source]], which in turn is more reliable than a [[tertiary source]] and so on.
*  If a number of ''independent'' sources contain the same message, the credibility of the message is strongly increased.
* The tendency of a source is its motivation for providing some kind of bias. Tendencies should be minimized or supplemented with opposite motivations.
*  If it can be demonstrated that the witness (or source) has no direct interest in creating bias, the credibility of the message is increased.

We may add the following principles:
* Knowledge of source criticism cannot substitute subject knowledge:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Because each source teaches you more and more about your subject, you will be able to judge with ever-increasing precision the usefulness and value of any prospective source. In other words, the more you know about the subject, the more precisely you can identify what you must still find out". (Bazerman, 1995, p. 304).

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The reliability of a given source is relative to the questions put to it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The empirical case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of cognitive authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were frequently used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the actual topic at hand" (Savolainen, 2007).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following questions are often good ones to ask about any source according to the American Library Association (1994) and Engeldinger (1988):

#How was the source located?
#What type of source is it?
#Who is the author and what are the qualifications of the author in regard to the topic that is discussed?
#When was the information published?
#In which country was it published?
#What is the reputation of the publisher?
#Does the source show a particular cultural or political bias?

For literary sources we might add complementing criteria:

#Does the source contain a bibliography?
#Has the material been reviewed by a group of peers, or has it been edited?
#How does the article/book compare with similar articles/books?

==Levels of generality==
How general are principles of source criticism?
Some principles are universal, other principles are specific for certain kinds of information sources. One may ask whether principles of source criticism are unique to the humanities?

There is today no consensus about the similarities and differences between natural science and humanities. [[Logical positivism]] claimed that all fields of knowledge were based on the same principles. Much of the criticism of logical positivism claimed that positivism is the basis of the sciences, whereas [[hermeneutics]] is the basis of the humanities. This was, for example, the position of [[Jürgen Habermas]]. A newer position, in accordance with, among others, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] understands both science and humanities as determined by researchers' preunderstanding and paradigms. Hermeneutics is thus a universal theory.  The difference is, however, that the sources of the humanities are themselves products of human interests and preunderstanding, whereas the sources of the natural sciences are not. Humanities are thus "doubly hermeneutic".

Natural scientists, however, are also using human products (such as scientific papers) which are products of preunderstanding (and, for example, [[academic fraud]]).

==Contributing fields==

===Epistemology===
Epistemological theories are the basic theories about how knowledge is obtained and thus the most general theories about how to evaluate information sources. [[Empiricism]] evaluates sources by considering the observations (or sensations) on which they are based. Sources without basis in experience are not seen as valid. [[Rationalism]] provides low priority to sources based on observations. In order to be meaningful observations must be grasped by clear ideas or concepts. It is the logical structure and the well definedness that is in focus in evaluating information sources from the rationalist point of view. [[Historicism]] evaluates information sources on the basis of their reflection of their sociocultural context and their theoretical development. [[Pragmatism]] evaluate sources on the basis of how their values and usefulness to accomplish certain outcomes. Pragmatism is skeptical about claimed neutral information sources.

The evaluation of knowledge or information sources cannot be more certain than is the construction of knowledge. If we accept the principle of [[fallibilism]] we also have to accept that source criticism can never 100% verify knowledge claims. As discussed in the next section is source criticism intimately linked to [[scientific method]]s.

The presence of '''fallacies of argument''' in sources is another kind of philosophical criteria for evaluating sources. Fallacies are presented by Walton (1998). Among the fallacies are the 'ad hominem fallacy' (the use of personal attack to try to undermine or refute a person's argument) and the 'straw man fallacy' (when one arguer misrepresents another's position to make it appear less plausible than it really is, in order more easily to criticize or refute it.) See also [[fallacy]].

===Research methodology===
Research methods are methods used to produce scholarly knowledge. The methods that are relevant for producing knowledge are also relevant for evaluating knowledge. An example of a book that turns methodology upside-down and uses it to evaluate produced knowledge is Katzer; Cook &amp; Crouch (1998). See also [[Unobtrusive measures]], [[Triangulation (social science)]].

===Science studies===
Studies of quality evaluation processes such as [[peer review]], [[book review]]s and of the normative criteria used in evaluation of scientific and scholarly research. Another field is the study of [[scientific misconduct]].

Harris (1979) provides a case study of how a famous experiment in psychology, [[Little Albert]], has been distorted throughout the history of psychology, starting with the author (Watson) himself, general textbook authors, behavior therapists, and a prominent learning theorist. Harris proposes possible causes for these distortions and analyzes the Albert study as an example of myth making in the history of psychology. Studies of this kind may be regarded a special kind of [[reception history]] (how Watson's paper was received).  It may also be regarded as a kind of critical history (opposed to ceremonial history of psychology, cf. Harris, 1980). Such studies are important for source criticism in revealing the bias introduced by referring to classical studies.

See also Hjørland (2008): [https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212553/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=305 Empirical studies of the quality of science].

===Textual criticism===
Textual criticism (or broader: text philology) is a part of [[philology]], which is not just devoted to the study  of texts, but also to edit and produce "scientific editions", "scholarly editions", "standard editions", "historical editions", "reliable editions", "reliable texts", "text editions"  or "critical editions", which are editions in which careful scholarship has been employed to ensure that the information contained within is as close to the author's/composer's original intentions as possible (and which allows the user to compare and judge changes in editions published under influence by the author/composer). The relation between these kinds of works and the concept "source criticism" is evident in Danish, where they may be termed "kildekritisk udgave" (directly translated "source critical edition").

In other words, it is assumed that most editions of a given works is filled with noise and errors provided by publishers, why it is important to produce "scholarly editions". The work provided by text philology is an important part of source criticism in the humanities.

===Psychology===
The study of [[eyewitness testimony]] is an important field of study used, among other purposes, to evaluate testimony in courts. The basics of eyewitness fallibility includes factors such as poor viewing conditions, brief exposure, and stress. More  subtle factors, such as expectations, biases, and personal stereotypes can intervene to create erroneous reports. Loftus (1996) discuss all such factors and also shows that [[eyewitness memory]] is chronically inaccurate in surprising ways. An ingenious series of experiments reveals that memory can be radically altered by the way an eyewitness is questioned after the fact. New memories can be implanted and old ones unconsciously altered under interrogation.

Anderson (1978) and Anderson &amp; Pichert (1977) reported an elegant experiment demonstrating how change in perspective affected people's ability to recall information that was unrecallable from another perspective.

In psychoanalysis  the concept of [[defence mechanism]] is important and may be considered a contribution to the theory of source criticism because it explains psychological mechanisms, which distort the reliability of human information sources.

===Library and information science (LIS)===
In schools of library and information science (LIS) is source criticism of taught as part of the growing field [[Information literacy]].
Study issues like [[relevance]], quality indicators for documents, kinds of documents and their qualities (e.g. scholarly editions) and related issues are studied in LIS and are relevant for source criticism. [[Bibliometrics]] is often used to find the most influential journal, authors, countries and institutions. The study of [[book review]]s and their function in evaluating books should also be mentioned. The well-known comparison of Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica (Giles, 2005) - although not done by information scientists - contained an interview with an information scientist (Michael Twidale) and should be obvious to include in LIS.

It could be argued that library and information education should provide teaching in source criticism at least at the same level as is taught in Upper Secondary School  (see Gudmundsson, 2007).

In library and information science the checklist approach has often been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210212549/http://www.iva.dk/jni/lifeboat/info.asp?subjectid=308 |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of this approach is given by Meola (2004): "Chucking the checklist".

Libraries sometimes provide advice on how their users may evaluate sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html General Source Criticism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304184332/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/kallkritik/ekallkritik.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html Topicality and Reliability of Printed Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215004102/http://www.bib.slu.se/kurser/sss/samla/vardering/evarref.html |date=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Library of Congress has a "Teaching with Primary Sources" (TPS) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/tps/about/|title=About the Program- Teaching with Primary Sources - Teacher Resources - Library of Congress|author=|date=|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Source criticism is also about ethical behavior and culture. It is about a free press and an open society, including the  protecting information sources from being persecuted (cf., [[Whistleblower]]).

==In specific domains==

===Photos===


{{See also|Photo manipulation}}

Photos are often manipulated during wars and for political purposes. One well known example is Joseph Stalin's manipulation of a photograph from May 5, 1920 on which Stalin's predecessor Lenin held a speech for Soviet troops that Leon Trotsky attended. Stalin had later Trotsky retouched out of this photograph. (cf. King, 1997). A recent example is reported by Healy (2008) about North Korean leader [[Kim Jong Il]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/was-the-dear-leader-photoshopped-in/?scp=7&amp;sq=Kim%20Jong-il&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Was the Dear Leader Photoshopped In? | first=Jack | last=Healy | date=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet sources===


{{See also|E-mail fraud|Internet fraud}}

Much interest in evaluating Internet sources (such as [[Wikipedia]]) is reflected in the scholarly literature of [[Library and information science]] and in other fields. Mintz (2002) is an edited volume about this issue. Examples of literature examining Internet sources include Chesney (2006), Fritch &amp; Cromwell (2001), Leth &amp; Thurén (2000) and Wilkinson, Bennett, &amp; Oliver (1997).

=== Archaeology and history ===
"In history, the term historical method was first introduced in a systematic way in the sixteenth century by Jean Bodin in his treatise of source criticism, ''Methodus ad facilem historiarium cognitionem'' (1566). Characteristically, Bodin's treatise intended to establish the ways by which reliable knowledge of the past could be established by checking sources against one another and by so assessing the reliability of the information conveyed by them, relating them to the interests involved." (Lorenz, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;6870).

As written above, modern source criticism in history is closely associated with the German historian [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795&amp;ndash;1886), who influenced historical methods on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, although in rather different ways. American history developed in a more empirist and antiphilosophical way (cf., Novick, 1988).

Two of the best-known rule books from History's childhood are Bernheim (1889) and Langlois &amp; Seignobos (1898). These books provided a seven-step procedure (here quoted from Howell &amp; Prevenier, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;70-71):
# If the sources all agree about an event, historians can consider the event proved.
# However, majority does not rule; even if most sources relate events in one way, that version will not prevail unless it passes the test of critical textual analysis.
# The source whose account can be confirmed by reference to outside authorities in some of its parts can be trusted in its entirety if it is impossible similarly to confirm the entire text.
# When two sources disagree on a particular point, the historian will prefer the source with most "authority" - - i.e. the source created by the expert or by the eyewitness.
# Eyewittnesses are, in general, to be preferred, especially in circumstances where the ordinary observer could have accurately reported what transpired and, more specifically, when they deal with facts known by most contemporaries.
# If two independently created sources agree on a matter, the reliability of each is measureably enhanced.
# When two sources disagree (and there is no other means of evaluation), then historians take the source which seems to accord best with common sense.

Gudmundsson (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;38) writes:  "Source criticism should not totally dominate later courses. Other important perspectives, for example, philosophy of history/view of history, should not suffer by being neglected" (Translated by BH). This quote makes a distinction between source criticism on the one hand and historical philosophy on the other hand. However, different views of history and different specific theories about the field being studied may have important consequences for how sources are selected, interpreted and used. Feminist scholars may, for example, select sources made by women and may interpret sources from a feminist perspective. Epistemology should thus be considered a part of source criticism. It is in particular related to "tendency analysis".

In [[archaeology]], [[radiocarbon dating]] is an important technique to establish the age of information sources. Methods of this kind were the ideal when history established itself as both a scientific discipline and as a profession based on "scientific" principles in the last part of the 1880s (although radiocarbon dating is a more recent example of such methods). The empiricist movement in history brought along both "source criticism" as a research method and also in many countries large scale publishing efforts to make valid editions of "source materials" such as important letters and official documents (e.g. as [[facsimile]]s or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s).

[[Historiography]] and [[Historical method]] include the study of the reliability of the sources used, in terms of, for example, authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.

===Biblical studies===
{{Main|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}
Source criticism, as the term is used in [[biblical criticism]], refers to the attempt to establish the sources used by the author and/or redactor of the final text. The term "literary criticism" is occasionally used as a synonym.

Biblical source criticism originated in the 18th century with the work of [[Jean Astruc]], who adapted the methods already developed for investigating the texts of Classical antiquity ([[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] in particular) to his own investigation into the sources of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It was subsequently considerably developed by German scholars in what was known as "the [[Higher Criticism]]", a term no longer in widespread use. The ultimate aim of these scholars was to reconstruct the history of the biblical text, as well as the religious history of ancient Israel.

Related to Source Criticism is [[Redaction Criticism]] which seeks to determine how and why the redactor (editor) put the sources together the way he did. Also related is [[form criticism]] and [[tradition history]] which try to reconstruct the oral prehistory behind the identified written sources.

===Journalism===

{{See also|Journalism fraud}}

Journalists often work with strong time pressure and have access to only a limited number of [[information source]]s such as [[news bureau]]s, persons which may be interviewed, [[newspaper]]s, [[Academic journal|journals]] and so on (see [[journalism sourcing]]). Journalists' possibility for conducting serious source criticism is thus limited compared to, for example, historians' possibilities.

===Legal studies===

{{See also|Evidence (law)}}

The most important legal sources are created by parliaments, governments, courts, and legal researchers. They may be written or informal and based on established practices. Views concerning the quality of sources differ among legal philosophies: [[Legal positivism]] is the view that the text of the law should be considered in isolation, while [[legal realism]], [[interpretivism (legal)]], [[critical legal studies]] and feminist legal criticism interprets the law on a broader cultural basis.

'''Abstract''':  When classifying the array of interpretive methods currently available, biblical critics regularly distinguish between historical-critical methods, on the one hand, and literary critical methods, on the other. Frequently, methods on one side of the divide are said to be antagonistic to certain methods on the other. This article examines two such presumed antagonistic methods, source criticism and deconstructive criticism, and argues that they are not, in fact, antagonistic, but similar: both are postmodern movements, and both share an interpretive methodology (insofar as it is correct to speak of a deconstructive methodology). This argument is illustrated with a source-critical and a deconstructive reading of Exodus 14.

'''Spiritual left''' refers to a spiritually or religiously based position that shares the social transformative vision of the [[left-wing politics|left]] and its commitment to social justice, peace, economic equality, and (in recent years) ecological consciousness, but who base their commitment on spiritual or religious traditions. 

Two present-day examples of spiritual leftism are [[Jim Wallis]], editor of ''[[Sojourners]]'' magazine, who finds a call for peace and for the elimination of poverty in the Christian Gospel and Rabbi [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]], editor of ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' magazine, calling for a "New Bottom Line" where productivity, efficiency and rationality would be judged not only in material terms, but also in terms of love, generosity, peace, social justice, ecological sanity and awe and wonder at the grandeur of the universe.

'''''State v. Lyerla''''', [[Supreme Court of South Dakota]], 424 N.W.2d 908 (1988), is a [[criminal case]] in which it was found that an [[attempt]] to commit a crime with an element of [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] is a [[logical impossibility]]; specifically that attempted second degree murder is logically impossible.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law - Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|671–675}}

Lyerla randomly shot into a truck three times after being goaded by the driver of the truck.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}} One shot killed the driver and the others did not hit the driver or either of two passengers.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}}

Lyerla was convicted of [[second degree murder]] for killing the driver.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}} Lyerla was convicted on two counts of attempted second degree murder of each passenger.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}}

Lyerla appealed on the ground that it is a logical impossibility to attempt second degree murder, since attempt requires [[specific intent]] and recklessness implies lack of such [[intent]].&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}} Implied in the jury finding of second degree murder, rather than first degree murder which was also sought, was lack of specific intent to kill anyone in the truck, but rather a reckless disregard for their life.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}}

The court agreed with Lyerla and reversed the conviction.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}} The court wrote: 
::''"In order to attempt to commit a crime, there must exist in the mind of the perpetrator the specific intent to commit the acts constituting the offence. To attempt second degree murder one must intend to have a criminally reckless state of mind... [a] logical impossibility."&lt;ref name=CL/&gt;{{rp|671–675}}

{{cleanup-rewrite|there is substantial ambiguity differentiating between sworn and unsworn declarations|article|date=August 2013}}
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
}}

A '''sworn declaration''' (also called a ''sworn statement'' or a ''statement under penalty of perjury'') is a document that recites facts pertinent to a legal proceeding.  It is very similar to an [[affidavit]], but unlike an affidavit, it is not witnessed and sealed{{dubious|Isn't this completely backwards|reason=statute discusses unsworn|date=August 2013}} by an official such as a [[notary public]].  Instead, the person making the declaration signs a separate endorsement paragraph at the end of the document, stating that the declaration is made under penalty of [[perjury]].

In legal proceedings, generally, facts that rely upon an individual's memory or knowledge are most reliably proven by having the person give [[testimony]] in court:  he appears in person before a judge, at a time and place known to other interested persons, swears that his testimony will be true, states his testimony so that all can hear it, and can be [[cross-examine]]d by opposing parties.  Generally, the written record of his testimony is taken down in written form by an official of the court, the [[court reporter]].

Such a procedure, although maximizing fairness and the likelihood of obtaining the truth, is expensive, troublesome, and time-consuming.  Therefore, in many instances, especially in preliminary or uncontested proceedings, a court will allow testimonial evidence to be given in a document filed with the [[clerk of court]].  Traditionally, this has required an [[affidavit]]:  the person must put his testimony into written form and then sign the document in front of an official, such as a notary public or clerk, swearing to the official that the contents of the document are true.  The official then endorses the document and generally stamps it with an official seal.  Such an affidavit has several advantages over simple signed testimony:  
* The person giving the testimony is subject to penalties if he has lied, usually the felony of [[perjury]]
* The official is able to see the person, giving some assurance that the person is not suffering under a disqualifying disability
* The official is able to witness the signing of the document and check proof of the [[affiant]]'s identity, helping to prevent some forms of outright fraud.

In recent years, however, to provide for even greater economy of time and money, courts have increasingly allowed persons to omit the step of swearing before a notary public or official.  Instead, the affiant puts a separate paragraph at the end of the document, such as the following (for United States federal courts):
&lt;blockquote&gt;I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).&lt;ref name="unsworn1"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCodeClause|28|1746|(2)}} (for execution within the United States).  For execution outside the United States, see {{UnitedStatesCodeClause|28|1746|(1)}} ("I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Where allowed, such an endorsement gives the document the same weight as an affidavit, per {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1746}}&lt;ref name="unsworn"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|28|1746}}:  Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury&lt;/ref&gt;  The document is called a ''sworn declaration'' or ''sworn statement'' instead of an affidavit, and the maker is called a "declarant" rather than an "affiant", but other than this difference in terminology, the two are treated identically by the court.

A sworn declaration used in place of an affidavit must be specifically authorized by statute.  The federal courts and a few states have general statutes allowing a sworn declaration in any matter where an affidavit can be used.&lt;ref name="unsworn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RCW 9A.72.085 - State of Washington&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, sworn statements are allowed for some purposes, but not others.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Minnesota law allows sworn statements to support a family violence waiver. Minnesota Statutes § 256J.545&lt;/ref&gt;

One drawback to the use of a sworn statement instead of an affidavit is that, while the protection of liability for perjury is retained, the protection of having an independent official witness the signing, check the affiant's identification, etc., is lost.  This function is essentially taken over by the attorney for the party in whose favor the affidavit is given;  the court relies upon the honesty of the attorney, or, perhaps more realistically, upon the attorney's fear of being disbarred, to guarantee that the declarant is competent to testify, is who he says he is, and has actually sworn to the truth of the facts stated.  Another incentive for attorneys to make sure that the text of a declaration precisely matches the declarant's recollection is that the witness may be subject to [[Witness impeachment|impeachment]] at trial if the discrepancies between the declaration and any later testimony turn out to be significant.

Yet another more practical drawback is the conservative nature of the law.  Even if use of a sworn statement is fully authorized, another individual to the transaction—such as a party to a business transaction or another person's attorney—may be unacquainted with the form and refuse to accept it in lieu of a notarized affidavit.

The '''''Tiangong Kaiwu''''' (天工開物), or '''''The Exploitation of the Works of Nature''''' was a [[China|Chinese]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled by [[Song Yingxing]]. It was published in May 1637 with funding provided by Song's patron [[Tu Shaokui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{wdl|3021}} |author=Song, Yingxing |date=1637 |trans-title=The Exploitation of the Works of Nature |title=Tiangong Kaiwu |work=World Digital Library |language=Chinese |location=Jiangxi Sheng, China |accessdate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 36"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Song"&gt;Song, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' is an encyclopedia covering a wide range of technical issues, including the use of various [[gunpowder |gunpowder weapons]]. Copies of the book were very scarce in China during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) (due to the government's establishment of [[monopolies]] over certain industries described in the book), but original copies of the book were preserved in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 172"/&gt; 

== Overview ==

It featured detailed illustrations that were valuable for historians in understanding many early Chinese production processes. For example, illustrations for [[brick-making]]; one shows a kilnmaster checking the temperature of a furnace while an assistant stands by and douses the kiln to induce superficial glazing;&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; another illustration shows a brick-maker filling a wooden mold with clay while he dresses the brick's surface with a finishing wire strung on a bow.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the historian [[Joseph Needham]] points out, the vast amount of accurately drawn illustrations in this encyclopedia dwarfed the amount provided in previous Chinese encyclopedias, making it a valuable written work in the history of Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 172"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  
At the same time, the Tiangong Kaiwu broke from Chinese tradition by rarely referencing previous written work. It is instead written in a style strongly suggestive of first-hand experience.  In the preface to the work, Song attributed this deviation from tradition to his poverty and low standing.&lt;ref name="Cullen"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cullen, Christopher| title=The Science/Technology Interface in Seventeenth-Century China: Song Yingxing 宋 應 星 on "qi" 氣 and the "wu xing" 五 行| journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London| year=1990| volume=53| issue=2| pages=295–318 | doi=10.1017/S0041977X00026100| jstor=619236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
In the first chapter, The Growing of Grains, Song Yingxing wrote about the great necessity of rural farmers in society, and although they were emulated by tradition, were scoffed at by aristocrats throughout time. Song Yingxing began the chapter with the context of this paragraph in mind:

[[Image:Tiangong Kaiwu Chain Pumps.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two types of [[hydraulic]]-powered [[chain pump]]s from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu''.]]
{{cquote|Master Song observes that, while the existence of the [[Shennong|Divine Agriculturalist]] of antiquity is an uncertain matter, the truth denoted by the two words of his name has existed down to the present day. Man cannot live long without the sustenance of the [[Five Cereals (China)|five grains]]; yet the five grains cannot grow of themselves; they must depend on man to cultivate them. The nature of the soil changes with time, and the species and properties [of the plants] differ according to the geographic environment. But why was it that the classification and explanation of the numerous varieties of grain had to await the coming of Houzhi, even though a thousand years had elapsed between the time of the Divine Agriculturalist and the [[Yao (ruler)|Emperor Taotang]], during which interval grain was used as food and the benefits of cultivation had been taught throughout the country? It was because the rich men regarded the [farmer's] straw hat and cape as [[convict]]s garb, and in aristocratic households the word "peasant" had come to be used as a curse. Many a man would know the taste of his breakfast and supper, but was ignorant of their sources. That the First Agriculturalist should have been called "Divine" is certainly not the mere outcome of human contrivances.&lt;ref name="song 3"&gt;Song, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Song wrote about the general terms used in agriculture, saying that the "hundred grains" referred to crops in general, while the "five grains" were specifically [[sesamum]], [[legume]]s, [[wheat]], [[panicle]]d [[millet]], and glutinous millet ([[rice]] was not included in this, says Song, because the ancients were only used to the environment of [[Northern and southern China|northern China]], which was devoid of rice at the time).&lt;ref name="Song 3 4"&gt;Song, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote about the meticulous and proper [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] of each crop, as well as how to avoid agricultural disasters in the process.&lt;ref name="Song 3 31"&gt;Song, 3-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In aiding the text, he also provided many different drawn illustrations, including a man loosening the soil by ploughing with an [[ox]],&lt;ref name="Song 5"&gt;Song, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; soil broken into fine particles by an ox-drawn [[harrow (tool)|harrow]],&lt;ref name="Song 7"&gt;Song, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; men engaging in foot weeding and hand weeding of rice,&lt;ref name="Song 9 10"&gt;Song, 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; a vertical [[waterwheel]] with hollow wooden cylinders dipping water into an open woodwork tub feeding an [[irrigation]] [[canal]],&lt;ref name="Song 13"&gt;Song, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; a cylinder-type [[chain pump]] powered by a vertical waterwheel placed in a narrow, low-lying stream with a mounted rotating wheel placed at the top of an elevated plane, whereupon the cylinders fed water into an irrigation canal,&lt;ref name="Song 15"&gt;Song, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; a wooden river [[dam]] correcting the flow of water around a field of crops,&lt;ref name="Song 16"&gt;Song, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[sluice]] gate controlling the flow of a water channel,&lt;ref name="Song 17"&gt;Song, 17&lt;/ref&gt; a square-pallet chain pump powered by a horizontal waterwheel, connected by an [[axle]] to a gear-tooth wheel above, which in turn engaged a vertical gear-tooth wheel,&lt;ref name="Song 18"&gt;Song, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; another square-pallet chain pump employing an ox-drawn set of geared wheels,&lt;ref name="Song 19"&gt;Song, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; two different types of foot-treadle operated chain pumps,&lt;ref name="Song 20 21"&gt;Song, 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[counterweight]]ed [[lever]] for raising or lowering a bucket,&lt;ref name="Song 22"&gt;Song, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[pulley]]-wheel for raising or lowering a bucket,&lt;ref name="Song 25"&gt;Song, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; an ox-drawn plough-seeder with a cone-shaped filter,&lt;ref name="Song 26"&gt;Song, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; an ox-drawn pair of stone rollers, used for pressing [[seed]]s into the soil,&lt;ref name="Song 27"&gt;Song, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; the simpler process of sewing seeds by hand and pressing them into the dirt by foot,&lt;ref name="Song 28"&gt;Song, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and finally, an illustration of men cultivating wheat with broad-headed hoes.&lt;ref name="Song 30"&gt;Song, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another chapter, The Preparation of Grains, he also provided illustrations for rolling rice grains with a wooden ox-drawn roller,&lt;ref name="Song 84"&gt;Song, 84&lt;/ref&gt; a crank-operated rotary-fan [[winnowing]] machine that separated [[husk]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 85"&gt;Song, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; a hand-operated wooden hulling mill,&lt;ref name="Song 87"&gt;Song, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; a hand-operated earthen hulling machine,&lt;ref name="Song 88"&gt;Song, 88.&lt;/ref&gt; a process of sieving to separate husk-free grains,&lt;ref name="Song 89"&gt;Song, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; two types of foot-operated [[trip hammer]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 91 92"&gt;Song, 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[hydraulic]]-powered trip hammer powered by a waterwheel that rotated an axle of overhead [[cam]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 93"&gt;Song, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[horse]]-drawn hulling mill,&lt;ref name="Song 96"&gt;Song, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; an oxen-drawn grinding mill,&lt;ref name="Song 98"&gt;Song, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; a grinding mill operated by a vertical waterwheel,&lt;ref name="Song, 99."&gt;Song, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; and a rolling mill operated by a horizontal waterwheel, the waterwheel placed in a rushing current found under a wooden deck that rotated the axle of the stone roller above within the interior of a building.&lt;ref name="Song 103"&gt;Song, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nautics==
[[Image:Tiangong Kaiwu Ship.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A two-masted Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junk ship]], from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu''.]]
The subject of maritime and nautical technology and engineering was discussed extensively by Song Yingxing. Song noted that in northern China the chief means of transportation was by [[carriage]] and [[cart]], while in southern China it was by [[ship]] and [[boat]].&lt;ref name="Song 171"&gt;Song, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;  He provided various nuances about nautical matters, such as metal [[anchor]]s for [[battleship]]s and seagoing vessels weighing up to 30,000 [[catty|catties]].&lt;ref name="Song 189"&gt;Song 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Song 196"/&gt;  Song noted that there were thousands of names classifying different boats found in China, which was often named in accordance to their overall shape, [[cargo]] capacity, and quality (of material used and construction).&lt;ref name="Song 171"/&gt;  For example, he described the layout and construction of the [[grain]] [[tribute]] boat as a shallow, flat-bottom craft, with the preferred woods of [[Cedar wood|cedar]] and [[chestnut]] being used to construct the [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead compartments]] of the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]].&lt;ref name="Song 172"&gt;Song, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Song also wrote of the methods used by the Chinese in his day for [[pearl diving]] in [[Guangdong]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 668"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 668.&lt;/ref&gt; Song wrote that these divers were able to stay [[underwater]] for prolonged periods of time since a secure rope was tied around their waists connected to the ship as they breathed through a long curving pipe that led up above the surface of the water.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 668"/&gt; This long breathing tube was strengthened by rings of tin and fastened to a watertight leather [[Diving mask|face mask]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 668"/&gt; A drawn illustration of this was provided in his book.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 669"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 669.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his admiration for the [[stern]]-mounted steering [[rudder]] (which had been known to the Chinese since at least the 1st century AD),&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 649 650"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 649-650.&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote:

{{cquote|
The nature of a [[Junk (ship)|ship]] is to follow water as the grass bends under the wind. Therefore a rudder is constructed to divide and make a barrier to the water, so that it will not itself determine the direction of the vessel's motion. As the rudder is turned, the water turbulently presses on it, and the boat reacts to it. The dimensions of the rudder should be such that its base is level with the bottom of the (inland transport) ship. If it is deeper, even by an inch, a shallow may allow the hull to pass but the stern with its rudder may stick firmly in the mud (thus grounding the vessel); then if the wind is at gale strength that inch of wood will give rise to indescribable difficulties. If the rudder is shorter, even by an inch, it will not have enough turning forces to bring the bows round. The water divided and obstructed by the rudder's strength, is echoed as far as the bows; it is as if there were underneath the hull a swift current carrying the vessel in the very direction desired. So nothing needs to be done at the bows...The rudder is worked by a [[tiller]] attached to the top of its post, a 'door-bar' (as the sailors call it). To turn the boat to the north the tiller is thrust to the south, and ''vice versa''...The rudder is made of a straight post of wood [more than 10 ft. long and 3 ft. in circumference for the grain-ships] with the tiller at the top, and an axe-shaped blade of boards fitted into a groove cut at its lower end. This blade is firmly fastened to the post with iron nails, and the whole is fixed (with tackle) to the ship to perform its function. At the end of the stern there is a raised part (for the [[helmsman]]) which is also called the 'rudder-house'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 634"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 634.&lt;/ref&gt;

(''Note: in this passage he speaks mostly of fresh-water ships at [[Poyang Lake]] and the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]]''.)

==Sericulture and cotton==
[[Image:Tiangong Kaiwu Drawloom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A giant draw [[loom]] machine for figure [[weaving]], from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu''.]]
Song Yingxing opened his chapter on clothing with the aspects of [[sericulture]] in producing [[silk]]. He gave an accurate description of the raising of [[Bombyx mori|silkworms]], along with their [[instinct]]ual [[mating]] tradition.&lt;ref name="Song 36"&gt;Song, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Those raising the silkworms had their eggs deposited on sheets of paper or cloth, and stored for use in the following year.&lt;ref name="Song 36"/&gt; He wrote that in some regions a bathing process was used on these sheets, employing rain water, lime water, or [[brine]], and gave specifications on the timing for this during winter, in the 12th month of the year.&lt;ref name="Song 36"/&gt; The reason for this, he said, was so that the inferior eggs would die in the process, hence less [[mulberry]] leaves would be consumed needlessly.&lt;ref name="Song 36"/&gt; He also provided specifications on how to avoid damaging the eggs in the long process of preparation before the bathing process in the 12th month.&lt;ref name="Song 36 37"&gt;Song, 36-37.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the differences between two general forms of silkworms, late and early, while providing information on a wide variety in different silkworm breeds and cocoons,&lt;ref name="Song 37"&gt;Song, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and even silkworm [[disease]]s.&lt;ref name="Song 41"&gt;Song, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; After their eventful hatching, he described the proper living conditions and environment that the silkworms should be immersed in,&lt;ref name="Song 38"&gt;Song, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the care that should be given in feeding them.&lt;ref name="Song 39 41"&gt;Song 39-41.&lt;/ref&gt; He warned of different sources of foul odors and smoke that had the capability of killing the silkworms if they came into contact.&lt;ref name="Song 38"/&gt; He described the spinning of cocoons,&lt;ref name="Song 42"&gt;Song, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; gathering of cocoons,&lt;ref name="Song 42"/&gt; sorting of cocoons,&lt;ref name="Song 48"&gt;Song, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and the different pests such as birds and [[mosquito]]es that should be avoided,&lt;ref name="Song 42 48"&gt;Song, 42, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the proper planting of mulberry trees and how to harvest them.&lt;ref name="Song 38 39"&gt;Song, 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; For the process of making silk, he noted that raw silk could not be reeled into normal silk until a formal wadding process was done.&lt;ref name="Song 48" /&gt; He described the [[reel]]ing of silk fabric with a reeling machine,&lt;ref name="Song 48 49"&gt;Song 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bobbin|spooling]] of silk fibers,&lt;ref name="Song 49 50"&gt;Song, 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; the spinning of silk fibers into [[weft]] yarns, the silken threads drawn into a warp frame for weaving,&lt;ref name="Song 50"&gt;Song, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "ingenious" works of figure designing.&lt;ref name="Song 56"&gt;Song, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the proper dimensions of different draw looms,&lt;ref name="Song 55 56"&gt;Song, 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Song Yingxing wrote that although silk was reserved for those with economic means, both rich and poor used cotton clothing during the winter.&lt;ref name="Song 60"&gt;Song, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient times, he said, [[cotton]] was called ''xima'' ('nettle-[[hemp]]').&lt;ref name="Song 60"/&gt; He outlined two different types of cotton and their characteristics: tree cotton (Ceiba pentandra) and the cotton plant (Gossypium indicum).&lt;ref name="Song 60"/&gt; He noted their planting in spring and their picking by autumn, as well as use of a [[cotton gin]] to separate cotton seeds that are naturally tightly fastened to fiber bolls of cotton.&lt;ref name="Song 60 61"&gt;Song, 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the process of straightening the cotton fibers with wooden boards, which prepared them for the spinning wheel, the "slivers drawn out to desired size and twisted into yarns."&lt;ref name="Song 60"/&gt; After describing the weaving process of cotton and the different patterns used, he also described cotton padding during winter, in ancient times it was hemp padding, and that the rich could afford silk padding in their winter attire.&lt;ref name="Song 63"&gt;Song, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these he also described different [[fur]], [[wool]]en, and [[felt]] clothing.&lt;ref name="63 70"&gt;Song, 63-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metallurgy, casting, and forging==
[[Image:Tiangong Kaiwu Silver Smelting &amp; Refining.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Smelting [[silver]] [[ore]] and the process of removing [[lead]] compounds, from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu''.]]

In China, the 'five [[metal]]s' were [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron]], and [[tin]], although the term could be extended in general terms to any sort of metal.&lt;ref name="Song 257"&gt;Song, 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of how gold was held to be the most precious metal of them all, and that it could be obtained in the mountains, panned from river sand, and from underground [[mining]].&lt;ref name="Song 236"&gt;Song, 236.&lt;/ref&gt; He also outlined the different grades of gold and its [[malleable]] qualities.&lt;ref name="Song 236"/&gt; To eliminate trace elements of other metals found in gold [[alloy]]s, Song Yingxing outlined the use of a [[crucible]] technique.&lt;ref name="Song 237"&gt;Song, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

Song Yingxing wrote that ancient rulers of early China cast inscriptions of writing onto [[bronze]] tripods since this was a much more durable method of preserving the written record than using the perishable materials found in books and scrolls.&lt;ref name="Song 159 160"&gt;Song, 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that musical and announcing bells of higher quality were made of different copper alloys, while those of lesser quality were made of iron.&lt;ref name="Song 160"&gt;Song, 160.&lt;/ref&gt; He also provided weighted formulas of different metal compositions for certain bells, for example, the casting a large bell in an audience hall or pavilion that required 47,000 [[catty|catties]] of copper, 4,000 [[catty|catties]] of tin, 50 [[ounce|oz]]. of gold, and 120 [[ounce|oz]]. of silver in its composition.&lt;ref name="Song 160"/&gt; In the smelting process, long pits for the liquid metal flow had to be dug, having a [[Molding (process)|drymold]] construction of [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[Mortar (firestop)|mortar]] that was dried and covered in ox fat and [[beeswax]].&lt;ref name="Song 160"/&gt; Then he noted the following process of pounded earth and [[charcoal]] powder that was screened and mixed into a mud paste that would be gradually spread on the surface of the wax several inches thick.&lt;ref name="Song 162"&gt;Song 162.&lt;/ref&gt; When dried and heated so that the melted fat and wax could flow out entirely by means of apertures at the base, the bell or tripod could be cast in the vacated cavity between the core and the mold.&lt;ref name="Song 162"/&gt; With the individual casting process for bells and tripods, Song Yingxing also described the intricate individual casting processes for making cooking pots and pans,&lt;ref name="Song 163"&gt;Song, 163.&lt;/ref&gt; metal [[statue]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 163"/&gt; metal barrels of [[cannon]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 165"&gt;Song, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; metallic [[mirror]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 165" /&gt; and different metallic coins of copper or iron.&lt;ref name="Song 165 170"&gt;Song, 165-169.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the processes of hammer forging with the initial casting of an [[anvil]],&lt;ref name="Song 189"/&gt; and noted that in the heating process of forging, [[coal]] accounted for 70% of the fuel, charcoal taking the rest at 30%.&lt;ref name="Song 189"/&gt; He also outlined the [[quench]]-hardening process of rapid cooling in clear water immediately after iron and [[steel]] products were forged.&lt;ref name="Song 190"&gt;Song, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined the different types of [[knife|knives]], axes,&lt;ref name="Song 190"/&gt; hoes,&lt;ref name="Song 191"&gt;Song, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; [[file (tool)|file tools]],&lt;ref name="Song 191"/&gt; [[Scratch awl|awls]],&lt;ref name="Song 192"&gt;Song, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[saw]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 192"/&gt; [[chisel|wood chisels]],&lt;ref name="Song 196"&gt;Song, 196.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anchor]]s,&lt;ref name="Song 196"/&gt; and metal needles&lt;ref name="Song 196 197"&gt;Song, 196-197&lt;/ref&gt; that could be forged and produced. For the making of the finest swords, he said, they are coated with steel after "a hundred smeltings," but the core of the sword was still made of [[wrought iron]]; this was because a sword made entirely of steel would easily break when making hard strikes.&lt;ref name="Song 190"/&gt;

==Sulfur and saltpetre==

There were many [[manufacturing]] processes described in the ''Tiangong Kaiwu''. For example, for roasting [[iron]] [[pyrite]] in converting [[sulphide]] to [[oxide]] in [[sulfur]] used in gunpowder compositions, the book illustrated how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as [[vapor]] that would solidify and [[crystallize]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 126"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 126.&lt;/ref&gt; For the preparation of [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], Song Yingxing wrote:

{{cquote|
Saltpetre (solve-stone) is found both in China and in the lands of neighboring peoples, all have it. In China it is chiefly produced in the north and west. Merchants who sell (saltpetre) in the southern and eastern (parts of the country) without first paying for the official certificate are punished for illegal trading. Natural saltpetre has the same origin as common [[salt]]. Subterranean moisture streams up to the surface, and then in places near water (e.g. the sea), and where the earth is thin, it forms common salt, while in places near the mountains, and where the earth is thick, it forms saltpetre. Because it dissolves immediately in water it is called solve-stone. In places north of the [[Yangtze]] and the [[Huai River|Huai]] rivers, after the mid-Autumn fortnightly period, (people) just have to be at home and sweep the earthen floors on alternate days to collect a little for purifying. Saltpetre is most abundant in three places. That produced in [[Sichuan]] is called ''chuan xiao''; that which comes from [[Shanxi]] is commonly called ''yan xiao''; and that found in [[Shandong]] is commonly called ''tu xiao''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 102 103"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

{{cquote|
After collecting saltpetre by scraping or sweeping the ground (as also from walls) it is immersed in a tub of water for a night, and impurities floating on the surface are skimmed off. The solution is then put into a pan. After boiling until the solution is sufficiently concentrated, it is transferred to a container, and overnight the saltpetre crystallizes out. The prickly crystals floating on the surface are called ''meng xiao'' and the longer crystals are ''maya xiao'' (the amount of these varies with the places where the raw material has been collected). The coarse (powder or crystals) left at the bottom as a residue is called ''pu xiao''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 103"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

{{cquote|
For purification the remaining solution is again boiled, together with a few pieces of [[turnip]], until the water has [[evaporate]]d further. This is then poured into a basin and left overnight so that a mess of snow-white (crystals) is formed, and that is called ''pen xiao''. For making gunpowder this ''ya xiao'' and ''pen xiao'' have a similar effect. When saltpetre is used for making gunpowder, if in small quantity it has to be dried on new tiles, and if in large quantity it should be dried in [[earthenware]] vessels. As soon as any moisture has all gone, the saltpetre is ground to a powder, but one should never use an iron [[Mortar and pestle|pestle in a stone mortar]], because any spark accidentally produced could cause an irretrievable catastrophe. One should measure out the amount of saltpetre to be used in a particular gunpowder formula, and then grind it together with (the right amount of) sulfur. [[Charcoal]] is only added later. After saltpetre has been dried, it may become moist again if left over a period of time. Hence when used in large cannons it is usually carried separately, and the gunpowder prepared and mixed on the spot.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 103"/&gt;
}}

==Gunpowder weapons==

Many of the gunpowder weapons that Song Yingxing described were similar to those in the Chinese ''[[Huolongjing]]'' of the earlier 14th century, although there are many noted differences between the two. For example, the ''Huolongjing'' described a [[land mine]] that was triggered by motion of the enemy above, with a pin release that let down falling weights which would use rope and axle to rotate a [[flint]] [[wheellock|steel-wheel]] which in turn sent sparks onto a train of fuses for the mines.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 199"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; It also described an explosive [[naval mine]] that was timed by a fuse and sent down river to an enemy ship.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 205"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' of Song Yingxing that outlined the use of a rip-cord pulled from ambushers hidden on a nearby shore that would trigger the steel-wheel mechanism in producing sparks for the naval mine placed in the river or lake.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 205"/&gt; Song Yingxing also outlined the different types of metals that were preferable in casting different types of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 339 f"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 339 F.&lt;/ref&gt;

Song Yingxing described a 'match for ten thousand armies' bomb as follows:

(When attacks are made upon) the walls of small cities in remote prefectures; if the available guns are too weak to repulse the enemy, then bombs should be suspended (i.e. dropped) from the battlements; if the situation continues to worsen, then the 'match for ten thousand armies' bomb should be employed...The saltpetre and sulfur in the bomb, on being ignited (explode), and blow many men and horses to pieces in an instant. The method is to use a dried empty clay ball with a small hole for filling, and in it are put the gunpowder, including sulfur and saltpetre, together with 'poison gunpowder' and 'magic gunpowder'. The relative proportion of the three gunpowders can be varied at will. After the fuse has been fitted, the bomb is enclosed in a wooden frame. Alternatively a wooden tub, coated on the inside with the sort of clay used for image-making, can be used. It is absolutely necessary to use the wooden framework or the tub in order to prevent any premature breakage as the missile falls (until the gunpowder explodes). When a city is under attack by an enemy the defenders on the walls light the fuse and throw the bomb down. The force of the explosion spins the bomb round in all directions, but the city walls protect one's own men from its effects on that side, while the enemy's men and horses are not so fortunate. This is the best of weapons for the defense of cities.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 187"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The historian Needham notes that Song Yingxing must not have been much of a military man with extensive knowledge of martial matters, due to his enthusiasm for this archaic type of bomb that had been used by the Chinese since the [[Song Dynasty]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 187"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 166"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''tiger shark''' (''Galeocerdo cuvier''&lt;ref name=ITIS&gt;{{cite web|title=ITIS Report – ''Galeocerdo cuvier''|url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=160189|website=Integrated Taxonomic Information System!|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a species of [[requiem shark]] and the only extant member of the [[genus]] '''''Galeocerdo'''''. It is a large macropredator, capable of attaining a length over {{convert|5|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=FroesePauly/&gt; Populations are found in many [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] waters, especially around central [[Pacific]] islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body, which resemble a [[tiger]]'s pattern, but fade as the shark matures.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;

The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter. It is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, with a range of prey that includes [[crustacean]]s, [[fish]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[bird]]s, [[squid]], [[turtle]]s, [[Hydrophiinae|sea snake]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and even other smaller sharks. It also has a reputation as a "garbage eater",&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt; consuming a variety of inedible, man-made objects that linger in its stomach.   Though apex predators, tiger sharks are sometimes taken by groups of [[killer whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incredible moment killer whales hunt and kill a tiger shark|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/sciencetech/video-1122910/Incredible-moment-killer-whales-hunt-kill-tiger-shark.html|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a [[endangered species|near threatened species]] due to [[shark finning|finning]] and fishing by humans.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

The tiger shark is second only to the [[great white shark|great white]] in recorded fatal attacks on humans.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The shark was first described by [[François Péron|Peron]] and [[Charles Alexandre Lesueur|Lesueur]] in 1822, and was given the name ''Squalus cuvier''.&lt;ref name=FroesePauly/&gt; [[Johannes Peter Müller|Müller]] and [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle|Henle]] in 1837 renamed it ''Galeocerdo tigrinus''.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; The genus, ''Galeocerdo'', is derived from the Greek ''galeos'', which means shark, and ''kerdo'', the word for fox.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; It is often colloquially called the man-eater shark.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;

The tiger shark is a member of the order [[Carcharhiniformes]], the most species-rich order of sharks, with more than 270 species also including the small [[catshark]]s and [[hammerhead shark]]s.&lt;ref name=FroesePauly/&gt; Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a [[nictitating membrane]] over the eyes, two dorsal fins, an [[anal fin]], and five [[gill]] slits. It is the largest member of the Carcharhinidae [[Family (biology)|family]], commonly referred to as [[requiem shark]]s. This family consists of mostly slender but powerful mid- to large-sized sharks and includes some other well-known sharks, such as the [[blue shark]] (''Prionace glauca''), [[lemon shark]] (''Negaprion brevirostris''), and [[bull shark]] (''Carcharhinus leucas'').&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;

==Description==
The tiger shark commonly attains a length of {{convert|3.25|-|4.25|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} and weighs around {{convert|385|-|635|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; It is [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]], with exceptionally large females reportedly measuring over {{convert|5|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}, and the largest males {{convert|4|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}}. Weights of particularly large female tiger sharks can exceed {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hinman, B. (2015). ''Keystone Species That Live in the Sea and Along the Coastline''. Mitchell Lane Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, F., &amp; Davenport, T. L. (2013). ''Elasmobranchs from marine and freshwater environments in Colombia: A review''. Current Politics and Economics of South and Central America, 6(4), 483.&lt;/ref&gt; One pregnant female caught off Australia reportedly measured {{convert|5.5|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} long and weighed {{convert|1524|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Even larger unconfirmed catches have been claimed.&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Gerald |title=The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-85112-235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some papers have accepted a record of an exceptional {{convert|7.4|m|ftin|0|abbr=on}} length for a tiger shark, but since this is far larger than any scientifically observed specimen, verification would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;Simpfendorfer, C. A., Goodreid, A. B., &amp; McAuley, R. B. (2001). ''Size, sex and geographic variation in the diet of the tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, from Western Australian waters''. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 61(1), 37-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tobuni, I. M., Benabdallah, B. A. R., Serena, F., &amp; Shakman, E. A. (2016). ''First documented presence of Galeocerdo cuvier (Péron &amp; Lesueur, 1822)(ELASMOBRANCHII, CARCHARHINIDAE) in the Mediterranean basin (Libyan waters)''. Marine Biodiversity Records, 9(1), 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the largest [[Extant taxon|extant]] sharks, the tiger shark ranks in average size only behind the [[whale shark]] (''Rhincodon typus''), the [[basking shark]] (''Cetorhinus maximus''), and the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''). Some other species such as [[megamouth shark]]s (''Megachasma pelagios''), [[Pacific sleeper shark]]s (''Somniosus pacificus''), [[Greenland shark]]s (''Somniosus microcephalus''), and [[bluntnose sixgill shark]]s (''Hexanchus griseus'') broadly overlap in size with the tiger shark, but as these species are comparatively poorly studied,  whether their typical mature size matches that of the tiger shark is unclear.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; The [[great hammerhead]] (''Sphyrna mokarran''), a member of the same taxonomic order as the tiger shark, has a similar or even greater average body length, but is lighter and less bulky, with a maximum known weight of {{convert|580|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite news|title=Record Hammerhead Pregnant With 55 Pups |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2006/07/24/hammerhead_ani.html?category=earth&amp;guid=20060724100030 |publisher=''[[Associated Press]]'' via ''Discovery News'' |date=July 1, 2006 |accessdate=October 18, 2008 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622001318/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2006/07/24/hammerhead_ani.html?category=earth&amp;guid=20060724100030 |archivedate=June 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger shark teeth are unique with very sharp, pronounced serrations and an unmistakable sideways-pointing tip. Such dentition has developed to slice through flesh, bone, and other tough substances such as turtle shells. Like most sharks, its teeth are continually replaced by rows of new teeth throughout the shark's life. Relative to the shark's size, tiger shark teeth are considerably shorter than those of a great white shark, but they are nearly as broad as the root as the great white's teeth and are arguably better suited to slicing through hard-surfaced prey.&lt;ref name=MarineBio/&gt;&lt;ref name= Randall&gt;Randall, J. E. (1992). Review of the biology of the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Marine and Freshwater Research, 43(1), 21-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; Its high back and [[dorsal fin]] act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Skin===
The skin of a tiger shark can typically range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage of this is that when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged, since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as [[countershading]]. Dark spots and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=CanadianShark/&gt; They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]], which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt.&lt;ref name=MarineBio/&gt; Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a [[lateral line]] which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.&lt;ref name=brunswick/&gt;

===Vision===
Sharks do not have moveable upper or lower eyelids, but the tiger shark—among other sharks—has a [[nictitating membrane]], a clear eyelid that can cover the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://dspace.mote.org/bitstream/2075/3090/1/MTR%20A-1970b.pdf |title=Studies on the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of sharks |last=Gilbert |first=Perry W. |date=1970 |website=[[Mote Marine Laboratory]] |access-date=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reflective layer behind the tiger shark's [[retina]], called the [[tapetum lucidum]], allows light-sensing cells a second chance to capture [[photon]]s of visible light. This enhances vision in low-light conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Communication in Fishes |last=Hart |first=Nathan S. |last2=Lisney |first2=Thomas J. |last3=Collin |first3=Shaun P. |date=2006 |publisher=Science Publishers |isbn=9781578084067 |editor-last=Ladich |editor-first=Friedrich |location=Enfield, NH |pages=346–347 |chapter=Visual Communication in Elasmobranchs |oclc=63187557 |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shaun_Collin/publication/37629037_Visual_communication_in_elasmobranchs/links/0046351caf9f8beadb000000.pdf}}&lt;!-- Doesn't explicitly say the tiger shark possesses it. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Tigershark3.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Juvenile tiger shark in the Bahamas|alt=Profile photo of shark, accompanied by [[remora]], swimming just above a sandy seafloor]]
[[File:Reef-Fidelity-and-Migration-of-Tiger-Sharks-Galeocerdo-cuvier-across-the-Coral-Sea-pone.0083249.s002.ogv|thumb|250px|Video of juvenile tiger shark at Lord Howe Island, Australia, from [[PLOS ONE]]]]
The tiger shark is often found close to the coast, mainly in [[tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] waters throughout the world.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; Its behavior is primarily [[nomadic]], but is guided by warmer currents, and it stays closer to the equator throughout the colder months. It tends to stay in deep waters that line reefs, but it does move into [[Channel (geography)|channels]] to pursue prey in shallower waters. In the western [[Pacific Ocean]], the shark has been found as far north as [[Japan]] and as far south as [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=FroesePauly/&gt; It has also been recorded in the Mediterranean, but so far only on two occasions, firstly off Spain and then off Sicily.&lt;ref name = ciesm&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ciesm.org/atlas/Galeocerdocuvier.php | title = Galeocer''do cuvier'' | accessdate = 15 January 2017 | publisher = CIESM|work = CIESM Atlas of Exotic Fishes in the Mediterranean Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger sharks can be seen in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], North American beaches, and parts of South America. It is also commonly observed in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Other locations where tiger sharks are seen include off Africa, China, [[India]], [[Australia]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;

Certain tiger sharks have been recorded at depths just shy of {{Convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; but some sources claim they move into shallow water normally thought to be too shallow for a species of its size.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt; A recent study showed the average tiger shark would be recorded at {{Convert|350|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, making tiger sharks uncommonly seen in shallow water. However, tiger sharks in Hawaii have been observed in depths as shallow as {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}} and regularly observed in coastal waters at depths of {{convert|20|to|40|ft|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

==Feeding==
The tiger shark is an [[apex predator]]&lt;ref name=Heithaus2001a/&gt; and has a reputation for eating almost anything.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=37 Tiger Sharks, ''Galeocerdo cuvier'']. marinebio.org&lt;/ref&gt; Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on [[Teleostei|small fish]], as well as various small [[jellyfish]], and [[mollusk]]s including [[cephalopod]]s. Around the time they attain {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}, or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; Numerous [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s, [[sea bird]]s, [[sea snake]]s,&lt;ref name=Heithaus2004/&gt; [[marine mammal]]s (e.g. [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops''), [[common dolphin]]s (''Delphinus''),&lt;ref name=Heithaus2002/&gt; [[spotted dolphin]]s (''Stenella''),&lt;ref name=Maldini/&gt; [[dugong]]s (''Dugong dugon''), [[Pinniped|seal]]s and [[sea lion]]s, and [[sea turtle]]s (including the three largest species: the [[Leatherback sea turtle|leatherback]] (''Dermochelys coriacea''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharkdefenders.com/2011/04/tiger-sharks-killed-for-eating.html Tiger Sharks Killed for Eating Leatherback Turtles]. Shark Defenders (2011-04-16). Retrieved on 2013-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Loggerhead sea turtle|loggerhead]] (''Caretta caretta'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~heithaus/SBERP/projects/turtres.html Shark Bay Ecosystem Research Project]. .fiu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[green sea turtle]]s (''Chelonia mydas''),&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Witzell, W. N. (1987). ''Selective predation on large cheloniid sea turtles by tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier)''. Japanese Journal of Herpetology, 12(1), 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt; They also eat other sharks (including adult [[sandbar shark]]s (''Carcharhinus plumbeus'')), as well as [[Batoidea|ray]]s, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

Due to high risk of predation, dolphins often avoid regions inhabited by tiger sharks.&lt;ref name=Competition/&gt; Injured or ailing [[whale]]s may also be attacked and eaten. A group was documented killing an ailing [[humpback whale]] (''Megaptera novaeangliae'') in 2006 near Hawaii.&lt;ref name=OfficeNMS/&gt; A scavenger, the tiger shark will feed on dead whales, and has been documented doing so alongside great white sharks.&lt;ref name=Dudley/&gt;

Evidence of dugong predation was identified in one study that found dugong tissue in 15 of 85 tiger sharks caught off the Australian coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpfendorfer |first1=Colin A. |last2=Goodreid |first2=Adrian B. |last3=McAuley |first3=Rory B. |title=Size, Sex And Geographic Variation in the Diet of the Tiger Shark, ''Galeocerdo cuvier'', From Western Australian Waters |journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes |date=1 January 2001 |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |doi=10.1023/A:1011021710183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, examination of adult dugongs has shown scars from failed shark attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Paul K. |title=Scarring and photoidentification of dugongs (''Dugong dugon'') in Shark Bay, Western Australia |journal=Aquatic Mammals |issn=0167-5427 |date=1995 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=205–211 |url=http://www.aquaticmammalsjournal.org/share/AquaticMammalsIssueArchives/1995/AquaticMammals_21-03/21-03_Anderson.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize attacks, dugong microhabitats shift similarly to those of known tiger shark prey when the sharks are abundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wirsing |first=Aaron J. |last2=Heithaus |first2=Michael R. |last3=Dill |first3=Lawrence M. |title=Living on the edge: dugongs prefer to forage in microhabitats that allow escape from rather than avoidance of predators |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=July 2007 |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=93–101 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.11.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broad, heavily calcified jaws and nearly terminal mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark to take on these large prey.&lt;ref name=Competition/&gt; In addition, excellent [[eyesight]] and acute [[olfaction|sense of smell]] enable it to react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

Notably, terrestrial mammals, including [[horse]]s (''Equus ferus caballus''), [[goat]]s (''Capra aegagrus hircus''), [[sheep]] (''Ovis aries''), [[dog]]s (''Canis lupus familiaris''), [[cat]]s (''Felis catus''), and [[brown rat]]s (''Rattus norvegicus''), are fairly common in the stomach contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; In one case, remains of two flying foxes were found in the stomach of this shark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mikula, P. |title= Fish and amphibians as bat predators|journal= European Journal of Ecology|volume= 1|doi= 10.1515/eje-2015-0010|year= 2015|issue =1|pages =71–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile [[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]], [[oil]] cans, [[tire]]s, and [[Baseball (object)|baseballs]].&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;

===Swimming efficiency and stealth===
All tiger sharks generally swim slowly, which, combined with cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Competition/&gt; Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks are one of the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.&lt;ref name=Competition/&gt;

==Reproduction==
Males reach sexual maturity at {{convert|2.3|to|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and females at {{convert|2.5|to|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=MarineBio/&gt; Typical weight of relatively young sexually mature specimens, which often locally comprise the majority of tiger sharks encountered per game-fishing and scientific studies, is around {{convert|80|to|130|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Randall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pepperell, J. 1992. ''Trends in the distribution, species composition and size of sharks caught by gamefish anglers off south-eastern Australia, 1961-1990.'' In: J. Pepperell (ed.), Sharks: Biology and Fisheries. Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, pp. 213–225. CSIRO Publications, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Females mate once every three years.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt; They breed by internal fertilization. The male inserts one of his [[clasper]]s into the female's genital opening ([[cloaca]]), acting as a guide for the [[sperm]]. The male uses his teeth to hold the female still during the procedure, often causing the female considerable discomfort. Mating in the Northern Hemisphere generally takes place between March and May, with birth between April and June the following year. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place in November, December, or early January. The tiger shark is the only species in its family that is [[ovoviviparous]]; its eggs hatch internally and the young are born live when fully developed.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;

The young develop inside the mother's body up to 16 months. Litters range from 10 to 80 pups.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; A newborn is generally {{Convert|51|to|76|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt; How long tiger sharks live is unknown, but they can live longer than 12 years.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt;

==Conservation==
[[File:Tiger shark, Hawaii Aii.jpg|thumb|A large tiger shark caught in [[Kane'ohe Bay|Kane{{okina}}ohe Bay]], [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] in 1966|alt=Photo of shark hung by its tail on the shore]]
The tiger shark is captured and killed for its [[Fish anatomy#Fins|fins]], [[flesh]], and [[liver]]. It is caught regularly in target and nontarget fisheries. Several populations have declined where they have been heavily fished. Continued demand for fins may result in further declines in the future. They are considered a [[endangered species|near threatened species]] due to excessive [[shark finning|finning]] and fishing by humans according to [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

While shark fin has very few nutrients, shark liver has a high concentration of [[retinol|vitamin A]], which is used in the production of vitamin oils. In addition, the tiger shark is captured and killed for its distinct skin, as well as by [[big-game fishing|big-game]] fishers.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;

In 2010, Greenpeace International added the tiger shark to its seafood red list, which is a list of fish commonly sold around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.&lt;ref name=Greenpeace/&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
Although sharks rarely bite humans, the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large share of fatal shark-bite incidents, and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species.&lt;ref name=sharkAttackStats/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ritter/&gt; They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans.&lt;ref name=SharkInfo/&gt; The tiger shark also dwells in river mouths and other runoff-rich water.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;&lt;ref name=MarineBio/&gt; While the tiger shark is considered to be one of the sharks most dangerous to humans, its bite rate is low.&lt;ref name=hawaii/&gt; It is second on the list of number of recorded bites on humans, with the great white shark being first.&lt;ref name=flmnh/&gt;&lt;ref name=sharkAttackStats/&gt; Typically, three to four shark bites occur per year in Hawaii, but they are rarely fatal; one notable survivor of such an attack is [[surfing]] champion [[Bethany Hamilton]], who lost her left arm at age 13 to a tiger shark in 2003. This bite rate is very low, considering thousands of people swim, surf, and dive in Hawaiian waters every day.&lt;ref name=hawaii/&gt; Human interactions with tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to the islands to give birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Main |first=Douglas |title=Hawaii tiger shark migration in fall coincides with rise in bites |date=September 10, 2013 |work=CBS Science News |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/hawaii-tiger-shark-migration-fall-coincides-rise-bites-8C11122659 |accessdate=October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1959 and 2000, 4,668 tiger sharks were [[culling|culled]] in an effort to protect the [[tourism]] industry. Despite damaging the shark population, these efforts were shown to be ineffective in decreasing the number of interactions between humans and tiger sharks. Feeding sharks in Hawaii (except for traditional Hawaiian cultural or religious practices) is illegal,&lt;ref name=Hawaii_Statutes/&gt;&lt;ref name=WPRFMC/&gt; and interaction with them, such as [[Shark proof cage|cage]] diving, is discouraged. South African shark behaviorist and shark diver Mark Addison demonstrated divers could interact and dive with them outside of a shark cage in a 2007 [[Discovery Channel]] special,&lt;ref name=Donahue/&gt; and underwater photographer [[Fiona Ayerst]] swam with them in [[the Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=Donahue/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazines.co.za/issue/200905201.html Riveting Shark Encounters: Fiona Ayerst recounts ... gentle tiger shark in the warm silky waters of the Bahamas]. Magazines.co.za (June/July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; At "Tiger Beach" off Grand Bahama, uncaged diving with - and even the handling of - female tiger sharks has become a routine occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueworldtv.com/webisodes/watch/tiger-shark-handling |title=Tiger shark handling |publisher=Jonathan Bird's Blue World |accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
The tiger shark is considered to be sacred ''[[Aumakua|na {{okina}}aumakua]]'' (ancestor spirits) by some [[native Hawaiians]], who think their eyeballs have special powers of visual perception. This aligns with the generally known facts about sharks and their [[Sharks#Senses|highly developed senses]].&lt;ref name=hawaii/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7715">'''''Uniclass 2015''''' is a unified classification system for all sectors of the UK construction industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenbs.com/services/our-tools/introducing-uniclass-2015|title=Introducing Uniclass 2015|publisher=theNBS.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains consistent tables classifying items of all scales, from facilities such as a railway to products like [[anchor plate]]s, flue liners or [[LED lamp]]s. 

Originally released in 1997, Uniclass allows project information to be structured to a recognised standard. This original version has now been heavily revised, to make it more suitable for use with modern construction industry practice, and to make it compatible with BIM ([[Building information modeling]]) now and in the future. 

Led by the [[National Building Specification]] (NBS), experts from across the industry have developed the new system, known as Uniclass 2015.  This significantly extends the scope of the previous version, and responds to industry feedback on the draft tables known as Uniclass 2, published by CPI in 2013.

Uniclass 2015 provides:

*A unified classification system for the construction industry. For the first time, buildings, landscape and infrastructure can be classified under one unified scheme
*A hierarchical suite of tables that support classification from a university campus or road network to a floor tile or kerb unit
*A numbering system that is flexible enough to accommodate future classification requirements
*A system compliant with [[ISO 12006]] that is mapped to NRM1 and supports mapping to other classification systems in the future
*A classification system that will be maintained and updated by NBS.

==Development==
Uniclass 2015 has been restructured and redeveloped to provide a comprehensive system suitable for use by the entire industry, including the infrastructure, landscape, and engineering services as well as the building sector, and for all stages in a project life cycle.

Uniclass 2015 provides a means of structuring project information essential for the adoption of BIM Level 2. Information about a project can be generated, used and retrieved throughout the life cycle.

The initial classification work has focussed on the seven core tables that describe an asset required to support the Digital Plan of Work; additional tables covering Form of Information, Project Management and Construction Aids are also under development.

Uniclass 2015 has been carefully structured to be in accordance with ISO 12006-2 ''Building construction – Organization of information about construction works – Part 2: Framework for classification''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61753|title=ISO 12006-2:2015 Building construction -- Organization of information about construction works -- Part 2: Framework for classification|publisher=iso.org|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that Uniclass 2015 is particularly suited to use in an international context, as mapping to other similarly compliant schemes around the world is streamlined.

==Application==
Uniclass 2015 is divided into a set of tables, each accommodating a different ‘class’ of information.  These can be used to categorise information for costing, briefing, CAD layering, etc. as well as when preparing specifications or other production documents.

These tables are also suitable for buildings and other assets in use, and maintaining asset management and facilities management information.

==The tables==
The suite of tables&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/classification#classificationtables|title=Full Uniclass 2015 classification tables|publisher=theNBS.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are broadly hierarchical, and allow information about a project to be defined from the broadest view of it to the most detailed.  For detailed design and construction, the main starting point are '''Entities''', which are composed of '''Elements'''; Elements are made up of '''Systems''' which in turn contain '''Products'''. 

Entities can also be described using the '''Spaces''' and '''Activities''' tables if required, and at the more general level the '''Complexes''' table contains terms that can be thought of as groupings of Entities, Activities and Spaces.  

Looked at more closely, the tables comprise:

*'''Complexes''': a Complex describes a project in overall terms. It can be a private house with garden, drive, garage and tool shed, or it can be a University campus with buildings for lecturing, administration, sport, halls of residence, etc. Rail networks and airports are also examples of complexes
*'''Entities''': Entities are discrete things like buildings, bridges, tunnels etc. They provide the areas where different activities occur
*'''Activities''': this defines the activities to be carried out in the complex, entity or space. For example a prison complex provides a Detention activity at a high level, but can also be broken down into individual activities like exercise, sleeping, eating, working, etc.  The Activities table also includes surveys, operation and maintenance and services
*'''Spaces/Locations''': in buildings, spaces are provided for various activities to take place. In some cases a space is only suitable for one activity, for example a kitchen, but a school hall may be used for assemblies, lunches, sports, concerts and dramas. Also classed as spaces are transport corridors that run between two locations, such as the railway between London Kings Cross to Newcastle, or the M1 from London to Leeds
*'''Elements and functions''': elements are the main components of a structure like a bridge (foundations, piers, deck) or a building (floors, walls and roofs). Functions cover things like lighting, heating and water: general requirements that are not yet designed
*'''Systems''': Systems are the collection of components that go together to make an element or to carry out a function. For a pitched roof, the rafters, lining, tiles, ceiling boards, insulation and ceiling finish comprise a system, or a low temperature hot water heating system is formed from a boiler, pipework, tank, radiators etc.
*'''Products''': finally, the individual products used to construct a system can be specified, e.g. joist hangers, terrazzo tiles, gas fired boilers.

==Using the classification system==
The tables need to be flexible and to be able to accommodate sufficient codings to ensure coverage, to allow for a multitude of items and circumstances, including new technologies and developments that are yet to emerge.

Each code consists of either four or five pairs of characters. The initial pair identifies which table is being used and employs letters. The four following pairs represent groups, sub-groups, sections and objects. By selecting pairs of numbers, up to 99 items can be included in each group of codes, allowing plenty of scope for inclusion.

For example, Systems are arranged in groups with subgroups which are sub divided, which leads to the final object code.  For instance: 

*'''SS_30''' Roof, floor and paving systems
*'''SS_30_10''' Pitched, arched and domed roof structure systems
*'''SS_30_10_30''' Framed roof structure systems
*'''SS_30_10_30_25''' Heavy steel roof framing systems

or

*'''SS_50''' Disposal systems
*'''SS_50_75''' Wastewater storage, treatment and disposal systems
*'''SS_50_75_67''' Primary sewage treatment and final settlement systems
*'''SS_50_75_67_46''' Lamella tank systems

The '''Walker Art Gallery''' is an art gallery in [[Liverpool]], which houses one of the largest art collections in England, outside [[London]]. It is part of the [[National Museums Liverpool]] group, and is promoted as "the [[National Gallery]] of the North" because it is not a local or regional gallery but is part of the national museums and galleries administered directly from central government funds.

==History of Gallery and origins of the collection==
[[File:Arthur Devis - Mr and Mrs Atherton - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|288px| [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]] - ''Mr and Mrs Atherton'']]
The Walker Art Gallery's collection dates from 1819 when the [[Liverpool Royal Institution]] acquired 37 paintings from the collection of [[William Roscoe]], who had to sell his collection following the failure of his banking business, though it was saved from being broken up by his friends and associates.

In 1843, the Royal Institution’s collection was displayed in a purpose-built gallery next to the Institution’s main premises. In 1850 negotiations by an association of citizens to take over the Institution’s collection, for display in a proposed art gallery, library and museum, came to nothing.

The collection grew over the following decades: in 1851 Liverpool Town Council bought [[Liverpool Academy of Arts|Liverpool Academy]]’s diploma collection and further works were acquired from the Liverpool Society for the Fine Arts, founded in 1858. The competition between the Academy and Society eventually led to both collapsing.

[[William Brown Library and Museum]] opened in 1860, named after a Liverpool merchant whose generosity enabled the Town Council to act upon an 1852 Act of Parliament which allowed the establishment of a public library, museum and art gallery, and in 1871 the council organised the first Liverpool Autumn Exhibition, held at the new library and museum.

The success of the exhibition enabled the Library, Museum and Arts Committee to purchase works for the council’s permanent collection, buying around 150 works between 1871 and 1910.

[[File:Martin Archer Shee - William Roscoe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright| Martin Archer Shee - ''[[William Roscoe]]'', whose collection was the first founding collection of the gallery]]
Designed by local architects [[Cornelius Sherlock]] and [[Henry Hill Vale (architect)|H. H. Vale]], the Walker Art Gallery was opened on 6 September 1877 by [[Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby]]. It is named after its founding benefactor, [[Andrew Barclay Walker|Sir Andrew Barclay Walker]] (1824–1893), a former mayor of Liverpool and wealthy [[Brewing|brewer]] born in [[Ayrshire]] who expanded the family business to [[England]] and moved to live in [[Gateacre]].

In 1893, the Liverpool Royal Institution placed its collection on long-term loan to the gallery and in 1948 presented William Roscoe's collection and other works. This occurred during post-war reconstruction when the gallery was closed, re-opening in 1951. During the [[Second World War]] the gallery was taken over by the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] and the collection was dispersed for safety.

Extensions to the gallery were opened in 1884 and 1933 (following a two-year closure) when the gallery re-opened with an exhibition including [[Picasso]] and [[Gauguin]]. In 2002 the gallery re-opened following a major refurbishment.

In 1986, the gallery achieved national status, as part of the [[National Museums Liverpool|National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/about/history/1873-1929.aspx "The foundation of the Walker Art Gallery ", National Museums Liverpool] Retrieved 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/about/history/1931-2002.aspx "Expansion and growth of the Walker Art Gallery", National Museums Liverpool] Retrieved 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Walker's collection includes Italian and Netherlandish paintings from 1300–1550, European art from 1550–1900, including works by [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Poussin]] and [[Degas]], 18th and 19th-century British art, including a major collection of [[Victorian painting]] and many [[Pre-Raphaelite]] works, a wide collection of prints, drawings and watercolours, 20th-century works by artists such as [[Lucian Freud]], [[David Hockney]] and [[Gilbert and George]] and a major sculpture collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/ "Collections", National Museums Liverpool] Retrieved 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The select collection of minor or decorative arts covers a wide range, from Gothic ivories to British ceramics up to the present day.

The first [[John Moores Painting Prize|John Moores Contemporary Painting Prize]] exhibition was held in 1957. Sponsored by Sir John Moores, founder of Littlewoods, the competition has been held every two years ever since and is the biggest painting prize in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/johnmoores/ "John Moores Contemporary Painting Prize", National Museums Liverpool] Retrieved 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a regular programme of temporary exhibitions which in 2009-10 has included Aubrey Williams, Bridget Riley, Sickert and Freud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/events/past-exhibitions.aspx "Exhibition archive", National Museums Liverpool] Retrieved 25 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the gallery staged ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'', the first national museum exhibition of the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Richard |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art24134 |title= Stuckist's Punk Victorian gatecrashes Walker's Biennial |publisher= Culture24 |date=17 September 2004 |accessdate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery also takes part in the [[Liverpool Biennial]].

The gallery is located on [[William Brown Street]] (the only street in the UK to consist of nothing other than museums, galleries and libraries) in a neo-Classical building.

The neighbouring area includes the [[William Brown Library]], [[World Museum Liverpool]], [[St George’s Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]], [[Wellington's Column]], [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street Station]] and the entrance to the [[Queensway Tunnel]]. The other major art gallery in Liverpool is [[Tate Liverpool]], at the [[Albert Dock]], which houses modern art.

On 17 December 2011, the Walker Art Gallery got a new addition to its collection - a statue of a priest vandalised by Banksy. The renowned graffiti artist has sawn off the face of an 18th-century replica stone bust and glued on a selection of bathroom tiles. The resulting 'pixellated' portrait is entitled ''Cardinal Sin'' and is believed to be a comment on the abuse scandal in the Church and its subsequent cover-up. This piece of art is displayed in Room three, which is one of the 17th-century Old Master galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/room-guide/banksy-sculpture-liverpool.aspx |title=Banksy sculpture at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool |publisher=Liverpool museums |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2 July 2013, the ''La Masseuse'' sculpture by Edgar Degas, previously owned by [[Lucian Freud]], found a permanent home at the Walker Art Gallery, thanks to the donation-in-payment system put in place by the Arts Council England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmediaagency.com/en/68980/degas-finds-refuge-at-the-walker-art-gallery/ |title=Degas finds refuge at the Walker Art Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WhizFolders''' is an organizer and outliner for managing notes on [[MS Windows]]. WhizFolders has been around since 1998. Its predecessor WhizNote, a plain text notes organizer, was released in CompuServe forums in 1993.

WhizFolders allows to manage your information in two-panes--the left pane being a hierarchical list of note titles and the right-pane contains the detail or text of the selected note in the list. The notes can be merged when copying to the clipboard, or when exporting or printing. A boolean search for information is available. Keyword tags can also be assigned to the notes to find them even when the actual tag is absent in their text.

A freeware viewer is separately available to read WhizFolder files.

==Features==
*Hierarchical list of note titles
*Word wrapped note titles
*Drag and drop outlining of note titles
*Rich text note contents (RTF)
*Boolean or exact search
*Keyword tags

The '''Zoological Museum Amsterdam''' (ZMA) was a [[natural history museum]] located close to [[Oosterpark (Amsterdam)|Oosterpark]] in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. It was part of the Faculty of Science, Mathematics and Computer Science (Science) of the [[University of Amsterdam]].

It was one of the two major natural history museums in the Netherlands. The total collection included approximately 13 million objects and was used mainly for scientific purposes. In addition to the museum function of the management and conservation of collections and exhibition, it was also a major scientific and (university) education function. At the Aquarium Building [[Natura Artis Magistra|Artis]] Department organized exhibitions around the theme of human nature. The museum was divided into three sections - [[Vertebrates]], [[Invertebrates]] and [[Entomology]] - and two departments, Exhibitions and Biodiversity Informatics.&lt;ref name="uva" /&gt;

In 2011, the collection of the Zoological Museum was merged into that of [[Naturalis]] and the [[National Herbarium of the Netherlands]] in [[NCB Naturalis]] (Dutch Centre for Biodiversity), launched on 26 January 2010.&lt;ref name="merger" /&gt; To highlight the move, the Naturalis museum has an exhibition on "Naturalia, circus animals to scientific object", in which objects from the collection of the ZMA are displayed, between 14 October 2011 and 19 August 2012.&lt;ref name="exhibit"/&gt;
