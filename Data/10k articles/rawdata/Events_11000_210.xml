The professional Guest of Honor at the 34th [[Worldcon]] was former Kansas Citian [[Robert A. Heinlein]].  He did not prepare a formal guest of honor speech, as such, but gave a generally well received one, immediately following the convention's [[Hugo Awards]] ceremony at the nearby [[Art Deco]]-inspired Music Hall section of the [[Kansas City Municipal Auditorium]]. Heinlein came with an alarm clock and put it on his center stage podium and spoke casually until his own preset time period ended with the alarm going off. Heinlein was previously the Guest of Honor at the [[3rd World Science Fiction Convention|3rd Worldcon]] (1941) and the [[19th World Science Fiction Convention|19th Worldcon]] (1961). He remains the only science fiction writer honored three times by the annual World Science Fiction Convention. Heinlein attended many MidAmeriCon events, including a blood donation drive and later donor reception held at the nearby Hotel Continental, one of the Worldcon's overflow hotels. Being someone with a very rare blood type, Heinlein had organized the blood drive and reception to honor those anonymous donors who had donated blood, saving lives during surgeries, including his own earlier in the decade.

Longtime fan artist [[George Barr (artist)|George Barr]] was the convention's Fan [[Science fiction convention#Guests of Honor|Guest of Honor]]. He created the convention's official [[black-and-white]] logo artwork and painted the full-color wrap-around [[dust jacket]] artwork used on the convention's hardcover program book. His hardcover art book, ''Upon the Winds of Yesterday'' from Donald F. Grant, Publisher, made its debut at MidAmeriCon.

Well known, long time fan and fan writer and professional science fiction and mystery writer [[Wilson Tucker]] (aka Bob Tucker) served as the convention's Toastmaster.

==Programming and events==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

===''The Star Wars'' display===
Listed in the MidAmeriCon pocket program was "The Star Wars Display" in Muehlebach Towers meeting room 364 (aka The Chapel). Charles Lippincott, [[lucasfilm|Star Wars Corporation]]'s vice-president of advertising, publicity, promotion, and merchandising, producer [[Gary Kurtz]], and actor [[Mark Hamill]] were on hand promoting the upcoming [[George Lucas]] film, that would be released 9 months later in May 1977. At that point, the space fantasy was being called ''The Star Wars'' (''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''). Three of the film's [[Theatrical property|costumes]] were displayed on mannequins: [[Darth Vader]] and the [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] robots; also on display was Darth Vader's lightsaber (hanging from his belt) and a [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Storm Trooper]] helmet and blaster, behind-the-scenes production 8x10 stills, and a wall of framed conceptual artwork by [[Ralph McQuarrie]]. As a part of the studio's promotion of the film, an offset-printed, two-page yellow press release flyer was given away in the display room; it depicted an early graphic of the [[Luke Skywalker]] character drawn by McQuarrie. A dark blue, 2.25-inch wide promotional button, emblazoned in white type with the motto "May the Force Be With You", and a largish, full-color film poster drawn by [[Howard Chaykin]], were also made available. The display proved so popular that all three promotional items were gone by the end of the second day of the display.

===''The Star Wars'' slide presentation===
At 1:30 pm, on Saturday afternoon September 4, 1976, an hour-long presentation made up of [[35mm]] slides of the film's production artwork and on-set production photos was narrated live in the Muehlebach's Imperial Ballroom, the hotel's largest, to a standing-room-only crowd; this was presented by The Star Wars Corporation's Charles Lippincott. During the course of the presentation, he outlined in great detail the plot of the film from scene one through to the final scene. A lengthy audience question-and-answer period followed with Lippincott, producer Kurtz, and star Hamill.

===''Forbidden Planet'' soundtrack &amp; screening===
The "electronic tonalities" soundtrack for the classic [[MGM]] science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' was first released in 1976 by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]] at MidAmeriCon. It was on a vinyl [[Gramophone record|LP]] [[album]], done for the film's 20th anniversary, on the Barron's own PLANET Records label (later changed to SMALL PLANET Records and distributed by GNP Crescendo Records). The LP was premiered at the convention by the Barrons as part of a 20th Anniversary celebration of the film being held at MidAmeriCon. They helped the convention's film programming staff arrange for the rental of fine grain print of the film from MGM's archival storage vaults. Three separate screenings of ''Forbidden Planet'' were held as part of the convention's all 35mm science fiction and fantasy film retrospective. The Barrons were on-hand to promote their signed soundtrack LP, and they introduced the first of the three screenings of the film.

===First Hugo Losers party=== 
For MidAmeriCon, science fiction and [[fantasy]] author [[George R. R. Martin]], along with his good friend [[Gardner Dozois]], organized the first-ever Hugo Losers Party. They first gathered together all the leftover but previously unfinished and opened bottles of wine and liquor, and all unopened beer, and all left-over snack foods from Sunday evening's many open room parties. This was for a uniquely themed "dead dog" party: It was to be a gathering spot for all past Hugo losers (and friends and family), set to happen Monday evening after the "official" closing ceremonies for MidAmeriCon that afternoon. Martin and Dozois had planned to host this open party should Martin lose either Hugo for which he had been nominated. He became the party's undisputed host when he lost in ''both'' MidAmeriCon Hugo Awards categories: for the [[Novella|Novelette]] "...and Seven Times Never Kill Man" and the [[novella]] "The Storms of Windhaven", written with [[Lisa Tuttle]].

Whenever a past or current Hugo loser entered, Martin, standing atop his three-drawer-high room dresser, would take a swig directly from a liquor bottle, and in a loud voice announce, "Looooose," as his other arm, held on high, made a wide, sweeping downward arc, all to the delight of the assembled party goers. A little later at the party, writer [[Larry Niven]] was presented with a ''replacement'' Hugo Award by convention chairman Ken Keller. As Niven entered, from atop his dresser, Martin announced in a well-lubricated voice, "There's another loser, he ''broke'' his new Hugo". Niven had dropped and broken the award in a backstage stairwell shortly after winning it while rushing back to his auditorium seat. Niven quickly departed after receiving a loud round of good natured [[booing|boos]] and catcalls in response to Keller's presentation. In the years and decades that followed, the Hugo Losers Party became an annual event and evolved into one of the largest social gatherings held annually at every Worldcon.

===First hardcover program &amp; souvenir book===
The convention also produced another first: a highly collectible hardcover 172 page program and souvenir book, edited and designed by [[Tom Reamy]]. The book contained articles, essays, an artists' portfolio illustrating scenes from the novels of Guest of Honor Robert A. Heinlein, fiction by [[Harlan Ellison]] and [[Howard Waldrop]], as well as convention-related items like guest biographies, detailed film program notes, a membership list, and paid advertising. Only two other hardcovers have subsequently been done, one by the [[45th World Science Fiction Convention]] and one by the [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention]].

===Hugo awards===
====Ceremony and format change====
At MidAmeriCon, the 22nd Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards, the Hugos, were held for the very first time as a stand-alone, separate event and not given out during a traditional combined guests of honor speeches and awards banquet in the Radisson Muehlebach Hotel. Instead, Sunday evening of the convention, they were presented in the nearby 2600-seat Music Hall of Kansas City's [[Art Deco]] Municipal Auditorium complex, in keeping with MidAmeriCon's theme, "Science Fiction and the Arts".  
 
As convention members entered the Art Deco opulence of the Music Hall to take their seats, they were greeted by a variety of popular 1930's show tunes playing from the auditorium's speakers. The house lights slowly fading to black, announced the start of the ceremony. Multiple super trooper spotlights began quickly panning the curtained stage area, just as [[Benny Goodman]]'s original up-tempo show tune "Hoorah for Hollywood" began playing from the speakers. As the tune ended, the spotlights abruptly stopped, just as The Music Hall's house lights slowly began to come up. Max Steiner's dramatic ''[[Overture]]'' from his score to the 1932 fantasy film ''[[King Kong]]'' began playing, just as the stage's seven sets of vertical and horizontal drapery were set in motion. The black grand drape opened slowly, revealing six colored vertical and horizontal drapes, opening one after the other, in sync to the movements of one minute and 30 second Steiner composition. While the score was still playing, the stage became fully exposed and MidAmeriCon's logo was projected onto a [[cyclorama]] backdrop: "MidAmeriCon Presents (slide dissolve) The 22nd Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards (slide dissolve) The Hugos", and the rousing Steiner composition ended. From offstage, a voice-over by Kansas City actor David Wilson, intoned ''King Kong'' dialog, "''He was a King and a God in the world he knew'' (slight pause), but we've tamed and brought him here for you tonight' (slight pause). Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 8th Wonder of the Science Fiction World, Mr. Bob Tucker". After the applause died down, toastmaster Bob Tucker began his opening remarks, some humorous, and made several quick announcements. The Hugo Awards were then presented.

Bob was assisted on stage throughout the ceremony by MAC committee member [[Pat Cadigan]] and Hugo Awards sub-committee member India Boone. They brought the nominee envelopes and Hugo Awards from back stage as Bob Tucker announced the recipients, who came on stage from a special nominee's seating area at the front of the Music Hall.

Guest of Honor Robert A. Heinlein's delivered his guest of honor address immediately following the Hugo Awards presentation.

====First "themed" Hugo base====
MidAmeriCon also presented another Worldcon first, a "themed" base used for the Hugo Award: "The Dragon and the Rocket". Instead of being made out of finished wood in square or angled stacked shapes, as in the past, all bases were cast from flexible molds using a marbled effect achieved by combining contrasting tinted [[porcelain]] powder layers with resin and a hardener. When cured, a low-luster clear outer finish was then applied. Each example featured a sculpted, just-hatched dragon (representing the fantasy genre) wrapped half-way around each ''round'' 4.5" tall base. The traditional 13" tall, four-finned Hugo rocket (representing science fiction) was [[31st World Science Fiction Convention|John Millard]]'s newer 1973 design; a dozen examples had been machined from billet aluminum stock and then finished with an overall semi-gloss clear outer coat. The flat top of each base had a 4-inch diameter, quarter-inch thick, sand-blasted aluminum "transition" disk that each rocket sat upon. The rocket and disc where then friction tightened to the base through its center using a long threaded bolt and nut; each base's round, flat bottom was then covered with adhesive-backed black felt to hide the recessed attachment point. A curved black-and-silver engraved Hugo information plate was affixed by two screws to the base's side facing away from the wrapped dragon. The overall base design was by convention chairman Ken Keller, with the final finished design and casting master sculpted by three-time Hugo Award-winning fan artist [[Tim Kirk]] (who went on to win his fourth Hugo in the same category that year).

'''''A New Brain''''' is a [[musical theater|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[William Finn]] and book by Finn and [[James Lapine]]. Though many of Finn's previous musicals were to some extent autobiographical, ''A New Brain'' dealt directly with his own harrowing experience with an [[arteriovenous malformation]] and the healing power of art.&lt;ref name=lincoln&gt;[http://lct.org/showMain.htm?id=133 "'A New Brain' at the Newhouse, Background, Cast and Creatives"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325112538/http://lct.org/showMain.htm?id=133 |date=March 25, 2012 }}. Lincoln Center Theater, accessed December 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The hero of the musical, Gordon Schwinn, worries that he may not live to complete his work.  Finn wrote many of the songs soon after his release from the hospital. The musical premiered [[Off-Broadway]] in 1998 and has been revived in the U.S., England and elsewhere.

==Productions==
''A New Brain'' started as a "series of songs that Bill Finn wrote after he left the hospital", with a concert of those songs produced at [[The Public Theater]].&lt;ref name=andre&gt;Bishop, Andre. [http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/a-new-brain#tracks "'A New Brain' Liner Notes"]. MasterworksBroadway, accessed December 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A fully staged workshop production was held in 1996 and again in 1997 and included contributions by Lapine.&lt;ref name=andre/&gt;

The musical was first produced Off-Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at [[Lincoln Center]], with previews beginning on May 14, 1998, and closed on October 11, 1998.&lt;ref name=haun&gt;Haun, Harry and Lefkowitz, David and Simonson, Robert.

==Plot==
Lisa, a homeless woman, asks the audience for some change. Songwriter Gordon Schwinn works at his piano to meet a deadline, irritated because he must write a song about spring for children's television host Mr. Bungee, who dresses as a frog ("Frogs Have So Much Spring (The Spring Song)"). Gordon takes a break from writing The Spring Song to meet his best friend Rhoda at a restaurant, where the waitress, who is a fan of Mr. Bungee, informs Gordon and Rhoda of the specials at the restaurant, including ("Calamari"). During lunch, he clutches his head and falls face first into his meal. Rhoda calls an ambulance ("911 Emergency") and Gordon is taken to the hospital. Gordon's greatest fear is dying with his greatest songs still inside him ("I Have so Many Songs"), to which he ponders about what makes a song (“Heart and Music”). Gordon's mother, Mimi, arrives and insists that ("Mother's Gonna Make Things Fine"). A neurosurgeon, Dr. Jafar Berensteiner, explains that there's ("Trouble in His Brain") and that an MRI is necessary.

Gordon snaps at Mimi for underestimating his condition and not listening to the Doctor, to which a hallucination of Mr. Bungee appears, telling Gordon to ("Be Polite To Everyone"), and Gordon tells it to leave. Gordon daydreams about his boyfriend Roger, who is on his way to the hospital from a ("Sailing") trip. The nurses, sadistic Nancy D. and compassionate Richard, are introduced. Nancy D. requests a ("Family History"), prompting Gordon to ponder why he only inherited the bad traits from his parents ("Gordon's Law of Genetics"). He reflects on his father's abandonment ("And They're Off"). ("Roger Arrives") and spends some time with Gordon, who tells him to ("Just Go"). Richard enters to give Gordon a sponge bath in preparation for his (“MRI Tomorrow”). During the sponge bath, Richard complains that he is ("Poor, Unsuccessful and Fat"). Gordon hallucinates and sees Mr. Bungee who continually bullies him. Gordon is visited by a minister, who tries to inflict his Protestant beliefs on Gordon, who is Jewish. Gordon asks him to leave, and goes to sleep.

Gordon is woken by Nancy, who informs him that it’s (“MRI Day”). To cope with his claustrophobia, he thinks about a past sailing trip with Roger ("Sitting Becalmed in the Lee of Cuttyhunk"). Dr. Berensteiner tells Gordon that he has an [[arteriovenous malformation]], and needs a ("[[Craniotomy]]"). Nancy D. informs him of the risks - if he doesn't go through with the operation, he could die, however, if Dr. Berensteiner is not exact with his surgery, he could also die.  Gordon, given the choice by the Doctor, decides to go through with the operation, and Roger offers to sleep with Gordon that night ("An Invitation to Sleep In My Arms"). Rhoda arrives with news that Mr. Bungee needs a new song by the next morning, so Gordon declines Roger's offer and decides to write instead. He then hallucinates about Lisa, who he encountered earlier on his way to lunch with Rhoda. Lisa implores the audience for ("Change"), both physical money and social change. Gordon presents his new song, ("Yes"), to Mr. Bungee, who hates it, storming off to leave Gordon dejected ("In the Middle of the Room"). Mimi cleans Gordon's apartment, and in a rage, throws out all of his books ("Throw It Out"). Gordon waits anxiously as his surgery is delayed ("In the Middle of the Room (Part 2)"). Then the operation commences. 

Roger, distraught about the surgery, encounters Lisa who consoles him ("A Really Lousy Day in the Universe"). In a coma, Gordon hallucinates a surrealistic mini-opera featuring people from his life ("Brain Dead", "Whenever I Dream", "Eating Myself Up Alive", "The Music Still Plays On") concluding with a friendly Mr. Bungee telling Gordon (“Don’t Give In”), leading him back to consciousness. Dr. Berensteiner celebrates the successful surgery ("Craniotomy (Reprise)"). Gordon and Roger fool around in the hospital shower, much to Richard's dismay ("You Boys Are Gonna Get Me In Such Trouble"). Gordon expresses his new appreciation for life ("Sailing (Reprise)"). 

Months later, Gordon has recovered and is enjoying a new, more fulfilled life with Roger. They run into Lisa, who is selling Gordon's books that Mimi threw out. Gordon and Roger ask for them back, but she refuses ("The Homeless Lady's Revenge"). She flees, leaving Gordon furious, but Roger calms him down ("Time"). Gordon has overcome his fear of dying with his greatest songs inside him ("Time and Music"). With his life at last in balance, he is able to write again and finishes the spring song ("I Feel so Much Spring").

==Critical reception==
[[Ben Brantley]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote: "The problem is that for Mr. Finn (and probably, alas, for most people), happiness is definitely a blander muse than anxiety. ''A New Brain,'' which has been directed with wit and elegance by Graciela Daniele, has moments of captivating eccentricity. But watching it is often like passing a group of animated, slightly drunken revelers on the street: you're glad they have something to celebrate, but it's a private party, and you walk on by with a faint smile. Mr. Finn originally conceived what became ''A New Brain'' as a series of revue numbers, and it might have worked better in that format. As a story, shaped by Mr. Finn and his longtime collaborator, James Lapine, the show has a spliced-together feeling, a disjunctive quality at odds with the holistic spirit it seems to be aiming for."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/theater/061998brain-theater-review.html "Theater Review; A Romp Through the Valley of Death"] ''The New York Times'', June 19, 1998, accessed June 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antlers Gallery''' is a [[Commercial art|commercial gallery]] based in [[Bristol]] England.  Created in 2010 by gallery Director Jack Gibbon, Antlers Gallery produces temporary exhibitions across varying locations, with their only permanent base being online. Dubbed the '[[nomadic]]' gallery, they use a similar business model to pop – up galleries but tie these together under the gallery brand. Antlers also have an active publishing wing working with artists producing limited edition prints and multiples.

Antlers Gallery represent a group of contemporary artists through exhibitions, art fairs and consultancy. Although primarily based in Bristol – with exhibitions held in areas such as [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]], [[Cabot Circus]], [[Whiteladies Road]], [[Christmas Steps, Bristol|Christmas Steps]] and [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]]. Previous exhibitions have also been held in [[Stroud]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[London]]. Antlers Gallery exhibit at art fairs across the U.K, including the [[Affordable Art Fair]]s and [[London Art Fair]].

The Antlers model is based on mutually beneficial relationships with private landlords. These have included:- [[Land Securities]], TCN UK, Jess Properties, Kingsley Thomas, and Linden Homes.

[[Anima mundi|''Anima Mundi'']] ran from 5 – 27 July. The main focus of the exhibition was a 5m long, concertina bookwork created by Tim Lane.

An '''assembly hall''' is a kind of [[Hall|function hall]], a large room used to hold public meetings or meetings of the members of an organization such as a school, church, or [[deliberative assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/assembly-hall|title=Assembly hall definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the last case is the [[Assembly Hall (Washington, Mississippi)]] where the general assembly of the state of [[Mississippi]] was held. Some [[Christian]] denominations call their meeting places or places of worship assembly halls, for example the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]. Elders and ministers of [[Presbyterian]] churches gather in assembly halls for their [[General Assembly (Presbyterian church)|general assembly]], such as in the [[General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland]].

'''''Belorusy i rynok''''' ({{lang-ru|Белорусы и рынок}}, {{IPA-ru|bʲɛləˈrusɨ ɪ ˈrʲnək|pron}}) is the main business weekly newspaper published in [[Belarus]].

The newspaper was founded in 1990 under the name ''Belorusskij rynok'' (Белорусский рынок, ''The Belarusian Market'') and was one of the first private media in Belarus.

In 2005 the newspaper had to change its name following a decree of president [[Lukashenka]] that forbid usage of the words ''National'' and ''Belarusian'' in names of organisations and newspapers.

Current chief editor is [[Viačasłaŭ Chadasoŭski]].

The newspaper is published mainly in [[Russian language]].

The '''China–Japan–South Korea trilateral summit''' is an annual summit held between [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], three major countries in [[East Asia]]. The first summit was held during December 2008 in [[Fukuoka]], Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/13/content_10499574.htm Chinese, Japanese PMs meet for boosting bilateral ties]&lt;/ref&gt; The talks are focused on maintaining strong trilateral [[international relations|relations]],&lt;ref name=xh&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/13/content_10499574.htm Chinese, Japanese PMs meet, pledge to boost bilateral ties]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[economy of East Asia|regional economy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/09/content_10479144.htm China expects positive result at upcoming meeting with ROK, Japan ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211053420/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/09/content_10479144.htm |date=2008-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1CiRGpo3cM CCTV-9 English News, broadcast 13 December 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emergency management|disaster relief]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/13/content_10499644.htm China, Japan, S Korea to promote co-op on disaster management ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111141541/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/13/content_10499644.htm |date=2009-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summits were first proposed by South Korea in 2004, as a meeting outside the framework of the [[ASEAN Free Trade Area#ASEAN Plus Three|ASEAN Plus Three]], with the three major economies of East Asia having a separate community forum. In November 2007 during the ASEAN Plus Three meeting, the leaders of China, Japan and Korea held their eighth meeting, and decided to strengthen political dialogue and consultations between the three countries, eventually deciding on an [[ad hoc]] meeting to be held in 2008.

In September 2011, the three countries launched the [[Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat]] in [[Seoul]]. The Secretary-General is appointed on a two-year rotational basis in the order of Korea, Japan, and China. Each country other than the one of the Secretary-General nominates a Deputy Secretary-General respectively.

== 1st trilateral summit (2008) ==
The first separate meeting of the leaders of the three countries was held in Fukuoka, Japan. During the meeting, the "Joint Statement between the three partners" was signed and issued, which identified the direction and principles behind cooperation between China, Japan and South Korea. The conference adopted the "International Financial and Economic Issues Joint Statement", "Disaster Management of the Three Countries Joint Statement" and "Action plan to promote cooperation between China, Japan and South Korea".

===Trilateral relations===
One of the topics discussed focused in the improvement of future relations between the three countries, from strategic and long-term perspectives. Prior talks between the three countries have been hindered specifically by various territorial and historical disputes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/rtrs/20081211/tbs-japan-china-korea-21231dd_2.html Japan, South Korea, China: trilateral ties, tensions - Yahoo! Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]] stated that "China is willing to make joint efforts with Japan to continue to develop the strategic and mutually beneficial ties in a healthy and stable manner, to benefit the peoples of the two countries and other nations in the region as well." &lt;ref name=xh/&gt; Japanese prime minister [[Tarō Asō]] also expressed that he believed the best manner in dealing with the [[Great Recession|economic crisis of 2008]] was economic partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/13/content_10499616.htm China, Japan, S Korea agree to enhance systematic co-op] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112030306/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-12/13/content_10499616.htm |date=2009-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also speculation of a future regional [[Free trade area]]. Such co-operation would greatly benefit the three nations, which account for two thirds of total trade,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2008-12/12/content_7296881.htm Regional summit to tackle crisis - Chinadaily]&lt;/ref&gt; 40% of total population and three quarters &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2008-12/15/content_7305758.htm A new channel opened up for integration of East Asia - Chinadaily]&lt;/ref&gt; of the GDP of Asia (20% of global GDP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southchinasea.org/docs/ASEAN-China%20Relations.pdf ASEAN-China Relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304235214/http://www.southchinasea.org/docs/ASEAN-China%20Relations.pdf |date=2009-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), during the ongoing economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;SBS World News Australia, 14 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2nd trilateral summit (2009) ==
The second summit was held in the [[Great Hall of the People]] in Beijing. Despite the worries of limitations that the summit has faced in 2008, this all changed in 2009, when Japan, China and Korea were forced to coordinate and cooperate more closely to manage the regional effects of the global financial crisis.

In their joint statement on the crisis, the trio identified the need to cooperate on global issues (such as financial risk) and in global institutions, including at the G20. While a reaction to global events, this cooperation began to significantly affect the management of East Asia. Over the course of 2009, the three nations resolved their long running dispute over contributions (and thus voting weight) in the Chiang Mai Initiatives, the first major ‘success’ of the ASEAN Plus Three process. The three nations also worked together to push through a general capital increase at the Asian Development Bank to help it fight the effects of the global financial crisis, a decision mandated by the G20 but about which the US appeared ambivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joel Rathus|title=China-Japan-Korea trilateral cooperation and the East Asian Community|url=http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2010/06/15/china-japan-korea-trilateral-cooperation-and-the-east-asian-community|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=EAST ASIA FORUM|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 3rd trilateral summit (2010) ==
The third summit among these three countries was held in Jeju, Korea. The prime minister of Korea, Lee Myung bak hosted the meeting and China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, Japan's prime minister Yukio Hatoyama attended the meeting. One document called the 2020 Cooperation Prospect was released, which firstly emphasized that the three countries will face up to history and cooperate for the future development. Also, looking forward to the specific goals that should be achieved in the next ten years, this document stressed the importance to concentrate on the cooperation in different fields.

In the progress of institutionalizations and improvements of the partnership, the leaders decided to enhance the communication and strategic mutual trust. The leaders agreed to establish a secretariat in Korea in 2011 to confront the natural disaster, discuss the possibility to build up the 'defense dialogue mechanism', improve the policing cooperation and boost the communication among the government. In terms of sustainable development and common prosperity, the leaders said they would try to complete the survey of the Trilateral Free Trade Area before 2012; improve the trade volume; enhance trade facilitation and they restated that they would attach great importance to the customs cooperation; make efforts to the negotiation about investment agreement and offer necessary infrastructure for the improvement of the free flow of investment capital; enhance the coordination of the financial departments; improve the effectiveness of the multilateral Chiang mai initiate; reject all forms of trade protectionism; improve the cooperation in science and innovation; and strengthen the cooperation and consultation policies in the fields of industry, energy, the energy efficiency and resource.

== 4th trilateral summit (2011) ==
Because the previous three summit meetings covered a wide range of world issues, they did not produce any concrete outcome. There was no agreement on North Korea’s nuclear development or on the March and September 2010 incidents involving North Korea. Moreover, although the leaders of the three countries had agreed to set up a permanent secretariat headquartered in Seoul to facilitate trilateral cooperation, it has still not been implemented. The three leaders had also agreed to strengthen mutual understanding and trust, expand cooperation in trade, investment, finance, and environmental protection. Not much progress has been achieved in these areas as well over the past one year.

The fourth meeting was held in the wake of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|nuclear accident at Fukushima]] and the natural disaster in Japan. Prime Minister Kan Naoto proposed to hold the summit in Fukushima to convey the message to the world that Fukushima has already become a safe place. The Japanese government hoped that if the heads of the three countries gather in the crisis-stricken city, radiation fears will be mitigated. However, due to logistic problems, the meeting could not be held in Fukushima and instead was held in Tokyo.

While Japan was accused of not providing its neighbours with accurate information when radioactive materials leaked at Fukushima, the summit led to agreement to establish an emergency notification system, enhance cooperation among experts, and share information in the event of emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rajaram Panda and Pranamita Baruah|title=Japan-China-South Korea Trilateral Summit Meet Holds Promise|url=http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/JapanChinaSouthKoreaTrilateralSummitMeetHoldsPromise_rpanda_250511|publisher=Institute for defence studies and analysis|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5th trilateral summit (2012) ==
14 May 2012, Leaders from China, Japan, and South Korea concluded the Fifth Trilateral Summit Meeting and signed the Trilateral Agreement for the Promotion, Facilitation and Protection of Investment (hereinafter referred as the Trilateral Agreement) at a summit in Beijing. The Trilateral Agreement represents a stepping stone towards a three-way free trade pact to counter global economic turbulence and to boost economic growth in Asia.

According to a joint declaration, the three nations will further enhance the “future-oriented comprehensive cooperative partnership” to unleash vitality into the economic growth of the three countries, accelerate economic integration in East Asia, and facilitate economic recovery and growth in the world.

In the joint declaration, the three nations list directions and prioritization of future cooperation, which includes enhancing mutual political trust, deepening economic and trade cooperation, promoting sustainable development, expanding social, people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and strengthening communication and coordination in regional and international affairs.

Among all these proposals, the signing of the Trilateral Agreement and the decision to endorse the recommendation from the trade ministers to launch the trilateral FTA negotiations within this year are at the top of the priority list in deepening economic and trade cooperation.&lt;ref name="News article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Xiaolei Gu|title=China-Japan-South Korea Sign Trilateral Agreement and Launch FTA Talks|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2012/05/14/china-japan-south-korea-sign-trilateral-agreement-and-launch-fta-talks.html|accessdate=3 October 2012|newspaper=CHINA BRIEFING|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 6th trilateral summit (2015) ==
The 6th trilateral summit was held on 1 November 2015 in [[Seoul]], resuming the summit since 2012 due to varieties of disputes and issues ranging from [[World War II]] apologies to territorial disputes among the three nations. During the summit, [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Li Keqiang]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Shinzō Abe]], and [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Park Geun-hye]] agreed to meet annually in order to work towards deepening trade relations with the [[China–Japan–South Korea Free Trade Agreement|proposed trilateral free trade agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=[[Choe Sang-hun]]|title=China, Japan and South Korea Pledge to Expand Trade at Joint Meeting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/world/asia/china-japan-and-south-korea-conduct-first-trilateral-meeting-in-3-years.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also agreed to pursue the [[six-party talks]] over [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea's nuclear weapons program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Song Jung-a|title=S Korea, Japan and China agree to push for N Korea nuclear talks|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65bb9728-808a-11e5-84dc-31c8b3b18e5f.html#axzz3qIr2YZKW|accessdate=2 November 2015|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">The '''Contingency Fund for Foreign Intercourse''' (sometimes referred to as the Contingent Fund for Foreign Intercourse) was a [[United States government]] "[[black budget]]" program established in 1790 to fund covert operations primarily directed against Europe.&lt;ref name="turner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="warner"/&gt; Three years later it was consuming 12% of the government's budget and in 1846 came under the scrutiny of Congress, but the government refused to provide details of the operation of the fund.

==History==
[[File:WHOportTyler.jpg|thumb|right|An 1846 attempt by Whigs to obtain details of covert operations ordered by John Tyler, pictured, was rebuffed by then-president James Polk.]]
The Contingency Fund for Foreign Intercourse was established at the request of [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]] in July 1790 with an initial operating appropriation of $40,000. Within three years this amount had grown to more than $1 million, consuming roughly 12 percent of the [[United States federal budget]].&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt; The terms of the appropriation permitted Washington (and eventually his successors) to conceal the nature and purpose of expenditures made from the fund. Information about activities funded by the Contingency Fund are sparse, however, it is known they were generally ''ad hoc'' covert operations directed against [[Europe]]an states.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Michael|title=Historical Dictionary of United States Intelligence|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0810878909|page=xxi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KDYBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Evolution of the U.S. Intelligence Community-An Historical Overview|url=http://fas.org/irp/offdocs/int022.html|website=fas.org|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831 Senator [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]] described the purpose of the fund as one designed to finance the operation of "spies, if the gentleman pleases; for persons sent publicly and secretly to search for important information, political or commercial ... for agents to feel the pulse of foreign governments."&lt;ref name="warner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=John|title=Where Secrecy is Essential|journal=Studies in Intelligence|date=Summer 1987|pages=45–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1846 the Contingency Fund for Foreign Intercourse had come under increasing congressional scrutiny. [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] requested a full accounting of expenditures made under the fund during the just-completed administration of [[John Tyler]], a request then-president [[James Polk]] rebuffed, declaring that "in no nation is the application of such funds made public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robarge|first1=David|title=Central Intelligence Agency and Public Accountability|journal=Journal of Intelligence History|date=Winter 2010|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s the first permanent U.S. government intelligence services were established in the form of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] and the [[Military Intelligence Division]].&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

==Known operations financed by the Fund==
In its first year of existence, 1790, the fund was used to finance a sensitive diplomatic mission by [[Gouverneur Morris]] in [[London]] regarding outstanding boundary matters between the United States and United Kingdom. The first use of the fund to underwrite covert activities, meanwhile, occurred shortly thereafter when the United States secretly paid ransoms and tributes to the [[Barbary States]] for the release of American hostages and promises of non-interference with American shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knott|first1=Stephen|title=Secret and Sanctioned: Covert Operations and the American Presidency|date=1996|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=9780195100983|pages=167–170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgYxLklV7UwC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Toole|first1=GJA|title=Honorable Treachery: A History of U. S. Intelligence, Espionage, and Covert Action from the American Revolution to the CIA|date=2014|publisher=Grove/Atlantic|isbn=0802192025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 [[James Madison]] used $50,000 from the fund, equivalent to the cost of a naval [[frigate]], to acquire the [[Henry letters]], purported correspondence between alleged British spy [[John Henry (spy)|John Henry]] and the [[Governor-General of Canada]]. The publication of the papers by Madison helped generate sufficient public outrage to secure the passage of the [[United States declaration of war upon the United Kingdom]]. Madison also tapped the fund to secretly finance paramilitary forces in [[Florida]] as a pressure against [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of American Intelligence|url=https://www.cia.gov/kids-page/6-12th-grade/operation-history/history-of-american-intelligence.html|website=cia.gov|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard W Leopold, ''The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History'' (1962) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Babcock|first1=Kendric|title=The Rise of American Nationality, 1811–1819|date=1968|publisher=Ardent Media|pages=63–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7jlEpaxRWcC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a public statement made by president John Tyler, [[Duff Green]] was paid $1,000 from the fund to finance an operation in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1841 that influenced the appointment of the [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Lord Ashburton]] as the British negotiator in the [[Aroostook War|Maine-New Brunswick border dispute]]. The ultimate settlement of that dispute resulted in the net transfer of about {{convert|2,000|sqmi|km²}} of territory to the United States by the United Kingdom, to the consternation of many in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="warner"/&gt;

A '''Durbar festival''' is an annual [[festival]] celebrated in several cities of [[Nigeria]]. This festival marks the end of Ramadan and is also shared with eid el Kabir and eid el Fitri, Muslim holidays. It begins with prayers, followed by a parade of the Emir and his entourage on horses, accompanied by musicians, and ending at the Emir's palace. Durbar festivals are organised in cities such as [[Kano]], [[Katsina]], Sokoto, Zaria and [[Bida]], and are considered [[tourist]] attractions.

==History==
The Durbar festival was introduced to Nigeria by colonial administrators with political objectives in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinmetz |first=George|title=State/culture: State-formation After the Cultural Turn|date= 1999|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[Durbar (disambiguation)|Durbar]] is of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin and it was first linked to ceremonial assemblies marking the proclamation of Queen Victoria as the Empress of colonial India in 1877. In Nigeria, the events then were ceremonial in nature, the first Durbar was held in 1911, subsequent ceremonies were held in 1924, 1925, 1948, 1960 and 1972. The ceremonies linked together pre-colonial aspects of martial display, colonist created assemblies and celebrations of important events in [[Northern Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Augi |first=Abdullahi|title=The History and Performance of Durbar in Northern Nigeria|date= 1978|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Festac===
The Durbar festival featured prominently in the [[World Festival of Black Arts|2nd World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture]] sometimes known as Festac 77. Since Festac, the colonial origins was gradually phased out and the events were linked with pre-colonial traditions such as the importance of horses for military purposes and ceremonies in the [[Bornu Empire]] and the ceremonies of 'Hawan Sallah' and 'Hawan Idi'.

The '''Eastern Trombone Workshop (ETW)''' has become one of the largest annual events for [[trombone]] in the world. The workshop's mission is to give students, performers, and educators an opportunity to meet and share ideas, talents, and opinions about the world of trombone. ETW regularly hosts participants throughout the nation and abroad. The workshop is held at Brucker Hall—The [[United States Army Band|U.S. Army Band]]'s state-of-the-art performance center—located on historic [[Fort Myer]], [[Virginia]], just across the [[Potomac River]] from [[Washington, D.C.]]

ETW is the only professionally organized and staffed trombone workshop or conference in the United States. Soloists, educators, and students, as well as university and college trombone ensembles from around the world, attend the workshop annually.

The workshop hosts a number of solo and ensemble competitions for performers of all ages. Over 1,000 students and professional trombonists have submitted audition tapes for the various competitions sponsored by ETW since 1993. Competitions include the National Solo Competition, the National Jazz Solo Competition, the National Jazz Ensemble Competition, and the National Trombone Quartet Competition.

Soloists have the opportunity to perform with the music ensembles from the U.S. Army Band to include the U.S. Army Orchestra, Concert Band, and Blues Jazz Ensemble.

All events are open and free to the public. Activities include concerts, master classes, recitals, lectures and clinics by the leading artists of the day. The workshop annually features premier performances of new works and arrangements for [[tenor trombone|tenor]] and [[bass trombone]].

There are no registration fees.

==History==
In 1978, [[John Marcellus]], former principal trombonist with the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]], along with John Melick, former trombone instructor at [[Towson State University]], founded the Eastern Trombone Workshop at Towson State University in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. In 1981 the workshop moved to [[Florida State University]], under the direction of trombone instructor William Cramer. The [[United States Navy Band|U.S. Navy Band]] took control of the workshop in 1986, thus bringing the event to the Washington area.

In 1993, U.S. Army Band solo trombonist Scott Shelsta, with support of Colonel Bryan Shelburn, commander of the U.S. Army Band, took hold of the reins of ETW.

'''EgyptAir Flight 648''' was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens [[Ellinikon International Airport]] in Greece and [[Cairo International Airport]] in Egypt. On 23 November 1985, a [[Boeing 737-200]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |title=Accident Database: Accident Synopsis 11241985 |publisher=Airdisaster.com |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085212/http://www.airdisaster.com/cgi-bin/view_details.cgi?date=11241985&amp;reg=SU-AYH&amp;airline=EgyptAir |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; airliner, registered SU-AYH, servicing the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by the terrorist organization [[Abu Nidal]]. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by [[Egypt]]ian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. 

==Hijacking==
On 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its [[Athens]]-to-[[Cairo]] route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The [[Palestinian political violence|terrorists]], calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and [[grenade]]s.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} The terrorist leader, [[Omar Rezaq]], proceeded to check all [[passport]]s. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newdominion.com/2012/03/03/interpol-investigates-terror-in-the-skies.html Interpol Investigates – Terror in the Skies&lt;/ref&gt; aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the [[fuselage]] was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.

[[Libya]] was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, [[Malta]] was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an [[Alitalia]] aircraft was hijacked on its way to [[Italy]]. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the [[Aviator|pilot]], Hani Galal, to land at [[Luqa Airport]]. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.

The Mexican passengers were actress Lupita Pallás and her daughter Laila Ortiz de Pinedo, mother and sister of Mexican actor [[Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo]].

==Standoff==
At first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the [[Arab world]], and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 747]] landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]], rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20101123/local/anniversary-of-a-massacre-the-egyptair-hijacking-in-malta.337385|title=Anniversary of a massacre – The EgyptAir hijack in Malta|date=23 November 2010|work=[[Times of Malta]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430015446/http://www.criminaljusticedegreesguide.com/features/10-most-terrifying-airplane-hijackings-of-all-time.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2011|title=10 Most Terrifying Airplane Hijackings of All Time|date=|work=[[Criminal Justice Degrees Guide]]|page=|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds.  Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans – Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5" tall.

France, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. [[Naval Air Station Sigonella]] was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at [[Naples]]. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. [[Delta Force]] ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian [[Unit 777]] under the command of Major-General [[Kamal Attia]] was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.

==Raid==
Without warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread [[suffocation]]. On the other hand, the ''[[Times of Malta]]'', quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737–266 SU-AYH Malta-Luqa Airport (MLA) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date= |accessdate=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.

A total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.

Rezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic [[double jeopardy]]). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in [[Nigeria]]. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.

==Aftermath and criticism==
In his 1989 book ''[[Massacre in Malta]]'', [[John A. Mizzi]] writes:

{{cquote|Malta was faced with a problem it was ill-equipped to meet. The authorities took a firm stand in denying fuel to the hijackers but made no sensible provisions, through political bias and lack of experience, to meet the circumstances that arose from this decision. No proper team was set up at the outset to evaluate or deal progressively with the crisis, although only a few days previously an incident management course had been organized by a team of U.S. experts in Malta at the request of the government.&lt;ref name="Mizzi"&gt;Mizzi, J.A. (1989). ''Massacre in Malta : The Hijack of Egyptair MS 648'', 72 p:ill. J.A. Mizzi – Valletta : Technografica, 1989. DDC : 364.162&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mizzi adds:

{{cquote|The Egyptian commandos were given too free a hand and they acted out of their mission with little regard for the safety of the passengers. They were determined to get the hijackers at all costs and the Maltese government's initial refusal for U.S. anti-terrorist resources (a team led by a major-general with listening devices and other equipment) offered by the [[State Department]] through the U.S. Embassy in Malta – a decision reversed too late – contributed in no small measure to the mismanagement of the entire operation.&lt;ref name="Mizzi" /&gt;}}

Mizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold – the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the [[censorship]] of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through [[RAI TV]], when its correspondent [[Enrico Mentana]] spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: "Parlo da Malta. Qui c'è stato un massacro ..." ("I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.

Decisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in [[Floriana]]. The United States had seen the situation as so ‘hot’ that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.

EgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by [[Boeing 737-800]]. The [[flight number]] 648 
is now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.

==In popular culture==
The events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the [[Biography Channel]] television program ''[[I Survived...]]'', which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a sub-speciality in the Maltese islands, performed Ms Pflug's neurosurgical procedure. Ms Pflug also related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, ''Miles to Go Before I Sleep''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jackie Nink Pflug|author2=Peter Kizilos|title=Miles to Go Before I Sleep: A Survivor's Story of Life After a Terrorist Hijacking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=royVNfdQE6cC&amp;pg=PA102|year=2001|publisher=Hazelden Publishing|isbn=978-1-56838-837-3|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an ''[[Interpol Investigates]]'' episode, [[Interpol Investigates#Terror in the Skies|"Terror in the Skies"]], broadcast by the [[National Geographic Channel]].

The hijacking is also the subject of the book ''Valinda, Our Daughter'', written by Canadian author [[Gladys Taylor (publisher)|Gladys Taylor]].

The events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot in [[Brad Thor]]'s novel Path of the Assassin.

[[File:Jubilant (18614107969).jpg|right|thumb|260px|A [[cosplay]]er dressed as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] at the inaugural Flame Con on June 13, 2015 at [[Grand Prospect Hall]]]]

'''Flame Con''' is an annual two-day multi-genre entertainment and [[Comic book convention|comic convention]], focused on fans and creators of [[pop culture]] who are [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] (LGBTQ). Launched in 2015, it is the first LGBTQ comic convention in New York City,&lt;ref name="SLATE"/&gt; and bills itself the largest LGBTQ comic convention in the world.&lt;ref name="FC2018-PRESS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SYFY"/&gt;

==Programming==
Flame Con is organized by [[Geeks OUT]], a non-profit organization aimed at organizing LGBTQ events at comic conventions.&lt;ref name="FC2018-PRESS"/&gt; The convention is a multi-genre event, showcasing LGBTQ-inclusive pop culture across [[comics]], [[graphic novel]]s, [[anime]], [[manga]], video games, movies, and television. Flame Con features panel discussions, workshops, and an exhibitors floor.&lt;ref name="FC2018-PRESS"/&gt; The convention is launched with an annual kick-off party, which features a dance party and [[Drag queen|drag performances]].&lt;ref name="FIRESTARTER"/&gt;

In partnership with the [[Ali Forney Center]], the Sunday of each Flame Con is designated as "Youth Day", in which attendees under the age of 20 are granted free admission.&lt;ref name="SYFY"/&gt;

==History==
Flame Con launched as a [[Kickstarter]] campaign in November 2014, with a fundraising goal of $15,000.&lt;ref name="OUT2014"/&gt; The campaign would ultimately raise over $19,000,&lt;ref name="KICK"/&gt; and was inaugurated as a one-day convention in June 2015. The following year, Flame Con moved from [[Grand Prospect Hall]] to the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott, and expanded to two days of programming. In 2018, Flame Con relocated from Brooklyn to [[Manhattan]] to be held at the [[Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel]].&lt;ref name="COMICSBEAT"/&gt;

After the [[Orlando nightclub shooting|2016 shooting at Pulse nightclub]], Flame Con instituted a ban on all [[Toy weapon|prop weapons]] at the convention, including those used in [[cosplay]].&lt;ref name="BAN1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BAN2"/&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''Fuji Grand Champion Series'''|富士グランドチャンピオンレース}} ran from 1971 to 1989. It was a drivers' championship in Japan and was originally for 2 litre [[Group 6 (racing)|Group B6]] cars. The series was started in 1973, and all races were held at the [[Fuji Speedway]] circuit.

== History ==

In its formative years, cars eligible to start included the [[March 74S]], [[Alpine A441 Renault]], [[Chevron Cars Ltd|Chevron]], [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]] and [[Group Racing Developments|GRD]].

In its second year of running, it had its first fatalities. At the start of the second race of the second round of the 1974 series, two cars were racing for the lead. They collided and [[Hiroshi Kazato]] and [[Seiichi Suzuki]] crashed into them, causing a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/sport/simonarron/5425366/Touching_tribute_to_the_fallen_heroes_of_a_bygone_era_/ |title=Touching tribute to the fallen heroes of a bygone era |first=Simon |last=Arron |date=2008-10-11 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kazato, 25, and Suzuki, 37, were killed. The race was immediately abandoned, and the circuit was reconstructed with the hairpin first corner that exists to this day, bypassing the banking.

A change in the rules in 1979 made it possible for single seat sportscars, similar to the revived Can-Am series, to race in the series.

In the second race of 1983 [[Famiyasu Sato]] was killed in practice. Later in the series, [[Toru Takahashi (racing driver)|Toru Takahashi]] was killed when his car spun, and the aerodynamics of the car caused it to fly through the air, driver's head-first into the catch fencing, also killing a spectator.  This led to a further change in the circuit where a chicane was added in 300R (the final corner) to slow the cars.

The maximum engine size limit was increased to 3 litres in 1987. In 1988, the series changed its name from Fuji Grand Champion series to Grand Champion series because some races added into the championship were not held at Fuji.

The late 1980s saw attendance dropping, and after 1989 the series folded.

==Revival==
The series was revived again in 2002 as GC-21, like its predecessor;&lt;ref name="RSCgc21"&gt;http://www.racingsportscars.com/championship/GC21.html&lt;/ref&gt; the series used [[Dallara GC21]] cars, which were rebodied [[Formula Three|F3]] cars powered by [[Toyota S engine#3S-GTE|3S-GTE]] engines. Like its predecessor, it raced exclusively at [[Fuji Speedway]] with the exception of 2004, when the circuit was undergoing a major renovation work.&lt;ref name="RSCgc21"/&gt; Despite running on a small field (usually five and six cars at a time), it ran on into 2006 when the series again folded. Between [[2006 Japan Le Mans Challenge season|2006]] and [[2007 Japan Le Mans Challenge season|2007]], it formed part of the [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP2 class]] in the [[Japan Le Mans Challenge]].

'''Guru-da-Gaddi''' is an important [[Sikh]] religious event held every 3 November. The event honors when the tenth and last [[Sikh Guru]]s when they said 'the next Guru would be the Holy Sikh Book' [[Guru Granth Sahib]].  [[Guru Gobind Singh]], declared that [[Guru Granth Sahib]] would from that moment on be the Guru or the Guiding Force. The message was delivered on 3 November 1708 by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] at [[Nanded]] in the [[States of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]] in [[India]]. [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji established [[Khalsa]] and conferred the status of the Guru to the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and elevated it as the everlasting Guru.

This event is commemorated with a festival/ritual that starts with [[Diwali]] in [[India]] - a Hindu Sikh festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20080926/1063510.html |title=Preparations for tricentenary of Guru-Da-Gaddi in full swing |publisher=News.webindia123.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tercentenary celebrations of the occasion are being referred at Guru-da-gaddi and are being celebrated on 3 November 2008 in Nanded in [[Maharshtra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/chiefminister/On_path_of_progress.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316122505/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/chiefminister/On_path_of_progress.pdf |date=16 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaivision.com/enews/2008/Oct/02/Nanded-admin-citizens-all-set-for-Guru-Da-Gaddi-celebrations.asp ]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indopia.in/India-usa-uk-news/print-385757.html |title=indiareport.com |publisher=Indopia.in |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddinews.gov.in/Current%20Affairs |title=www.ddinews.com |publisher=www.ddinews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_news.asp?id=616948 |title=Mah Congress gets into election mode with Sonia visit &amp;#124; news.outlookindia.com |publisher=Outlookindia.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhnet.com/news/honor-300th-anniversary-guru-gaddi |title=Honor the 300th Anniversary of Guru Gaddi |publisher=SikhNet |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasion comes after celebrations of [[300 Years of Khalsa]] panth established by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] ji in 1699.

'''Havana Jam''' was a three-day [[music festival]] that took place at the [[Karl Marx Theater]], in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], on 2–4 March 1979. It was sponsored by [[Bruce Lundvall]], the president of [[Columbia Records]], [[Jerry Masucci]], the president of [[Fania Records]], and the Cuban Ministry of Culture.

The festival included, on the American side, [[Weather Report]], [[the CBS Jazz All-Stars]], the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], [[Mike Finnigan]], [[Kris Kristofferson]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.festivalfocus.org/film/148274/havana-jam-79/&lt;/ref&gt;, Tony Williams, Jaco Pastorius, [[Rita Coolidge]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/havana-jam-mw0000031691&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Billy Joel]]. The Cuban acts included [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Zaida Arrate]], [[Elena Burke]], [[Orquesta de Santiago de Cuba]], [[Conjunto Yaguarimú]], [[Frank Emilio Flynn]], [[Juan Pablo Torres]], [[Los Papines]], [[Tata Güines]], [[Cuban Percussion Ensemble]], [[Sara González]], [[Pablo Milanés]], [[Manguaré]], and [[Orquesta Aragón]].

== History ==

===Background and planning===
In 1977, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] and Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] started to loosen the political tension between the two countries and opened Interest Sections both in [[Havana]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. It was the first time in almost two decades after Castro's rise to power that there was a real interest in establishing a normalization of diplomatic relations and the lifting of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].

With a real crisis in the music industry in the [[United States]] and the start of the [[salsa music|salsa]] boom, in April 1978, [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] director, [[Bruce Lundvall]], saw an open door to probe [[Cuban music]] and together with a group of the company's music enthusiasts made a four-day trip to Havana, where they were overwhelmed by the sound of Cuban music, but especially by [[Afro-Cuban]] jazz band [[Irakere]], one of Cuba's most highly regarded and virtuoso musical acts.

After months of talks, Lundvall managed to sign Irakere and in July the group traveled to [[New York (state)|New York]] to perform an unannounced guest set at the famed [[Newport Jazz Festival|Newport Jazz Festival-New York]]. Rave reviews led to an invitation from the prestigious [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in [[Switzerland]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Irakere jamming at Havana Jam.png|thumb|left|upright=2.5|[[Ikarere]] jamming with [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Stan Getz]] and [[Jaco Pastorius]] at the Havana Jam Festival]]  --&gt;

A few months later, Irakere won their first [[Grammy]] with the album Irakere, recorded at their [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] and [[Newport Jazz Festival]] performances, and Lundvall wanted to try his luck with other Cuban bands too. So, in the Fall of 1978, he joined forces with [[Fania Records]] director [[Jerry Masucci]] and convinced the Cuban cultural authorities to organize a three-day festival in Havana with the participation of Cuban and American musicians. The event would be recorded and televised for the enjoyment of both the Cuban and American people.

So they all agreed to set a date for the festival, spontaneously entitled Havana Jam. March 2 through 4, 1979, were the days earmarked for this historical step toward establishing a cultural exchange between the two enemy nations. In order to carry out the Herculean task of planning, Lundvall brought aboard [[Jock McLean]] and [[Phil Sandhaus]], of [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]'s artists development department. Both veterans of major concert promotion, they knew the festival needed professional production of the highest caliber, and enlisted [[Showco]] (a [[Dallas]]-based concert production company) and [[Studio Instrument Rentals]] for the task.

At this point in time, Lundvall was diligently "feeling out" select members of the Columbia artist roster, all of whom were honored to accept the invitation to perform in Cuba. By early February the talent was confirmed. Representing the U.S. would be [[Billy Joel]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[Weather Report]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] with [[Rita Coolidge]], the [[Fania All-Stars]] and the [[CBS Jazz All-Stars]]. The latter group was conceptualized by Lundvall and scheduled to feature more than 20 top jazz artists on the label.

With the festival within grasp, other [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] personnel were summoned into the picture-rehearsals were set up for the [[CBS Jazz All-Stars]], travel accommodations were made, equipment was rented, a wide cross-section of media was invited, and both recording and videotaping plans were confirmed.

Record producers [[Bert deCoteaux]] and [[Mike Berniker]] flew down with a crew from the CBS Recording Studios along with a support team and mobile 24-track Recording  Studio from [[Record Plant NY]].

Engineered by David Hewitt with Phil Gitomer and Michael Guthrie. McLean, Sandhaus, Freston and various other people were already busy working in Havana's Karl Marx Auditorium when the musicians landed at the [[José Martí airport]] on March 1.

'''Havana Jam''' was an invitation-only event, with mostly cultural personalities and members of the [[Communist Party]] and their children in attendance, though some students from different art and music schools were also invited.

The festival was hardly mentioned on the Cuban press, and thirty years later not many Cubans know it ever existed.

=== The festival ===

====Friday, 2 March 1979====
With the hall filled to capacity, [[Weather Report]] opened the show, offering an assortment of sound effects before launching into their set. The audience repeatedly rose to its feet during the program, setting the festival's prevailing mood of "music over politics". Backstage, Weather Report's members ([[Joe Zawinul]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Peter Erskine]]) were later congratulated by an assortment of Cuban musicians and fans, most of whom were familiar with the group's repertoire through the aid of [[Radio stations in Florida|Florida radio]], mostly [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations such as [[WQAM]], [[WAQI|WGBS]], [[WKWF]] and [[WLCY]].

[[Weather Report]] was followed by two traditional Cuban ensembles of differing styles. The first, [[Conjunto Yaguarimú]], featured vocalists [[Zaida Arrate]] and [[Pacho Alonso]], who interpreted "dated" Cuban music. The second group, [[Orquesta Aragón]], played some of the most dynamic music of the festival, utilizing its charanga sound of violins, cello, flute and rhythm section.

The concert was running very late, and people began to leave the hall because of a midnight public transportation curfew. Hence, when the [[Fania All-Stars]] took the stage the house was half empty, yet the excitement of this ensemble-featuring practically every top name in salsa still captured the spirit of the audience. The ensemble included top salsa artists of the likes of [[Rubén Blades]], [[Johnny Pacheco]], [[Pete "El Conde" Rodríguez|Pete Rodríguez]], [[Héctor Lavoe]], [[Larry Harlow (salsa)|Larry Harlow]], [[Santos Colón]], [[Luigi Texidor]], [[Pupi Legarreta]], [[Papo Lucca]], [[Roberto Roena]], [[Adalberto Santiago]], [[Sal Cuevas]], [[Wilfrido Vargas]], and other Latin superstars.

====Saturday, 3 March 1979====
Leading off Saturday evening's entertainment was the first grouping of the [[CBS Jazz All-Sta]]rs, composed of [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Arthur Blythe]], [[Woody Shaw]], [[Hubert Laws]], [[Bobby Hutcherson]], [[Willie Bobo]], [[Cedar Walton]], [[Percy Heath]] and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]. The group performed several tunes by Walton and Jimmy Heath that had the crowd on its feet after every solo.

The stage was then turned over to the "once-in-a-life-time" [[Trio of Doom]], including luminaries [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]. The highly amplified trio captivated the audience with its unique sound. As a finale, a third ensemble came onstage: Blythe, Jimmy Heath, Laws, Bobo, [[Richard Tee]], [[Rodney Franklin]], [[Eric Gale]], [[John Lee (musician)|John Lee]] and [[Gerry Brown]]. Although their set was limited to two selections, the assemblage was also well received.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stephen Stills in Havana.png|thumb|right|upright=1|[[Stephen Stills]] doing his set in Havana]] --&gt;

What followed was the highlight of the festival, the 25-member [[Cuban Percussion Ensemble]]. The entourage featured some of the biggest names in modern [[Cuban drumming]], such as [[Tata Güines]], [[Los Papines]], [[Guillermo Barreto]] and [[Changuito]], backed by pianist [[Frank Emilio]] and his quartet.

After a masterful percussion set, Cuba was treated to its first taste of [[rock 'n' roll]] by [[Stephen Stills]]. He performed a high-energy set that featured a top-notch band that included [[Bonnie Bramlett]] and [[Mike Finnigan]]. Stills gave a sampling of his various hits throughout the years, and then jumped into the audience with his remote control guitar and sang a salute to the audience entitled [[Cuba Al Fin]].

[[Irakere]] closed the show, spurred on by the high energy audience in the theater. Featuring leader keyboardist [[Chucho Valdés]], Irakere pulled out all stops. The group was then joined by [[Rodney Franklin]], [[Richard Tee]], [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Willie Bobo]], [[Stan Getz]], [[Jaco Pastorius]] and others in an all-out jam session, bringing the evening's proceedings to an abrupt halt at 3 A.M.

====Sunday, 4 March 1979====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rita Coolidge, Kris Kristofferson and Billy Swan in Havana.png|thumb|left|upright=2|[[Rita Coolidge]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Billy Swan]] at the Havana Jam]]  --&gt;
Leading off Sunday evening's performances was trombone player [[Juan Pablo Torres]], followed by Cuban singer [[Elena Burke]].{{cn|date=October 2018}} Appearing next on the bill were [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Rita Coolidge]], backed by an excellent band composed of [[Billy Swan]] and other top musicians. Kristofferson performed first, singing many of his hit songs which were recognized by the audience. The tunes were interspersed with Kris's well-meaning stabs at speaking [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The house was rocking as [[Rita Coolidge]] took the stage and the Cubans all sang along to Coolidge's AM-radio hits.  The evening was propelled one step further when [[Sara González]]  sang several numbers accompanied by [[Pablo Milanés]] y Grupo [[Manguaré]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Then came the festival's finale, [[Billy Joel]]. Unlike most of the other acts, Joel's performance was not recorded or videotaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rare Photos: Billy Joel at Havana Jam 1979 |url=https://www.billyjoel.com/news/rare-photos-billy-joel-havana-jam-1979/ |website=Billy Joel Official Site |accessdate=3 October 2018 |date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
In 1979, Columbia released two double albums of the festival performances, ''Havana Jam'' and ''Havana Jam 2''. The [[Fania All-Stars]]'s set was released later that year as ''Havana Jam on Fania''. The Trio of Doom performance was released in 2007 as ''Trio of Doom''.

The event is recollected and revived in [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s 2009 [[documentary]] ''[[Havana Jam '79]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1793">The '''III International AIDS Conference''' was held in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1987.

==Conference highlights==
6000 researchers attended and presented 220 science reports.&lt;ref name="windom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Windom|first=Robert E.|title=The Third International AIDS Conference - Reflections|journal=Public Health Journal|date=September–October 1987|volume=102|issue=5|pages=461–462|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477906/pdf/pubhealthrep00175-0003.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2012|pmc=1477906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  900 journalists attended.&lt;ref name="windom"/&gt;

Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] spoke at the conference on the topic of confidentiality of [[HIV test]]ing, for which the government was developing a policy.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-02/news/mn-4306_1_aids-virus |title=Bush Is Booed as He Defends AIDS Proposals |first1=Marlene |last1=Cimons |first2=Harry |last2=Nelson |work=articles.latimes.com |date=2 June 1987 |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Gallo]] announced the discovery of [[HIV-2]].&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

The conference marked an international acceptance in recognizing AIDS. Between 1986-7, the number of countries which reported AIDS statistics to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] doubled.&lt;ref name="windom"/&gt; The conference brought recognition to many countries' national HIV education programs.&lt;ref name="windom"/&gt; There was no single research breakthrough at the conference which emerged as particularly newsworthy in the mass media.&lt;ref name="windom"/&gt;

The '''Indianapolis Theatre Fringe Festival''', nicknamed "IndyFringe," is a 10-day showcase of traditional and non-traditional theatre, dance, music, improvisation and a wide range of other performance and visual arts, performed and created by local, national and international artists. The festival features performances by 64 adult performance groups.

==History==
Based on the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe Festival]] that began in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], when rogue theater groups set up on the edges of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Crews, Nick (August 21, 2006). "IndyFringe goes mainstream", ''[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]'' '''27''' (24): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  IndyFringe's roots are found in Mayor [[Bart Peterson]]'s Cultural Tourism Initiative in 2001.  A group of experts and citizens met for "Theatre City Indianapolis 2012" and came up with the idea for an Indianapolis Theatre Fringe Festival.  Central Indiana Community foundation donated seed money and IndyFringe was born.&lt;ref&gt;Lieber, Tammy (August 15, 2005). "Festival prepares to kick off with help from friends", ''[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]'' '''26''' (23): 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year for the festival was 2005. The festival drew 4,775 patrons in its inaugural year. In 2006, a substantial increase in publicity and media coverage resulted in attendance doubling, with 9,677 patrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indybiznow.com/Default.aspx?TabId=391&amp;issueyear=2006&amp;issuemonth=08&amp;issueday=21&amp;page=3&amp;article=Ar00303 Indy Biz Now &gt; IBJ Articles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, there were 11,214 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Harry, Lou (August 31, 2010). "[http://www.ibj.com/lou-harrys-ae/2010/08/31/indyfringe-by-the-numbers/PARAMS/post/21999 IndyFringe by the numbers]", ''[[Indianapolis Business Journal]]''. Retrieved October 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule==
The festival is typically presented in mid August.  The 2017 festival is scheduled for August 17–27, 2017.

Performance groups are invited to apply for a place in the festival in November each year. Sixty-four groups perform on eight different stages. Approximately half of the groups are local and half are national and international.

Performances are presented at eight [[Indianapolis]] area venues: the [[Phoenix Theatre (Indianapolis)|Phoenix Theatre]], [http://www.indycomedysportz.com/ ComedySportz Theatre], [http://www.tots.org/ Theatre on the Square], IndyFringe Basile Theatre, Indy Eleven Theatre and the Fireman's Union Hall.  All are located in the [http://www.discovermassave.com/ Massachusetts Avenue Arts and Cultural District] within easy walking distance of one another.

== History ==
Insulin was introduced by Banting and Best from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1921 as an injectable agent. German researchers first introduced the idea of inhalable insulin in 1924.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost01"/&gt; Years of failure followed until scientists realized they might be able to use new technologies to turn insulin into a concentrated powder with particles sized for inhalation.

In the 1980s [[Nektar Therapeutics]] developed technology to make insulin into small particles that they licensed to Pfizer; [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] developed a delivery device that they licensed to [[Eli Lilly and Company]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost01"/&gt;

Once concrete methods were developed, human tests began in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost01"/&gt; In January 2006, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the use of Exubera, a form of inhalable insulin developed by [[Pfizer]];&lt;ref name="exubra_fda_approval"/&gt; it was approved in the UK in August 2006 but reimbursed by the [[National Health Service]] only for people who had problems with needles;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/5245344.stm|title=Inhaled insulin given UK launch|date=August 4, 2006|work=BBC News | access-date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was not reimbursed by any US insurer.&lt;ref name="Oleck_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oleck J, Kassam S, Goldman JD | title = Commentary: Why Was Inhaled Insulin a Failure in the Market? | journal = Diabetes Spectrum | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 180–4 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27574374 | pmc = 5001220 | doi = 10.2337/diaspect.29.3.180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;A 2007 [[systematic review]] concluded that the inhaled hexameric insulin (Exubera) "appears to be as effective, but no better than injected short-acting insulin. The additional cost is so much more that it is unlikely to be cost-effective."&lt;ref name="pmid17767897"/&gt;  In 2007, Pfizer announced that it would no longer manufacture or market Exubera. According to Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Kindler this was because Exubera "failed to gain acceptance among patients and physicians".&lt;ref name="cnn01"/&gt;

At the time of Exubera's discontinuation, several other companies were pursuing inhaled insulin including [[Alkermes (company)|Alkermes]] working with [[Eli Lilly and Company]],&lt;ref name="bioworldtoday01"/&gt; [[MannKind Corporation]],&lt;ref name="mannkind01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt01"/&gt; and Aradigm working with [[Novo Nordisk]]. By March 2008, all of these products had been discontinued because investors all decided to withdrew their fund, except for MannKind's Afrezza product.&lt;ref name="diabetescloseup01"/&gt;

On March 16, 2009 MannKind submitted an NDA for their inhalable insulin. In 2011 the FDA denied approval of Afrezza and because the design of the delivery device had changed, the FDA requested additional clinical trials to ensure that people would use it the same way as the earlier versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investors.mannkindcorp.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=792188|title=MannKind Corporation Receives Complete Response Letter from the FDA for AFREZZA(R)|date=January 19, 2011|access-date=July 19, 2016|publisher=MannKind Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting further studies, Mannkind submitted a new application, and in June, 2014, the FDA approved Afrezza for both Type I and Type II adult diabetics, with a label restriction for patients having asthma, active lung cancer or COPD.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabel2015&gt;{{cite web|title=US Afrezza label|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2016/022472s009lbl.pdf|publisher=FDA|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 Mannkind and Sanofi agreed that Sanofi would take over manufacturing and marketing of Afrezza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sanofi fills some big shoes in $925M Afrezza pact with MannKind|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/partnering/sanofi-fills-some-big-shoes-925m-afrezza-pact-mannkind|work=FierceBiotech|date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sanofi said it was dropping the effort in January 2016 due to poor sales of $7.5 million in 2015;&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staton|first1=Tracy | name-list-format = vanc |title=Sanofi tried and failed with Afrezza.

[[File:Mangos in market.jpg|333px|right|thumb|Over 500 [[List of mango cultivars|types of mango]] are featured at the International Mango Festival]]
The '''International Mango Festival''', held annually in [[Delhi]], India during early summer, is a two-day [[festival]] showcasing [[mango]]es.  It has been held since 1987.&lt;ref name=hindu2006&gt;{{cite news

 | newspaper = The Hindu

 | accessdate = 2007-01-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is organised by the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) in collaboration with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, the National Horticultural Board and the [[New Delhi Municipal Council]].  As in recent past years, the festival was held in the Talkatora Indoor Stadium.&lt;ref name=hindu2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=lonelypl&gt;{{cite web

&lt;ref name=times2006/&gt;

A [[tourism]] official explained:  &lt;blockquote&gt;
More than 50 mango growers from across the country, mainly from [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Gujarat]] and Delhi, were given an interactive platform to present the 'king of fruits' [...] The visitors, who normally think mango has just five or six varieties, were educated through quizzes and competitions about the huge variety of the fruit grown and innumerable possibilities of using mango in cuisine. They also enjoyed colourful entertainment programmes of music and dance. [...] It is an informal and international platform with a two-fold approach, to promote tourism as well as mango export.&lt;ref name=times2006/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More than 550 varieties and [[List of mango cultivars|cultivars of mango]] are featured in the festival for visitors to view and taste.  Among these are [[alphonso (mango)|alphonso]], mallika, [[Amrapali (mango)|amrapali]], himsagar, malda, balia, chorasya, dhaman, dhoon, fazia, gelchia, nigarin kheria, ruchika and shamasi.  Notable [[chef]]s from [[five star hotel]]s like the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Maurya Sheraton]], [[Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower]], Inter-Continental Hotel, [[Marriott India]], Qutub Hotel and Claridges around India demonstrate the preparation of assorted [[recipe]]s made with mango.&lt;ref name=times2006/&gt;

The festival is also an opportunity for agro-industries and food industries processing mangoes into [[jam]]s, [[Pickling|pickle]]s, [[fruit juice]] and [[canning|canned fruit]] to display their products.

Activities in the festival include cultural programmes and recreational events like a mango [[competitive eating|eating competition]] for women, mango [[slogan]] writing, a demonstration of mango carving, a magic show, and a quiz about mangoes.  For the mango judging competition, there are various categories and a minimum of seven ripe mangoes are required for competing in each. There is also a prize given for biggest mango.&lt;ref name=hindu2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc2002&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In describing International Mango Festival, a reporter for the [[BBC]] said: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Some visitors found the culinary preparations - unusual in a country where the fruit is primarily eaten uncooked - interesting.  India exports about 40,000 metric tonnes of mangoes to 80 countries and the annual revenue earned from exporting mangoes and mango products reaches $85 million.  Festival organisers hope the event will help to raise these figures significantly.  [[Hindu mythology]] in India gives the mango an aura of mystique as a symbol of the joy of life.&lt;ref name=bbc2002/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other festivals==
Mango festivals are also held elsewhere in the world such as one hosted by [[Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden|Fairchild Tropical Gardens]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]], United States, another in [[Cebu]], [[Philippines]] and a third in [[Negril]], [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.about.com/b/a/257621.htm About Miami]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2003/11/27/bus/rp.6th.in.export.of.fresh.mangoes..html Sun Star Cebu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negril.com/delveland-mango-festival-2005.html Fourth Annual Delveland Mango Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

9 August 2015 There will be 1st International Mango Festival Canada in Mississauga, Ontario
Organized by Canadian Friend's Front (CFF) &amp; United Canadian Pakistani Volunteers (UCPV)

Mango is an international fruit favored by many countries and loved by many communities in the city of Mississauga. We have chosen Mango to be a center attraction of this event due to diverse and rich cultural communities of Mississauga and keeping their love for it in mind. Almost every community living in Mississauga either produce Mango in their native country or import it, keeping this in mind International Mango Festival Canada is aiming to represent mango from each mango producing region in the world. We believe it is one of the most common factors between the communities here and once we hold such festival it will bring people out and engage them. We would like to engage local city vendors and businesses to participate and showcase their services and merchandise related to mango to support local economy. There has never been such event in Canada and this event will bring city of Mississauga on the map more prominently.

1st Outdoor #Mango Festival Canada will be on 4 June 2016 @ #Celebration Square ( City Hall ) Mississauga. This event is organized by CFFI ( Canadian Friends Front Intl'l &amp; Universal Promotions.  And Entry will be Free.

'''''Kalimantaan''''' is a novel by [[C. S. Godshalk]] offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of [[James Brooke]] in [[Sarawak]] in [[Borneo]].

==Plot introduction==
The novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including [[diary]] entries, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, and straight [[Literary technique|narrative]] to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what "really" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.

==Plot summary==
In 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of [[Borneo]], commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the [[Sultan of Brunei]] for having safely returned the crew of a British [[cargo ship|merchantman]], lost on his coast. It was a region full of [[headhunting|headhunter]]s, [[pirate]] tribes, and [[slave trade]]rs. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.

Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was [[James Brooke]]; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the ''Royalist''; Gideon Barr's is the ''Carolina'' (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, [[Charles Anthoni Johnson Brooke|Charles Johnson]], who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).

Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an "air of permanence" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on [[Margaret Brooke]], wife of the second Rajah, and her book "My Life in Sarawak". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.

On the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.

Godshalk uses [[Malay language|Malay]] words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of ''Kalimantaan'' will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:

'''Lenin was a mushroom''' ({{lang-ru|Ленин — гриб}}) was a highly influential televised [[hoax]] by [[Soviet]] musician [[Sergey Kuryokhin]] and reporter [[Sergey Leonidovich Sholokhov|Sergey Sholokhov]]. It was first broadcast on 17 May 1991 on [[Petersburg – Channel 5|Leningrad Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Alexei |last=Yurchak |authorlink=Alexei Yurchak |date=Summer 2011 |title=A Parasite from Outer Space: How Sergei Kurekhin Proved That Lenin Was a Mushroom |journal=Slavic Review |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=307 |doi=10.5612/slavicreview.70.2.0307 |issn=0037-6779 |jstor=10.5612/slavicreview.70.2.0307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum-msk.org/material/politic/5261278.html|title=Десакрализация образа власти|website=МСК|accessdate=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hoax took the form of an interview on the television program ''Pyatoe Koleso'' (The Fifth Wheel). In the interview, Kuryokhin, impersonating a historian, narrated his findings that [[Vladimir Lenin]] consumed large quantities of [[psychedelic mushrooms]] and eventually became a mushroom himself. Kuryokhin arrived at his conclusion through a long series of logical fallacies and appeals to the authority of various "sources" (such as [[Carlos Castaneda]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]), creating the illusion of a reasoned and plausible logical chain.

The timing of the hoax played a large role in its success, coming as it did during the [[Glasnost]] period when the ebbing of [[censorship]] in the [[Soviet Union]] led to many revelations about the country's history, often presented in sensational form.&lt;ref name=Atlas&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Grundhauser |url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/lenin-mushroom-hoax-russia? |title=How Vladimir Lenin Became a Mushroom |website=[[Atlas Obscura]] |date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Soviet television had, up to that point, been regarded by its audience as conservative in style and content. As a result, a large number of Soviet citizens (one estimate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.topos.ru/article/2139|title=Диалоги с Сергеем Жариковым на исходе лета|author=Иоффе Д.|date=2004-03-12|publisher=Topos|accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; puts the number at 11,250,000 audience members) took the deadpan "interview" at face value, in spite of the absurd claims presented.

Sholokhov has said that perhaps the most notable result of the show was an appeal by a group of party members to the Leningrad Regional Committee of the [[CPSU]] to clarify the veracity of Kuryokhin's claim. According to Sholokhov, in response to the request one of the top regional functionaries stated that "Lenin could not have been a mushroom" because "a mammal cannot be a plant."&lt;ref name=Atlas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mishenin|first=Dmitry |title=Тихий Шолохов |trans-title=Quiet flows the Sholokhov |type=Interview of S. Sholokhov with ''Krestyanka'' magazine|url=http://www.krestyanka.ru/archive/year2008/dec/dec_349.html|date=December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214123744/http://krestyanka.ru/archive/year2008/dec/dec_349.html|archive-date=14 December 2008 |language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] classifies mushrooms as [[Fungus|fungi]], a separate [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] from [[plant]]s.

The incident has served as a watershed moment in Soviet (and Russian) culture and has often been used as proof of the gullibility of the masses.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Margaret de Jesús''' (born November 4, 1957 in [[Brooklyn, New York]]) is a retired female [[track and field]] athlete from [[Puerto Rico]], who competed in the women's [[400 metres]] during her career. She set her personal best (54.23 s) in the event in 1987. Her sole global competition appearance came at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] where she competed as part of the Puerto Rican women's [[4x400 metres relay]] team. The team did not make the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Margaret de JesÃºs Bio, Stats, and Results |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/margaret-de-jesus-1.html |website=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com |accessdate=9 August 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her [[twin sister]] [[Madeline de Jesús]] also competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics, and won a number of international medals during her career as a [[long jump]]er. Both were born in  [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and raised in [[Río Piedras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Salón de la Fama del Deporte Riopedrense/Exaltados 2005/Margaret De Jesús |url=http://www.famadeportesrp.org/exaltados/perfiles/2005/margaret.html |website=www.famadeportesrp.org |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olympic controversy==

After Puerto Rico’s Madeline de Jesus came up lame while competing in the long jump, she was unable to run in the 4×400-meter relay at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. Madeline enlisted her identical twin sister, Margaret, as an imposter for a qualifying heat. Margaret ran the second leg of the qualifier, and the team advanced. When the chief coach of the Puerto Rican team learned of the ruse, however, he pulled his team out of the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garriga |first1=Ray |title=The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee Friday banned two sisters... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/10/05/The-Puerto-Rican-Olympic-Committee-Friday-banned-two-sisters/2825465796800/ |website=UPI |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:McColo-Spammonth.gif|thumb|right|Effect of McColo takedown on spam volumes, from [[SpamCop]].]]
'''McColo''' was a [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-based [[web hosting service|web hosting]] [[Internet service provider|service provider]].&lt;ref name="washpost1112"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111200658.html|title=Host of Internet Spam Groups Is Cut Off|last=Krebs|first=Brian|date=November 12, 2008|work=Washington Post |accessdate=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2008, the company was shut down by two upstream providers, [[Global Crossing]] and [[Hurricane Electric]], because a significant amount of [[malware]] and [[botnet]]s had been trafficking from the McColo servers.&lt;ref name="washpost1112" /&gt;

==History==
McColo was formed by a 19-year-old Russian hacker and student named Nikolai. Nikolai's nickname was "Kolya McColo"; hence the name of the provider.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Jeffrey. ''Inside Cyber Warfare: Mapping the Cyber Underworld''. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2009, {{ISBN|0596802153}}, pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malware traffic==
At the time of termination of its [[Upstream server|upstream]] service on November 11, 2008, it was estimated that McColo customers were responsible for a substantial proportion of all [[email spam]] then flowing&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/12/mccolo_goes_silent/ McColo goes silent], [[The Register]], November 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent reports claim a two-thirds or greater reduction in global spam volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/11/spam_volumes_drop_by_23_after.html Spam Volumes Drop by Two-Thirds After Firm Goes Offline], ''[[Washington Post]]'' "Security Fix" blog, November 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduction had been sustained for some period after the takedown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/spam-back-to-94-of-all-e-mail/ Spam Back to 94% of All E-Mail], ''[[The New York Times]]'' "Bits" Blog, March 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; McColo was one of the leading players in the so-called "[[bulletproof hosting]]" market — ISPs that will allow servers to remain online regardless of complaints.

According to ''[[Ars Technica]]'' and other sources, upstream ISPs Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric terminated service when contacted by [[Brian Krebs]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]''’s ''Security Fix'' blog,&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/11/the_badness_that_was_mccolo.html A Closer Look at McColo], [[Washington Post]] ''Security Fix'' blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081112-spam-sees-big-nosedive-as-rogue-isp-mccolo-knocked-offline.html Spam sees big nosedive as rogue ISP McColo knocked offline], [[Ars Technica]], November 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but multiple reports had been published by organisations including [[SecureWorks]], [[FireEye, Inc.|FireEye]] and [[ThreatExpert]], all naming McColo as the host for much of the world's botnet traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Joe|title=The Return of Warezov|url=https://www.secureworks.com/research/warezov|website=SecureWorks|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2008/10/mccolo-hosting-srizbi-cc.html#more FireEye] threat analysis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.threatexpert.com/report.aspx?uid=745bcad4-9f9d-4a32-ba95-7cb7d5fc14f8 ThreatExpert] threat analysis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.secureworks.com/research/warezov] threat analysis&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Joe Stewart, director of malware research for SecureWorks, the [[Mega-D botnet|Mega-D]], [[Srizbi botnet|Srizbi]], [[Pushdo]], [[Rustock]] and [[Warezov]] botnets  all hosted their master servers at McColo; numerous complaints had been made but McColo simply moved offending servers and sites to different subnets.  [[Spamhaus.org]] reportedly finds roughly 1.5&amp;nbsp;million computers infected with either Srizbi or Rustock sending spam in an average week.

Following the shut down, details began to emerge of the ISP's other clients, which included distributors and vendors of child pornography and other criminal enterprises, including the [[Russian Business Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/12/AR2008111200658.html Washington Post], November 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The McColo takedown especially affected [[Srizbi botnet|Srizbi]], the world's largest botnet, with around 500,000 infected nodes as of November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/11/26/srizbi_returns_from_dead/ Srizbi returns from the dead], [[The Register]], November 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The botnet is reported to be capable of sending around 60&amp;nbsp;billion spam messages a day, which is more than half of the global total of 100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csoonline.com/article/356219/Srizbi_Grows_Into_World_s_Largest_Botnet Srizbi grows into world's largest botnet], CSO Online, May 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symantec|Symantec's]] monthly state of spam report for April 2009 stated that spamming was now back to what it was before McColo was taken offline. Due to botnets being created and old ones being brought back online, it estimated that about 85 percent of all email traffic is spam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/spammers-recovering-from-mccolo-shutdown-591118 Spammers recovering from McColo shutdown]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/other_resources/b-state_of_spam_report_04-2009.en-us.pdf State Of Spam for April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Musha Incident''' ({{CJKV|c=霧社事件|j=霧社事件|r=Musha Jiken|w=Wu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-she&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Shih&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-chien&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|p=Wùshè Shìjiàn}}; {{zh|poj=Bū-siā Sū-kiāⁿ}}), also known as the '''Wushe Rebellion''' and several other similar names, began in October 1930 and was the last major [[Rebellion|uprising]] against colonial [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces in [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese Taiwan]]. In response to long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, the [[Seediq people|Seediq]] indigenous group in Musha (Wushe) attacked the village, killing over 130 Japanese. In response, the Japanese led a relentless counter-attack, killing over 600 Seediq in retaliation. The handling of the incident by the Japanese authorities was strongly criticised, leading to many changes in aboriginal policy.

==Background==
Previous armed resistance to Japanese imperial authority had been dealt with sternly, as evident in responses to previous uprisings such as the [[Tapani Incident]], which resulted in a cycle of rebel attacks and strict Japanese retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Denny |year=2003|title=Taiwan: A Political History |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn=9780801488054 |page= 35|ref=harv |chapter=The Japanese Occupation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the 1930s, armed resistance had largely been replaced by organised political and social movements among the younger Taiwanese generation. Direct police involvement in local administration had been relaxed, many stern punishments were abolished, and some elements of self-government, albeit of questionable effectiveness, had been introduced to colonial Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harry J.|last=Lamley|chapter=Taiwan Under Japanese Rule, 1895-1945: The Vicissitudes of Colonialism |year=2007 |title=Taiwan: A New History |editor=Rubinstein, Murry A. |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |place=New York |isbn=9780765614940 |edition=expanded|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a different approach was used in order to control Taiwan's indigenous peoples. Formosa Island aborigines were still designated as {{nihongo||生蕃|seiban|"raw barbarians" or "wild tribespeople"}}, and treated as savages rather than equal subjects. Tribes were 'tamed' through assimilation, the process of disarming traditional hunting tribes and forcing them to relocate to the plains and lead an agrarian existence. Further resistance was then dealt with by military campaigns, isolation and containment.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=49}} In order to access natural resources in mountainous and forested indigenous-controlled areas, Governor-General [[Sakuma Samata]] adopted a more aggressive terrain policy, attempting to pacify or eradicate aboriginal groups in areas scheduled for logging within five years; by 1915, this policy had been largely successful, although resistance still existed in more remote areas.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}}

===Proximal causes===
The Seediq aborigines in the vicinity of Musha had been considered by Japanese authorities to be one of the most successful examples of this "taming" approach, with [[Tribal chief|Chief]] [[Mouna Rudao]] being one of 43 indigenous leaders selected for a tour of Japan a few years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Chien-Chao|last1=Hung|title=A history of Taiwan|date=2000|publisher=Il Cerchio|location=Rimini|isbn=9788886583800|page=222|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, resentment still lingered, due largely to police misconduct, the continuing practice of forced labor, and the ill treatment of indigenous beliefs and customs.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}}

In the days immediately prior to the incident, chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected.&lt;ref name=TakaoClub&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wushe Incident|publisher=The Takao Club|url=http://www.takaoclub.com/monaludao/wusheincident.htm|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.

==Incident==
[[File:Commander and Staff of Musha Punitive force.JPG|thumb|200px|Commander and staff of the Musha Punitive force.]]

On 27 October 1930, hundreds of Japanese converged on Musha for an athletics meet at the Musyaji Elementary School. Shortly before dawn, Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in a raid of strategic police sub-stations to capture weapons and ammunition. They then moved on the elementary school, concentrating their attack on the Japanese in attendance. A total of 134 Japanese, including women and children, were killed in the attack. Two [[Han Taiwanese]] dressed in Japanese clothing were also mistakenly killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 Mar 2014 |title=Wushe Incident |website=Encyclopedia of Taiwan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325180546/http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3722 |archivedate=25 March 2014 |url=http://taiwanpedia.culture.tw/en/content?ID=3722 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of whom was a girl wearing a Japanese kimono.{{sfnp|Hung|2000|p=222}} The Aboriginals aimed to only kill Japanese specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heé|first1=Nadin|title=Taiwan under Japanese Rule.

==Consequences==
The Japanese authorities responded with unprecedentedly harsh military action. A press blackout was enforced, and [[Governor-General of Taiwan|Governor General]] Eizo Ishizuka ordered a counter-offensive of two thousand troops to be sent to Musha, forcing the Seediq to retreat into the mountains and carry out guerrilla attacks by night. Unable to root out the Seediq despite their superior numbers and firepower, the Japanese faced a political need for a faster solution. Consequently, Japan's army air corps in Taiwan ordered bombing runs over Musha to smoke out the rebels, dropping [[mustard gas]] bombs in violation of the [[Geneva Protocol]] in what was allegedly the first such use of chemical warfare in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Croddy, "China's Role in the Chemical and Biological Disarmament Regimes", The Nonproliferation Review Spring 2002: 16, &lt;http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/91crod.pdf&gt;, accessed 24 September 2011, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TakaoClub /&gt; The uprising was swiftly quelled, with any remaining resistance suppressed by the third week of December 1930;&lt;ref name=TakaoClub /&gt; Mona Rudao had committed suicide on November 28, but the uprising had continued under other leaders.{{sfnp|Hung|2000|p=223}} Of the 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, 290 of whom committed suicide to avoid dishonor.

Due to internal and external criticism of their handling of the incident, Governor-General Kamiyama and Goto Fumio, his chief civil administrator, were forced to resign in January 1931. However, Kamiyama's replacement, Ota Masahiro, also took a harsh approach to controlling Taiwan's indigenous peoples: certain tribes were disarmed and left unprotected, giving their aboriginal enemies an opportunity to annihilate them on behalf of the Japanese administration.{{sfnp|Roy|2003|p=51}} Around 500 of the Seediq involved in the Musha Incident surrendered and were subsequently confined to a village near Musha. However, on 25 April 1931, indigenous groups working with the Japanese authorities attacked the village, [[Taiwanese aborigines#Headhunting|beheading]] all remaining males over the age of 15. This came to be known as the "Second Musha Incident".

However, the uprising did affect a change in the authorities' attitudes and approaches towards aborigines in Taiwan. Musha had been regarded as the most "enlightened and compliant" of the aboriginal territories, and the colonial power's inability to prevent the massacre provoked a fear of similar nationalist movements starting in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ching|first1=L.|title=Savage Construction and Civility Making: The Musha Incident and Aboriginal Representations in Colonial Taiwan|journal=positions: east asia cultures critique|date=1 December 2000|volume=8|issue=3|page=799|doi=10.1215/10679847-8-3-795|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A change in policy was clearly needed. Ching suggests that the ideology of imperialisation (''kominka'') became the dominant form of colonial control; aborigines became represented as imperial subjects on equal footing with other ethnic groups in Taiwan, and were upgraded in status from "raw savages"  to {{nihongo4||高砂族|takasagozoku|"tribal peoples of Taiwan"}}. Furthermore, Japanization education was intensified, promoting Japanese culture and loyalty to the emperor in the younger generation.

During the Musha Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted against the Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Musha Incident, since the Japanese had long played them off against each other. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident.

==In the media==
The Musha Incident has been depicted three times in movies, in 1957 in the film ''Qing Shan bi xue'' ({{lang|zh|青山碧血}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Daw-Ming|title=Historical dictionary of Taiwan cinema|date=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9780810879225|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2003 TV drama {{Interlanguage link multi|Dana Sakura|zh|3=風中緋櫻}}, and in the 2011 Taiwanese film ''[[Seediq Bale]]''. 

The Chinese novel ''Remains of Life'' (originally published in Chinese in 1999, published in English translation in 2017) is a fictionalized account of the aftermath of this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Wu He (2017).

[[File:KZ-Hinzert-Plakette-Nacht-und-Nebel.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque for the French victims at [[Hinzert concentration camp]], showing the expressions ''Nacht und Nebel'' and "NN-Deported"]]
'''''Nacht und Nebel''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈnaχt ʊnt ˈneːbəl|}}) was a directive issued by [[Adolf Hitler]] on 7 December 1941 targeting political activists and [[Resistance movement|resistance]] "helpers" in [[World War II]] to be imprisoned or killed, while the family and the population remained uncertain as to the fate or whereabouts of the Nazi state's alleged offender. Victims who disappeared in these "Night and Fog" actions were never heard from again.

==Name==
The alliterative [[hendiadys]] ''Nacht und Nebel'' ([[German language|German]] for "Night and Fog") was first used by Wagner in ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' (1869) and has since been adopted into everyday German (e.g. it appears in [[Thomas Mann|Thomas Mann's]] ''[[Der Zauberberg]]''). It remains unclear whether the term ''Nacht-und-Nebel-Erlass'' ("Night and Fog directive") had been in wide circulation or used publicly before 1945.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Background==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S72707, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinrich Himmler]] issued orders for ''Nacht und Nebel'' in 1941.]]
Even before the [[Holocaust]] gained momentum, the Nazis had begun rounding up [[political prisoner]]s from both Germany and [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]]. Most of the early prisoners were of two sorts: they were either prisoners of personal conviction (belief), political prisoners whom the Nazis deemed in need of "re-education" to Nazi ideals, or [[Resistance movement|resistance]] leaders in occupied western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel (1992). ''Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History'', pp. 82–120, pp. 232–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the time of the ''Nacht und Nebel'' decree, prisoners from Western Europe were handled by German soldiers in approximately the same way as other countries: according to international agreements and procedures such as the [[Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Dülffer (2009). ''Nazi Germany 1933–1945: Faith and Annihilation'', pp. 160–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler and his upper level staff, however, made a critical decision not to conform to what they considered unnecessary rules and in the process abandoned "all chivalry towards the opponent" and removed "every traditional restraint on warfare."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Görlitz, "Keitel, Jodl, and Warlimont," cited in Barnett ed., (2003). ''Hitler's Generals'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 1941, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] issued the following instructions to the [[Gestapo]]: 

{{quote|After lengthy consideration, it is the will of the Führer that the measures taken against those who are guilty of offenses against the Reich or against the occupation forces in occupied areas should be altered. The ''Führer'' is of the opinion that in such cases penal servitude or even a hard labor sentence for life will be regarded as a sign of weakness. An effective and lasting deterrent can be achieved only by the death penalty or by taking measures which will leave the family and the population uncertain as to the fate of the offender. Deportation to Germany serves this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Crankshaw (1956). ''Gestapo: Instrument of Tyranny'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 12 December, [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Armed Forces High Command]] Feldmarschall [[Wilhelm Keitel]] issued a directive which explained Hitler's orders:

{{quote|Efficient and enduring intimidation can only be achieved either by capital punishment or by measures by which the relatives of the criminals do not know the fate of the criminal.}}

[[File:Wilhelm Keitel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Wilhelm Keitel]] expanded the repressive ''Nacht und Nebel'' program to countries under [[military occupation]].]]
Three months later Keitel further expanded on this principle in a February 1942 letter stating that any prisoners not executed within eight days were to be handed over to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nürnberger Dokumente'', PS-1733, NOKW-2579, NG-226. Cited in Bracher (1970). ''The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; and 

{{quote|to be transported to Germany secretly, and further treatment of the offenders will take place here; these measures will have a deterrent effect because - A. The prisoners will vanish without a trace. B. No information may be given as to their whereabouts or their fate.}}

The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission, by denying friends and families of seized persons any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany, and vanished without a trace.  In 1945, the abandoned ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) records were found to include merely names and the initials "NN" (''Nacht und Nebel''); even the sites of graves were unrecorded. The Nazis even coined a new term for those who "vanished" in accordance with this decree; they were ''vernebelt''—"transformed into mist".&lt;ref&gt;Conot (2000). ''Justice at Nuremberg'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, it is not known how many people disappeared as a result of this order.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester (2003). ''The Arms of Krupp, 1587–1968'', p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that the [[Forced disappearance|disappearances]] committed as part of the ''Nacht und Nebel'' program were [[war crime]]s which violated both the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] and [[customary international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yjil.org/docs/pub/35-1-finucane-enforced-disappearance.pdf |title=Enforced Disappearance as a Crime Under International Law: A Neglected Origin in the Laws of War |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140722001023/http://www.yjil.org/docs/pub/35-1-finucane-enforced-disappearance.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Himmler immediately communicated Keitel's directive to various SS stations and within six months the decree was sent to concentration camp commanders by [[Richard Glücks]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (2012). ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?: The "Final Solution" in History'', pp. 337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nacht und Nebel'' prisoners were mostly from [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007465|title=Night and Fog Decree|work=ushmm.org|accessdate=22 January 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/660uWexUX?url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007465|archive-date=2012-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually arrested in the middle of the night and quickly taken to prisons hundreds of miles away for questioning, eventually arriving at concentration camps such as [[Natzweiler]], [[Esterwegen concentration camp|Esterwegen]] or [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]], if they survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Night and Fog Decree| url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/timeline/nacht.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kogon (2006). ''The Theory and Practice of Hell: The German Concentration Camps and the System behind Them'', pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; Natzweiler concentration camp in particular, became an isolation camp for political prisoners from northern and western Europe under the decree's mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Overy (2006). ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 30 April 1944, at least 6,639 persons were captured under the ''Nacht und Nebel'' orders.&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Gruchmann: "Nacht- und Nebel-"Justiz... In: VfZ 29 (1981), S. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 340 of them may have been executed. The 1956 film ''[[Night and Fog (1956 film)|Night and Fog]]'', directed by [[Alain Resnais]], uses the term to illustrate one aspect of the concentration camp system as it was transformed into a system of labour and death camps.

==Text of the decrees==
{{quote|Directives for the prosecution of offences committed within the occupied territories against the German State or the occupying power, of 7 December 1941.

Within the occupied territories, communistic elements and other circles hostile to Germany have increased their efforts against the German State and the occupying powers since the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian campaign]] started. The amount and the danger of these machinations oblige us to take severe measures as a deterrent. First of all the following directives are to be applied:

I. Within the occupied territories, the adequate punishment for offences committed against the German State or the occupying power which endanger their security or a state of readiness is on principle the death penalty.

II. The offences listed in paragraph I as a rule are to be dealt with in the occupied countries only if it is probable that sentence of death will be passed upon the offender, at least the principal offender, and if the trial and the execution can be completed in a very short time. Otherwise the offenders, at least the principal offenders, are to be taken to Germany.

III. Prisoners taken to Germany are subject to military procedure only if particular military interests require this. In case German or foreign authorities inquire about such prisoners, they are to be told that they have been arrested but that the proceedings do not allow any further information.

IV. The Commanders in the occupied territories and the Court authorities within the framework of their jurisdiction, are personally responsible for the observance of this decree.

V. The Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces determines in which occupied territories this decree is to be applied. He is authorized to explain and to issue executive orders and supplements. The Reich Minister of Justice will issue executive orders within his own jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nacht und Nebel decree (English translation)|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/nightfog.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States, Office of United States Chief of Counsel for Prosecution of Axis Criminality, ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression'', 8 vols. and 2 suppl. vols.

==Rationale==
The reasons for ''Nacht und Nebel'' were many. The policy, enforced in [[German-occupied Europe|Nazi-occupied countries]], meant that whenever someone was arrested, the family would learn nothing about the person's fate. The people arrested, sometimes only suspected resisters, were secretly sent to Germany and perhaps to a concentration camp. Whether they lived or died, the Germans would give out no information to the families involved.&lt;ref&gt;Stackelberg (2007). ''The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany'', p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to keep the population in occupied countries quiet by promoting an atmosphere of mystery, fear and terror.&lt;ref&gt;Crankshaw, Edward (1990) [1956]. ''Gestapo: Instrument of Tyranny'', London: Greenhill Books. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaden &amp; Nestler (1993). "Erlass Hitlers über die Verfolgung von Strafteten gegen das Reich, 7 December 1941." ''Dokumente des Verbrechens: Aus den Akten des Dritten Reiches'', vol i, pp. 162–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The program made it far more difficult for other governments or humanitarian organizations to accuse the German government of specific misconduct because it obscured whether or not internment or death had even occurred, let alone the cause of the person's disappearance.  It thereby kept the Nazis from being held accountable. It allowed across-the-board, silent defiance of international treaties and conventions – one cannot apply the requirements for humane treatment in war if one cannot locate a victim or discern that victim's fate. Additionally, the policy lessened German subjects' moral qualms about the Nazi regime, as well as their desire to speak out against it, by keeping the general public ignorant of the regime's malfeasance and by creating extreme pressure for service members to remain silent.&lt;ref&gt;Kammer &amp; Bartsch (1999). "Nacht und Nebel Erlaß," in ''Lexikon Nationalsozialismus: Begriffe, Organisationen und Institutionen'', p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of prisoners==
[[File:US Holocaust Memorial Museum - Boxcar.jpg|thumb|alt=Original artifact. Brown boxcar with light creating shadows from upper right corner.|Replica of a [[Holocaust train]] boxcar used by Nazi Germany to transport [[History of the Jews during World War II|Jews]] and other [[Holocaust victims|victims]] during the Holocaust.]]
The ''Nacht und Nebel'' prisoners' hair was shaved and the women were given a convict costume of a thin cotton dress, wooden sandals and a triangular black headcloth. According to historian Wolfgang Sofsky,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prisoners of the ''Nacht und Nebel'' transports were marked by broad red bands; on their backs and both trouser legs was a cross, with the letters "NN" to its right. From these emblems, it was possible to recognize immediately what class a prisoner belonged to and how he or she was pigeonholed and evaluated by the SS.&lt;ref&gt;Sofsky (1997). ''The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The prisoners were often moved apparently at random from prison to prison such as [[Fresnes Prison]] in Paris, [[Waldheim, Saxony|Waldheim]] near [[Dresden]], [[Leipzig]], [[Potsdam]], [[Lübeck]] and [[Stettin]]. The deportees were sometimes herded 80 at a time with standing room only into slow moving, dirty [[cattle truck]]s with little or no food or water on journeys lasting up to five days to their next unknown destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/01-25-46.asp |title=Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 6 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the camps, the prisoners were forced to stand for hours in freezing and wet conditions at 5:00am every morning, standing strictly to attention, before being sent to work a twelve-hour day with only a twenty-minute break for a scant meal. They were confined in cold and starving conditions; many had dysentery or other illnesses, and the weakest were often beaten to death, shot, guillotined, or hanged, while the others were subjected to torture by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Nichol-Rennell"&gt;Nichol, John and Rennell, Tony (2007). ''Escape from Nazi Europe'', Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the inmates were totally exhausted or if they were too ill or too weak to work, they were then transferred to the [[Revier]] (''Krankenrevier'', sick barrack) or other places for extermination. If a camp did not have a [[gas chamber]] of its own, the so-called [[Muselmann|Muselmänner]], or prisoners who were too sick to work,  were often killed or transferred to other concentration camps for extermination.&lt;ref name="Nichol-Rennell"/&gt;

When the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] liberated [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]], the [[SS]] transported many of its remaining ''Nacht und Nebel'' prisoners to concentration camps deeper in Nazi-controlled territory, such as [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] for women, [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]], [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], [[Schloss Hartheim]], or [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Traveler's Guide"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book|author=Marc Terrance|title=Concentration Camps: Guide to World War II Sites|year=1999|publisher=Universal Publishers|location=|isbn=1-58112-839-8| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNt9IVBVeNQC&amp;pg=PA142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the war, the program caused the mass execution of political prisoners, especially [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military prisoners, who in early 1942 outnumbered the Jews in number of deaths even at [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthäus (2004), "Operation Barbarossa and the Onset of the Holocaust, June – December 1941," in Browning &amp; Matthäus (2004). ''The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939– March 1942'', pp. 259–264.&lt;/ref&gt; As the transports grew and Hitler's troops moved across Europe, that ratio changed dramatically. The ''Nacht und Nebel'' decree was carried out surreptitiously, but it set the background for orders that would follow and established a "new dimension of fear".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Shaw (2002). "Nacht und Nebel," in ''Dictionary of the Third Reich'', p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued, so did the openness of such decrees and orders.

It can be surmised from various writings that in the beginning the German public knew only a little of the plans Hitler had to enforce a "New European Order".{{vague|date=May 2017}} As the years passed, despite the best attempts of [[Goebbels]] and the [[Propagandaministerium|Propaganda Ministry]] with its formidable domestic information control, diaries and periodicals of the time show that information about the harshness and cruelty of the program became progressively known to the German public.&lt;ref&gt;Gellately (2001). ''Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany'', pp. 51–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soldiers brought back information, families on rare occasion heard from or about loved ones, and Allied news sources and the [[BBC]] were able to get past censorship sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson (2006). ''What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder, and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany'', pp. 185–225.&lt;/ref&gt; Although captured archives from the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] contain numerous orders stamped with "NN" (''Nacht und Nebel''), it has never been determined exactly how many people disappeared as a result of the decree.

Hesitant if not outright skeptical at first of reports coming in about the atrocities being committed by the Germans, the Allies' doubts were pushed aside when the French entered the [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] camp (one of the ''Nacht und Nebel'' facilities) on 23 November 1944, and discovered a chamber where victims were hung by their wrists from hooks to accommodate the process of pumping poisonous [[Zyklon-B]] gas into the room.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe (2012). ''Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II'', p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Keitel later testified at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] that of all the illegal orders he had carried out, the ''Nacht und Nebel'' decree was "the worst of all".&lt;ref&gt;Shirer (1990). ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Supreme Court Justice and chief prosecutor at the international Nuremberg trial, [[Robert H. Jackson]] listed the "terrifying" ''Nacht und Nebel'' decree with the other horrid crimes committed by the Nazis in his closing address.&lt;ref&gt;Marrus (1997). ''The Nuremberg War Crimes Trial, 1945–46: A Documentary History'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; In part because of his role in carrying out this decree, Keitel was sentenced to death by [[hanging]], despite his insistence on being shot instead due to his military service and rank.&lt;ref&gt;Conot (2000). ''Justice at Nuremberg'', p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt; At 1:20am on 16 October 1946 Keitel defiantly shouted out, "''[[Deutschland Über Alles|Alles für Deutschland! Deutschland über alles!]]''" just before the [[trap door]] opened beneath his feet.&lt;ref&gt;Conot (2000). ''Justice at Nuremberg'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Bikers Roundup''' is the largest [[camping]] [[motorcycle rally]] in the USA and is organized by a group of  [[African American]] [[motorcycle clubs]]. Its location changes every year&lt;ref&gt;American Motorcyclist Jul 1995&lt;/ref&gt; but every decade it returns to its founding city of [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. More than 1,000 motorcycle clubs attend the event and black women make up close to half of participants.&lt;ref name=Samuels2007&gt;{{Citation |title=Black Bikers: the rides and the history |first=Adrienne P |last=Samuels |magazine= [[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |location= Chicago |date= October 2007 |volume=62 |issue= 12 |pages= 98&amp;ndash;106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First organized in 1977 by Dallas Thibodeaux and  Rozell Nunn, Jnr attracting 49 riders, it has since grown to a five-day event, with up to 30,000 participants, who enjoy camping, exhibition, parades, stunt shows, entertainment and a host of other motorcycle-related experiences including drag racing and a "biggest gut contest".&lt;ref name="ebony"&gt;Black Bikers:the rides and the history. Samuels, Adrienne P. Samuels. Ebony, Volumes 62-63, Johnson Pub. Company Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbrkcmo.com/ Official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The event serves to unite the Black motorcycle community and promote camaraderie. Starting from 1998, each year participants donate food and money to support local food paid programmes. By 2000, donations had reached 16,000 tonnes and $9,000.&lt;ref&gt;A Gathering of Friends. Kresnak, Bill. American Motorcyclist, Dec 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the history of [[racism|racial segregation]] in the USA, the event was largely ignored by the media and motorcycle industry for most of its history but is now supported by manufacturers such as [[Honda]] and [[Harley-Davidson]], which was the first major company to attend,&lt;ref name="ebony" /&gt; and is both family friendly and open to all ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;Road Signs, American Motorcyclist Jul 2001 P. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ned Kelly''''' (sometimes titled ''Ned Kelly: The Electric Music Show'') is an Australian musical with book and lyrics by [[Reg Livermore]] and music by [[Patrick Flynn (composer)|Patrick Flynn]].  It tells the story of Australian bushranger [[Ned Kelly]] with an eclectic score combining rock opera, vaudeville and burlesque. The original Australian production played in Adelaide and Sydney in 1977 and 1978.

==Development and concept album==
Livermore began writing ''Ned Kelly'' in 1972 when touring as a performer with the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in Perth and Adelaide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110872538 |title=Ned Kelly musical. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=18 October 1977 |accessdate=9 July 2015 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livermore and Flynn had previously collaborated on the musical ''[[Lasseter (musical)|Lasseter]]'' which was produced in Sydney in 1971 by the [[Old Tote Theatre Company]] at the Parade Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/5622&lt;/ref&gt;

In the manner of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', a concept album of the musical was made ''prior'' to a stage production.  The concept album, released in mid-1974, featured various members of the Australian cast of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'', including [[Jon English]] as Ned Kelly, Trevor White, [[John Paul Young]] and Livermore. Janice Slater sang the role of Ma Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110782304 |title=A new dimension to Ned Kelly. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=8 June 1974 |accessdate=9 July 2015 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation of the album involved some disharmony between ''Ned Kelly'''s collaborators, with [[Bob Ellis]] brought in by producer [[Clyde Packer]] and Flynn to revise existing lyrics and write lyrics for new songs (he is credited on the album as additional lyrics).

==Productions==

In 1974, it was announced that [[Robert Helpmann]] would direct a production in 1975 to feature Livermore, Jon English and [[Jeannie Lewis]], produced by Packer in partnership with J.C. Williamson's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110780741|title=IN BRIEF Ned Kelly musical.|date=30 May 1974|via=National Library of Australia|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|page=3|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GvpjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pOUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1136%2C1162844|title=Ned Kelly – now he's to be a musical|date=2 June 1974|work=Sydney Morning Herald|last1=Thompson|first1=Grant|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This production did not eventuate.

In mid-1977, the [[Adelaide Festival Centre|Adelaide Festival Centre Trust]] started planning for the first production of ''Ned Kelly'', to open in Adelaide.  Livermore was director and designer, with Keith Bain the choreographer and Michael Carlos musical director.  The cast included Nick Turbin as Ned Kelly, [[Geraldine Turner]] as Ma Kelly, [[Doug Parkinson]] as Joe Byrne and [[Arthur Dignam]] as Superintendent Hare.

''Ned Kelly'' opened 30 December 1977 at the Festival Theatre, [[Adelaide Festival Centre]].  It was produced by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, Eric Dare, the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]] and SAS Channel 10. The musical was capitalised at $250,000 with weekly running costs of $40,000 to $50,000.  The production was visually striking, with design features including a full drop curtain containing over 600 hurricane lamps and Kelly's iconic armour represented by a costume of shiny black plastic with geometric bullet holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heinrichs|first1=Paul|title=Stage reward offered for a new Ned Kelly|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ye9hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hpIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5736%2C2776743|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=The Age|date=10 October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Showscene|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19780112&amp;id=XZ9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1044,2979203&amp;hl=en|accessdate=10 July 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=12 January 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical reception was negative.  The major Adelaide newspaper, the [[Adelaide Advertiser]], in its review referred to the show as "an artistic disaster – a hideous monument to bad taste and theatrical excess".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45656797 |title=Ned Kelly rides again. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=28 December 1977 |accessdate=9 July 2015 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production transferred to [[Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney|Her Majesty's Theatre]] in Sydney on 4 February 1978, where critical reception was substantially more positive. After two months, the production closed in Sydney.  An expected Melbourne season at the [[Palais Theatre]] from early April 1978 did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110880691 |title=Bigger things likely after Kelly role. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=1 December 1977 |accessdate=9 July 2015 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only professional revival has been a production by the New Moon Theatre Company, directed by Terence O'Connell, that toured the Queensland regional cities of [[Cairns]], [[Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and [[Rockhampton]] in January and February 1982.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/work/3648&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pink floyd live 8 london.jpg|thumb|300px|Pink Floyd's reunion, performing at [[Live 8]] in London, July 2005]]

[[Pink Floyd]] were pioneers in the [[Concert|live music]] experience, renowned for their lavish stage shows that combine intense visual experiences with music to create a show in which the performers themselves are almost secondary. Pink Floyd's combination of music and visuals set the standard for [[rock music|rock]] musicians. As well as visuals, Pink Floyd set standards in sound quality with innovative use of sound effects and panning [[quadrophonic]] speaker systems.

==Special effects==
Besides the music, arguably the most important and certainly the most elaborate part to any Pink Floyd live show is the special effects.

{{Quote| 'Yes, we did all sorts of strange things, you know, for live concerts as well, we used to make up tapes for the audience to come in by. We had one half-hour-long tape, which we'd play for the half an hour the audience was coming in just before we started our show, and things like that. Just tapes of bird noises in quad--quadraphonic sound, you know, with birds singing, and pheasants taking off in the distance, and swans taking off from water, a tractor driving down one side of the room, and an airplane going over the top, and all these things carrying on, all just from just different sound effects records, you just stick them in and you--you create a type of mood.' | [[David Gilmour]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Shades of Pink - The Definitive Pink Floyd Profile| work=The Source Radio Show| author=Kendall, Charlie| url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t1483-gilmour-waters-mason-wright-shades.html| year=1984| accessdate=2011-07-26| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AbUYov2v?url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t1483-gilmour-waters-mason-wright-shades.html| archivedate=2012-09-11| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The light show===
Pink Floyd were among the first bands to use a dedicated travelling light show in conjunction with their performances. During the Barrett era, dynamic [[liquid light shows]] were projected onto enormous screens behind the band while they played, and the band also incorporated large numbers of strobe lights, which were controlled manually by an engineer. This had the effect of totally obscuring the band itself, except for their shadows, which Barrett took advantage of: he would hold his arms up during parts where he was not required to play, making his shadow grow, shrink and undulate, adding to the visual spectacle. They developed many of these lighting techniques through their fortuitous early association with light artist Mike Leonard.

When psychedelia fell out of fashion from about 1970 onwards, elevated platforms of the type conventionally used for roof maintenance in high buildings were brought on tour and filled with lighting equipment to be raised and lowered during performances. Following [[Roger Waters]]' departure in 1985, the Pink Floyd light show reached a dazzling pinnacle. [[Marc Brickman]], the group's lighting designer, utilized hundreds of automated [[intelligent lighting]] fixtures and [[laser]]s, which were state-of-the-art at the time. By the 1994 ''[[The Division Bell|Division Bell]]'' tour, the band was using extremely powerful, isotope-splitting copper-vapour lasers. These gold-coloured lasers were worth over $120,000 apiece and previously had only been used in nuclear research and high speed photography.&lt;ref name="Lighting"&gt;[http://industryclick.com/magazine.asp?magazineid=136] {{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/artint/25.htm |title=Welcome to the machine |website=Pink-floyd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large circular projection panel dubbed "Mr Screen" first made an appearance during performances of ''Dark Side of the Moon'' in 1974 and became a staple thereafter. The high quality, extreme wide angle projection required special high-speed, 35mm, 10,000 watt xenon film projectors, with  custom lenses, all designed, built and toured by ''[[Bran Ferren|Associates &amp; Ferren]]''. Specially recorded films and animations were projected onto it, and for 1977 "In the Flesh" and 1980–1981 "The Wall Live" tours, coloured spotlights were fixed around the rim, an effect which reached its zenith with the dancing patterns of multi-coloured lights in the ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' and ''[[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell]]'' tours. In the latter, the screen could be retracted behind the stage when not required, and was tilted horizontally with its peripheral lights focused onto the stage into a single spotlight during the final [[guitar solo]] in "[[Comfortably Numb]]".

Several generations of giant [[disco ball|glitter balls]] began with the ''Dark Side of the Moon'' tour. By the ''Division Bell'' tour, the ball had evolved into a globe 4.9 metres in diameter, which rose from the [[mixing desk|mixing station]] to a height of 21.3 metres before opening into an array of [[petal]]s 7.3 metres wide during the final guitar solo of "Comfortably Numb",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stufish.com/pink-floyd/the-division-bell/reality.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514064633/http://www.stufish.com/pink-floyd/the-division-bell/reality.html |archivedate=2010-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing a 12 [[watt|kilowatt]] Phobeus [[Hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide|HMI]] lamp inside.&lt;ref name="Lighting" /&gt;

===Props and pyrotechnics===
Thanks to stage architect/designer [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]], Pink Floyd's tours became a staple in the industry because of their outstanding special and scenic effects. [[Pyrotechnics]] (such as exploding flashpots, an exploding [[gong]] and [[fireworks]]) and dry ice were used extensively throughout Pink Floyd's career. In 1973's tour to promote ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', a large scale model plane flew over the audience and crashed onto the stage with a spectacular explosion, an effect repeated at the start of ''[[The Wall]]'' and the ''[[The Division Bell Tour|Division Bell]]'' shows. During shows to promote ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'', a similar effect was achieved with a flying bed.

Oversized [[helium]] [[balloon]]s were first introduced during the ''Dark Side of the Moon'' tours, but in 1975, this element began to play a central part of the live show. For the U.S. leg of the 1975 tour, a [[pyramid]] shaped [[dirigible]] was floated above the stage. It proved unstable in windy conditions and blew into the crowd, which tore it into pieces for souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/artint/27.htm |title=Shades of Pink |website=Pink-floyd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trademark [[Pink Floyd pig|giant pig]] was brought in for ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stufish.com/pink-floyd/animals/reality.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422040913/http://www.stufish.com/pink-floyd/animals/reality.html |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; floating over the audience, as well as a grotesque 'Nuclear Family', a refrigerator filled with snakes, a television and a [[Cadillac]]. In some shows, an envelope of [[propane]] gas was put inside the pig, causing it to explode. The inflatables reached their peak in 1980–1981 during ''The Wall'' shows, in which several of the characters from the album were brought to life in the form of fully mobile, giant string [[puppets]] with menacing spotlights for eyes, taking the traditional balloons to a new level. The characters were designed by the notable satirical artist, [[Gerald Scarfe]].&lt;ref name="Schaffner 241"&gt;Schaffner, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

Special effects reached a new and outrageous level during these ''Wall'' shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stufish.com/pink-floyd/the-wall/reality.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515013228/http://www.stufish.com/pink-floyd/the-wall/reality.html |archivedate=2010-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a {{convert|160|ft|m|adj=on}} long, {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} high wall made from 340 white bricks was built between the audience and the band during the first half of the show.&lt;ref name="Schaffner 241" /&gt; The final brick was placed as Roger Waters sang "goodbye" at the end of the song "Goodbye Cruel World". For the second half of the show, the band was largely invisible, except for a hole in the wall that simulated a hotel room where Roger Waters "acted out" the story of Pink, and an appearance by [[David Gilmour]] on top of the wall to perform the climactic guitar solo in "Comfortably Numb". Other parts of the story were told by Gerald Scarfe animations projected onto the wall itself (these animations were later integrated into the film ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall|Pink Floyd: The Wall]]''). At the finale of the concert, the wall was demolished amidst sound effects and a spectacular light show.

==Performance history highlights==
===Barrett era===
The earliest shows for what is considered to be "Pink Floyd" occurred in 1965 and included [[Bob Klose]] as a member of the band, which at the time played mainly [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] covers. Klose left the band after 1965. The remaining four members played very small (generally no more than 50 people), mostly unadvertised shows at the [[Marquee Club]] in London through June 1966. The set list continued to include R&amp;B, but some original [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] was also being introduced.

On 30 September 1966, Pink Floyd were invited to play All Saint's Church Hall to raise money for the nascent [[International Times]] newspaper, and quickly became the "house band". At these shows, the band began its use of visual effects and gradually stopped covering R&amp;B.  Word of these shows quickly spread in the London underground culture and soon the band became very well-attended and developed a cult following. On 23 December 1966, the first of the "[[International Times]]" associated gigs to be held at the [[UFO Club]] was performed.  Mainstream interest about the counter-culture was increasing and a very small portion of their 20 January 1967 show at the UFO Club was broadcast as part of [[Granada TV]]'s documentary entitled ''It's So Far Out, It's Straight Down'', which constitutes the first audial or visual record of the band live.

Pink Floyd were among the 30 bands that played [[The 14 Hour Technicolor Dream|The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream]] benefit gig organised for the "International Times" legal defence fund and held at the [[Alexandra Palace]] in London on the eve of 30 April 1967. Some of the other bands who played were [[The Who]], [[The Move]], [[The Pretty Things]], [[Soft Machine]], [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]] and [[The Creation (band)|The Creation]]. Notables in attendance included musician [[John Lennon]], artist [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]], actor [[Michael Caine]], artist and musician [[Yoko Ono]], actress [[Julie Christie]], musician [[Mick Jagger]] and artist [[David Hockney]]. Although both the [[BBC]] and filmmaker Peter Whitehead filmed portions of the event, there is no known footage of Pink Floyd.

On 12 May 1967, Pink Floyd performed at [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London a concert entitled [[Games for May]]. At this show, they debuted a multi-speaker pan pot system controlled by joystick from the stage that allowed them to move sound to anywhere a speaker had been set up. This precursor to their later [[Azimuth Co-ordinator|"Azimuth Coordinator"]] unfortunately was stolen after the show.

After their debut single, "[[Arnold Layne]]", charted well in the UK, the band was invited to perform on the [[BBC2]] music show ''The Look of the Week'' on 14 May 1967. The setlist for the broadcast consisted of "[[Pow R. Toc H.]]" and "[[Astronomy Domine]]". This was their first British television appearance.

Pink Floyd were invited to appear on the BBC2 music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in July 1967 for three weeks after their second single "[[See Emily Play]]" reached #6 on the UK charts.  By this time [[Syd Barrett]]'s behavior had become somewhat unpredictable. On one occasion, the increasingly difficult Barrett remarked that if [[John Lennon]] did not have to appear on ''Top of the Pops'' neither did he.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Watts |first= M. |date= 27 March 1971 |title= The Madcap Laughs |url= http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/band/interviews/sb/sb71.html |journal= [[Melody Maker]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061021030310/http://www.pinkfloyd-co.com/band/interviews/sb/sb71.html |archivedate= 21 October 2006 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, their management company, [[Blackhill Enterprises]], convinced the band to cancel all of their August shows and go to Spain to recuperate.

Increasingly, throughout the summer and into the fall of 1967, copious drug use (especially [[LSD]]) and pressure by the record company to constantly write new hit songs continued to take a toll on Barrett's mental state. He became unable to make a meaningful contribution to the group on stage, playing his guitar incoherently and sometimes not playing at all. By the time of the band's first tour of the US in early November 1967, his condition was plainly showing. He stared blankly into space on their 4 November ''[[American Bandstand]]'' performance, listlessly strummed and barely managed to mime the vocals to "Apples and Oranges". On 5 November, things got worse: they appeared on ''The [[Pat Boone]] Show'' and Syd sat in stubborn silence, refusing to answer any question put to him. He also refused to mime to "See Emily Play": Waters was forced to mime the track instead (Waters confirmed this on the ''[[VH1's Legends]]: Pink Floyd'' episode). After the 22 December show, the rest of band quietly put out word that they were in need of a guitarist.

Although both [[Jeff Beck]] and Davy O'List were considered, it was [[David Gilmour]], then unobligated, who was brought on to augment Syd as need arose during live shows. For the first four shows of 1968, Pink Floyd was a five-man live act again. When they were on the way to their show at Southampton University on 26 January 1968, they decided not to pick up Syd.

===Transition and experimentation===
''See: [[Pink Floyd World Tour 1968]]''

A typical 1968 [[set list]] would include some of the following:
*"[[Astronomy Domine]]"
*"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]"
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]"
*"[[Pow R. Toc H.]]"
*"[[Let There Be More Light]]"
*"[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|The Massed Gadgets of Hercules]]" (first performed on 23 May 1968, renamed "[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]" )
*"[[Flaming (Pink Floyd song)|Flaming]]"
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene|Keep Smiling People]]" (a prototype version of "[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]")

Although their management company Blackhill Enterprises parted ways with them over their decision about Syd Barrett on 29 June 1968, Pink Floyd headlined the first free [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] concert organized by Blackhill. Others performing were [[T.Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].

{{Quote| 'The one in '68 was wonderful because it was much more a picnic in the park than a mini-Woodstock. A lovely day. It was important for us too because it reminded us of our, uh, roots -- whether spurious or not. They *were* our roots -- not personally, but as an enterprise. We were the house band.' | [[Nick Mason]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The 30 Year Technicolor Dream| first=Phil| last=Sutcliffe| work=Mojo Magazine| url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t1484-gilmour-mason-wright-30-year.html#post23744| date=July 1995| accessdate=2011-07-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711045614/http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t1484-gilmour-mason-wright-30-year.html#post23744| archivedate=2011-07-11| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A second tour of the US during July and August 1968 (see [[A Saucerful of Secrets US Tour]]) was launched to tie into the release of their second album, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]''. Increasingly throughout 1968 and 1969, shows consisted of post-Barrett compositions, with notable exceptions being "[[Astronomy Domine]]" and "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]", both of which were performed into the 1970s.  Their audiences changed during this time as well: while Barrett-era crowds consisted mainly of hippies who would dance in time with the music, they now drew more "intellectual" crowd,  who would sit and remain quiet until the last note of a song was played.&lt;ref name="Povey"&gt;Povey and Russell p. 55-57&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1969, most of their excess earnings were funneled into upgrading their sound equipment rather than maintaining a permanent light show.  If visuals were to be used at all, they had to be provided by the venue or the local promoter.&lt;ref name="Povey" /&gt;

A typical 1969 [[set list]] would include some of the following:

''See: [[The Man And The Journey Tour]]''

*"[[The Man and the Journey|The Man/The Journey]]"
*"[[Astronomy Domine]]"
*"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]"
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]"
*"[[Pow R. Toc H.]]"
*"[[Let There Be More Light]]"
*"[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]"
*"[[Cymbaline]]"
*"[[Green is the Colour]]"
*"[[Main Theme]]" (rarely played)
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]"

The shows at [[Mothers (music venue)|Mothers]], [[Birmingham]] on 27 April 1969 and the College of Commerce, [[Manchester]] on 2 May 1969 were recorded for the live part of the [[Ummagumma]] album.  One source also claims that the show at [[Bromley Technical College]] on 26 April 1969 was also recorded for the album.&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 1969, at [[Royal Festival Hall]], they debuted their new pan pot 360 degree sound system dubbed the "Azimuth Coordinator". This show, named "More Furious Madness from the Massed Gadgets of Auximenes", consisted of two experimental "suites", "The Man" and "The Journey". Most of the songs were either renamed earlier material or under a different name than they would eventually be released.

A UK tour of occurred during May and June 1969 culminating in the show dubbed "The Final Lunacy" at [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 26 June 1969. Considered one of the most experimental concerts by Pink Floyd, it featured a crew member dressed as a gorilla, a cannon that fired, and band members sawing wood on the stage. At the finale of "The Journey" suite the band was joined on stage by the brass section of the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the ladies of the Ealing Central Amateur Choir, and at the very end a huge pink smoke bomb was let off.&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional complete performance of "The Man/The Journey" occurred at the [[Concertgebouw]], [[Amsterdam]] on 17 September and was taped and later broadcast by Dutch radio station Hilversum 3. Portions of the suites were being performed as late as early 1970.

===The "Atom Heart Mother" era===
A typical 1970 [[set list]] would include some of the following:
*"[[Astronomy Domine]]"
*"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]"
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]"
*"[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]"
*"[[Cymbaline]]"
*"[[Green is the Colour]]"
*"[[Main Theme]]" &amp;nbsp;(rarely played, and only in early 1970)
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]"
*"[[Ummagumma|Sysyphus]]" pts. 1-4 &amp;nbsp;(rarely played, and only in early 1970)
*"[[Grantchester Meadows (song)|Grantchester Meadows]]"
*"[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|Embryo]]"
*"[[The Violent Sequence]]" &amp;nbsp;(rarely played, and only in early 1970)
*"[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]"
*"[[Fat Old Sun]]" &amp;nbsp;(beginning in September)
*"[[Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast]]" &amp;nbsp;(only played a few times in December)

Early in 1970, Pink Floyd performed at gigs a piece from their film soundtrack for [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' referred to as "The Violent Sequence".  This was the musical basis for "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]", from their ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' album. Lacking only the lyrics, it is identical to the final song and is the earliest part of the seminal album to have been performed live. The song "[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|Embryo]]" was also a part of the live repertoire around this time, but was never to appear on a studio album, until the compilation album ''[[Works (Pink Floyd album)|Works]]''.

On 18 January 1970 (possibly 17 January 1970), the band began performing a then untitled instrumental piece, which would eventually become the title track to their next album ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''. At this point, it had no orchestra or choir accompaniment. The song officially debuted at the Bath Festival, [[Somerset]] England on 27 June 1970 under the title "[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|The Amazing Pudding]]" (later the name of a [[The Amazing Pudding|Pink Floyd fanzine]]) and for the first time with orchestra and choir accompaniment.

Announced as "[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|The Atom Heart Mother]]" by the British broadcaster [[John Peel]] on his [[BBC Radio 1]] show "Peel's Sunday Concert" on 16 July 1970, a name suggested by him to the band,&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p 83&lt;/ref&gt; it was also announced as "The Atomic Heart Mother" two days later at the [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] free concert.&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Partly because of the difficulties of finding and hiring local orchestras and choirs, the band often played what is referred to as the "small band" version of the song when they performed it live.

On 28 June 1970 Fink Floyd was the end-performance of the [[Kralingen Music Festival]] or "Stamping Ground" in a park near Rotterdam, The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="album"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stamping-Woodstock-European-Celebration-Kralingen/dp/B002ZG3C7K |title=Stamping Ground, 28th of June 1970, Woodstock European Celebration (Kralingen Music Festival): Various artists: Amazon.co.uk: MP3 Downloads |website=Amazon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pink Floyd also appeared at a Free festival In Canterbury on August 31 which was filmed. This was the end leg of the Medicine Ball Caravan tour organised by Warner Brothers, which was later made into a film of the same name. It appears that the Pink Floyd footage was not included in the movie but spectators report that Atom Heart Mother was part of the set that was recorded. The audience must have been one of the smallest to see Pink Floyd at this era, only 1500 were present as the festival was not widely promoted.

In contrast, over 500,000 people witnessed their show at Fête de L'Humanité, Paris on 12 September 1970, their largest crowd ever. Filmed by French TV, the show was never broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental on the album ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'', the song "[[Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast]]" was performed at a few gigs in December 1970. "Breakfast" being made was part of the song. The first part of this lasted around four minutes. The second part of "breakfast" preparation was around a minute followed by a 3-minute tape of British DJ [[Jimmy Young (disc jockey)|Jimmy Young]], whom the band disliked.

For a great recording of some of their material from this period check out the Fillmore West&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concerts.wolfgangsvault.com/ConcertDetail.aspx?id=1143 |title=Concert Vault - Live Concert Recordings Streamed Online |website=Concerts.wolfgangsvault.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; show in San Francisco, California on 29 April 1970 on [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Wolfgang's Vault]]. This show includes material from ''[[Ummagumma]]'' and ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''.

===Early performances of "Echoes"===
A typical 1971 [[set list]] would include some of the following:
*"[[Astronomy Domine]]" &amp;nbsp;(dropped from the setlist in June)
*"&lt;s&gt;[[Interstellar Overdrive]]&lt;/s&gt;" &amp;nbsp;(dropped from the setlist in November 1970)
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]"
*"[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]"
*"[[Cymbaline]]"
*"[[Green Is the Colour]]" &amp;nbsp;(dropped from the setlist in August)
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]"
*"[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|Embryo]]"
*"[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]"
*"[[Fat Old Sun]]"
*"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]"
*"[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]" &amp;nbsp;(beginning in late September / early October)

January 1971 saw the band working on a track in the studio of then unconnected parts whose working title was either "Nothing — Parts 1 to 24"&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; or "Nothing Parts 1–36".&lt;ref name="Fitch p. 93"&gt;Fitch p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; This song made its live debut under the working title "Return of the Son of Nothing" on 22 April 1971 at [[Norwich]], England and like "[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]" before it, it was a work in progress. This was later to be released as "[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]" on the album ''[[Meddle]]''.

Although announced as "Echoes" on 6 August 1971 at [[Hakone]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/faq/faq5.html#9 |title=Echoes FAQ Ver, 4.0 - 5/10 |website=Pink-floyd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the song was still performed with the additional lyrics at later August gigs. The show on 18 September 1971 at [[Montreux]], Switzerland and subsequent shows do not have the additional lyrics. In 1972, during a German tour, Waters sardonically introduced Echoes as "Looking Through the Knotholes in Granny's Wooden Leg" (a [[Goon Show]] reference) on one occasion and "[[The Dam Busters March|The March of the Dam Busters]]" on another. On another occasion, during a live radio broadcast, Waters had instructed the DJ to announce "One of These Days" to the home audience as "A poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation."

After the band's Crystal Palace Garden Party performance (London, 15 May 1971), it was discovered that the sheer volume of the gig caused the nearby pond's entire fauna to die. The band was subsequently pressured to compensate for the ecological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/live-at-pompeii/in-depth-analysis-part-two.html |title=Pink Floyd news :: Brain Damage - In-depth analysis - part TWO |publisher=Brain Damage |date=1971-05-15 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eclipse - A Piece for Assorted Lunatics===
{{Main|Dark Side of the Moon Tour}}
A typical 1972 [[set list]] included:

'''First Set''':
* "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe in the Air]]"
* "[[On the Run (Pink Floyd song)|The Travel Sequence]]"
* "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]"
* "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Home Again]]"
* "[[The Great Gig in the Sky|The Mortality Sequence]]" (aka "Religion")
* "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]"
* "[[Us and Them (song)|The Violent Sequence]]"
* "[[Any Colour You Like|Scat]]"
* "[[Brain Damage (song)|Lunatic]]"
* "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]"

'''Second Set''':
*"[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]"
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]" &amp;nbsp;(or as an encore)
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]" &amp;nbsp;(or as an encore)
*"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]" &amp;nbsp;(or as an encore)
*"[[Atom Heart Mother (suite)|Atom Heart Mother]]" &amp;nbsp;(rarely, last performance on 22 May 1972)
*"[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]" &amp;nbsp;(rarely in second set, usually as an encore)
*"[[Childhood's End (Pink Floyd song)|Childhood's End]]" &amp;nbsp;(rarely, introduced in November 1972)

'''Encore''':&lt;br&gt;
''Rotated one of these three songs:''
*"[[A Saucerful of Secrets (song)|A Saucerful of Secrets]]" &amp;nbsp;(last performance on 23 September 1972)
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]" &amp;nbsp;(or in second set)
*"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]" &amp;nbsp;(or in second set)
''Occasionally, multiple song encores were performed, adding:''
* "Blues"

Playing 98 shows (the most until 1994), 1972 was the last time Pink Floyd varied their set lists each night on a tour until their final one.  Songs played in the second set and encore were swapped constantly, and the band even varied the number of songs played in the encore from the usual one, to two or three.

1972 saw Pink Floyd debut the performance of a not just a song (like on previous tours), but an entire album prior to its release. The original title was ''Eclipse (A Piece for Assorted Lunatics)'', then ''The Dark Side of the Moon - A Piece for Assorted Lunatics'', the name under which it made its press debut in February 1972 at London's Rainbow Theatre. The title changed for the first part of the US tour to ''Eclipse (A Piece for Assorted Lunatics)'' during April and May before reverting to ''Dark Side of the Moon - A Piece for Assorted Lunatics'' in September for the second part of the US tour&lt;ref&gt;Fitch p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; and finally released in 1973 under the title of ''Dark Side of the Moon''.

One of the two shows at The Dome, [[Brighton]], England on 28 June and 29 June was filmed by Peter Clifton for inclusion on his film ''Sounds of the City''. Clips of these appear occasionally on television and the performance of "[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]" is on the various artists video ''Superstars in Concert''.&lt;ref&gt;Povey and Russell p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1972, during the middle of the European leg of their 1972 world tour and again in January 1973, Pink Floyd performed with the [[Roland Petit]] Ballet. The portion of the setlist for which the ballet was choreographed was "[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]", "Careful with That Axe, Eugene", "[[Obscured by Clouds (song)|Obscured by Clouds]]", "[[When You're In]]" and "Echoes".

===Dark Side of the Moon===
[[File:PinkFloyd1973.jpg|thumb|Dark Side of the Moon, Earls Court, 1973]]

An early 1973 [[set list]] (until mid-March) included:

'''First Set''':
*"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]"
*"[[Obscured by Clouds (song)|Obscured by Clouds]]"/"[[When You're In]]" (The two songs incorporated into a longer piece with a jamming guitar &amp; keyboard section in the middle)
*"[[Childhood's End (Pink Floyd song)|Childhood's End]]" (rarely)
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]"
'''Second Set''':&lt;br&gt;
''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' entire album&lt;br&gt;
'''Encore''':
*"[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]"

For remainder of 1973 (except 4 November), the set list included:

'''First Set''':
*"[[Obscured by Clouds (song)|Obscured by Clouds]]"
*"[[When You're In]]"
*"[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]"
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]"
*"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]"
'''Second Set''': &lt;br&gt;
''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' entire album&lt;br&gt;
'''Encore''':
*"[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]"

In 1973, the band moved ''Dark Side of the Moon'' to the second set (where it would reside through 1975), and played the album version of the piece, notably the revamped versions of "On the Run" and "The Great Gig in the Sky."  1973 saw Pink Floyd go on two relatively short tours of the US, one in March to coincide with the release of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' and a later one in June. Sandwiched between them were two nights at London's [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]] on 18 May and 19 May where they debuted the special effect of a plane crashing into the stage at the end of the song "On the Run".&lt;ref name="Fitch p. 227"&gt;Fitch p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;  This was also the first year that the band took additional musicians on tour with them, unlike the earlier performances of "Atom Heart Mother" where the band would often hire local musicians.

Because of the overwhelming chart success of both ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', which reached #1 in the US in late April, #2 in the UK, and the US-released single "Money", the nature of Pink Floyd's audiences changed in June 1973. [[David Gilmour]] said of the change "It was 'Money' that made the difference rather than 'The Dark Side of the Moon'.  It gave us a much larger following, for which we should be thankful. ... People at the front shouting, 'Play Money! Gimme something I can shake my ass to!' We had to get used to it, but previously we'd been playing to 10,000 seaters where, in the quiet passages, you could hear a pin drop."&lt;ref&gt;Mojo Magazine, March 1998, p 78&lt;/ref&gt;  They could now sell out stadiums.

On 4 November 1973, Pink Floyd played two shows at London's Rainbow Theatre to benefit musician [[Robert Wyatt]] formerly the drummer of [[Soft Machine]], a band they'd played with in their [[UFO Club]] days. Wyatt fell from a fourth floor window in June 1973, breaking his back and making him a [[paraplegic]].  The set list for these two shows were:

'''Main Set''':&lt;br&gt;
''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' entire album&lt;br&gt;
'''Encore:'''
*"[[Obscured by Clouds (song)|Obscured by Clouds]]"
*"[[When You're In]]"

===1974 Tours===
{{Main|Pink Floyd 1974 tours}}

A French Summer Tour [[set list]] would include all of the following:
*"[[Sheep (song)|Raving and Drooling]]"
*"[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]"
*"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]"
*''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (Entire album)
Encore (one of the following):
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]"
*"[[One of These Days (instrumental)|One of These Days]]"

A British Summer Tour set list included all of the following:
*"Shine On You Crazy Diamond"
*"Raving and Drooling"
*"[[Dogs (Pink Floyd song)|You've Got to be Crazy]]"
*''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (Entire album)
Encore:
*"Echoes"

These early versions of "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", "Raving and Drooling" &amp; "You've Got to be Crazy" were released as part of the [[Why Pink Floyd...?|Wish You Were Here Experience and Immersion sets]].

===1975 North America Tour &amp; Knebworth '75===
{{Main|Wish You Were Here Tour}}

A typical 1975 set would include all of the following:

*"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)"
*"Have a Cigar"
*"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)"
*"Raving and Drooling"
*"You've Got to be Crazy"
*''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (entire album)
Encore:
*"Echoes"

In 1975, the band launched a short tour that ended two months prior to the release of ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'', which eventually sold out stadiums and arenas across America.

The last gig of the tour was as the headliner of 1975 [[Knebworth Festival]], which also featured The [[Steve Miller Band]], [[Captain Beefheart]] and [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] (who joined Pink Floyd on the stage to sing "Have a Cigar"). It was the second Knebworth Festival, which featured artists such as [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Frank Zappa]] between 1974 and 1979.

Despite some technical problems, the band managed to perform a remarkable concert{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}, which as well as the usual special effects featured a fly-past by a pair of [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s. This was supposed to synchronise with the start of 'Breathe' but the band had tuning difficulties and the planes flew over before the start of the set. Knebworth was the last time the band would perform "Echoes" and the entire ''Dark Side of the Moon'' with Roger Waters.

===In the Flesh===
{{Main|In the Flesh (Pink Floyd tour)}}

A typical 1977 [[set list]] would include the following:
*''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'' (entire album)
*''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (entire album)
Encore:
*"[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]"
*"[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]"
*"[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]" (performed once in [[Oakland, California]])
*"[[More Blues]]" (performed once in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada)

In 1977, Pink Floyd embarked on a world tour in support of the "Animals" album. Although the album had not sold as well as their two previous releases, "Dark Side Of The Moon" and "Wish You Were Here", the band's popularity was at an all-time high. The band managed to sell out arenas and stadiums in both Europe and America, setting attendance records all along the way. In Chicago, the band played to an estimated audience of 95,000; in [[Cleveland]] and [[Montreal]], they set attendance records for those venues by playing to over 80,000 people. The "In The Flesh" tour would later become widely known as their most memorable series of concert performances, and the last in which Roger Waters would accompany the band. The elaborate stage presentations, particularly those constructed for the outdoor venues, were their most complex and elaborate to date. Designed by [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]] and Andrew Sanders, they featured a pyrotechnic "waterfall", umbrella-like canopies that could be deployed to protect the band from the elements, and a variety of characters associated with the "Animals" album; including "Algie", a 40-foot long inflatable pig that drifted out over the audience, the "Average American family" (which, at the time, included Mom, Dad and 2.5 children), and paper sheep that parachuted down on the crowds after being shot from cannons mounted to the sides of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner, p. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; The musicians that accompanied the band on the tour included veteran saxophone player Dick Parry (occasionally playing keyboards as well) and guitarist Snowy White, who also filled in on bass guitar for some songs.

In the first half of each show, the band played all of the songs from ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]'', but in a slightly different sequence than the album (typically starting with "Sheep", then "Pigs On the Wing (Part 1)", "Dogs", "Pigs On the Wing (Part 2) and "Pigs (Three Different Ones)").  The second half of the shows consisted of ''Wish You Were Here'' being played in its exact running order ("Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5)", "Welcome to the Machine", "Have a Cigar", "Wish You Were Here" and "Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 6-9)"). The encores would usually consist of either "Money" or "Us and Them" from ''Dark Side of the Moon'' or both. At the [[Oakland]], [[California]] show on May 9, they played "[[Careful with That Axe, Eugene]]" as a third encore, the last time the song was ever performed live.

The tour started in [[Dortmund]], [[West Germany]] on January 23 and proceeded through Europe, ending in [[Stafford]], [[England]] on March 31. Three weeks later, the North American leg of the tour opened in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] on April 22, concluding in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] on July 6. The show in [[Oakland]], [[California]] on May 9 is widely regarded as one of the band's finest performances ever. During "Have a Cigar," Waters and Gilmour can be heard laughing as they sing part of the opening line. In the run-up to the band's four-night run at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] (July 1–4), tour promoters used an aggressive marketing strategy, filling pages of [[The New York Times]] and [[Billboard magazine]] with ads. In May, there was a Pink Floyd parade on 6th Avenue featuring both inflatable and live animals.&lt;ref name="Schaffner 218"&gt;Schaffner, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Another memorable performance occurred in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] on June 25. The show was held at [[Cleveland Stadium|Cleveland Municipal Stadium]], just a short distance from [[Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport|Burke Lakefront Airport]]. Most of the shows opened with a recording of jet airplane taking off, but promoters secretly arranged for the band's [[Boeing 737]] jet to do a low flyover directly over the stadium as the show opened. The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] later fined the promoters $1,500 over the incident. The show was also delayed briefly by a fan that grabbed the tether line for the inflatable pig and wouldn't release it. At their performance in Boston two nights later, Waters jokingly said "We're going to take a PIG break, back in 20 minutes". He closed the show by gratefully commenting that this had been "the perfect end to the perfect day, good night and God bless".&lt;ref name="Schaffner 218"/&gt;

As the tour began, everyone was in good spirits, but the later shows were marred by Roger Waters' increasing annoyance with the raucous fans in attendance. During the last show in Montreal, a noisy fan near the stage irritated Waters to such an extent that he spat on him. The act so disgusted David Gilmour that he left the stage prior to the final encore, ""[[More Blues]]"", leaving Snowy White to fill in as the roadies began dismantling the stage equipment. The insatiable audience clamored for the band to keep playing, and a small riot broke out in front of the stage following the band's eventual exit. Later that night, Waters recounted the incident to his friend, music producer [[Bob Ezrin]], and expressed his growing feelings of alienation toward their fans. Those feeling of detachment became the starting and focal point for Pink Floyd's next album, ''The Wall''.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner, p. 218-219&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wall live===
{{Main|The Wall Tour (1980–81)}}
The 1980/1981 set lists comprised the entire album, ''[[The Wall]]''.

Pink Floyd mounted its most elaborate stage show in conjunction with the tour of ''The Wall''. A band of session musicians played the first song, wearing rubber face masks taken from the real band members, then backed up the band for the remainder of the show. Most notable was the giant wall constructed between band and audience.

The costs of the tour were estimated to have reached US$1.5 million even before the first performance. The New York Times stated in its 2 March 1980 edition that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 'Wall' show remains a milestone in rock history though and there's no point in denying it. Never again will one be able to accept the technical clumsiness, distorted sound and meagre visuals of most arena rock concerts as inevitable" and concluded that "the 'Wall' show will be the touchstone against which all future rock spectacles must be measured.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The show was designed by [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]] with Art Direction by [[Gerald Scarfe]].

''The Wall'' concert was only performed a handful of times each in four cities: Los Angeles, Uniondale (Long Island), Dortmund, and London (at Earl's Court). The primary 'tour' occurred in 1980, but the band performed eight shows at Dortmund (14–20 February 1981) and five more shows at Earl's Court (13–17 June) for filming, with the intention of integrating the shows into the upcoming [[Pink Floyd – The Wall|movie]]. The resulting footage was deemed substandard and scrapped; years later, Roger Waters has given conflicted answers on the status of the concert films stating from "trying to locate this footage for historical purposes but was unsuccessful and considers it to be lost forever" to "I have all of the film but am reluctant to release". There are several unofficial videos of the entire live show in circulation and some footage is shown on the ''Behind the Wall'' documentary.

Gilmour and Mason attempted to convince Waters to expand the show for a more lucrative, large-scale stadium tour, but because of the nature of the material (one of the primary themes is the distance between an artist and his audience) Waters balked at this. In fact, Waters had reportedly been offered a guaranteed US$1 million for each additional stadium concert, but declined the offer, insisting that such a tour would be hypocritical.

These shows are documented on the album ''[[Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81]]''.

Waters recreated [[The Wall Concert in Berlin|the ''Wall'' show in Berlin]] in 1990, alongside the ruins of the [[Berlin Wall]], and was joined by a number of guest artists (including [[Bryan Adams]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Van Morrison]], [[The Band]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Ute Lemper]] and [[Thomas Dolby]]). This concert was even bigger than the previous ones, as Waters built a {{convert|550|ft|m|adj=on}} long and {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=on}} high wall.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffner, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the theatrical features of ''The Wall'' were increased to cater for a sold-out audience of 200,000 people and of another estimated 500 million, in 35 countries, watching on television. After the concert began, the gates were opened and an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people were able to watch the concert. This show is available on ''[[The Wall Live in Berlin]]'' album and DVD.

Roger staged [[The Wall Live (2010–2011 tour)|another tour]] of ''The Wall''  in 2010 saying of the story "it has occurred to me that maybe the story of my fear and loss with its concomitant inevitable residue of ridicule, shame and punishment, provides an allegory for broader concerns.: Nationalism, racism, sexism, religion, Whatever!  All these issues and ‘isms are driven by the same fears that drove my young life."

===A Momentary Lapse of Reason===
{{Main|A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour}}

After the release of ''[[A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' in 1987, Pink Floyd embarked on an 11-week tour to promote the album. The two remaining members of the band, David Gilmour and Nick Mason, along with Richard Wright, had just won a legal battle against Roger Waters and the future of the group was uncertain. Having the success of ''The Wall'' shows to live up to, the concerts' special effects were more impressive than ever. The initial "promotional tour" was extended, and finally lasted almost two years, ending in 1989 after playing around 200 concerts to about 5.5 million people in total, including 3 dates at [[Madison Square Garden]] (5–7 October 1987) and 2 nights at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] (5–6 August 1988). The tour took Pink Floyd to various exotic locations they had never played before such as shows in the forecourt of [[the Palace of Versailles]], Moscow's [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow arena)|Olympic Stadium]], and [[Venice]], despite fears and protests that the sound would damage the latter city's foundations.

These shows are documented by the ''[[Delicate Sound of Thunder]]'' album and [[Delicate Sound of Thunder (film)|video]].

Pink Floyd was the second highest grossing act of 1987 and the highest grossing of 1988 in the U.S. Financially, Pink Floyd was the biggest act of these two years combined, grossing almost US$60 million from touring, about the same as U2 and Michael Jackson, their closest rivals, combined. Worldwide, the band grossed around US$135 million.

The tour marked the first time that the band played in Russia, Norway, Spain, New Zealand and was the first time they had played in Australia since 1973.

A further concert was held at the [[Knebworth Festival]] in 1990, a charity event that also featured other Silver Clef Award winners. Pink Floyd was the last act to play, to an audience of 125,000. During this gig [[Clare Torry]] sang backing vocals making it the second and last time she did so. [[Vicki Brown (singer)|Vicki]] and [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]] also attended as backing vocalists, as well as [[Candy Dulfer]] with saxophone solo. The £60,000 firework display that ended the concert was entirely financed by the band.

===The Division Bell===
{{Main|The Division Bell Tour}}

The Division Bell Tour in 1994 was promoted by Canadian concert impresario [[Michael Cohl]] and became the highest-grossing tour in rock music history to that date, with the band playing the entirety of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' in some shows, for the first time since 1975.

The concerts featured more elaborate special effects than the previous tour, including two custom designed airships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volaarchive.pinkfloydtrader.com/belle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720004341/http://www.volaarchive.pinkfloydtrader.com/belle.html |archivedate=2008-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arch-shaped stage was designed by Marc Brickman and [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]] with lighting by Marc Brickman.  Three stages leapfrogged around North America and Europe, each {{convert|180|ft|m}} long and featuring a {{convert|130|ft|m|adj=on}} arch modelled on the [[Hollywood Bowl]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} All in all, the tour required 700 tons of steel carried by 53 articulated trucks, a crew of 161 people and an initial investment of US$4 million plus US$25 million of running costs just to stage. This tour played to 5.5 million people in 68 cities; each concert gathered an average 45,000 audience. At the end of the year, the Division Bell Tour was announced as the biggest tour ever, with worldwide gross of over £150 million (about US$250 million). In the U.S. alone, it grossed US$103.5 million from 59 concerts. However, this record was short-lived; less than a year later, [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (like the Division Bell Tour, also sponsored in part by [[Volkswagen]]) finished with a worldwide gross of over US$300 million. The Stones and U2 (with their [[Vertigo Tour]]) remain the only acts ever to achieve a higher worldwide gross from a tour, even when adjusting for inflation.

These shows are documented by the Pulse ''[[Pulse (Pink Floyd album)|album]]'' and ''[[Pulse (1995 film)|DVD]]''.

===Post-''[[Pulse (Pink Floyd album)|Pulse]]'' era===

==== 1996: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame performance ====
In 1996, Gilmour and Wright performed "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]" with [[Billy Corgan]] (of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] fame) at their [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction.

==== 2001: David Gilmour &amp; Nick Mason statements about Pink Floyd touring again in the future ====
In an interview with [[BBC Radio 2]] in October, 2001, Gilmour implied that the ''[[Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd]]''  compilation (released in November 2001) "probably" signaled the end of the band. "You never know exactly what the future (holds)", Gilmour said. "I'm not going to slam any doors too firmly, but I don't see myself doing any more of that, and I certainly don't see myself going out on a big Floyd tour again." A few days later in an interview with [[Launch.com]], Nick Mason contradicted the statement, saying "I don't feel I've retired yet. You know, if everyone wanted to, we could certainly still do something. I've spent 30 years waiting for the planets to align. I'm quite used to it."

==== 2002: ''David Gilmour in Concert'' DVD release ====
David Gilmour released a solo concert DVD called ''[[David Gilmour in Concert]]'' in November 2002 which was compiled from shows on 22 June 2001 and 17 January 2002 at The Royal Festival Hall in London. Richard Wright, Robert Wyatt, and [[Bob Geldof]] (Pink in ''The Wall'' film) make guest appearances.

==== 2003: Steve O'Rourke's funeral performance ====
Longtime manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed "Fat Old Sun" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" at his funeral at [[Chichester Cathedral]], contrary to reports in the media claiming they played "Wish You Were Here".

==== 2005: Live 8 performance ====
On 2 July 2005 Pink Floyd performed at the [[Live 8 concert, London|London Live 8 concert]] with Roger Waters rejoining David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright. It was the quartet's first performance together in over 24 years — the band's last show with Waters was at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] in London on 17 June 1981.

Gilmour announced the Live 8 reunion on 12 June 2005:
:{{cquote|Like most people I want to do everything I can to persuade the [[G8]] leaders to make huge commitments to the relief of poverty and increased aid to the third world. It's crazy that America gives such a paltry percentage of its [[Gross national product|GNP]] to the starving nations. Any squabbles Roger and the band have had in the past are so petty in this context, and if re-forming for this concert will help focus attention then it's got to be worthwhile.}}

The band's set consisted of "[[Speak to Me]]/[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]/[[Breathe (Reprise)]]", "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]", and "[[Comfortably Numb]]". As on the original recordings, Gilmour sang the lead vocals on "Breathe" and "Money", and shared them with Waters on "Comfortably Numb".  For "Wish You Were Here", Waters sung half of the verse's lyrics, unlike the original recording. When Waters was not singing, he was often enthusiastically mouthing the lyrics off-microphone. During the guitar introduction of "Wish You Were Here", Waters said:

:{{cquote|It's actually quite emotional standing up here with these three guys after all these years. Standing to be counted with the rest of you. Anyway, we're doing this for everyone who's not here, but particularly, of course, for [[Syd Barrett|Syd]].}}

They were augmented by guitarist/bassist [[Tim Renwick]] (guitarist on Roger Waters' 1984 solo tour, who has since become Pink Floyd's backing guitarist on stage); keyboardist/lap steel guitarist/backup vocalist [[Jon Carin]] (Pink Floyd's backing keyboardist from 1987 onward who performed on the 1999–2000 North American leg of Waters' "In the Flesh" tour, his 2006–2008 "Dark Side of the Moon Live" tour, his 2010–2011 "The Wall" tour and [[David Gilmour]]'s 2006 [[On an Island]] tour); saxophonist [[Dick Parry]] during "Money" (who played on the original recordings of "Money", "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]", and "Shine on You Crazy Diamond"); and backing singer [[Carol Kenyon]] during "Comfortably Numb". During "Breathe", on the screen behind them, film of the iconic [[Pink Floyd pig|pig]] from the ''Animals'' album was shown flying over [[Battersea Power Station]] (itself visible on the horizon in television broadcasts of the performance), and during "Money", a shot of ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' record being played was shown. During "Comfortably Numb", the three giant screens showed the Pink Floyd Wall (from the cover of ''[[The Wall]]''), and during the final guitar solo, the words "[[Make Poverty History]]" were written on the wall.

At the end, after the last song had been played, Gilmour said "thank you very much, good night" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous pictures of Live 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6iOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 |title=Johnny Cigarini: Confessions of a King's Road Cowboy: Memoirs of a terrible ... |author=John Cigarini |page=170 |website=Books.google.com |date=2014-11-28 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they proceeded to walk off, Nick Mason threw his drumsticks into the audience. With Wright's subsequent death, in September 2008, this was to be the final concert to feature all four bandmates playing together.

==== 2007: Syd Barrett tribute concert ====
On 10 May 2007 the sans-Waters Pink Floyd (presented as Rick Wright, David Gilmour and Nick Mason) took part in a Syd Barrett tribute concert in London performing "[[Arnold Layne]]", and Roger Waters performed "Flickering Flame".

==Backing musicians==
''See: [[Pink Floyd live backing musicians]]''

Because of the increasingly complex nature of Pink Floyd's music, more and more [[Pink Floyd Live Backing Musicians|musicians]] besides the band were required on stage to recreate sounds achieved in the studio. Some performances of ''Atom Heart Mother'' featured an entire [[orchestra]] and [[choir]], reputedly a nightmare to bring on tour. Less 'weighty' contributions from other musicians followed. In 1973 [[Dick Parry]] provided [[saxophone]] for ''Dark Side of the Moon'' and reprised this for live performances in every subsequent tour except those promoting ''The Wall'' and ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'', the latter in which Scott Page provided sax. For 1977's ''Animals'' promotion, [[Snowy White]] was brought in as an additional guitarist. He returned for ''The Wall'' shows along with a complete "surrogate band" consisting of [[Peter Wood (musician)|Peter Wood]] (keyboards), Willie Wilson (drums) and [[Andy Bown]] (bass). Andy Roberts replaced White for the 1981 shows. For the ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'' and ''Division Bell'' tours, [[Jon Carin]] (whom David Gilmour had met at [[Live Aid]] playing in [[Bryan Ferry]]'s backing band) provided additional synthesizers and keyboards, [[Guy Pratt]] replaced Roger Waters on bass, [[Tim Renwick]] provided additional guitar and [[Gary Wallis]] additional percussion. Several backing vocalists, (the most notable of whom are [[Rachel Fury]], [[Clare Torry]], [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]], [[Margaret Taylor]], [[Durga McBroom]] and [[Carol Kenyon]]) have accompanied the band on and off from ''Dark Side of the Moon'' onwards. During their performance at [[Live 8]], Pink Floyd used [[Tim Renwick]], [[Jon Carin]], [[Dick Parry]] and [[Carol Kenyon]].

'''''profil''''' is an [[Austria]]n weekly news [[magazine]]  published in German and based in [[Vienna]].

==History and profile==
''profil'' was founded in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European News Resources|url=http://guides.nyu.edu/content.php?pid=74313&amp;sid=704214|work=NYU Libraries|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Oscar Bronner]],&lt;ref name=eutopix&gt;{{cite news|title=profil|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=1572|accessdate=7 October 2013|work=Euro Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kimb&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kimberly Bradley|title=Alive and kicking|journal=Monocle|date=October 2014|volume=77|issue=8|url=http://monocle.com/magazine/issues/77/alive-and-kicking/|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also founded the magazine ''[[Trend (magazine)|trend]]'' and the daily newspaper ''[[Der Standard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despite Everything: The Oscar Bronner Story|url=http://deutscheshaus.as.nyu.edu/object/dh.event.DespiteEverythingTheOscarBronnerStory051513|work=Deutsches Haus|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=char&gt;{{cite web|author=Charlotte Natmeßnig|title=Business Press in Austria|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers2/Natmessn.pdf|work=Helsinki.fi|format=Conference Paper|date=2006|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is headquartered in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=eutopix/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Media in the German Speaking Countries|url=https://german.uchicago.edu/links/media|work=University of Chicago|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''profil'' came out as a monthly on 7 September 1970. Starting in October 1972, it was published every two weeks and from January 1974 every week.&lt;ref name=rustel/&gt; In 2001 ''profil'' became part of the publishing company [[NEWS (publishing)|NEWS]].&lt;ref name=eutopix/&gt; The magazine is sometimes considered the Austrian counterpart to ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/source-information/667-profil profil] Presseurop. Retrieved 3 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 business magazine, ''[[ecco (magazine)|ecco]]'', merged with ''profil''.&lt;ref name=char/&gt;

''profil'' includes sections for Austria, abroad, economy, society, science, and culture. [[Gloss (annotation)|Gloss]]es, [[caricature]]s, and letters to the editor are also published. In the mid-1980s it had an independent and liberal leaning.&lt;ref name=ujb/&gt; In the 2000s the magazine had a [[left liberal]] political stance.&lt;ref name=esi&gt;{{cite web|title=Communicating Europe: Austria Manual|url=http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/enlargement_debates_manual_austria.pdf|work=European Stability Initiative|accessdate=12 October 2013|date=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It targets Austria's [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref name=char/&gt; Both ''profil'' and ''trend'' initiated [[investigative journalism]] in the country.&lt;ref name=char/&gt; It was ''profil'' which revealed the [[Nazi]] past of [[Kurt Waldheim]], former [[Austrian president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Mitten|title=The Politics of the Antisemitic Prejudice.

[[Christian Rainer]] has been publisher and [[editor-in-chief]] since 1998&lt;ref name=kimb/&gt; when he succeeded [[Josef Votzi]] in the post. The chief editorial staff consists of [[Sven Gächter]], [[Stefan Janny]], and [[Herbert Lackner]].

[[File:Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Announcing 6 Points At Lahore.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announcing the six points in Lahore]]

The '''Six Point Movement''' was a movement in [[East Pakistan]], spearheaded by [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], which called for greater autonomy for East Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Six-point_Programme|title=Six-point Programme - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's main agenda was to realize the six demands put forward by a coalition of Bengali nationalist political parties in 1966, to end the perceived exploitation of East Pakistan by the [[West Pakistan]]i rulers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news/six-points-and-june-7-1966|title=Six Points and June 7, 1966|date=2013-06-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a milestone on the road to Bangladesh's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-237234|title=Historic Six-Point Day today|date=2012-06-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the [[partition of India]], the new state of Pakistan came into being. The inhabitants of East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) made up the majority of its population, and exports from East Pakistan (such as [[jute]]) were a majority of Pakistan's export income. However, East Pakistanis did not feel they had a proportional share of political power and economic benefits within Pakistan. A statistical overview of [[economic discrimination]] is shown in this table:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-40021|title=The historic six-point movement and its impact on the struggle for independence|date=2008-06-07|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Pakistan was facing a critical situation after being subjected to continuous discrimination on a regional basis, year after year. As a result, the economists, intelligentsia, and the politicians of East Pakistan started to raise questions about this discrimination, giving rise to the historic six-point movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==The Six Points==
The six points are noted as being:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

#The Constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense based on the [[Lahore Resolution]], and the parliamentary form of government with supremacy of a Legislature directly elected on the basis of universal adult franchise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#The federal government should deal with only two subjects: Defence and Foreign Affairs, and all other residual subjects should be vested in the federating states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate Banking Reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#The power of taxation and revenue collection should be vested in the federating units and the federal centre would have no such power. The federation would be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its expenditures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
#East Pakistan should have a separate military or paramilitary force, and Navy headquarters should be in East Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The proposal was rejected by politicians from West Pakistan and non Awami League politicians from East Pakistan. It was rejected by the President of All Pakistan Awami League [[Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan|Nawabzada Nasarullah Khan]]. It was also rejected by [[National Awami Party]], [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-i-Islami]], and [[Nizam-e-Islam Party|Nizam-i-Islam]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The movement had the support of the population of East Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2006/06/12/d60612020626.htm|title=Revisiting the significance of the historic Six-Point Movement|last=Manik|first=M Waheeduzzaman|date=|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|de|Theater am Kärntnertor}}''' or '''{{lang|de|Kärntnertortheater}}''' (English: [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]]n Gate Theatre) was a prestigious [[theatre]] in [[Vienna]] during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Its official title was ''{{lang|de|Kaiserliches und Königliches Hoftheater zu Wien}}'', the "Imperial and Royal Court Theater of Vienna".

==History==
The theater was built in 1709 to designs by [[Antonio Beduzzi]] on a site near the former Kärntnertor,&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|de|Kärntnertor}}" means "Carinthian gate"; from "{{lang|de|Kärnten}}" (German for [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]), "{{lang|de|Kärntner}}" ("Carinthian")&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds of the present [[Hotel Sacher]]. The expenses of building the theater were borne by the City of Vienna, and was intended (as [[Eva Badura-Skoda]] notes)&lt;ref name=BS&gt;Badura-Skoda 1973&lt;/ref&gt; to be "frequented by the Viennese population of all classes." However, at the command of the Emperor, the first performances were of Italian opera, an elite form of entertainment. In 1711 the theater was redirected to its original purpose when it was placed under the direction of [[:de:Josef Anton Stranitzky|Josef Stranitzky]], who put on a variety of entertainments, often embodying a German version of the Italian [[commedia dell'arte]].&lt;ref name=BS /&gt; The theater was managed by Stranitzky's widow after his death.

In 1728 the court artists Borosini and Selliers, who had performed [[Intermezzo|intermezzi]] in both German and Italian, became the Kärntnertortheater's directors. From 1742 to 1750 the theatre was leased to Selliers alone. In 1752, however, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] withdrew the imperial privilege, placing the theater under the direct scrutiny of the magistrates of Vienna.

The first theatre burned in 1761 and was rebuilt by the court architect [[Nicolò Pacassi]]; two years later it reopened, again under protective privilege, as the ''{{lang|de|Kaiserliches und Königliches Hoftheater zu Wien}}'', "Imperial and Royal Court Theater of Vienna". From the early nineteenth century [[ballet]]s were added to the repertory, as well as Italian and German [[opera]]s. From 1811 to 1814 [[Ignaz Franz Castelli]] served as ''Hoftheaterdichter'', "poet of the court theater". From 1821 the Italian [[impresario]] [[Domenico Barbaia]] added the theatre to the string of theatres under his management, and presented [[Italian opera]]s. Beginning in 1861 the Vienna Court Opera House (now the [[Vienna State Opera]]) was built on the adjoining grounds; it was completed in 1869 and in 1870 the former theatre was razed, making way for the apartment building that became the [[Hotel Sacher]]. [[Gerhard Bronner]]'s [[cabaret]] showcase [[:de:stadtTheater walfischgasse|stadtTheater walfischgasse]] used the name ''{{lang|de|Neues Theater am Kärntnertor}}'' (New Theatre at the Kärntnertor) from 1959 to 1973 before adopting its present name; it is located on the next block at 4 Walfischgasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kabarettarchiv.at/Ordner/history.htm | title=The History of Austrian Cabaret | publisher=kabarettarchiv.at | accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First performances of operas and other works==
During its heyday several composers conducted the theatre orchestra, including the young [[Franz Lachner]] and [[Ferdinando Paer]].

'''Youth Conference''' is a large scale three-day Christian event held in numerous places around the world. The originating event, YC Alberta, is held in [[Red Deer|Red Deer, Alberta]], Canada. YC is a ministry of Extreme Dream Ministries.

YC is unique from other Christians music festivals in that attendees buy tickets to attend all main speakers and concerts, not just the ones they choose.

YC Weekend is typically scheduled to take place for 3 days on may long weekend each year.

==History==

YC was organized by the Alberta district of the [[Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada]] (PAOC). The first YC was held in 1994, with a group of 500 students. After being held for several years at the Centrium in Red Deer, Alberta, the conference outgrew the facilities and moved to [[Edmonton Coliseum]] in 2000. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, it had a record attendance of around 18000 people. 2014 was the 20th anniversary of YC. In remembrance of the anniversary, the mayor of the city of Edmonton (Don Iveson), proclaimed "YC Days". Thus means every year, the weekend that YC is on, it is YC days.

In 2005 YC branched out to hold an event in [[Ukraine]], which was very successful. YC is still expanding, with an event held each year in [[Winnipeg]], [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], [[Belize]] and [[Slovakia]].

==Format==

Each year, YC has a different "theme" that expresses what organizers wish attendees to focus on during the weekend, which starts on Friday, goes through Saturday, and ends Sunday evening.

On Friday, YC kicks off in Northlands Coliseum, usually with a light and fireworks show. Then comes a [[contemporary worship]] service, followed by a speaker. Then the evening ends with a concert.

On Saturday morning, there is another worship service, after which two speakers present. At noon, the attendees are released to eat lunch, and browse the many afternoon activities YC offers, like workshops, numerous concerts, indoor games, exhibitors, and a marketplace. Then the evening brings a concert, a worship service with another speaker, and a concert.

On Sunday morning, there is a worship service with a speaker. The afternoon brings similar afternoon events as Saturday's. YC ends differently year to year. Sometimes it ends with a worship service, and a final concert. It also can end with a worship service, and then a speaker.

The event has sold out several times, with over 18,000 people in attendance. In recent years, the event has seen an average of approximately 10,000-12,000 people.

==YC Ukraine==

'''Youth Conference Ukraine''', or '''YC Kiev''' as it has been called, is a branch-off of YC Alberta held in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]. Around 5500 people attended the first 3-day event in summer 2005. [[Delirious?]] was a featured artist there. YC Kiev was run by [[Extreme Dream Ministries]] in its inaugural year, but the project is now being undertaken by the Alliance of Ukrainian Youth Leadership team.

==YC Manitoba==

'''Youth Convention Manitoba,''' or '''YC Manitoba''' is an annual Christian Youth Convention held in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].  In 2005 '''YC Fusion''', the original Convention name, had Mike Love — founder and president of Extreme Dreams Ministries as their keynote speaker at the conference. As Mike later recalled, he felt that Manitoba was a new mission field ready for an awakening. When the 2005 conference came to a close, Rob Bedard, the YC Fusion Director announced his position was ending which led to the announcement of Extreme Dreams Ministries future role in the conference. Changing the name from YC Fusion to YC Manitoba, Extreme Dreams Ministries and Mike Love led the way with a well-received 2006 conference and continues to do so.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4667">"'''Zombie company'''" is a media term for a company that needs [[bailout]]s in order to operate, or an in [[debt]]ed company that is able to repay the interest on its debts but not repay the principal.

==Description==

Zombie companies are indebted businesses that, although generating cash, after covering running costs, fixed costs (wages, rates, rent) they only have enough funds to service the interest on their loans, but not the debt itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20262282| title = 'Zombie' companies eating away at economic growth| date = 13 Nov 2012| publisher = [[BBC]] |quote  = "A zombie company is one which is generating just about enough cash to service its debt, so the bank is not obliged to pull the plug on the loan," (Mark Thomas, PA Consulting) }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such they generally depend on banks (creditors) for their continued existence, effectively putting them on never-ending life support.

== History ==
The term "zombie company" was applied to Japanese firms supported by Japanese banks during the period known as the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|"Lost Decade"]] after the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] in c.1990. Japanese banks continued to support weak or failing firms.&lt;ref name="z1"/&gt; The retailer [[Daiei]] is an example of a large company that expanded greatly during the period leading to the 1990 crash, and under different circumstances would have been expected to have entered receivership or bankruptcy. The finance minister [[Takeo Hiranuma]] was reported as describing the 96,000 employee firm as being 'too big to fail'.&lt;ref name="z1"&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/nov/20/japan.internationalnews| title = Japan's zombie economy – not buying but browsing | date = 20 Nov 2002| first = Charlotte| last = Denny| publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = James| last = Brooke| title =  They're Alive!
