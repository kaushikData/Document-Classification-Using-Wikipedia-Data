Youssef is the son of Kalim Youssef, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] immigrant, and Antoinette Youssef, a Brazilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Youssef enviou 1bilhao para exterior| work =O Globo| url =http://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/youssef-enviou-1-bilhao-para-exterior-14001740| language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =condenacao alberto youssef sergio moro| work =Conjur| url =http://s.conjur.com.br/dl/condenacao-alberto-youssef-sergio-moro.pdf| language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in very modest circumstances in Londrina, a town in the state of Paraná.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

When he was a boy, he sold snacks in the streets of Londrina. During his teenage years, after earning a pilot's license, he began smuggling costly electronic items and other merchandise into Brazil from [[Paraguay]], where taxes were far lower, and selling them on.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Santos| first =Klecio| title =Quem é Alberto Youssef, o doleiro suspeito no governo e na Petrobras| work =ZH Noticias| language=Portuguese| date =April 26, 2014| url =http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticias/noticia/2014/04/quem-e-alberto-youssef-o-doleiro-suspeito-no-governo-e-na-petrobras-4485137.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older sister worked with him on this smuggling operation, which first put Youssef on the government's radar, in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; Also during his teens, he helped his mother sell food at a shop at the local airport.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

It was at the airport that he met [[José Janene]], a businessman and pilot who would later become a member of Congress and helped Youssef with his career.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Career==

===Early activities and scandals===
By the early 1990s, Youssef had left smuggling behind and gone into the business of money laundering. Soon he was considered one of the top ''doleiros'', or black-market currency changers, in Brazil. According to [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]], Youssef began driving an armored car to deliver cash amounts daily.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Youssef was arrested both in 2000, and again in 2001, because of a corrupt operation that was based in Londrina and that involved the bribery of bank employees who in return cashed municipal checks, including unsigned checks. He was never put on trial, however, and spent less than a month behind bars.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Youssef was also involved with a case of embezzlement in [[Maringá]], a town near Londrina around the same time as his other arrests. Indicted on charges of criminal conspiracy, he escaped punishment by fingering local government officials who had been involved in the scandal.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

===Banestado scandal===
Youssef was then charged with money laundering in the Banestado scandal. Banestado was a state-run bank that had been used by many wealthy persons to launder money and thus avoid high Brazilian taxes. Youssef was in charge of the money laundering, and was said to have laundered more than $830 million.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

Once again, Youssef plea-bargained, turning in other doleiros, whose conviction and imprisonment only enhanced Youssef's standing in his profession.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

===Further activities and scandals===
In yet another investigation, Youssef got off by telling prosecutors about the manipulation of tax credits at a government power utility.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

In 2006, Janene was indicted in a scandal involving members of congress who sold their votes. Prosecutors later determined that some of the money generated by this scheme was laundered by Youssef through a Brasilia gas station. After Janene's death in 2010, Youssef took control of Janene's network of corruption in both [[Brasilia]] and Petrobras.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

===Petrobras scandal===
{{Main article|Operation Car Wash}}
Youssef has been called a "principal player"&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; in the largest scandal in Brazilian history. It involves money laundering and other corrupt activities at the government-owned oil company, Petrobras, executives of which accepted bribes in return for overpaying construction firms doing work for the firm. Youssef became part of the operation in late 2006 at the invitation of Janene; it was his job to collect the bribes from the contractors.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The scandal has been under investigation since March 2014. The investigators' big break came with the discovery of an e-mail by Youssef in which he discussed a [[Range Rover]] bought for [[Paulo Roberto Costa]], who had been Petrobras's supplies director from 2004 to 2012. As he had in many other scandals, Youssef agreed to turn state’s evidence. When he handed his lawyers a piece of paper on which he had written the names of the participants in the Petrobras operation, Reinaldet asked, “Are you serious?” Reinaldet later told the ''[[The New York Times|Times]]'', "It was kind of like, in Brazil, we know that corruption is a monster. But we never really see the monster. This was like seeing the monster."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Youssef told prosecutors that President [[Dilma Rousseff]], who had served as chairwoman of Petrobras from 2003 through 2010, was aware of the kickback scheme.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;  One investigator said that Youssef's revelations made it clear “we had a case that was 100 times bigger” than they had originally imagined.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Because of his agreement with prosecutors, Youssef, who would ordinally have received a prison sentence of over 8 years, will instead serve only three years for his involvement in Petrobras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Justiça Federal condena réus ligados à empreiteira Camargo Corrêa| language=Portuguese| work =Globo.com| date =July 20, 2015| url =http://g1.globo.com/pr/parana/noticia/2015/07/justica-federal-condena-seis-reus-ligados-empreiteira-camargo-correa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment==
Youssef was arrested in March 2014, and in September he was sentenced to four years and four months for having violated the terms of a plea bargain regarding the Banestado case. He is now in [[Curitiba]] .

==Personal life==
Youssef is married to Joan of Arc Fernandes da Silva Youssef, who separated from him after learning of his extramarital affairs. His mistresses have included [[Nelma Kodama]], a convicted criminal who is now in prison, and [[Taiana Camargo]], a fashion model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Shalom| first =David| title ="Youssef criou o meu filho", afirma ex-amante do doleiro| work =Ultimo Segundo| date =Jan 14, 2015| url =http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/politica/2015-01-14/youssef-criou-meu-filho-diz-ex-amante-do-doleiro.html| language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Ex-diretor deu roteiro de prisões | language=Portuguese| work =O Tempo| date =Nov 17, 2014| url =http://www.otempo.com.br/capa/pol%C3%ADtica/ex-diretor-deu-roteiro-de-pris%C3%B5es-1.948437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Londrina, he was known as an extravagant spender on parties and women.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt;

'''Alonso Pita da Veiga''', born in [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] in 15th century [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]], was one of the most remarkable officers of the [[Tercio|Spanish Tercios]] fighting under the orders of Count [[Andrade|Fernando de Andrade]] in the [[Battle of Pavia]] ([[Italy]]), and in other battles of the Italian Wars between the years 1513-1525.  He was granted the right to display a coat of arms, and was granted land and property in [[Ferrolterra]], his birthplace, for having participated in the capture, on the battlefield, of the king of [[France]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].

The decree granting a coat of arms to Alonso Pita da Veiga, was archived at the General Archive of Simanca  (Archivo general de Simancas, legajo 388, rotulado de "Mercedes y Privilegios.’) and  was issued by Emperor Charles V on 24 July 1529, four years after the Battle of Pavia. A verbatim text of the decree can be found in, among other 19th Century Spanish books, in the book, "Crisol historico espanol y restauracion de glorias nacionales", published in Havana, Cuba in 1862 by the Spanish historian José Ferrer de Couto.  A summary of the document, in English translation, gives the following details:

"Alonso Pita da Veiga, Galician, and our vassal" served his majesty well in several battles including the Battle of Bicencio and the Battle of Vicoca.
In regards to the Battle of Pavia, the decree states that Alonso Pita da Veiga recaptured the standard  " ... of His Most Serene Infante Don Fernando, who is now King of Hungary, Our most dear and loved son and brother, which bore the insignia of Our Duchy of Burgundy, which the French had taken when the standard-bearer was killed”. This refers to the standard of Ferdinand, the brother of Charles V, whose troops fought at Pravia. For this action, Alonso Pita da Veiga was awarded 600 gold ducats.

In regards  to the capture of King Francis I of France, the decree states  "and in the same battle, you accomplished so much that you reached the person of said King (Francis I of France) and captured him, jointly with the other persons that captured him.”  So, in effect, Charles V credited a group of individuals, and not a single individual, with the capture of King Francis I. For that action, Alonso Pita da Veiga was awarded the sum of 30,0000 maravedís per year, for life, "above and beyond your pay as an 'hombre de arma'". "Hombre de arma" was a term used in that era to signify a mounted warrior as opposed to a foot soldier.

The decree states that Alonso Pita da Veiga took from Francis I of France the following:   " and you took from him his left gauntlet and a brocade decorated with four crosses of silver cloth and a crucifix made of the True Cross, of which events the same King of France gave testimony in a document signed by his own hand."

The decree then awards Alonso Pita da Veiga a coat of arms, described in the decree, that incorporates the different elements of his deeds at the Battle of Pavia: 

“A coat of arms, quarted, the first quarter colored the color of blood and in it a gauntlet as a symbol that you took said King of France, and a royal Crown of gold above of said gauntlet; and in the lower quarter, a blue field with three gold fleur-de-lis which are the true arms of the Kings of France; and in the right quarter with the field colored as the superior quarter and in it the brocade decorated with its crosses; and the left quarter, likewise colored, and in it the said standard of the Most Serene King of Hungary with the arms of Our Duchy of Burgundy.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">'''Banus''' was a teacher of [[Josephus|Titus Flavius Josephus]], a first-century Romano-Jewish scholar, historian and hagiographer.

Josephus wrote in his work ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' that Banus "lived in the desert, used no other clothing than grew upon trees, had no other food than what grew of its own accord, and bathed himself in cold water frequently, both by night and by day, in order to preserve his chastity. I imitated him in those things, and
continued with him three years."&lt;ref name="Josephus"/&gt; Josephus then returned to the city at the age of nineteen and began to live according to the rules of the [[Pharisees]].&lt;ref name="Josephus"/&gt; 

Chajes&lt;ref name="Europeana"/&gt; connects the name "Banus" with the Talmudic "Bannaah".&lt;ref name="Jewishencyclopedia2455"/&gt;

'''Belle Gold''' (née '''French'''), briefly known as '''Lacey''', is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. She is portrayed by [[Emilie de Ravin]], who became a series regular in the second season and onwards after making recurring appearances in the first season, and has become a fan favorite since her debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2012/06/19/once-upon-a-time-emilie-de-ravin-series-regular-season-2/|title=Exclusive: ''Once Upon a Time'' Promotes Emilie de Ravin to Series Regular for Season 2|first=Matt|last=Mitovich|work=TVLine|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is both based on the character from ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' by [[Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont]], and the [[Belle (Disney)|Disney princess]] of the [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|1991 film of the same name]]. Emilie de Ravin remained a series regular until the show’s sixth season. De Ravin departed the main cast at the conclusion of the sixth season, returning as a guest star for the fourth episode of the seventh season to bring the character some closure, solidified during a final appearance in the show's series finale.

==Character background==
Belle is represented throughout the series as a hopeful individual who sees the best in people (occasionally, to a fault), a knowledgeable bookworm well-versed in many languages, and a steadfast heroine determined to help those in need.

===Early life===
Belle grew up in the Enchanted Forest as the daughter of [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Sir Maurice|Sir Maurice]] ([[Eric Keenleyside]]) and his wife Colette ([[Frances O'Connor]]). She always had a close relationship with her mother, having been introduced to her love for books by her&lt;ref name="4x06"&gt;Episode 4.06 "Family Business"&lt;/ref&gt; and taught different skills such as how to translate fairy language.&lt;ref name="6x09"&gt;Episode 6.09 "Changelings"&lt;/ref&gt; Belle also had a childhood friend by the name of Samuel.&lt;ref name="OotP"&gt;Canon graphic novel, ''Out of the Past''&lt;/ref&gt; However, besides this, not much else is known about Belle's life growing up. Nearing adulthood, Belle is startled to learn that war is ready to break out between her father's kingdom and the ogres.[[File:Belle BTC 5x17.jpg|thumb|left|Belle gets to know Gaston ([[Wes Brown (actor)|Wes Brown]]), her future betrothed.]] Her father arranges for her to marry [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Gaston|Sir Gaston]] ([[Wes Brown (actor)|Wes Brown]]), a union that Belle openly objects, though she agrees to go out on a walk with him and she surprisingly takes a liking to him. This all changes when she finds him torturing a young ogre, but she reluctantly agrees to marry him once the war does officially break out.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 5.17 "Her Handsome Hero"&lt;/ref&gt; At one point during the war, Belle and her family are forced to flee their castle; however, she and her mother spend time packing up all of their important books. An ogre storms the castle and kills Colette, and a traumatized Belle is left without any memory of the event. Desperate to know the truth, she travels to Arendelle where she meets [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Anna|Princess Anna]] ([[Elizabeth Lail]]). Anna takes her to rock troll [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Grand Pabbie|Grand Pabbie]] ([[John Rhys-Davies]]) who is able to retract her memories and put them into a pebble which she's instructed to brew into a tea. However, due to an encounter with the [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Ingrid/Snow Queen|Snow Queen]] ([[Elizabeth Mitchell]]), Belle loses the rock and returns home empty handed. Maurice confesses the truth to Belle, explaining how Colette sacrificed herself to save her. This sets Belle on the track of becoming a hero, as she reveals to her father that on her trip she learned of a man who could help them: [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] ([[Robert Carlyle]]).&lt;ref name="4x06"/&gt;

Rumplestiltskin agrees to protect Belle's kingdom if she agrees to leave her life behind and live with him as his caretaker. Both Maurice and Gaston object to this, but Belle ignores their pleas and leaves with the Dark One. Belle is frightened of Rumplestiltskin and his Dark Castle, as he shows her to her "room": a ghastly dungeon. Belle starts to see the softer side of her captor when she accidentally chips a teacup and he brushes it off as nothing.&lt;ref name="1x12"&gt;Episode 1.12 "Skin Deep"&lt;/ref&gt; At one point during Belle's stay in the Dark Castle, she and Rumplestiltskin are visited by an intruder, [[Robin Hood (Once Upon a Time)|Robin Hood]] ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), who the Dark One proceeds to torture for trying to steal from him. Feeling compassion for the thief, Belle releases Robin in her master's absence. When Rumplestiltskin returns, he demands she accompany him on his journey to find and kill the thief for stealing a magic wand from his castle. When Belle and Rumple see that Robin had only stolen the wand to cure his sick and [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Marian|pregnant wife]] ([[Christie Laing]]), Rumple spares the thief's life. Belle embraces Rumplestiltskin in a hug, seeing that there's a man behind the beast, and he later gifts her with a library.&lt;ref name="2x19"&gt;Episode 2.19 "Lacey"&lt;/ref&gt; It is implied that Belle and Robin Hood shared an encounter sometime after these events when Belle met the thief in his true form ([[Sean Maguire]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=AdamHorowitzLA|author=Adam Horowitz|number=587797877465853952|title=@Liv1177 @ScottNimerfro belle and RH had an encounter subsequent to the events of Lacey we have yet to see.|date=April 13, 2015|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, Rumplestiltskin returns home one day with a stolen baby, which he leaves for Belle to take care of. She's appalled and frightened by whatever he plans to do with the child, and so she sets out to unveil his plans and save the baby's life. Belle sneaks into Rumple's study and translates a scroll written in ancient fairy language. This, however, was all part of Rumplestiltskin's plan, as he needed her to translate the text, and he locks her in the library. The [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Reul Ghorm/Blue Fairy|Blue Fairy]] ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]) subsequently frees Belle, and she finds Rumplestiltskin using the child to summon the [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Black Fairy|Black Fairy]] ([[Jaime Murray]]), his mother. Belle is horrified by the Black Fairy's treatment of Rumplestiltskin, but nonetheless chides him for stealing a child. She then returns the child to his parents, Jack (Nick Hunnings) and Jill ([[Tammy Gillis]]).&lt;ref name="6x09"/&gt;

Belle and Rumplestiltskin's bond is further explored when Belle is targeted by the Queens of Darkness - [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Maleficent|Maleficent]] ([[Kristin Bauer van Straten]]), [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Ursula|Ursula]] ([[Merrin Dungey]]), and [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Cruella De Vil|Cruella De Vil]] ([[Victoria Smurfit]]) - who ransom her for Rumplestiltskin's enchanted gauntlet. The Dark One meets the three women at Demon's Bluff with the gauntlet, and is given no choice but to hand it over when Ursula threatens Belle's life. Once again, she sees something good in him beneath the beast.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 4.11 "Heroes and Villains"&lt;/ref&gt; One day, Belle is sent out to the market in order to pick up things for Rumplestiltskin when she stumbles upon her old friend Samuel, injured, so she brings him back to the Dark Castle to nurse him back to health. As it turns out however, he was only there to steal Rumplestiltskin's dagger, giving him control over the Dark One, and so Belle betrays him to protect Rumple.&lt;ref name="OotP"/&gt; As Belle and Rumple grow closer, his attitude towards her becomes more playful and lighthearted. Belle opens up Rumple's nailed down curtains and even convinces him to share the story of his [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Baelfire|lost son]] (Dylan Schmid). The Dark One agrees to tell Belle everything if she returns home from town with straw, this being his subtle way of setting her free, having developed genuine feelings for her. Though Belle plans not to return at first, she runs into the [[Regina Mills|Evil Queen]] ([[Lana Parrilla]]) on the road and learns that Rumplestiltskin's curse can be broken with a kiss of true love. Realizing that she's in love with the Dark One and that he loves her back, Belle returns and attempts to break his curse, only for it to backfire when Rumplestiltskin learns it was the Queen's idea. He lashes out at Belle and sends her back to the dungeon, and eventually kicks her out of his castle altogether. Belle argues that power won't be enough for Rumple and that he is only doing this because he doesn't believe anyone could truly love him. Before leaving, she says, "Now, you've made your choice. And you're going to regret it. Forever. All you'll have is an empty heart... and a chipped cup." &lt;ref name="1x12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="3x11"&gt;Episode 3.11 "Going Home"&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than return home to her friends and family, Belle spends some days in a local tavern where she meets a dwarf named [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Grumpy|Dreamy]] ([[Lee Arenberg]]). After convincing him to go after his love ([[Amy Acker]]), he encourages her to seek out adventure and join a group of men on the hunt for a beast known as the Yaoguai. She does so, but these men ignorantly discredit a woman's ability to hunt and kick her off their wagon, so she sends them in the wrong direction and proceeds to hunt the creature herself. She winds up befriending a warrior named [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Mulan|Mulan]] ([[Jamie Chung]]), and she is eventually able to track the Yaoguai down. However, as it turns out, this beast has merely been trying to communicate with them. With the aid of some fairy dust given to her by Dreamy, Belle restores the creature to its true form: [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Prince Phillip|Prince Phillip]] ([[Julian Morris]]). While Phillip and Mulan go off together in order to rescue [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Princess Aurora|Princess Aurora]] ([[Sarah Bolger]]), Belle decides to return to Rumplestiltskin. She's unable to do so, however, when the Evil Queen arrives to take her captive. Belle vows that the Queen cannot keep her and Rumple apart forever.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 1.14 "Dreamy"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2x11"&gt;Episode 2.11 "The Outsider"&lt;/ref&gt; Regina visits Rumple in his castle and convinces him that Belle was rejected by her father upon returning home and committed suicide by throwing herself off a tower, leaving him utterly heartbroken, while secretly Belle remains a prisoner in the Queen's castle.&lt;ref name="1x12"/&gt; Belle is later sought out by [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Captain Hook]] ([[Colin O'Donoghue]]), an old enemy of Rumplestiltskin's who believes that the Dark One's former maid may know the key to his undoing. Belle refuses to aid in his quest, so Hook knocks her unconscious and prepares to kill her, but Regina intervenes as she believes Belle to be a "valuable chess piece".&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.09 "Queen of Hearts"&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that Belle remained in the Queen's captivity until the casting of the First Curse.

===Season 1===
When the Evil Queen enacts a powerful Dark Curse that puts everyone in the town of Storybrooke, Maine with false memories for the next 28 years, Belle spends that entire span of time locked away in the psychiatric ward beneath the town's hospital. Unlike the other townspeople, Belle was left a blank slate and set to serve merely as a prisoner in order to keep her away from Rumplestiltskin or, as he's known in Storybrooke, Mr. Gold. However, when time starts moving again and Mr. Gold regains his memories of his past life in the Enchanted Forest, he forms a vendetta against Belle's father, believing he drove her to suicide. Sheriff [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) arrests Gold when he beats Moe French nearly to death, but when behind bars, Regina returns to him the chipped teacup in exchange for confirming to her that he knows the truth about the curse. She then proceeds to check up on a locked up Belle, who appears absolutely miserable.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 1.01 "Pilot"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1x12"/&gt;

As the Dark Curse nears its end with the Savior beginning to believe in magic, things start to fall apart for Regina. This includes her alliance with [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Jefferson/Mad Hatter|Jefferson]], the Mad Hatter ([[Sebastian Stan]]), whom she refuses to hold up her end of a deal with after he procured her the poisoned apple she once used on [[Mary Margaret Blanchard|Snow White]] ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Episode 1.21 "An Apple Red as Blood"&lt;/ref&gt; Wanting to hurt Regina, Jefferson breaks Belle out of her cell and instructs that she seek out Mr. Gold, insisting that he will protect her. Belle does so, shocking Gold beyond belief as he spent years believing she was dead. He embraces her with a hug, though she has no memory of him, but he assures her that she soon will. The two are seen headed towards the town's wishing well when the curse is officially broken. Belle's memories are restored, as she embraces Gold and declares her love for him, which he reciprocates. Gold puts their reunion on a short hold though, as he proceeds to drop a vial of True Love into the well, bringing magic to Storybrooke.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 1.22 "A Land Without Magic"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
Though Belle has been reunited with Rumplestiltskin, he continues to struggle with his dark impulses. Upon learning that Regina had locked Belle up for 28 years, he summons a Wraith to kill the Queen. A disappointed Belle temporarily leaves him. She soon returns though, deciding she can't give up on him just yet, and they continue to pursue a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.01 "Broken"&lt;/ref&gt; Belle moves in with Rumple, as she is oblivious to her father trying to find her; however, when he does, he attempts to force her over the town line to make her forget about her life with Rumplestiltskin, refusing to bless their relationship. This makes her both upset with him and Rumple, who she's learned is continuing to practice dark magic. Though she cuts ties with both of them, she eventually gives Rumple another chance upon realizing that he's attempting to change, giving her the town's library and setting her up with the apartment above it. They agree to then go out and get a hamburger, as Belle has never had one before.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.04 "The Crocodile"&lt;/ref&gt; As Belle explores life in Storybrooke, she comes to befriend [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Red Riding Hood|Ruby]] ([[Meghan Ory]]), who turns into a werewolf during every full moon. Belle stands by Ruby and insists that she is not the monster many believe her to be, as Belle sees the goodness in her heart.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.07 "Child of the Moon"&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Belle and Rumple grow closer, as they continue to go out on dates like lunch at Granny's Diner and a picnic in Rumple's pawnshop. However, interruptions occur frequently as the town panics due to the arrival of Regina's mother, [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Cora|Cora]] ([[Barbara Hershey]]), who has become a new threat to them all.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.08 "Into the Deep"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.10 "The Cricket Game"&lt;/ref&gt;

Belle supports Rumple in his mission to find a loophole around the town line barrier in hopes of going out in search of his long lost son, but ventures out on her own when it is revealed that Captain Hook has made it to Storybrooke and attacks her in the library. She ends up rescuing [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Archie Hopper|Archie Hopper]] ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) from being held hostage on the Jolly Roger, facing off against Hook. Rumple appears and beats Hook to Belle's horror, as she begs him to show her that her faith in him is justified. After Rumple spares Hook's life and prepares to leave town, Hook shoots Belle in an attempt at revenge. This sends her tumbling across the town line, causing her to lose her memory, just as an outsider drives into Storybrooke.&lt;ref name="2x11"/&gt; Though Rumple is able to heal Belle's gunshot wound immediately, she's escorted to the hospital in order to be kept under intensive care while suffering from amnesia. Rumple attempts to get through to Belle by showing her the chipped teacup, a remnant of their life together, but a scared and confused Belle throws and smashes the cup. Heartbroken, Rumple leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.12 "In the Name of the Brother"&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby visits Belle in the hospital but is disappointed that she doesn't remember who she is. When Belle recalls Rumple healing her wound with magic, as well as creating a fireball to throw at Hook, Ruby acts as though Belle isn't making any sense. Belle knows what she saw though, sending her into a frenzy, prompting a nurse sedating her. She later learns that she isn't alone in her belief, for she is approached by [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Greg Mendell|Greg Mendell]] ([[Ethan Embry]]), who reveals that he saw the same thing at the town line.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.13 "Tiny"&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lacey 2x19.jpg|thumb|right|Mr. Gold ([[Robert Carlyle]]) gets to know Lacey, Belle's alter-ego.]]
With Regina and Cora now conspiring together, Regina visits Belle in the hospital in an attempt to learn where Rumple's Dark One dagger is located.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.14 "Manhattan"&lt;/ref&gt; Rumple is later poisoned with Dreamshade by Hook, and on his deathbed Rumple calls Belle at the hospital to speak to her one last time, telling her that although she cannot remember it, she is a hero. Their call ends, but Rumple is cured when Mary Margaret sacrifices Cora's life for Rumple's.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.16 "The Miller's Daughter"&lt;/ref&gt;
Belle is relieved when Rumple visits her, seeing that he's still alive. Their happiness does not last though, as Regina magically instills a new persona in Belle - a party girl with loose morals by the name of Lacey - who Rumple soon finds at the local bar, after being discharged from the hospital. The two don't initially click, but Rumple is soon able to make it work when he discovers that Lacey is attracted to his dark side.&lt;ref name="2x19"/&gt; They continue to pursue a relationship, but Hook learns that Rumple is still alive when he sees the couple out walking the streets of Storybrooke.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.20 "The Evil Queen"&lt;/ref&gt; Lacey serves as a bad influence for Rumple, which goes noticed by Baelfire, now known as Neal ([[Michael Raymond-James]]), who Rumple has found and brought back to Storybrooke. Lacey soon learns that Rumple has magic, as well as the ability to grant her eternal youth. She reacts positively and suggests Rumple do what he must to preserve their future, oblivious to the fact that it means killing his grandson, [[Henry Mills (Once Upon a Time)|Henry Mills]] ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]).&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.21 "Second Star to the Right"&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to her old friend Dreamy (or Leroy, as he is known in our world), Belle's memories are eventually restored in the midst of the destruction of Storybrooke. She embraces Rumple as they prepare to die, but the town is soon saved, and Rumple must leave on a new quest to save Henry from Neverland. He leaves Belle behind with a protection spell to cast over the town. As he's fated to die on this mission, he expects this to be their final goodbye, but Belle promises that she'll see him again.&lt;ref&gt;Episode 2.22 "And Straight on 'Til Morning"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
[[File:Belle 3x22.jpg|thumb|left|Belle and Gold finally marry.]]
Rumplestilskin encounters a form of Belle frequently in Neverland as an illusion to act as a crutch to his cowardliness;&lt;ref name="S03E04"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-4/ 'Once Upon a Time' recap: Let the Wild Rumpus Start!] by Hilary Busis, from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (October 20, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; she is later revealed as his father Peter Pan's shadow in disguise. In Storybrooke, Belle helps Ariel retrieve Pandora's Box to send to the heroes in Neverland as a method of defeating Pan. Belle and Rumple are reunited when the group returns to Storybrooke after retrieving Henry, though Gold soon sacrifices himself to destroy his father and save Belle and the others. Belle breaks down, believing Rumple to be gone forever. Despite Rumple's heroic act, Pan's curse remains and Belle, along with the other inhabitants of Storybrooke, are sent back to their original worlds. In the Enchanted Forest, Belle and Neal travel to the Vault of the Dark One, where it is said the Dark One can be resurrected. Despite Belle's warnings of the price of magic, Neal ignores the possible repercussions and unlocks the vault, resurrecting Rumplestiltskin but sacrificing his own life in the process. Rumple absorbs Neal's body and consciousness into himself before Neal can die, however, and the Wicked Witch of the West obtains Rumple's dagger. Belle returns to Snow and Charming's castle, informing them of Rumple's resurrection. Months later, the heroes sneak into Rumple's Dark Castle, where he is being held prisoner by Zelena, the Wicked Witch. Belle is able to temporarily get through to Rumple, who is being driven mad by the multiple voices in his head, and he tells her that Zelena's weakness is light magic. Belle is returned to Storybrooke with no memories of the previous year when Snow and Charming enact the Dark Curse to stop Zelena from taking their baby. In Storybrooke, Emma separates Neal from Rumple's body in order to learn the identity of the Wicked Witch, and Neal dies shortly after. Belle mourns Neal's death with the rest of the town and eventually deduces Zelena's plan to change the past. She also discovers once again that Zelena is in possession of the Dark One's dagger and is keeping Rumple captive and under her control. Belle attempts to get through to Rumple and help him break free of the dagger's control, but Zelena stops her before she can. Belle's memories of the missing year are returned along with everyone else's when Regina breaks the new curse. Upon Regina's defeat of Zelena, Mr. Gold proposes to Belle after entrusting her with his dagger (though unbeknownst to her, it is a replica) and the two are married at the wishing well.

===Season 4===
Belle and Rumple share a blissful honeymoon in the Sorcerer's mansion, where Rumple discovers the Sorcerer's Hat. With Rumple's help, Belle discovers the Snow Queen's lair and is taunted by her reflection in the Snow Queen's magic mirror, causing her to question her faith in Rumple and their relationship. She quickly sets these doubts aside, however. Later, Belle helps Emma and Elsa deduce the Snow Queen's ultimate goal. Belle eventually learns of Rumple's deception, tearfully banishing her husband from the town with the power of the real dagger before he is able to kill Hook. While Gold is gone, Belle and Hook form a kind of friendship as they work together to find a way to free the fairies from the Sorcerer's Hat. Gold manages to return to Storybrooke with Ursula and Cruella de Vil, only to find Belle involved in a romantic relationship with Will Scarlet. In an attempt to threaten Gold, who is now working with the Queens of Darkness, Regina steals Belle's heart. Gold and Will work together to get it back, and Gold returns the heart to Belle and apologizes once again for his actions, telling Will that it is now his job to protect Belle's heart. In the alternate reality temporarily created by The Author, Belle and Rumple are living happily together with a child of their own. When Henry undoes The Author's actions and returns everyone to reality, Belle tells Gold that they could have truly had that happiness if not for his actions. As Gold's condition worsens, and he is consumed by the Dark One's powers, Belle confesses to him that she does not love Will and vows not to let him die alone. The Sorcerer's Apprentice removes the darkness from Gold's heart, though he remains in a comatose state whilst the darkness is taken in by Emma Swan.

===Season 5===
With the other residents of Storybrooke, Belle travels to the Enchanted Forest, taking Emma to Camelot in order to find Merlin and remove the Dark One's power from within her. However, weeks later, they return to Storybrooke with missing memories as to how they failed. During her time in Camelot, Belle's growing knowledge of spells helped to free Lancelot and Merida from King Arthur's prison. Belle subsequently helped Merida of Dunbroch win back her kingdom and save her three brothers from the other clans. In Storybrooke, Dark Emma awakens Rumple from his coma. Emma then steals Merida's heart and commands her to kill Belle in hopes that it will inspire Rumple to become a hero. Rumple insists that he and Belle leave town, but she refuses to run away from her life and the people she cares about. Dark Emma transforms Merida into a bear that chases Belle through the woods until the bear is stopped by Rumple, who feeds it anti-transformation powder in order to revert Merida to human form. Belle witnesses Rumple embrace his newfound heroism and remove Excalibur from its stone. After everyone's memory is restored and Rumple heroically faces Dark Hook, Rumple tells Belle that he is ready to finally be the man she deserves. Belle declines his offer to rekindle their relationship, stating that she has spent too long trying to heal his heart and that she has lost track of her own in the process. Upon the arrival of all previous Dark Ones in Storybrooke, Rumple sends Belle out of town so that she may escape the immediate threat and finally see the world as she has always wanted to. Belle accepts the offer and leaves, but returns once the threat is vanquished and tells Rumple that she wants to be with him because he has proven to be truly selfless, though she is unaware that Rumple has now reclaimed the powers of the Dark One.
[[File:Belle 5x17.jpg|thumb|Belle and Rumple work together to protect their unborn child.]]
Belle remains in Storybrooke when Rumple travels with Emma to the Underworld to rescue Hook, but is unaware that she is pregnant with their first child (although it is Rumple's second born child). It is revealed that, many years ago, Rumple promised his second born child to a healer back in the Enchanted Forest in exchange for saving young Baelfire's life. Now the healer has died and signed the contract over to Hades, whom the baby is now owed to. After she is sent through a portal along with Zelena and her daughter, Belle learns the truth from Gold about his reacquired powers and her pregnancy as well as the contract, putting her life and that of their unborn child in jeopardy once again. Belle is horrified by Rumple's embracing of his inner darkness, but agrees to work with him to save their child from Hades. Motivated by Hades, Gaston makes multiple attempts to kill Rumplestiltskin, reuniting Belle with her ex-fiancé. After confronting Gold about his murder of Gaston decades earlier, Belle intends to help Gaston move on from the Underworld, only to learn that Gaston blames her for his death. In an attempt to rescue Rumplestiltskin, Belle inadvertently pushes Gaston into the River of Lost Souls, damning him to eternal torment. Consumed with guilt over what she did to Gaston and fearing for her child's safety, Belle places herself under a sleeping curse given to her by Zelena, believing it will give Gold enough time to save their child from Hades. Before falling under, Belle makes Gold promise to return her to her father. Gold attempts to wake Belle with True Love's Kiss and fails, for Belle has begun losing faith in him again. To keep her and his unborn child safe, Rumple places Belle inside of Pandora's Box. In the season five finale, Pandora's Box is stolen by Mr. Hyde from the Land of Untold Stories. Hyde agrees to return the box containing Belle to Gold if he allows Hyde to conquer Storybrooke, a deal which Gold readily accepts.

=== Season 6===
Belle remains in her self-induced sleeping curse in Pandora's Box. Rumple enters her dreamworld to try to wake her, but fails in doing so. Her unborn son wakes her instead, and she once again rejects Rumple's offer to make a home together. As she seeks a new place to stay, Hook offers for Belle to stay on the Jolly Roger in repentance for attacking her in the past. Belle forgives him and accepts, recognizing that Hook is a changed man. After making a deal with Gold, David delivers a cassette tape to Belle which plays a Scottish lullaby recorded by Rumple for their son. Soon after, Rumple casts a spell forbidding Belle to leave the boat due to a serious threat from Mr. Hyde. However, the spell puts her in danger when she cannot flee from the true threat, Dr. Jekyll. This further deteriorates Belle and Rumple's relationship, as she insists she does not need his protection and Rumple argues that she will come back to him when she needs him. When Zelena notifies Belle of Rumple's relationship with the Evil Queen (Regina's newly-separated "evil half") and his plans to use the Shears of Destiny on their son to keep him from growing to hate Rumple, Belle confronts him. She tells him to stop trying to take their son's love, but to be worthy of it instead. Belle briefly forges an alliance with Zelena in order to escape Storybrooke, but Rumple stops them before she can. In the episode "[[Changelings]]", the Evil Queen speeds up Belle's pregnancy and Belle gives birth to Gideon. She gives her son to the Blue Fairy, fearing Rumple will try to take the child as he previously threatened. But the Blue Fairy is ambushed by Rumple's mother, the Black Fairy. Gideon is taken to the Dark Realm where he grows up very quickly and develops an immoral persona. Rumple apologizes for his villainous actions and tells Belle that they need to start trusting each other in order to save their son. In the mid-season finale, an adult Gideon arrives in Storybrooke and is shown confronting his mother and father in Gold's shop.
[[File:Belle 6x22.jpg|thumb|left|Belle and Rumple finally get their "happy beginning".]]
Gideon explains to his parents that he has arrived in Storybrooke to kill the Savior and take her powers for himself in order to defeat the Black Fairy and free the Dark Realm. Belle agrees to work with Rumple in order to save their son from the darkness growing inside of him and to prevent the looming "war" in Storybrooke. Rumple and Belle later learn that Gideon has been under the control of the Black Fairy, who has stolen his heart. After Rumple secretly forges an alliance with his mother in order to retrieve Gideon's heart, he returns the heart and Gideon happily reunites with his parents. The Black Fairy then casts her curse to begin the Final Battle, which separates Belle from her husband and son and turns her into a recluse and a hermit, afraid to leave the confines of her home. This is in direct contrast to Belle's true nature and love of travel and adventure. In addition, the Black Fairy once again steals Gideon's heart and commands him to kill the Savior. To break the curse, Rumple kills the Black Fairy, and he and Belle happily reunite. Together they enter the mines to once again retrieve Gideon's heart and stop him before he can kill Emma. Upon finding the heart and considering the power he could gain from Emma's death, Rumple makes the decision to ignore his dark impulses and commands Gideon to let Emma live. The end of the Final Battle sees adult Gideon disappear and reappear to Belle and Rumple as the baby she originally gave up. Belle and Rumple celebrate their "happy beginning" together with the Charmings, Emma, Hook, Regina, and Zelena at Granny's Diner.

===Season 7===
One year after the events of the season six finale, Belle and Rumple are planning baby Gideon’s first birthday party. Rumple gives Belle a travel book and promises her that he’s going to give her what she’s always wanted: a chance to see the world. Ten years later, along their travels, Belle, Rumple, and Gideon explore an ancient bridge above a river said to grant people’s greatest wishes. Rumple reveals to Belle that he no longer wishes to have the powers of the Dark One, because he wants to live out a mortal life with her. He drops the dagger into the river, but it instantly reappears. Belle vows to help Rumple find a way to be rid of his curse forever. Eight years later, Belle, Rumple, and Gideon are living in a castle or large estate in an unspecified location. Belle and Rumple are ecstatic to discover that (a now 18-year-old) Gideon has been accepted into a prestigious academy. Belle then reveals to Rumple that she has discovered and translated a fairy prophecy, which states: “When the Dark One finds eternal love, at the sun’s brightest set, where time stops, the path will appear to where the darkness shall rest.” Rumple tells Belle that the place referred to by the prophecy is the Edge of Realms, the edge of all existence where the sun never sets and time passes differently. Belle understands at this time that “the sun’s brightest set” means her own death, but purposely withholds this information from Rumple as she knows he would do anything to prevent it. Belle decides she would rather live a long, happy life with Rumple rather than endlessly seek another answer. The two travel to the Edge of Realms and decide to build their home there without the use of magic. Many blissful years pass, as Belle ages into an elderly woman and Rumple remains immortal. On her deathbed, Belle reveals to a distraught Rumple that only by letting her go may he finally find the answer to getting rid of the Dark One curse and ultimately reunite with her in death. Rumple tells Belle that he is too afraid to let her go, but she reminds him of their timeless tale. As she passes, Belle’s final words to Rumple are: “You let me go once before, and we found our way back to each other. You’re a good man, Rumple. Your heart is pure. You will find the answer you need to get rid of the dagger, and you will find your way back to me, okay? I promise.” ("[[Beauty (Once Upon a Time)|Beauty]]")

As the season progresses, Rumple's quest to reunite with Belle seems hopeless, until the series finale "[[Leaving Storybrooke]]", in which his Dark One powers are stripped from him by The Author and he untimately sacrifices his heart to save Wish Hook. Following Rumple's death, Belle appears to him in the afterlife in her signature gold ballgown. The two kiss, as Belle says lovingly, “I knew you’d make it home.”

==Character development and reception==
The producers had planned to make the Belle only a recurring role in the series,&lt;ref name=belle&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tvguide.com/News/Once-Upon-Time-Emilie-de-Ravin-Lost-1039492.aspx | title = Exclusive: Once Upon a Time Casts Lost's Emilie de Ravin As Belle | first = Natalie | last = Abrams | work = TVGuide.com | date = 8 November 2011 | accessdate = 8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after sporadic appearances in the first season and an overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans to Belle and Rumplestiltskin's relationship, she was promoted to a series regular in the second season.&lt;ref name="series regular"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/06/19/once-upon-emilie-de-ravin/|title='Once Upon a Time' scoop: Emilie de Ravin promoted to series regular| first=James |last=Hibberd |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = 19 June 2012 | accessdate = 20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had de Ravin not accepted the role of Belle, she would've gone on to star in a television series called ''[[Americana (TV pilot)|Americana]]''; ABC decided to pass on the pilot in 2012.&lt;ref name="spoiler"&gt;[http://www.spoilertv.com/2012/06/americana-leaked-scenes-from-dropped.html Leaked scenes from dropped show, ''Americana'']; retrieved 10/29/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

de Ravin's return as Belle in the season seven episode [[Beauty (Once Upon a Time)|"Beauty"]] received widespread critical acclaim. In [http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/27/once-upon-a-time-emilie-de-ravin-belle-dead/ an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly''], de Ravin said, "I was so excited to be able to bring their story to the fans and to bring their later years in love, and to be able to play that was really beautiful. They’ve had quite a tumultuous relationship, so for them to be able to get to a place of such acceptance with each other and themselves, and with life, and this inner peace that has washed over them. […] Her acceptance of mortality is shining a lot brighter than his acceptance or non-acceptance of immortality, which you’d expect to be the reverse in a way. That’s quite beautiful and was lovely to play."

{{Distinguish|Harpocrates}}
'''Carpocrates of Alexandria''' was the founder of an early [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] sect from the first half of the 2nd century. As with many Gnostic sects, we know of the Carpocratians only through the writings of the [[Church Fathers]], principally [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]]. As these writers strongly opposed Gnostic doctrine, there is a question of negative bias when using this source. While the various references to the Carpocratians differ in some details, they agree as to the [[Libertine|libertinism]] of the sect. However, such charges were common. Pagans accused Christians of immorality, and Christians made the same charges against fellow Christians who they considered heretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Robin |last= Lane Fox |title=Pagans and Christians in the Mediterranean World from the Second Century AD to the Conversion of Constantine |authorlink= Robin Lane Fox|publisher=Penguin |location = London, UK |year=1986 |page=427 |isbn= 978-0-14-102295-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irenaeus==
The earliest and most vivid account of Carpocrates and his followers comes from [[Irenaeus]] (died 202) in his ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/carpocra.stm Irenaeus: Against Heresies (Excerpt)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040513115803/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/bible/carpocra.stm |date=May 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including an account of the theology and practice of the sect.

They believe, he writes, that [[Jesus]] was not divine; but because his soul was "steadfast and pure", he "remembered those things which he had witnessed within the sphere of the unbegotten God" (similar to [[Plato]]'s concept of [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Anamnesis]]). Because of this, Jesus was able to free himself from the material powers (what other Gnostics call [[archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]], the [[Demiurge]], etc.). Carpocratians believed they themselves could transcend the material realm, and therefore were no longer bound by [[613 Commandments|Mosaic law]], which was based on the material powers, or by any other morality, which, they held, was mere human opinion. Irenaeus offers this belief as an explanation of their licentious behaviour.

Irenaeus then goes on to provide his further, slightly different, explanation. The followers of Carpocrates, he says, believed that in order to leave this world, one's imprisoned eternal soul must pass through every possible condition of earthly life. Moreover, it is possible to do this within one lifetime. As a result, the Carpocratians did "all those things which we dare not either speak or hear of" so that when they died, they would not be compelled to incarnate again but would return to God. ([[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] depicts a fictional sect with this belief in his short story "[[The Theologians]]".)

Irenaeus says that they practised various magical arts as well as leading a licentious life. He also says that they possessed a portrait of Christ, a painting they claimed had been made by [[Pontius Pilate]] during his lifetime, which they honoured along with images of [[Plato]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Aristotle]] "in the manner of the Gentiles".

Some early Christian authors opposed representational art, and statues and portraits and sculptures are crude and stylised. According to [[Robin Lane Fox]]: "Only one group of early Christians, the heretical Carpocratians, are known to have owned portraits of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Lane Fox, pp. 392–93 &lt;/ref&gt; However, early Christian art from the early third century depicting Jesus is widespread and cannot be limited only to the Carpocratians. Furthermore, the fact that depictions of Jesus are mentioned by multiple early Christian authors, whether in a positive or negative manner, is an indication that these depictions were popular enough to be noticed and must have received the acceptance of some Christian authorities. Moreover, early Christianity was heavily influenced by Judaism, which generally forbids religious depictions, and the reluctance of some authors to accept depictions of Jesus could be ascribed to Jewish influences rather than to Christian doctrine.{{Fact|date=November 2017}}	

==Clement==
Carpocrates is also mentioned by [[Clement of Alexandria]] in his ''[[Stromateis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book3-english.html Clement’s Stromata, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt; Clement quotes extensively from ''On Righteousness'' which he says was written by [[Epiphanes (gnostic)|Epiphanes]], Carpocrates' son. No copy outside of Clement's citation exists, but the writing is of a strongly [[Antinomianism|antinomian]] bent. It claims that differences in class and the ownership of property are unnatural, and argues for property and women to be held in common. Clement confirms the licentiousness of the Carpocratians, claiming that at their [[Agape]] (meaning an early Christian gathering) they "have intercourse where they will and with whom they will".

According to Clement, Carpocrates was from [[Alexandria]] although his sect was primarily located in [[Cephallenia]].

Carpocrates is again mentioned in the controversial ''[[Mar Saba letter]]'', purportedly also by Clement of Alexandria, which [[Morton Smith]] claimed to have discovered in 1958. The letter mentions and quotes from a previously unsuspected ''[[Secret Gospel of Mark]]'', saying that Carpocrates had wheedled an opportunity to copy it in Alexandria. The letter states that a corrupted copy was circulating among Carpocrates' followers.

==Miscellaneous references==
Other references to Carpocrates exist but are likely to be based on the two already cited.

[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] writes that

{{Quote|Carpocratians derived from a native of Asia, Carpocrates, who taught his followers to perform every obscenity and every sinful act. And unless one proceeds through all of them, he said, and fulfils the will of all demons and angels, he cannot mount to the highest heaven or get by the principalities and authorities.&lt;ref name="Gnostics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Andrew P.|title=he Secret History of the Gnostics|date=2015|publisher=Watkins Media Limited|isbn=1780288832|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4FpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT73&amp;lpg=PT73&amp;dq=Carpocrates,+who+taught+his+followers+to+perform+every+obscenity+and+every+sinful+act.+And+unless+one+proceeds+through+all+of+them,+he+said,+and+fulfils+the+will+of+all+demons+and+angels,+he+cannot+mount+to+the+highest+heaven+or+get+by+the+principalities+and+authorities&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=onneEb6VYM&amp;sig=Dmx-ecQiweBfK7d_Icl3_XwpG4k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiy5aqy-XTAhVh94MKHTU6DwIQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Carpocrates%2C%20who%20taught%20his%20followers%20to%20perform%20every%20obscenity%20and%20every%20sinful%20act.%20And%20unless%20one%20proceeds%20through%20all%20of%20them%2C%20he%20said%2C%20and%20fulfils%20the%20will%20of%20all%20demons%20and%20angels%2C%20he%20cannot%20mount%20to%20the%20highest%20heaven%20or%20get%20by%20the%20principalities%20and%20authorities&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Carpocrates is also mentioned by [[Tertullian]] and [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]], both of whom seem to rely on Irenaeus; and also perhaps by [[Origen]] and [[Hegesippus (chronicler)|Hegesippus]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] mentioned them in his 1844 book, ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'':
{{Quote|It is usually said that Judaism is the standpoint of the law. However, this could also be expressed by saying that Judaism lies in anxiety. But here the nothing of anxiety signifies something other than fate. It is in this sphere that the phrase “to be [[anxiety|anxious]]-[[nothing]]” appears most paradoxical, for guilt is indeed something. Nevertheless, it is true that as long as guilt is the object of anxiety, it is nothing. The ambiguity lies in the relation, for as soon as guilt is posited, anxiety is gone, and repentance is there. The relation, as always with the relation of anxiety, is sympathetic and antipathetic. This in turn seems paradoxical, yet such is not the case, because while anxiety fears, it maintains a subtle communication with its object, cannot look away from it, indeed will not, for if the individual wills it, repentance is there. That someone or other will find this statement difficult is something I cannot help. He who has the required firmness to be, if I dare say so, a divine prosecutor, not in relation to others but in relation to himself, will not find it difficult. Furthermore, life offers sufficient phenomena in which the individual in anxiety gazes almost desirously at guilt and yet fears it. Guilt has for the eye of the spirit the fascinating power of the serpent’s glance. The truth in the Carpocratian view of attaining perfection through sin lies at this point. It has its truth in the moment of decision when the immediate spirit posits itself as spirit by spirit; contrariwise, it is blasphemy to hold that this view is to be realized in ''concreto''. It is precisely by the anxiety of guilt that Judaism is further advanced than Greek culture, and the sympathetic factor in its anxiety-relation to guilt may be recognized by the fact that it would not at any price forego this relation in order to acquire the more rash expressions of Greek culture: fate, fortune, misfortune. p. 103-104}}

[[Oxford Dictionaries]].&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-it|konsiʎˈʎɛːre|lang}}, plural ''consiglieri'') is a position within the leadership structure of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Sicilian]], [['Ndrangheta|Calabrian]] and [[American Mafia]]. The word was popularized by the novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' (1969) and [[The Godfather|its film adaptation]]. In the novel, a [[:wikt:consigliere|consigliere]] is an advisor or counselor to the [[crime boss|boss]], with the additional responsibility of representing the boss in important meetings both within the boss's crime family and with other crime families. The consigliere is a close, trusted friend and confidant, the mob's version of an elder statesman; he is an advisor to the boss in a Mafia crime family, and sometimes is his 'right-hand man'. By the very nature of the job, a consigliere is one of the few in the family who can argue with the boss, and is often tasked with challenging the boss when needed, to ensure subsequent plans are foolproof.&lt;ref name="Capeci"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1u4Ci4yM2IC&amp;q= Capeci, Jerry. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia'']. Indianapolis: Alpha Books, 2002. {{ISBN|0-02-864225-2}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In some depictions, he is devoid of ambition and dispenses disinterested advice. This passive image of the consigliere does not correspond with what little is known of real-life consiglieri, however.

A real-life Mafia consigliere is generally the number-three person in a crime family, after the boss and  [[underboss]] in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Joaquin "Jack" and Michael Levin, (2008) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=L1jTPQAACAAJ&amp;dq= Making Jack Falcone: An Undercover FBI Agent Takes Down a Mafia Family]'', p. 133. {{ISBN|1-4165-5163-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The boss, underboss, and consigliere constitute a three-man ruling panel, or "administration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsn.org/indictments/bellomo/indictment_criminal_genovese_family-2006-2-23.htm|title=Criminal RICO indictment against Genovese Crime Family|author=|date=|work=ipsn.org|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Genovese crime family]] are credited with inventing the rank of Messaggero, who is tasked with serving as a liaison between the other American Mafia families.

==Etymology==
[[File:Mafia family structure tree.en.svg|thumb|300px|Structure of a Mafia crime family]]
In Italian, ''consigliere'' means "adviser" or "counselor" and is still a common title for example for members of city councils in Italy and [[Switzerland]]. It is derived from [[Latin]] ''consiliarius'' (advisor) and ''consilium'' (advice). The terminology of the American Mafia is taken from that of the Sicilian Mafia, and suggests that an analogy is intended to imitate the court of a medieval Italian principality. For example, [[Venice]] was led by a ''[[doge]]'' ("duke") and a ''consigliere ducale'' (advisor to the doge). An underboss will normally move up to boss when the position becomes vacant, so his position is equivalent to that of heir to the throne. Consigliere, meanwhile, is analogous to chief minister or chancellor. (In the novel ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]'' the word is spelled ''consigliori''; in the films, it is clearly pronounced ''consigliere''.) [[Joe Bonanno]] explains in his book ''A Man of Honor'' that a consigliere is more the voice or representative of the soldiers of the family, and that he may help to mediate in or resolve disputes on behalf of the lower echelons of the family.

==American Mafia==
[[Joe Valachi]] mentions a mysterious "Sandino" arbitrating disputes as the [[Genovese family]] consigliere in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Maas"&gt;Maas, Peter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dzAZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sandino&amp;pgis=1#search_anchor The Valachi papers]'', p. 158. ("Sandino was a greaseball, but he had a wise head.")&lt;/ref&gt; However, consiglieri in more recent times have tended to take a more active role in family affairs. In 1971, [[Colombo family]] consigliere [[Joseph Yacovelli]] directed a murder campaign against renegade Colombo family soldier [[Joe Gallo|Joseph "Crazy Joe" Gallo]].&lt;ref name="Capeci"/&gt; Two decades later, another Colombo consigliere, [[Carmine Sessa]], led a hit team that attempted to assassinate the acting boss, [[Victor Orena]].&lt;ref name="Capeci"/&gt; [[Frank Bompensiero]] was appointed consigliere of the [[Los Angeles crime family]] in 1976, only to be murdered in a public phone booth in February 1977;&lt;ref name="Capeci"/&gt; his boss had promoted Bompensiero so as to induce him to let his guard down.&lt;ref name="Capeci"/&gt; Electronic surveillance in 1979 recorded New England Mafia boss [[Raymond L.S. Patriarca]] talking about appointing his consigliere, so the position need not be chosen as a result of a consensus-seeking process.&lt;ref name="Capeci"/&gt; When New Jersey consigliere [[Stefano Vitabile|Stefano "Steve the Truck Driver" Vitabile]] found out in 1992 that his family's underboss, [[John D'Amato|John "Johnny Boy" D'Amato]], was bisexual, he ordered him killed.&lt;ref&gt;Mannion, James, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hEegHO9kST8C&amp;printsec= 101 things you didn't know about the Mafia]'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Gulino, a drug dealer and associate of the [[Bonanno crime family]], was murdered in 1993 after he allegedly "put hands" on his family's consigliere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Mob_Hits/1993_04_update.html|title=Rick Porrello's AmericanMafia.com - Mob Hits, Misses, Disappearances, and Deaths In America|author=|date=|work=AmericanMafia.com|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Ida]], the current Genovese consigliere, has been serving a life sentence since 1996. [[Dominick Cirillo]] is the family's acting consigliere. [[Joseph Corozzo]] is the current Gambino consigliere, while [[Anthony Rabito]] is consigliere for the [[Bonanno crime family]]. As these examples illustrate, modern consiglieri are generally former soldiers and [[Caporegime|capos]], not outside advisers.

The '''Crofton Family''' is an [[Anglo-Irish]] noble family holding titles in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] and [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom|The Baronetage of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland Page 720&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baron Crofton ==
The Crofton family is divided into three main branches, all holding titles in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage p.691, 105th edition&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Crofton estate in the townland of Ballymurray in [[Co. Roscommon]] was first granted to John Crofton during the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. He was the first occupier, having been appointed [[Auditor General]] in 1584. In addition to this estate he also obtained extensive grants of lands elsewhere in the county as well as in [[Co Leitrim|Leitrim]] and [[Co Sligo|Sligo]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkes Peerage, 105th, Pg. 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1661 that a Crofton obtained a title however, when Edward Crofton became a Baronet of the Mote for services rendered to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] during the Cromwellian rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netplaces.com/irish-history/the-fight-against-the-english/the-1641-rebellion-and-its-aftermath.htm|title=The 1641 Rebellion and Its Aftermath - Irish History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is now a subsidiary title to that of Baron Crofton.

The title of [[Baron Crofton]] of the Mote is the most senior. It was created in 1797 (as Baroness Crofton) for Dame Anne Crofton. She was the widow of [[Sir Edward Crofton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Edward Crofton, 2nd Baronet, of the Mote]], who had represented Roscommon in the [[Irish House of Commons]] and had been offered a peerage just before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 1067&lt;/ref&gt; The peerage was instead bestowed upon his widow. She was succeeded by her grandson, the second Baron, who had already succeeded as fourth Baronet. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1840 to 1869 and served as a [[Lord-in-waiting]] ([[government whip]] in the [[House of Lords]]) in the three [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administrations of the [[Earl of Derby]] and in [[Benjamin Disraeli|Benjamin Disraeli's]] first government. His son, the third Baron, served as an [[Irish Representative Peer]] between 1873 and 1912 and was also [[Steward (office)|State Steward]] to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. His nephew, the fourth Baron, was an [[Irish Representative Peer]] from 1916 to 1942. Edward, 3rd baron Crofton, was a noted composer and became a Representative Peer for Ireland in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hymnary.org/person/Crofton_EH|title=Edward, Lord Crofton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 the titles are held by the latter's great-great-grandson, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2007.

== Crofton of Longford House ==
This branch is now the older male branch of the Crofton family in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage p.690, 105th edition&lt;/ref&gt; 
Edward Crofton of Longford House in the County of Sligo was granted a [[Baronetcy]] in 1661. However, this title became extinct with [[Baronetage of Ireland|Sir Oliver Crofton, 5th Bt.]] in 1780. 
The Crofton Baronetcy, of Longford House in the County of Sligo, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 18 August 1838 for Sir James Crofton. Head of the elder male branch of the family, Sir James was also a Major of the Sligo Militia and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of the [[County Sligo (UK Parliament constituency)|County]]. He was descended from Thomas Crofton, uncle of the [[Baronetage of Ireland|first Baronet]] of the 1661 creation. As of 31 January 2014 the present Baronet has not officially [[peerage law|proven his succession]] and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Official Roll of the Baronetage-Crofton&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[family seat]] remains Longford House, [[Co. Sligo]].

== Crofton of Mohill ==
The Croftons of Mohill Castle settled in Ireland in 1643 following a patent from [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leighrayment.com/|title=Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although this branch of the family was of some distinction, they remained untitled until 1801. The Crofton Baronetcy, of Mohill in the [[Co Leitrim|County of Leitrim]], was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 10 August 1801 for [[Morgan Crofton]]. The sixth Baronet was a [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] in the [[2nd Life Guards]] and fought in the [[Second Boer War]], where he was severely wounded at the [[Relief of Ladysmith]], and in the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/|title=Home - The National Archives|work=The National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; His diaries from the First World War are published as "''Massacre of the Innocents: The Crofton Diaries, Ypres 1914–1915''",2004. Another member of the family, James Crofton, grandson of Morgan Crofton, third son of the first Baronet, was a [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] in the Army. 

The family seat remains Mohill Castle, [[Co. Leitrim]].

== Property==
The total holdings of the Croftons in [[Co Roscommon]] consisted of 11,053 acres, according to the Bateman Edition of Great Landowners of Great Britain and Ireland in 1883. The size of the Mote Park estate in Ballymurray consisted of c.7000 acres. Although this was a sizeable estate, when compared with others such as the Essex properties consisting of the town of Roscommon itself and extensive lands to the north, totalling some 36,000 acres, it clearly was not the largest.

Mote Park House was built by the Crofton family in the later half of the eighteenth century, preceding the Castle of Mote erected by the family in 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/special-collections/the-crofton-memoirs/|title=The Crofton Memoirs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crofton House, (at Mote Park,shown) was clearly an imposing structure and reflects the influence of neo-classicism prevalent at this time. This style emphasizes for the first time a sense of permanence and security among the landowning class. The house was the most impressive of its type built in [[Co. Roscommon]], the others of this period being located at Runnamoat near
Ballymoe, and Sandford House in [[Castlerea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landedestates.ie/|title=Landed Estates, NUI Galway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The house was originally an irregular two-storey-over-basement house, which the architect Richard Morrison more than doubled in size by adding six bays and an extra storey. It had a deep hall with a screen of columns, beyond which a door flanked by niches led into an oval library in the bow on the garden front.
These gardens contained many fine architectural features, some of which are still intact. Perhaps the most splendid surviving feature is the original entrance gate consisting of a Doric triumphal arch surmounted by a lion with screen walls linking two identical lodge houses. In 1865 a fire destroyed the entire house at Mote Park, as another had destroyed their castle a century previously. While the house was being re-built in 1866, the family occupied the old barrack room in the farmyard. Following the death of Lord Henry, his nephew, Arthur Edward Crofton became the last of the Croftons to reside at Mote, but moved to England in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/history-heritage/big-houses-of-ireland/mote-park-house/page-of-diary/|title=Page of Diary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Laurence Lucas''' (28 December 1894 – 1 June 1967) was an English [[Classics|classical]] scholar, literary critic, poet, novelist, playwright, political polemicist, Fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]], and intelligence officer at [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II]].

He is now best remembered for his scathing 1923 review of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'The Waste Land': ''New Statesman'' review, 3 November 1923. Scan of full review, British Library: [https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/review-of-the-waste-land-by-f-l-lucas-from-the-new-statesman]. Extracts: shubow.com [http://shubow.com/blog/herr-doktor-t-s-eliot.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and for his book [[Style (book)|''Style'']] (1955; revised 1962), an acclaimed guide to recognising and writing good prose.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joseph, 'Heavy Sentences', ''[[The New Criterion]]'' [https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Heavy-sentences-7053]; Walther, Matthew, 'The Art of Writing Well', ''New English Review'' [https://www.newenglishreview.org/print.cfm?pg=custpage&amp;frm=110481&amp;sec_id=117345]&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Tragedy in Relation to Aristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|'Poetics']]'' (1927, substantially revised in 1957) was for over fifty years a standard introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/exhibits/hogarth/series.htm 'Hogarth Press', University of Delaware Library Special Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; His most important contribution to scholarship was his four-volume old-spelling ''Complete Works of [[John Webster]]'' (1927), the first collected edition of the Jacobean dramatist since that of [[William Hazlitt (registrar)|Hazlitt]] the Younger (1857), itself an inferior copy of [[Alexander Dyce|Dyce]] (1830).&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ed., ''The Complete Works of John Webster'', London, 1927; vol.1, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot called Lucas "the perfect annotator",&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S., 'John Marston' in ''Elizabethan Essays'', London, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent Webster scholars have been indebted to him, notably the editors of the new [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] Webster (1995–2007).&lt;ref&gt;Gunby, David; Carnegie, David; Hammond, Antony; DelVecchio, Doreen; Jackson, MacDonald P.: editors of ''The Works of John Webster'' (3 vols, Cambridge, 1995–2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Official History mentions "a daring and resourceful reconnaissance on the crest south of Miraumont by Lt. F. L.

F. L. ("Peter") Lucas grew up in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and was educated at [[Colfe's Grammar School|Colfe's]], where his father F. W.

H. Beardwood (London, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; was headmaster, and from 1910 at [[Rugby School|Rugby]], where he was tutored by the [[Sophocles]] scholar Robert Whitelaw (1843–1917) in his last year before retirement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb12-ms.add.8480 Robert Whitelaw, Rugby School: archiveshub.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; He won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in 1913 to read for the [[Classical Tripos]], adding the [[Pitt Scholarship]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Review'', 11 February 1914, p.283&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Porson Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Review'', 11 March 1914, p.372&lt;/ref&gt; in 1914. In January 1914 he was elected [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostle]] – the last Apostle elected before the War&lt;ref name="Skidelsky vol.1"&gt;Skidelsky, Robert, ''John Maynard Keynes: The Economist as Saviour, 1920–1937'' (London 1992), p.6&lt;/ref&gt; – coming under the influence of [[G.

L., ''The River Flows'' (London, 1926), p.170, 173&lt;/ref&gt; he volunteered, aged 19, in October 1914&lt;ref name="Paul Levy Apostles"/&gt; and was commissioned in November,&lt;ref&gt;4 November 1914,[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28965/page/9022/data.pdf ''The London Gazette'', 6 Nov. 1914: thegazette.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; serving from 1915 as second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion The [[Royal West Kent Regiment]] in France. From August 1915 he was in the Somme trenches opposite [[Fricourt]] and [[Mametz, Somme|Mametz]]; he was wounded by shrapnel in May 1916. He returned to the front as lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;Lieutenant, 17 July 1916: ''Army List, November 1917'', p.1356a [https://www.digital.nls.uk/british-military-lists/pageturner.cfm?id=104133584] [https://www.digital.nls.uk/british-military-lists/pageturner.cfm?id=104133584]&lt;/ref&gt; in January 1917, went into battle near [[Grandcourt, Somme|Grandcourt]] on 17 February in the [[Operations on the Ancre, January–March 1917|Ancre Offensive]], was mentioned in despatches on 22 February, and was gassed on 4 March. In all he spent seventeen months in war-hospitals. By September 1917 he felt that the cause of honour and justice had been lost in the lust of Victory&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'September 1917' in ''Poems, 1935'' (Cambridge, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt;  ("We were too ready to go on fighting without offering terms" &lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London 1939), p.257&lt;/ref&gt;). Passed fit for garrison duty at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]], he sought the help of fellow-Apostle [[John Maynard Keynes]] to return to France,&lt;ref name="Skidelsky vol.1"/&gt; and from August 1918 to the Armistice he was Staff lieutenant in the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] ([[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] HQ), examining German prisoners near [[Bapaume]] and [[Le Quesnoy]]. His life hung in the balance in November 1918 shortly after the Armistice, when his lung wounds reopened in the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Lucas's war memoirs are contained in his ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (1939) [pp.12-19, 38-39, 95-96, 235-236, 257-259], in ''The Greatest Problem'' (1960) [pp.26–27, 143-151], and in the final chapters of ''The River Flows'' (1926).&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Cambridge in January 1919. Fell-walking in the Lake District "on Easter morning [1919] on [[Kidsty Pike]], between Hawes Water and Hayes Water, a blinding spring sun on snowy ridge beyond ridge, from Fairfield to Blucathra, brought a moment of such ecstatic intoxication that, were I a mystic, I should have called it a mystical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem, and Other Essays'' (London, 1960), p.257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Resuming his undergraduate studies, Lucas won a Chancellor's Medal for Classics and the [[Browne medal|Browne Medal]] (1920), and revived meetings of the Apostles, suspended since 1914, becoming Society Secretary and contributing nineteen papers.&lt;ref&gt;Deacon, Richard, ''The Cambridge Apostles'' (London, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to a Fellowship at King's College in 1920 before he had completed his degree,&lt;ref name="Tillyard"/&gt; [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] paying for him to holiday in Greece with [[W. J. H. Sprott|Sebastian Sprott]] on the eve of his [[Tripos]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem'' (London, 1960), p.271&lt;/ref&gt; He took a starred [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;At that time a pass in the fifteen papers of Part I of the Classical Tripos was equivalent to a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree. Lucas proceeded to his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; and began his career as a Classics lecturer in October 1920. In the spring of 1921 he spent three months in Greece as a student of the [[British School at Athens]], researching the site of the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in [[Thessaly]] (see '''Pharsalus''' below). Back in Cambridge he switched that year&lt;ref name="Wakeman J 1975"&gt;Lucas, F. L., autobiographical essay in ''World Authors, 1950–1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth-Century Authors'', ed. John Wakeman (New York, 1975), pp.882–884&lt;/ref&gt; to teaching for the English Tripos (instituted in 1919).&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1980 p.102"&gt;Wilkinson, L. P., ''Kingsmen of a Century, 1873–1972'' (Cambridge 1980), p.102&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Cambridge University English Faculty from 1921–1939 and from 1945–1962, and a University [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in English from 1947–1962. At the invitation of [[Desmond MacCarthy]], literary editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Lucas reviewed poetry and criticism for that journal from 1922 to 1926, having begun his career as reviewer with the [[Athenaeum (British magazine)|''Athenaeum'']] in 1920–21, its last year. Early reviews and essays were collected in his ''Authors Dead and Living'' (1926). Among them was a review of Housman's ''[[Last Poems]]'' (1922)&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Few, but Roses', ''New Statesman'', 20 October 1923, p.45–47; reprinted in ''[[The Dial]]'', September 1924, Vol. LXXVII, No 3; in ''The Living Age'', 319:419; and in ''A. E. Housman: The Critical Heritage'', ed. Philip Gardner (London, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; that, unusually, met with the approval of the poet himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem, and other essays'' (London, 1960), p.191&lt;/ref&gt; His move from Classics to English and his edition of Webster (1927) were inspired in large part by [[John Tresidder Sheppard|J. T. Sheppard]]'s March 1920 [[Marlowe Society]] production of ''[[The White Devil]]'', which made a powerful impression on him: "What could make the Cambridge production of ''The White Devil'' in 1920 seem, to at least two who saw it then without preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?" he asked in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''New Statesman'', 1 March 1924&lt;/ref&gt; "[Lucas] has been lucky in finding a writer [Webster] who takes his standpoint," T. E. Lawrence remarked, "and sums up life rather in his fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, T. E., 1928 letter to E. M. Forster, in Wilson, Jeremy, &amp; Wilson, Nicole, eds., ''T. E. Lawrence, Correspondence with E. M. Forster and F. L. Lucas'' (2010), p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas' preference, however, lay with [[Comparative Literature]], and after Webster he turned to his ''Studies French and English'' (1934; revised 1950) (he was ''Membre Correspondant Honoraire de L'Institut Littéraire et Artistique de France'' &lt;ref&gt;Biographical Notes, ''The English Association, Poems of To-day: Third Series'' (London 1938), p.xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;), and later to studies of Scandinavian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F.

Lucas (London, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; He served as committee member for the [[Cambridge Greek Play]] (1921–33)&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Greek Play: ''Oresteia'' [https://www.cambridgegreekplay.com/plays/1921/Oresteia]; ''Bacchae'' [https://www.cambridgegreekplay.com/plays/1930/bacchae]; ''Oresteia'' [https://www.cambridgegreekplay.com/plays/1933/oresteia]&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to write on Greek and Latin literature. As part-time Librarian at King's (1922–36) he accessioned the donated papers of [[Rupert Brooke]]. His students at King's included [[George Rylands]], [[John Davy Hayward|John Hayward]], [[F. E. Halliday]], [[List of teachers of Malvern College|H. C. A. "Tom" Gaunt]], [[Alan Clutton-Brock]], [[Julian Bell]], [[Winton Dean]] and [[Newman Flower|Desmond Flower]]. By Cambridge English students in general he was known as "F. L.".&lt;ref&gt;[[E. M. W. Tillyard|''The Granta'', 25 January 1939, p.195]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:King's College - Gibbs' Building.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Fellows' Building, King's. Of King's Lucas wrote: "Never in my experience of half a lifetime has it declined for one moment from that tradition of humanism, tolerance, and freedom in which I believe it unsurpassed throughout the Universities of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Search for Good Sense'' (London, 1958), p.15&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following the publication of his Webster, scholars turned to him for editorial advice: he helped in the preparation of Hayward's [[Nonesuch Press|Nonesuch]] ''Donne'' (1929), Housman's ''[[More Poems]]'' (1936), [[Theodore Redpath]]'s ''Songs and Sonets of John Donne'' (1956), and Ingram and Redpath's ''Shakespeare's Sonnets'' (1964).&lt;ref group=note&gt;"F. L. Lucas ... who scrutinised almost all our edition with keen eye, saved us from some definite mistakes, and made a great number of perceptive suggestions which have vastly benefited the edition." W. G. Ingram &amp; Theodore Redpath, ''Shakespeare's Sonnets'' (London, 1964), p.xv&lt;/ref&gt; He also performed an editorial and advisory role for [[Christopher Sandford]] at the [[Golden Cockerel Press]], where he introduced [[Porson (typeface)|Victor Scholderer's New Hellenic typeface]] (1937).&lt;ref&gt;Cave, Roderick, &amp; Manson, Sarah, ''A History of the Golden Cockerel Press, 1920–1960'' (London, 2002) p.232&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his verse translations from Greek and Latin, with engravings by [[John Buckland Wright]], were published in collectors' editions by the Golden Cockerel Press and [[Folio Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Anthony, ''Checklist of the Book Illustrations of John Buckland Wright'' (London, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle years of his career he was in demand as an invitation lecturer, giving seven BBC wireless talks in 1930, on [[Dorothy Osborne]] and on the Victorian Poets, delivering the 1933 Warton Lecture on English Poetry to the [[British Academy]], lecturing at the [[Royal Institution]] on Classicism and Romanticism (1935) and at the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on travel writing (1937), and, as part of a [[British Council]] drive to counter Soviet propaganda, lecturing in German on European literature to packed halls at the British Information Centre in West Berlin in October 1948 during the [[Berlin Blockade]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'A Week of Berlin', ''Manchester Guardian'', 19 October 1948 and 20 October 1948; enlarged and reprinted in ''The Greatest Problem, and Other Essays'' (London 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years Lucas won acclaim for his translations from the classics (see '''Verse translation''' below) and for his book ''Style'' (1955). He also turned encyclopedist, contributing articles on 'Poetry', 'Epic', 'Lyric', 'Ode', 'Elegy' and 'Pastoral' to the 15-volume 1950 [[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]], among others, and serving on the editorial board of the Encyclopædia Britannica's ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' series (1952). As he told [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], who visited him in Cambridge after the War, ''Je ne lis plus; je relis'' [:I no longer read; I reread].&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, Helen, ''Nikos Kazantzakis: A Biography based on his Letters'' (Oxford, 1968), p.447&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
From February 1921 to 1929 Lucas was married to the novelist [[E. B. C. Jones]] (1893–1966), known as "Topsy" to her friends. She was the sister-in-law of his former supervisor at Trinity, [[Donald Struan Robertson|Donald Robertson]]; he got to know her after reading and admiring her first novel, ''Quiet Interior'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, E. B. C., ''Helen and Felicia'' (London, 1927), dedication&lt;/ref&gt; Jones dedicated two novels to Lucas and based two characters on him – Hugh Sexton, gassed in the War, in ''The Singing Captives'' (1922), and Oliver in ''The Wedgwood Medallion'' (1923), a Cambridge classics graduate now studying the Elizabethan drama. Lucas based the character Margaret Osborne in [[The River Flows (novel)|''The River Flows'']] (1926) on her – a semi-autobiographical first novel that shifts some of his experiences of 1919–1920 to 1913–1915. The character Hugh Fawcett ("the best brain in the Foreign Office" but not much use as a matchmaker&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The River Flows'' (London 1926), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;) was based on [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]].&lt;ref&gt;Davenport-Hines, Richard, ''Universal Man: The Seven Lives of John Maynard Keynes'' (London 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Apostles Lucas was associated with the [[Bloomsbury Group]],&lt;ref name="Jones, Peter 2006, pp.301-327"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Then I went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], and talked for some hours with Lucas, who appeared to me decidedly fascinating – though exactly why I'm blessed if I know." – [[Lytton Strachey]], May 1920, ''The Letters of Lytton Strachey'', ed.

:"The society of Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Duncan Grant, Clive and Vanessa Bell, and Lytton Strachey was far from being in the ordinary sense a happy family. They were intensely and rudely critical of each other. They were the sort of people who would read letters addressed to others. They tormented each other with endless love affairs. In real crises they could be generous, but in ordinary affairs of life they were anything but kind ... [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson|Dickinson]] and Forster were not really Bloomsbury. They were soft-hearted and kind. Bloomsbury was certainly not that."&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Wilfred, 'Some Bloomsbury Interviews and Memories', ''Twentieth Century Literature'', Vol.43, No.2 (Summer, 1997), p.190; Lucas' words as reported in Wilfred Stone's notes&lt;/ref&gt;

Regina Marler (London 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1932 Lucas married the 21-year-old [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton]] Classics graduate and sculptor Prudence Wilkinson (1911–1944). His travel writings, accounts of their long walks through landscapes with literary associations, date from the years of his second marriage (1932–1939): ''From Olympus to the Styx'' (1934), a book on their 1933 walking tour of Greece (one of five journeys he made to that country), 'Iceland', a travelogue on their 1934 journey to the [[Sagas of Icelanders|saga]] sites, included in the original edition of his ''The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal'' (1936);&lt;ref&gt;'Iceland', ''Cornhill'' magazine, Aug. 1935, reprinted in the 1936 &amp; 1937 eds. of ''The Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal''&lt;/ref&gt; and journal-entries on their visits to Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and France.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; In these years they were frequent visitors to the home in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]] of [[Charles Mauron|Marie Mauron]], whose Provençal stories Lucas translated. ''From Olympus to the Styx'' argues for the return of the [[Elgin Marbles]]:
:"Considering what was to come, the much-abused 'theft' of the sculptures from the Acropolis by Lord Elgin was an undoubted blessing, though it was carelessly carried out, especially in removing the Caryatid from the Erechtheum; it would none the less be a graceful act for England to return them now to Athens."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''From Olympus to the Styx'' (London, 1934), p.146&lt;/ref&gt;
Prudence Lucas, as well as sharing these interests, designed the costumes and sets for the first production (1938) of his Icelandic tragedy [[Laxdœla saga|''The Lovers of Gudrun'']]. Her nervous breakdown in 1938 is touched on in Lucas's ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (1939); Lucas sought help from, among others, [[Wilhelm Stekel]], whom he met in London in 1939,&lt;ref name="Lucas, F. L. 1951"/&gt; but the rift proved irreparable. The emphasis on psychology in his post-war books – ''Literature and Psychology'' (1951), ''Style'' (1955), ''The Search for Good Sense'' (1958),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neglectedbooks.com/?p=1086  ''The Search for Good Sense'', by F.

Lucas], [[The Neglected Books Page]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Art of Living'' (1959), the essay on 'Happiness' in ''The Greatest Problem'' (1960), ''The Drama of Ibsen and Strindberg'' (1962) – reflects an interest shared with his third wife (1940–1967), the Swedish psychologist Elna Kallenberg (1906-2003),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.runeberg.org/vemarvem/sthlm45/0411.html Elna Kallenberg, runeberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; whom he married in 1940 – "the stranger who came to me from beyond the sea when I most needed her"&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F.

Lucas returned time and again in his books to the theme of happiness, and in 1960 summed up his thoughts on happiness thus:
:"Vitality of mind and body; the activity to employ and maintain them; the zest and curiosity that they can animate; freedom to travel widely in nature and art, in countries of the world and countries of the mind; human affections; and the gift of gaiety – these seem to me, then, the main causes of happiness. I am surprised to find how few and simple they are."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Happiness', in ''The Greatest Problem, and Other Essays'' (London 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

F. L. Lucas lived at 7 Camden Place, Cambridge, from 1921–25; at 20 West Road, Cambridge from 1925–39; at High Mead, [[Great Brickhill]] from 1939–45; and again at 20 West Road, Cambridge, from 1945 until his death in 1967. The dissident Czech academic [[:cs:Otakar Vočadlo|Otakar Vočadlo]] (1895–1974), Lucas's Prague correspondent in 1938-39 (see '''Appeasement''' below) and a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] survivor,&lt;ref name="Otakar Vočadlo King's"&gt;[https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/finance/support/international-studentships.html Otakar Vočadlo, kings.cam.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vocadlo cz"&gt;[https://www.dva.cz/2015-02-01/vocadlo/ Otakar Vočadlo, dva.cz]&lt;/ref&gt; celebrated his restoration, during the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968, to his Chair of English at Prague, by giving a course of lectures on Webster in memory of Lucas, whose support for the Czech cause in 1938–39 had not been forgotten.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1980 p.102"/&gt;

[[D. W. Lucas]], the classical scholar (1905–85), Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, University Director of Studies in Classics, and Perceval Maitland Laurence Reader in Classics, was F. L. Lucas's brother.

==Literary criticism==

===Approach===
Except in reviews of work by contemporaries, early examples of which appear in ''Authors Dead and Living'' (1926), Lucas adopted the [[Historicism|historical and biographical approach]] to criticism and examined the views of earlier critics, whose dogmatism he was swift to rebut. He increasingly linked his studies to developments in Psychology, notably in ''Literature and Psychology'' (1951). "The real [[Lex non scripta|'unwritten laws']]," he observed, "seem to me those of human psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Art of Living'', p.165 (London, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; Centrally, he discussed the writer's psychology as revealed through style. "Even science has invented no pickle for embalming a man like ''style''," he noted.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

The poets to whom he returned most often in publications were Tennyson (1930, 1932, 1947, 1957) and Housman (1926, 1933, 1936, 1960), but he ranged widely over Classical, European and English literature. Conscious that books can influence for good or ill, he admired authors he saw as defenders of sanity and good sense – men like Montaigne and Montesquieu – or as compassionate realists, like Homer in the ''Iliad'', Euripides, Hardy, Ibsen and Chekhov. "Life is 'indivisible'," he wrote.
:"A public tends to get the literature it deserves: a literature, to get the public it deserves. The values men pursue in each, affect the other. They turn in a vicious, or a virtuous, circle. Only a fine society could have bred Homer: and he left it finer for hearing him."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Critical Thoughts in Critical Days'', London, 1942, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
His criticism, while acknowledging that morality is historically relative, was thus values-based. "Writers can make men ''feel'', not merely see, the values that endure."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Literature and Psychology'' (London, 1951), p.333&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that too many modern writers encouraged men and women to flee to unreason, decadence and barbarism, he condemned the ''[[Julien Benda|trahisons des clercs]]'' of the twentieth century,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Critical Thoughts in Critical Days'', London, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; and used his lectures and writing to campaign for a responsible use of intellectual freedom. "One may question whether real civilisation is so safely afloat," he wrote in his last published letter (1966), "that we can afford to use our pens for boring holes in the bottom of it."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., [[Revolt in the Vendée|'La Vendée']], ''Times Literary Supplement'', 12 May 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The writer or artist serving up "slapdash nightmares out of his Unconscious",&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.44, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; "in an age morbidly avid of uncivilised irreticence",&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Drama of Ibsen and Strindberg'' (London, 1962), p.314&lt;/ref&gt; not only exhibited his own neuroses, but fed neurosis in others. Literary critics, too, had to take more responsibility. "Much cant gets talked," he noted of the [[Structuralism|Structuralists]], "by critics who care more for the form and organisation of a work than for its spirit, its content, its supreme moments."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Greek Poetry for Everyman'' (London, 1951), Preface p.xvi&lt;/ref&gt; The serious note in his criticism was counterbalanced by wit and urbanity, by lively anecdote and quotation, and by a gift for startling imagery and epigram.

What Lucas wrote about Housman's ''Name and Nature of Poetry'' in 1933 (though he contested some of its ideas) sums up what he himself aspired to as a literary critic: "… the kind of critical writing that best justifies itself before the brevity of life; that itself adds new data to our experience as well as arguing about the old; that happily combines, in a word, philosophy with autobiography, psychology with a touch of poetry – of the ‘poetic’ imagination. It can make acceptable even common sense. There are sentences here which recall the clear-cut Doric strength of the ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets|Lives of the Poets]]'' ..."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Poetry Examined by Professor Housman', ''Cambridge Review'', 8 June 1933, p.469&lt;/ref&gt;

His Cambridge colleague [[T. R. Henn]] noted that Lucas's approach and style were influenced by the [[Lytton Strachey|Strachey]] of ''Books and Characters'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;Henn, T.R., review of ''Authors Dead and Living'', ''The Cambridge Review'', 21 May 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Lucas's impatience with the "obscurantism" and coterie-appeal of much modern poetry made him in the interwar years one of the foremost opponents of the new schools. "As for 'profundity'," he wrote, "it is not uncommonly found also in dry wells; which may likewise contain little but obscurity and rubbish."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Cambridge Review'', 24 May 1958, p.576&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed also what he saw as the narrow dogmatism of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]], those "tight-lipped Calvins of art",&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; as he called them, of ''[[The Criterion (magazine)|Criterion]]'' and ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]''. Discussions of [[I. A. Richards]]'s criticism appear in his essay 'English Literature' in the volume ''University Studies: Cambridge 1933'' &lt;ref&gt;Wright, Harold, ed., ''University Studies: Cambridge 1933'' (London, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; and in Chapter 4 of his ''Decline and Fall of the Romantic Ideal'' (1936), and of Eliot's in the 1929 essay 'Modern Criticism',&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Criticism', ''[[Life and Letters]]'' Nov. 1929&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted in his ''Studies French and English'' (1934). An anonymous ''[[New Statesman]]'' review (29 December 1928) of Eliot's criticism, however, to which [[F. R. Leavis]] replied&lt;ref&gt;Leavis, F. R., 'T. S. Eliot: A Reply to the Condescending', ''Cambridge Review'', 8 February 1929&lt;/ref&gt; apparently believing it was by Lucas, and which Leavis's biographer says "was certainly by Lucas",&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, Ian, ''F. R. Leavis: A Life in Criticism'', p.103 (Harmondsworth, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; was in fact by Richard Ellis Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Mind: Ninety Years of The Cambridge Review'', eds.

He returned, briefly, for two signed reviews of authors he found congenial, [[Robert Browning|Browning]] (22 Nov. 1928) and [[Thomas Lovell Beddoes|Beddoes]] (10 Dec. 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; His critique of [[Q. D. Leavis]]'s ''Fiction and the Reading Public'' (1932) in ''University Studies: Cambridge 1933'' was described by F. R. Leavis's biographer as "improper": "senior academics do not use quasi-official publications to attack graduate students".&lt;ref&gt;MacKillop, Ian, ''F. R. Leavis: A Life in Criticism'', p.196 (Harmondsworth, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; (The volume, though printed by the [[Cambridge University Press|University Press]], was not published there; its editor stressed that the contributions were "unofficial" glimpses into the "intense mental activity" of each Cambridge department;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Harold, ed., ''University Studies: Cambridge 1933'', Introduction p.ix (London, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; and published theses are not normally considered exempt from criticism.)

===Lucas and Eliot===
Lucas's 1923 review of ''The Waste Land'', much reprinted in the decades since his death,&lt;ref&gt;''T. S. Eliot: 'The Waste Land', A Casebook,'' ed. C. B. Cox and Arnold Hinchliffe (London, 1968, Nashville, 1970); ''T. S. Eliot: The Critical Heritage,'' ed. Michael Grant (London, 1982); ''T. S. Eliot:  The Contemporary Reviews,'' ed. Jewel Spears Brooker (Cambridge, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; was omitted from his ''Authors Dead and Living'' (1926), a collection of ''New Statesman'' pieces, probably because he had ended by saying the poem should be left to sink. Remarks elsewhere confirm that he had not changed his opinion.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Sentences repeating opinions from the ''Waste Land'' review appear in 'The Progress of Poetry' (''Authors Dead and Living'', p.286) and ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'', p.172&lt;/ref&gt; Described by [[F. W. Bateson]] as "brilliantly wrong-headed",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Review of English Studies]]'', Vol.14, 1938 (no.54, April), p.233&lt;/ref&gt; the review is better known today than it was during Lucas's lifetime. His only other comment on the poem occurs in his essay 'English Literature' in the volume ''University Studies: Cambridge 1933'',&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Harold, ed., ''University Studies: Cambridge 1933'' (London, 1933), p.272&lt;/ref&gt; where he contested [[I. A. Richards]]' view of it in ''Science and Poetry'' (1926): "''The Waste Land'' is praised [by Richards] for its 'complete severence' from '''all'' beliefs', when it is really a yearning cry for them, and at its close some sort of faith is so clearly impending that it has been praised by others as a great religious poem (such are the triumphs of obscurity)." ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'' &lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Valerie: Haughton, Hugh: Haffenden, John; eds., ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'' (London 2012, 2013), vols. 3&amp;4&lt;/ref&gt; includes correspondence between Eliot and Lucas but no reference to the review. Historians of ''The New Statesman'' have regretted that [[Desmond MacCarthy]] invited Lucas to review modern poetry, one of them declaring Lucas "a disastrous choice" for a ''Waste Land'' review.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Adrian, '' 'The New Statesman': Portrait of a Political Weekly, 1913-1931'' (London 1996), p.206&lt;/ref&gt; (Disastrous, that is, for the journal's avant-garde image.) After 1923, though attacking obscurantism in general terms, Lucas largely ignored Eliot's poetry, aside from a retrospective dig in 1942 at 'The Hollow Men' ("hollow men whimpering under prickly pear trees, conceited still amid their grovellings because a prickly pear remains an exotic and highly intellectual plant" &lt;ref name="Lucas, F. L. 1942 p.45"&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Critical Thoughts in Critical Days'' (London, 1942), p.45&lt;/ref&gt;) and at 'Sweeney among the Nightingales' ("the nightingales of Aeschylus now exhibit to a ravished public their 'droppings'; for to the sewer all things are sewer" &lt;ref name="Lucas, F. L. 1942 p.45"/&gt;). On the later Eliot he was silent. He had no time for mystical poetry, regarding religion as an aberration of the human mind.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1967"/&gt;

In 1928 Lucas had been stung by Eliot's review in the [[The Times Literary Supplement|''Times Literary Supplement'']] criticising aspects of the Introduction to his ''Webster''.&lt;ref&gt;'John Webster', ''Times Literary Supplement'', 26 Jan. 1928, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; He replied vigorously in the same journal,&lt;ref&gt;'John Webster', ''Times Literary Supplement'', 2 Feb. 1928&lt;/ref&gt; only to find Eliot extending his criticisms in another review in [[The Criterion (magazine)|''The Criterion'']].&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S., 'Mr Lucas's ''Webster'' ', ''The Criterion'', June 1928, pp.155-158&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas counter-attacked in his 1929 essay 'Modern Criticism',&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Criticism', ''[[Life and Letters]]'' Nov. 1929, reprinted in his ''Studies French and English'' (1934)&lt;/ref&gt; ridiculing Eliot's literary-critical [[Obiter dictum|''obiter dicta'']] and hieratic tone. In later impressions of his essays, Eliot made minor changes or added clarifications to sentences Lucas had ridiculed, and praised the textual and historical scholarship of the 1927 ''Webster''. Lucas left the Introduction out of his 1958 revised editions of the two major plays, but demand for the unabridged 1927 ''Webster'' continued, and it was reprinted on both sides of the Atlantic in 1966.

===Reputation===
Lucas's standing as a literary critic was probably at its highest in the 1930s. "In three respects," wrote the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' in 1934, "Lucas rises pre-eminent from the crowd of contemporary critics: in his care for style, for dignity and grace in his method of presentment: in his learning in the literature of several languages: and in the balance, the sanity of his judgment."&lt;ref&gt;''Times Literary Supplement'', review of ''Studies French and English'', 22 February 1934, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Post-war, reviewers were often more hostile.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1980"&gt;Wilkinson, L. P., ''Kingsmen of a Century, 1873–1972'' (Cambridge 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Anthony Thwaite]] (1958), G. D. Klingopulos (10 April 1959), and [[Bernard Bergonzi]] (24 June 1960) in ''[[The Spectator]]'' ; John Raymond (1 March 1958), [[Walter Allen]] (16 July 1960), and [[M. C. Bradbrook]] (8 June 1962) in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Many post-war reviews amounted to reprisals by the Leavisite camp: "There is an air of breezy Bloomsbury superficiality and cultural omniscience about this book that is distressing," wrote one. "His is the type of over-cultivated fuddy-duddy mind that has done – and is doing – great damage to our whole culture in general and to literary appreciation in particular."&lt;ref&gt;John Raymond, ''[[New Statesman]]'', 1 March 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Probably because, [[psychoanalytic literary criticism]] aside, Lucas scorned most new trends – he described the critical theory of the 1950s as "largely pseudo-scientific bubble-blowing"&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'The Menace of Science to the Humanities' in ''The Greatest Problem, and Other Essays'' (London, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; – his criticism has long been out of fashion and is mostly out of print.

Lucas dedicated much of his time to making classical (mainly Greek) poetry accessible to modern readers through verse translations. His companion volumes ''Greek Poetry for Everyman'' (1951) and ''Greek Drama for Everyman'' (1954) contain some 20,000 lines. No single translator had attempted before to bring together in homogeneous volumes so much of the best of Greek poetry from Homer to the 6th century A.D., with the introductions and notes needed by the non-classicist. The translations were praised for their grace and fidelity – "the sense and the imagery are minutely reproduced" ([[Classical Association|''The Classical Review'']] )&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, G. S., ''The Classical Review'', Dec. 1952&lt;/ref&gt; – and were hailed by the press as Cambridge's single-handed answer to the [collaborative] ''Oxford Book of Greek Verse in Translation''.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Raymond, ''Sunday Times'', Jan.1951; Garrod, H. W., ''The Spectator'', 6 January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas's versions, however, presuppose a taste for a poetic style closer to [[William Morris|Morris]] than to Pound. Reviewers generally preferred his translations of lyric, Alexandrian and later poetry to the 7,000 rhymed lines from Homer, which were omitted from the second edition ([[Everyman Library]], 1966). "Lucas makes the plays deceptively easy to read and appreciate," wrote a reviewer of the second volume,&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, R. M. H., ''Phoenix'', Vol.12, No.4 (Winter 1958), pp.189–193&lt;/ref&gt; "by smoothing away the austerities and complexities of the Greek – qualities which some modernists conscientiously preserve or even exaggerate." The translation of [[Hippolytus (play)|''Hippolytus'']] remains in print in the [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] selection, ''Eight Great Tragedies'', ed. [[Sylvan Barnet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin.ca/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780452011724,00.html?sym=TAB Barnet, Sylvan (ed.), ''Eight Great Tragedies'' (Toronto)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original writing==

===Novels===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:F L Lucas, River Flows - wrapper.jpg|thumb|right|200px|First edition wrapper of ''The River Flows'', 1926, listed as "unknown" in ''A Checklist of the Hogarth Press, 1917-38'' by J. Howard Woolmer and Mary E. Gaither (London 1976)]] --&gt;
Of Lucas's novels the best received was [[Cécile (novel)|''Cécile'']] (1930), a tale of love, society and politics in the France of 1775–1776. Lucas dedicated the book to [[T. E. Lawrence]], a friend and admirer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castlehillpress.com/publications/2010_forster_prospectus.shtml ''T. E. Lawrence Studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.356-7&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote two further historical novels, ''[[Doctor Dido]]'' (1938), set in Cambridge in 1792–1812, and [[Battle of Bailén|''The English Agent: A Tale of the Peninsular War'']] (1969), set in Spain in 1808; and a novella, ''[[The Woman Clothed with the Sun]]'' (1937), on the [[Buchanites]] of the 1780s–90s. The three novels focus on a love-affair between an Englishman and a Frenchwoman (Lucas was a self-confessed ''gallomane''&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, ''Style'' (1955), Preface&lt;/ref&gt;); the Scots novella takes the form of an account, written by a Scottish minister in middle age, of his youthful bewitchment by [[Elspeth Buchan]] and of his curious sojourn among the Buchanites. A theme common to all four is the tension between fragile [[Age of Enlightenment|18th-century rationalism]] and, in varying forms, [[Romanticism|Romantic]] "enthusiasm" and unreason. For his semi-autobiographical first novel, [[The River Flows (novel)|''The River Flows'']] (1926), see '''Personal Life''' above.

===Poems===
As a poet Lucas was a polished ironist. Early collections (''Time and Memory'', 1929, ''Marionettes'', 1930, ''Poems, 1935'') were mostly personal lyrics or satires, but he came to specialise in dramatic monologues and narrative poems based on historical episodes "that seem lastingly alive" (''From Many Times and Lands'', 1953).&lt;ref&gt;"I try to find episodes in history that seem lastingly alive: and try to make them live on paper" (Lucas, ''Journal'' [1939], p.229)&lt;/ref&gt; His First World War poems, including [[Cheshire Regiment|'''Morituri'' – August 1915, on the road from Morlancourt']] (1935) and (below) ' "The Night is Chilly but not Dark" ' (1935), offer a retrospect of his experiences at the front.

:On nights when the moon creeps shrouded up the sky
:And hedge and holt lie glimmering ghostly grey,
:A voice still whispers in me, far away –
:''A good night, this, for wiring'' – and suddenly
:There rises from the dead that shadowy hell,
:The barbed-wire rasps, uncoiling through my hand,
:The flares dance flickering over no-man's-land,
:A dull machine-gun raps from La Boisselle.
:Then fades the phantom, and once more I know
:Our spider-webs of wire are rust by now,
:Our battlefields reconquered by the plough,
:And hands that worked with mine, dust long ago.

The inclusion of 'Beleaguered Cities' (1929) in various mid-twentieth century anthologies of English verse made it probably Lucas's best-known poem.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Beleaguered Cities' in ''Time and Memory'' (London, 1929); reprinted in ''Poems of Our Time'', ed. Richard Church and Mildred Bozman (London, 1945, 1959 [Everyman Library]); poemspictures.blogspot.com [http://poemspictures.blogspot.com/2006/05/beleagured-cities-by-fl-lucas-1894.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Others that have gained currency through anthologies include 'The Destined Hour' (1953), a re-telling in verse of the old [[Samarra|'appointment in Samarra']] fable,&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'The Destined Hour' in ''From Many Times and Lands'' (London, 1953); reprinted in ''Every Poem Tells a Story: A Collection of Stories in Verse'', ed. Raymond Wilson (London, 1988; {{ISBN|0-670-82086-5}} / 0-670-82086-5); www.funtrivia.com [http://www.funtrivia.com/bb.cfm?action=details&amp;qnid=17406&amp;boardid=19&amp;start=20]&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Spain 1809', the story of a village woman's courage during the French occupation in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Spain 1809' in ''From Many Times and Lands'' (London, 1953); reprinted in ''The Harrap Book of Modern Verse'', ed. Maurice Wollman and Kathleen Parker (London, 1958), and in ''The Penguin Book of Narrative Verse'', ed. David Herbert (Harmondsworth, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; His most ambitious poem was [[Ariadne (poem)|''Ariadne'']] (1932), an epic re-working of the [[Labyrinth]] myth, extracts from which were read on the [[BBC Home Service]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Passages from 'Ariadne' by F. L. Lucas, read by Nesta Sawyer, 6 Sept. 1934: [https://www.genome.ch.bbc.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Tidworth in ''The Quest for Theseus'' summarises: "Lucas invents another sweetheart for [[Theseus]], Aegle, one of the sacrificial maidens who accompany him to Crete.  The real stroke of originality is to make the Minotaur Minos himself in a bull-mask.  On Naxos [[Ariadne]] learns of Theseus's earlier love for Aegle, and decides to leave him while the image of her own love is still fresh. An ordinary love-affair is not what she wants; she has to seek the Ideal [Dionysus]." &lt;ref&gt;Tidworth, Simon, ''The Quest for Theseus'', ed. Anne Ward (London, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
Lucas's most successful play was the thriller [[Land's End (play)|''Land's End'']],&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Four Plays'' (Cambridge, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt; set in Cornwall in the mid-1930s ([[Westminster Theatre]], February–March 1938, 29 performances, with [[Cathleen Nesbitt]], [[Cecil Trouncer]] and [[Alan Napier]] among the cast) – "as full of drama as an egg is full of meat", noted ''[[The Stage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stage]]'', 3 March 1938; p.10&lt;/ref&gt; One of [[Paul Scofield]]'s earliest roles was in the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Birmingham Rep]]'s revival of the play in March–April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cms.birmingham-rep.co.uk/rep100/3253 ''Land's End'' at the Birmingham Rep, birmingham-rep.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas's radio play ''The Siren'' was first broadcast on the [[BBC Third Programme]] in 1948, with [[Catherine Lacey]], [[Frith Banbury]] and [[Deryck Guyler]] in the cast;&lt;ref&gt;''The Siren'' by F. L. Lucas, BBC Third Programme, 19 &amp; 21 Jan. 1948, genome.ch.bbc.co.uk [https://www.genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/2bb29082ba214e89a947f9980e59c995]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.suttonelms.org.uk/r3-1948.html Third Programme, Drama, 1948: suttonelms.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; a second production followed on the [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] in 1949, with [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Hugh Burden]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Siren'' by F.

His political drama [[The Bear Dances|''The Bear Dances: A Play in Three Acts'']] was the first dramatisation of the Soviets on London’s [[West End theatre|West-end stage]] ([[Garrick Theatre]], 1932, with [[Elena Miramova]], [[Abraham Sofaer]] and [[Olga Lindo]]). This play, though it closed early in London, was revived by various repertory theatres in the North of England in the later 1930s. It was an attempt at ideological disinfectant, written at a time when Cambridge University (in Lucas's words) "grew full of very green young men going very Red".&lt;ref name="Wakeman J 1975"/&gt;

==History, politics and society==

===Pharsalus===
Outside literature, Lucas is remembered for his solution to one of the more contentious problems of ancient topography. His "north-bank" thesis&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'The Battlefield of Pharsalos ', ''Annual of the British School at Athens'', No. XXIV, 1919–21 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30102514?seq=1]&lt;/ref&gt; on the location of the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] (48 B.C.), based on his 1921 solo field-trip to Thessaly and on a re-examination of the sources, dismissed a dozen previous theories and is now widely accepted by historians.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, T. Rice, ''The Roman Republic and the Founder of the Empire'' (Oxford, 1923); Fuller, J. F. C., ''Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier and Tyrant'' (London, 1965); Sheppard, Simon, ''Pharsalus 48 B.C.: Caesar and Pompey – Clash of the Titans'' (Oxford, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  John D. Morgan in his definitive 'Palae-pharsalus – the Battle and the Town'&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, John D., ''The American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 87, No. 1, Jan. 1983&lt;/ref&gt; writes:  "My reconstruction is similar to Lucas’s, and in fact I borrow one of his alternatives for the line of the Pompeian retreat. Lucas’s theory has been subjected to many criticisms, but has remained essentially unshaken."

===Appeasement===
{{rquote|right|
Are our minds clear, or are we drifting foggily into another 1914? It was because England hedged then, that we all but perished in the ditch beyond.
| F. L. Lucas, ''The Week-end Review'', 16 Sept. 1933 
}}
In the 1930s Lucas was widely known for his political letters to the British Press with their outspoken attacks on the policy that came to be known as [[appeasement]]. Following the inaction of the [[League of Nations|League]] over [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Manchuria]], he called repeatedly for "a League within the League", of nations pledged to uphold international law and oppose aggression. "Since the War," he wrote in 1933, "British policy has been shuffling, timid, ignoble."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., letter, ''The Week-end Review'', 21 October 1933&lt;/ref&gt; Having read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in the unexpurgated original and taken its threats as a statement of intent, he urged in September 1933 that Nazi Germany be prevented from re-arming. "[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] was monstrous", he wrote in ''The Week-end Review'',
:"but one thing surely comes first: Germany must not be allowed to re-arm. How prevent it? By an international police-force?  It would be ideal. Unfortunately it does not exist. The French have urged it. We in our muddle-headedness want neither it nor the alternative – war. Are we prepared to see France do its work instead and take action in Germany? – or are we going to sit sanctimoniously on the fence, disapproving, but secretly relieved? I devoutly hope the first. Germany must not re-arm; even if the French had to invade it once every five years, that would be better than the alternative."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., letter, ''The Week-end Review'', 16 September 1933&lt;/ref&gt;
A hatred of war, he argued in 1936, "can be no reason for being false to ourselves, in the name of an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., letter, ''Cambridge Review'', 14 February 1936&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1937: "We have not kept agreements we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., letter, ''Manchester Guardian'', 6 September 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the prevailing [[pacifism]] of the time – and he exchanged views with "passive pacifists" in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. "This is the voice of the England I love," wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Lucas's Prague correspondent was Otakar Vočadlo (1895-1974).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Otakar Vočadlo King's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vocadlo cz"/&gt; "and for whose soul I was trembling when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich."&lt;ref&gt;Letter in reply to Lucas's 'The Munich Agreement–and after', ''Manchester Guardian'', 4 October 1938; quoted in Lucas, ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement ''[[The Times|Times]]'' refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as "an annexe of the German embassy"&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London 1939), p.308&lt;/ref&gt;), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of [[Abyssinia Crisis|Abyssinia]] and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from [[Ezra Pound]]. Lucas put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition.

As well as letters to the press (some forty in all) his campaign included satires, articles, books, public speaking, fund-raising for the [[British Red Cross|Red Cross]], petitions to Parliament, meetings with émigrés like [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]] and [[Stefan Zweig]], and help for refugees. In these activities he was inspired by the example of "that grand old man"&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L.,  ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.265&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. W. Nevinson]], "one of the most striking personalities I have ever known",&lt;ref name="Lucas, F. L. 1951"&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Literature and Psychology'' (London, 1951), Preface&lt;/ref&gt; "whose long life has been given to Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., dedication to ''The Delights of Dictatorship'' (Cambridge, 1938)&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that future readers would be interested in what it had been like to live through such times, Lucas kept and published in March 1939 a
diary for 1938, ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938''. (The "high source" he refers to in ''Journal'' was probably [[Harold Nicolson]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.310&lt;/ref&gt;) ''Journal'' is notable for its candid remarks on pro-Nazi and pro-appeasement figures in the British Establishment. Of Chamberlain at [[Munich Agreement|Munich]] he wrote (30 September):
:"Even if what he did were the right thing to do, this was not the way to do it."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., Letter, ''Manchester Guardian'', 4 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt; "The surrender ''might'' have been necessary: the cant was not. Any statesman with a sense of honour would at least have stilled that hysterical cheering and said: ''My friends, for the present, we are out of danger. But remember that others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling.'' But this Chamberlain comes home beaming as fatuously as some country-cousin whom a couple of card-sharpers in the train have just allowed to win sixpence, to encourage him."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.277&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome he feared was an Anglo-German peace agreement – an accord between Nazis and the British Establishment: "One day a little note from [[Berghof (residence)|Berchtesgaden]] will appoint [[Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 7th Marquess of Londonderry|Lord Londonderry]] to 10 Downing Street. And that will settle everything."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., Letter, ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London, 1939), p.146&lt;/ref&gt; Though he welcomed the Government's about-turn on appeasement in March 1939, he doubted the genuineness of the conversion. "The noble lords of our Fifth Column still go marching on."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Journal Under the Terror, 1938'' (London 1939), Note, March 1939&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Nazis had noted Lucas's letters. In August 1939 he received a reply from [[Goebbels]], advising him to heed public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., letter, ''Manchester Guardian'', Tuesday, 15 August 1939&lt;/ref&gt; As a leading anti-fascist campaigner, he was placed by the Nazis on their [[The Black Book|''Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.'']] [:''Special Search List G.B.''] of Britons to be arrested and liquidated.

===Bletchley Park===
[[File:F L Lucas Bletchley Park letter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1939 Lucas letter from 'Room 47, Foreign Office' [:Bletchley Park], throwing a correspondent off the scent.]]
A brilliant linguist&lt;ref name=Tillyard&gt;Tillyard, E. M. W., ''The Muse Unchained'' (London, 1958), p.80&lt;/ref&gt; with infantry and [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] experience from 1914–18, proven anti-fascist credentials and a scepticism about the Soviet Union, Lucas was one of the first academics recruited by the Foreign Office – on 3 September 1939 – to [[Bletchley Park]]. He was one of the original four members of [[Hut 3]], whose organisation he set up,&lt;ref name="rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk"&gt;[https://www.rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk rollofhonour.bletchleypark]&lt;/ref&gt; and from March to July 1942, when the Hut was run by committee, acting head.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa, ''Secret Days: Code-breaking in Bletchley Park'' (London 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a central figure there, working throughout the war on the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] decodes as translator, intelligence-analyst and (from July 1942) head of the Research Section, ''3G'' [:Hut 3 General Intelligence], on the busy 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. shift.&lt;ref name="Smith, Michael 2011"&gt;Smith, Michael, ''The Secrets of Station X'' (London, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinsley and Stripp 2001"&gt;Hinsley, F. H. and Stripp, Alan, eds., ''Code-breakers : The Inside Story of Bletchley Park'' (Oxford, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; His main activities in ''3G'' were cracking Axis covernames and covernumbers in decodes, analysing German "proformas" (supplies and ammunition returns), and writing general intelligence papers.&lt;ref name="Jackson, John 2002 pp.77-78"&gt;Jackson, John, ed., ''The Secret War of Hut 3'' [based on [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] documents HW3/119 &amp; HW3/120] (Military Press, Milton Keynes, 2002), pp.77-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annan, Noel, ''Changing Enemies: The Defeat and Regeneration of Germany'' (London, 1995): nytimes.com [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/a/annan-enemies.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the intelligence-reports he produced was a study of Hitler's intentions in the east in May 1941, which contrasted with the Foreign Office view that the Germans were just "building up pressure [on the U.S.S.R.] to extract more raw materials".&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Millward, William, 'Life in and out of Hut 3' in ''Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park'', eds. F. H. Hinsley &amp; Alan Strip (Oxford 1993), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; "It becomes harder than ever to doubt," Lucas wrote,
:"that the object of these large movements of the German Army and Air Force is Russia. From rail movements towards Moldavia in the south to ship movements towards Varanger fjord in the far north there is everywhere the same eastward trend. Either the purpose is blackmail or it is war. No doubt Hitler would prefer a bloodless surrender. But the quiet move, for instance, of a prisoner-of-war cage to Tarnow looks more like business than bluff."&lt;ref&gt;The National Archives PRO HW 1/3; Smith, Michael, ''The Secrets of Station X'' (London, 2011), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Lucas papers ranged from practical suggestions, such as the proposal that the Salonica-Athens railway be cut in the [[Mount Oeta|Oeta]] gorges viaducts (carried out in [[Operation Harling]]), to psychological overviews later in the war, like 'Hitler as seen by Source' [:through decodes] and 'German Morale as seen by Source' (his old special subject from 1918 Intelligence Corps days).&lt;ref name="Jackson, John 2002 pp.77-78"/&gt;

[[File:"Hut 3", Bletchley Park - geograph.org.uk - 1592920.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hut 3, Bletchley Park, in 2009 (photo: Ian Petticrew)]]
He also wrote confidential Special Reports for the Bletchley Park Director-General, one on Second Front rumours in German signals, and another, with [[Peter Calvocoressi]], in early 1945 on the failure of Allied intelligence to foresee the [[Battle of the Bulge|German counter-offensive through the Ardennes]] in December 1944. Lucas and Calvocoressi concluded that "the costly reverse might have been avoided if Ultra had been more carefully considered".&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley]]'s words, in ''Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park'', eds. F. H. Hinsley &amp; Alan Strip (Oxford 1993), p.11&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, Hut 3 had grown "shy of going beyond its job of amending and explaining German messages", believing that "drawing broad conclusions was for the intelligence staff at SHAEF, who had information from all sources", including aerial reconnaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi to [[Neil Leslie Webster]], in Pearson, Joss ed. ''Neil Webster's Cribs for Victory: The Untold Story of Bletchley Park's Secret Room'' (2011), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; E. J. N. Rose, head Air Adviser in Hut 3, read the paper at the time and described it in 1998 as "an extremely good report" that "showed the failure of intelligence at SHAEF and at the Air Ministry".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael, ''The Secrets of Station X'' (London, 2011), p.272&lt;/ref&gt; The report is not known to have survived. It was probably the "Top Secret [intelligence] digest", a post-mortem on that failure, referred to by [[Kenneth Strong|General Strong]] (1968), "both record-copies of which were destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, K. W. D., ''Intelligence at the Top: the recollections of an Intelligence Officer'' (London, 1968), p.175-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Ralph, ''Ultra in the West'' (London, 1979), p.179&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas and Calvocoressi "expected heads to roll at Eisenhower's HQ, but they did no more than wobble".&lt;ref&gt;Calvocoressi, Peter, ''Top Secret Ultra'' (London 1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Peter Calvocoressi: Political writer who served at Bletchley Park and assisted at the Nuremberg trials', independent.co.uk [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-calvocoressi-political-writer-who-served-at-bletchley-park-and-assisted-at-the-nuremberg-trials-1905181.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most "exciting" work he did at Bletchley Park, he recalled, was handling operational signals on Axis convoys to North Africa from July 1941 and deducing convoys' routes using decrypts, maps, pins and pieces of string.&lt;ref&gt;'History of Hut 3', Public Records Office documents, ref. HW3/119 and /120; Smith, Michael, ''Station X: The Codebreakers of Bletchley Park'' (London, 1998); Smith, Michael, ''The Secrets of Station X'' (London, 2011), p.195&lt;/ref&gt; The high standards of accuracy and clarity that prevailed in Hut 3, his chief maintained, were "largely due to [Lucas's] being such a stickler" for them.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1967 p.21"&gt;Wilkinson, L. P., 'F. L. Lucas' in King's College Report, November 1967, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In out-of-hut hours Major Lucas was Officer Commanding the Bletchley Park [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]], a "rabble of egg-heads" that he turned, contrary to stereotype, into an efficient unit that outwitted the local regular forces in military exercises.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, L. P. 1967 p.21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinsley and Stripp 2001"/&gt; From June 1945 to the end of the War he was head of the Hut 3 History Section, compiling a 'History of Hut 3', now documents HW3/119 and HW3/120 in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]].&lt;ref name="rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk"/&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1946 for his wartime work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37412/supplement/281 The London Gazette Publication date: 28 December 1945 Supplement: 37412 Page: 281]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Non-Intelligence-specific reflections on his wartime years and work at Bletchley Park are contained in ''The Greatest Problem'' (London 1960) [pp.43, 117, 151, 270–271, 278] and in the autobiographical essay in ''World Authors, 1950–1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth-Century Authors'', ed. John Wakeman (New York 1975) [pp.882-884].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
In later years Lucas took up the cause of population-control, "a problem not talked about nearly enough", discussing the dangers of world [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] in ''The Greatest Problem'' (1960). Having laid out the statistics to 1959 and future projections, he argued that the "reckless proliferation" of ''homo sapiens'', as well as impoverishing the world by environmental damage and species-extinctions, would be damaging to the individual and to society:
:"The finest human qualities are endangered, because the size of populations increases, and ought to be diminished; the size of states increases, and ought to be diminished; the size of cities increases, and ought to be diminished. Vast communities lead to small individuals; and the real worth of any community lies in the worth of its individuals... The individual comes to feel himself a mere drop in the ocean; and feeling impotent, he grows irresponsible... Vast democracies cannot keep the virtues of democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem, and Other Essay'' (London, 1960), p.321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Art of Living'' (London 1959), p.176-7&lt;/ref&gt;

If population-growth went unchecked, he felt, "the damage to national efficiency might drive governments to act more intelligently";&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem, and Other Essay'' (London 1960), p.326&lt;/ref&gt; but better would be "a concentrated drive for population-planning, despite the formidable practical, scientific and psychological obstacles". "Far more, however," he added, "depends on the individual and his power to realise his own plight. Hence the need for constant and frank discussion, instead of leaving the subject, as now, in a conspiracy of uneasy silence; and the need for patient and tireless propaganda against man's reckless propagation."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem'' (London, 1960), p.330-331&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Axiom'''

"The more populous the world and the more intricate its structure, the greater must be its fundamental insecurity. A world-structure too elaborately scientific, if once disrupted by war, revolution, natural cataclysm or epidemic, might collapse into a chaos not easily rebuilt."&lt;br /&gt;
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | ― F. L. Lucas, ''The Greatest Problem'' (1960), p.&amp;nbsp;319-320
|}

He singled out the [[Holy See|Vatican]] for particular criticism. "Common sense percolates," he had written in 1934, "despite the Roman Church; which with its half-cynical sense of reality will doubtless end by swallowing the inevitable, as with Copernicus and Darwin, and evolve some doctrine of Immaculate Contraception."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''From Olympus to the Styx'' (London, 1934), p.254&lt;/ref&gt; He later pointed out the illogicality of the doctrine declaring it lawful to juggle with the [[Calendar-based contraceptive methods|calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;''Moral Questions Affecting Married Life'': Addresses given 29 October 1951 to the Italian Catholic Union of midwives, and 26 November 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, DC [https://www.(ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P511029.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise unlawful to practise [[Christian views on contraception|contraception]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem'' (London, 1960), p.329&lt;/ref&gt;

He was not optimistic about post-war immigration to the UK, believing that in the modern world the problem of over-breeding was not solved by migration, which in turn could bring new social problems. "Persons of liberal principles are shocked if one views this influx with misgiving. But the advantages are far from certain. Principles, however liberal, are no substitute for common sense."&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''The Greatest Problem'' (London, 1960), p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Literature and Psychology'' (1951) he had conjectured that the end of civilisation might come, not from war or famine, but from a decay of man's intelligence and self-control under the strain of a too artificial way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., ''Literature and Psychology'' (London, 1951), p.140&lt;/ref&gt; His only science-fiction story, 'Last Act' (1937), set in a not-too-distant future, had depicted the beginning of the end for "the desolator, Man", in an overpopulated, over-technological, and rapidly overheating biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, F. L., 'Last Act', in ''The Woman Clothed with the Sun, and Other Stories'' (London, 1937; New York, 1938), p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

''' 'Germany and Europe' '''

... My dream is of a British statesman who could say to his countrymen: "You are sick of war, weary of entanglements. There are some who would have you renounce both.  I offer you instead a heavier load of foreign responsibilities, a risk of new war. Because that is the only road to lasting peace. Since the War, British policy has been shuffling, timid, ignoble.  Be bold at last, and give a lead to Europe, by offering to form with France and whatever other European states will join, a League within the League, of nations pledged to submit all disputes to the League, but pledged also to fight without hesitation in defence of any member of the group who is attacked.  If Germany will join, so much the better; though Germany as she is never will. If America, better still; for the present America is a broken reed. All the more honor for us to accept a responsibility if she refuses.

"The way will not be easy. We shall often regret the day we pledged ourselves to bear taxation in peace and face death in war for interests and frontiers not our own. But no interest is more really our own than the reign of law between nations."

That is little likely to happen. Only an Abraham Lincoln takes risks of that sort with a nation. But this is not because the ordinary politician is wiser; it is because the ordinary politician does not realize the latent force of idealism, all the stronger with the decay of the religions which gave it other outlets, ready in the world of to-day for any leader with the courage to use it; and so easily abused accordingly by the rulers of Moscow and Berlin.

''' 'The limits of self-determination for racial minorities' '''

To the Editor of the ''Manchester Guardian''

Sir,

Many honest folk feel it hard to deny the Sudetens self-determination, if they want to belong to the Reich. But then, can we deny it to the Czech areas among the Sudetens? Then what about Sudeten pockets in the Czech areas? Self-determination must stop somewhere. In politics, as in physics, you come to a point where you cannot go on splitting things. You cannot have self-determination by villages. You may split Czechoslovakia now. In a few years it will be one again. Only it will be German. That is all.

What would our own answer be, supposing we were expected on racial grounds to hand over to Berlin our coastal counties from Essex to Northumberland? We should reply that any nation must defend itself against a step which would make it impossible to defend itself.

You cannot by any juggling with frontiers abolish racial minorities in Europe. And you cannot totally ignore geography. It follows that where you cannot move mountains you must move men. If the Sudetens are irrevocably set on being in the Reich let them go to the Reich instead of expecting the Reich to come to them. The Germans are the later comers in Bohemia. There are precedents for such an exodus. Good Aryans may disdain to copy Moses, but within these fifteen years just such an exchange of minorities has cured, as nothing else could have cured, the secular hate of Greek and Turk. If a small, poor and barren state like Greece could absorb between one and two million refugees it is absurd to pretend that a great country like Germany, which Hitler has set flowing with milk and honey, could not do as much and more. And if the Czechs can give a home to the persecuted refugees of the Axis, so much the better.

This seems to me justice. The alternative is to admit the Trojan Horse into Prague. That may be the sort of fool's wisdom called "expediency"; it is the line of least resistance; but at least let us not cant about its honesty.

Undoubtedly Hitler will object. He has other aims. It is not oppression he minds; the loudest yelps about persecution come from the persecutor of the Jews. Czechoslovakia lies on the flank of the German drive to the Black Sea. Therefore, Hitler will not hear reason.

A question that vitally affects all Europe should be discussed by Europe. If Hitler foams at the mere mention of the League, let it be a European conference. Only let it give full weight to those smaller Powers which have often a more disinterested sense of decency than their great neighbours. If Hitler refuses he puts himself at once in the wrong. The verdict of such a conference may not convince him; but if he cannot reason, he can count.

==== Eidetic memory ====
{{importance section|date=November 2018}}
In Seagrave's book ''The Marcos Dynasty'', he mentioned that Marcos possessed a [[eidetic memory|phenomenal memory]] and exhibited this by memorizing complicated texts and reciting them forward and backward, even such as the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines. Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago, in an interview with the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' on March 25, 2012, shared her experience as a speech writer to President Marcos: "One time, the Secretary of Justice forgot to tell me that the President had requested him to draft a speech that the President was going to deliver before graduates of the law school. And then, on the day the President was to deliver the speech, he suddenly remembered because Malacañang was asking for the speech, so he said, 'This is an emergency. You just have to produce something.' And I just dictated the speech. He liked long speeches. I think that was 20 or 25 pages. And then, in the evening, I was there, of course. President Marcos recited the speech from memory."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/790289/miriam-santiago-love-loss-and-her-home Miriam Santiago on love, loss and her home], Philippine Star, March 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Murder of Julio Nalundasan ==
{{main|Julio Nalundasan}}
In December 1938, Ferdinand Marcos was prosecuted for the murder of [[Julio Nalundasan]]. He was not the only accused from the Marcos clan; also accused was his father, Mariano, his brother, Pio, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo. Nalundasan, one of the elder Marcos's political rivals, had been shot and killed in his house in [[Batac]] on September 21, 1935 – the day after he had defeated Mariano Marcos a second time for a seat in the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name=mijares237&gt;{{Harvp|Mijares|1976|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually pulling the trigger. In late January 1939, they were finally denied bail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw19391.htm|title=CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY: PHILIPPINE SUPREME COURTDECISIONS ON-LINE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the year, they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the [[Capital punishment in the Philippines|death penalty]] for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty of [[contempt of court]]. The Marcos family took their appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], which overturned the lower court's decision on 22 October 1940, acquitting them of all charges except contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Jose P. Laurel penned the ''ponencia'' (in [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1940/oct1940/gr_l-47388_1940.html People vs. Mariano Marcos, et al., 70 Phil. 468]) with which [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Ramón Avanceña]], [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Justices]] Imperial, [[Anacleto Díaz|Díaz]] and Horilleno all concurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service during World War II==
{{Main|Military career of Ferdinand Marcos}}
Marcos' military service during [[World War II]] has been the subject of debate and controversy, both in the Philippines and in international Military circles.&lt;ref name="JeffGerth&amp;JoelBrinkley19860123"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/world/marcos-s-wartime-role-discredited-in-us-files.html?pagewanted=all |title=Marcos's wartime role discredited in U.S. files | last1=Gerth | first1=Jeff | last2=Brinkley | first2=Joel | date=January 23, 1986|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos, who had received ROTC training,  was activated for service in the US Armed Forces in the Philippines (USAFIP) after the attack on Pearl Harbor. He served as a 3rd lieutenant during the mobilization in the summer and fall of 1941, continuing until April 1942, after which he was taken prisoner.&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"/&gt; According to Marcos' account, he was released from prison by the Japanese on August 4, 1942,&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/01/24/new-doubts-on-marcos-war-role/40076661-fe6a-4695-88ea-1ee707e1c090/ |title= New Doubts on Marcos' War Role  |last=Sharkey |first=John |date=1986-01-24 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and US Military records show that he rejoined USAFIP forces in December 1944.&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"/&gt; Marcos' Military service then formally ended with his discharge as a Major in the 14th Infantry, US Armed Forces in the Philippines Northern Luzon, in May 1945.&lt;ref name="Curtis1948"&gt;Capt. E.R. Curtis, “Check Sheet, Subject:Ferdinand E. Marcos” sent to Lt. Col. W.M. Hanes, 24 March 1948, in AMM-GURF. As cited in{{Cite book |title=Why Ferdinand E. Marcos Should Not Be Buried at the Libingan ng mga Bayani |date=2016-07-12 |publisher=National Historical Commission of the Philippines |location=Manila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies ragarding Marcos' military service revolve around: the reason for his release from the Japanese POW camp&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"/&gt;; his actions between release from prison in August 1942 and return to the USAFIP in December 1944&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"/&gt;; his supposed rank upon discharge from USAFIP&lt;ref name="Curtis1948"/&gt;; and his claims to being the recipient of numerous military decorations, most of which were proven to be fraudulent.&lt;ref name="JeffGerth&amp;JoelBrinkley19860123" /&gt;

Documents uncovered by the Washington Post in 1986 suggested that Marcos' release in August 1942 happened because his father, former congressman and provincial governor [[Mariano Marcos]], "''cooperated with the Japanese military authorities''" as publicist.&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"/&gt;

After his release, Marcos claims that he spent much of the period between his August 1942 release and his December 1944 return to USAFIP&lt;ref name="JohnSharkey19860124"/&gt;  as the leader of a guerilla organization called ''Ang Manga Mahárlika'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], "The Freeman") in Northern [[Luzon]].&lt;ref name="Scott1992"&gt;{{cite book |last = [[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott]] |first = William Henry |title = Looking for the Prehispanic Filipino and Other Essays in the Philippine History |publisher = New Day Publishers |year = 1992 |location = Quezon City |isbn = 971-10-0524-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ebp2GQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in northern [[Luzon]] during [[World War II]].  According to Marcos' claim, this force had a strength of 9,000 men.&lt;ref name="Scott1992"/&gt; His account of events was later cast into doubt after a United States military investigation exposed many of his claims as either false or inaccurate.&lt;ref name="McCoy1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=McCoy, Alfred W.|title=Closer than brothers: manhood at the Philippine Military Academy|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-300-07765-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GNFRaSf1dP4C&amp;pg=PA167 167–170]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNFRaSf1dP4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversy arose in 1947, when Marcos began signing communications with the rank of  Lt. Col., instead of Major.&lt;ref name="Curtis1948"/&gt; This prompted US officials to note that Marcos was only "recognized as a major in the roster of the 14th Infantry USAFIP, NL as of 12 December 1944 to his date of discharge."&lt;ref name="Curtis1948"/&gt;

The biggest controversy arising from Marcos' service during World War II, however, would concern his claims during the 1962 Senatorial Campaign of being "most decorated war hero of the Philippines"&lt;ref name="JeffGerth&amp;JoelBrinkley19860123" /&gt;  He claimed to have been the recipient of 33 war medals and decorations, including the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and the [[Medal of Honor]], but researchers later found that stories about the wartime exploits of Marcos were mostly propaganda, being inaccurate or untrue.&lt;ref name="MikasMatsuzawa2003"/&gt;  Only two of the supposed 33 awards - the Gold Cross and the other the Distinguished Service Star- were given during the war, and both had been contested by Marcos' superiors.&lt;ref name="MikasMatsuzawa2003"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/war-hero |title=31 years of amnesia: Imagined heroism |last=Matsuzawa |first=Mikas |date=2003 |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=2018-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627030538/https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/war-hero |archive-date=2017-06-27 |dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the surrender of the Japanese and the end of World War II, the American government became preoccupied with setting up Marshall plan to revive the economies of the western hemisphere, and quickly backtracked from its interests in the Philippines, granting the islands independence on July 4, 1946.&lt;ref name="Wood1986"&gt;{{Cite book |title=From Marshall Plan to debt crisis : foreign aid and development choices in the world economy |last=Wood |first=Robert Everett |date=1986 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520055268 |location=Berkeley |oclc=13358314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubsky1993"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Technocracy and development in the Philippines |last=Roman. |first=Dubsky, |date=1993 |publisher=University of the Philippines Press |isbn=9715420168 |location=Diliman, Quezon City |oclc=30679756}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcos ran for his father's old post as house representative of the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte and won three consecutive terms, serving in the house from 1949 to 1959.&lt;ref name="Ferdinand Edralin Marcos"&gt;[http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/former_senators/ferdinand_marcos.htm Ferdinand Edralin Marcos].

Marcos ran a populist campaign emphasizing that he was a bemedalled war hero emerging from [[World War II]].

====1969 Presidential Campaign====
{{Main|Ferdinand Marcos presidential campaign, 1969}}

Ferdinand Marcos' campaign for a second term formally began with his nomination as the presidential candidate of the Nacionalista Party at its July 1969 general meeting. A meeting of the party's ruling junta had met a week earlier to assure that the nomination would be unanimous.&lt;ref name="Joaquin2013"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853430289 |title=Reportage on the Marcoses, 1964-1970 |last=Nick, |first=Joaquin, |publisher=Anvil Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=9789712728174 |location=Mandaluyong City, Philippines, |oclc=853430289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines which was in force at the time, Marcos was supposed to be allowed a maximum of two four year terms as President.&lt;ref name="Kasaysayan9ch10"/&gt;

During the 1969 campaign, Marcos launched USD50 million worth in infrastructure projects in an effort to curry favor with the electorate.&lt;ref name=Burton1989&gt;{{Cite book |title=Impossible Dream: The Marcoses, the Aquinos, and the Unfinished Revolution. |last=Burton  |first=Sandra  |publisher=Warner Books  |year=1989 |isbn=0446513989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rapid campaign spending was so massive that it would be responsible for the Balance of Payments Crisis of 1970, whose inflationary effect would cause social unrest leading all the way up to the proclamation of Martial Law in 1972.&lt;ref name=Balbosas1992&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Balbosa |first=Joven Zamoras |date=Second Semester 1992 |title=IMF Stabilization Program and Economic Growth: The Case of the Philippines |journal=Journal of Philippine Development  |volume=XIX|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cororaton1997"&gt;{{Cite paper |last=Cororaton |first=Cesar B.  |title=Exchange Rate Movements in the Philippines |journal=DPIDS iscussion Paper Series 97-05. |pages=3, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marcos was reported to have spent PhP 100 for every PhP 1 that Osmena spent, using up PhP 24 Million in Cebu alone.&lt;ref name="DeQuiros1997"/&gt;

With his popularity already beefed up by debt-funded spending, Marcos' popularity made it very likely that he would win the election, but he decided, as National Artist for Literature [[Nick Joaquin]] reported in the [[Philippines Free Press]], to "''leave nothing to chance''."&lt;ref name="Joaquin2013"/&gt;  Time and Newsweek would eventually call the 1969 election the "''dirtiest, most violent and most corrupt''" in Philippine modern history, with the term "Three Gs", meaning "''[[guns, goons, and gold]]''"&lt;ref name="Parsa2000"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=41_EXD1hWlgC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=guns+goons+and+gold+1969&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sGho6THhb_&amp;sig=TJpjktRQxR42AWagVnCEAlDV4h8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrluSkiJnbAhUIJJQKHVcjDr8Q6AEwDXoECAEQbg#v=onepage&amp;q=guns%2520goons%2520and%2520gold%25201969&amp;f=false |title=States, Ideologies, and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of Iran, Nicaragua, and the Philippines |last=Parsa |first=Misagh |date=2000-08-17 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521774307 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper |url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/philippinen/50071.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined&lt;ref name="SunStarEditorial20160229"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/60678/ |title=Editorial: Protecting the vote |last=editorial-protecting-vote-459796 |date=2016-02-29 |work=Sunstar |access-date=2018-05-22 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe administration's election tactics of vote-buying, terrorism and ballot snatching.&lt;ref name="DeQuiros1997"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39051509|title=Dead aim : how Marcos ambushed Philippine democracy|last=Conrado.|first=De Quiros,|date=1997|publisher=Foundation for Worldwide People's Power|others=Foundation for Worldwide People Power (Manila, Philippines)|isbn=9719167033|location=Pasig City|oclc=39051509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inflation and social unrest ====

Marcos won the November 1969 election by a landslide, and was inaugurated on December 30 of that year.  But Marcos' massive spending during the [[Ferdinand Marcos presidential campaign, 1969|1969 presidential campaign]] had taken its toll and triggered growing public unrest.&lt;ref name="NeverAgain"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Marcos Martial Law: Never Again |last=Robles |first=Raissa |publisher=FILIPINOS FOR A BETTER PHILIPPINES , INC |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the campaign, Marcos had spent $50 Million Dollars worth in debt-funded infrastructure, triggering a Balance of Payments crisis.&lt;ref name=" PhilStar"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/golden-era |title=Debt, deprivation and spoils of dictatorship {{!}} 31 years of amnesia |last=Diola |first=Camille |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=2018-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626200905/https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/golden-era |archive-date=2017-06-26 |dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Marcos administration ran to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for help, and the IMF offered a debt restructuring deal.  New policies, including a greater emphasis on exports and the relaxation of controls of the peso, were put in place.  The Peso was allowed to float to a lower market value, resulting in drastic inflation, and social unrest.&lt;ref name="NeverAgain"/&gt;

Marcos' spending during the campaign led to opposition figures such as Senator [[Lorenzo Tañada]], Senator [[Jovito Salonga]], and Senator [[Jose Diokno]] to accuse Marcos of wanting to stay in power even beyond the two term maximum set for the presidency by the 1935 constitution.&lt;ref name="NeverAgain"/&gt;

The media of the time classified the various civil society groups opposing Marcos into two categories.&lt;ref name="Passionate"&gt;Talitha Espiritu Passionate Revolutions: The Media and the Rise and Fall of the Marcos Regime Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Moderates", which included church groups, civil libertarians, and nationalist politicians, were those who wanted to create change through political reforms.&lt;ref name="Passionate"/&gt;  The "radicals", including a number of labor and student groups, wanted broader, more systemic political reforms.&lt;ref name="Passionate"/&gt;

====First Quarter Storm==== 
{{Primary sources|section|date=November 2018}}
{{Main|First Quarter Storm}}

By the time Marcos gave the first State of the Nation Address on January 26, 1970, the unrest born from the 1969-1970 Balance of Payments Crisis exploded into a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], [[protest]]s, and marches against the government.  Student groups - some moderate and some radical - served as the driving force of the protests, which lasted until the end of the university semester in March 1970, and would come to be known as the "[[First Quarter Storm]]".&lt;ref name="Manila,My Manila"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Manila,My Manila|publisher=Vera-Reyes, Inc.|year=1990|isbn=|pages=|author=Joaquin, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NeverAgain"/&gt; 

During Marcos' January 26, 1970 State of the Nation Address, the moderate [[National Union of Students of the Philippines]] organized a protested in front of Congress, and invited student groups both moderate and radical to join them.  Some of the students participating in the protest harangued Marcos as he and his wife Imelda as they left the Congress building, throwing a coffin, a stuffed alligator, and stones at them.&lt;ref name="InquirerRememberingFQS"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://globalnation.inquirer.net/118130/remembering-the-first-quarter-storm |title=Remembering the First Quarter Storm |last=Rodis |first=Rodel |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |access-date=2018-11-27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The next major protest took place on January 30, in front of the presidential palace,&lt;ref name="Newsbreak"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/51292-timeline-first-quarter-storm |title=TIMELINE: First Quarter Storm |last=Santos |first=Reynaldo Jr. |date=February 27, 2014 |work=Rappler |access-date=2018-11-27 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where activists rammed the gate with a fire truck and once the gate broke and gave way, the activists charged into the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes, Molotov cocktails. At least two activists were confirmed dead and several were injured by the police.

The mayor of Manila at the time, [[Antonio Villegas]], commended the [[Manila Police District]] for their "exemplary behavior and courage" and protecting the First Couple long after they have left. The death of the activists was seized on by ''[[The Manila Times]]'' and the ''[[Manila Chronicle]]'', both of which were controlled by Fernando Lopez's family. These newspapers blamed Marcos for the deaths and added fire to the weekly protests.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com/1970/01/|title=January - 1970 - The Philippine Diary Project|website=philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}} 

On February 18, protesters vandalized and set fire to the U.S. embassy lobby, resulting in a strong protest from the U.S. Ambassador.&lt;ref name="ndfp.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacaba 1982 11–45, 157–178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com/1970/02/|title=February - 1970 - The Philippine Diary Project|website=philippinediaryproject.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}

The KM protests ranged from 50,000 to 100,000 in number per weekly mass action.&lt;ref name="ndfp.org"/&gt; Students had declared a week-long boycott of classes and instead met to organize protest rallies.&lt;ref name="Lacaba 1982 11–45, 157–178"/&gt;

=====Role of the Communist Party ===== 
{{Unbalanced|section|date=November 2018}}
Around 1970, student activism was raging and many student activists joined the ranks of the communists. [[Kabataang Makabayan]] (Patriotic Youth, or 'KM') a political organization founded by [[Jose Maria Sison]] intended to be a nationwide extension of the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Finishing the Unfinished Revolution|last=Torrevillas-Suarez|first=Domini|date=March 29, 1970|work=Philippine Panorama|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/signposts-in-the-history-of-activism-in-the-university-of-the-philippines/|title=Signposts in the History of Activism in the University of the Philippines|last=Guillermo|first=Ramon|date=February 6, 2013|website=[[University of the Philippines]]|publisher=|access-date=November 19, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127024018/http://www.up.edu.ph/signposts-in-the-history-of-activism-in-the-university-of-the-philippines/|archivedate=November 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; carried out study sessions on Marxism–Leninism and intensified the deployment of urban activists in rural areas to prepare for [[People's war]].&lt;ref name="ndfp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndfp.org/historic-role-and-contributions-of-kabataang-makabayan/|title=Historic role and contributions of Kabataang Makabayan » NDFP|date=November 29, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://josemariasison.org/building-the-peoples-army-and-waging-the-peoples-war/|title=BUILDING THE PEOPLE'S ARMY AND WAGING THE PEOPLE'S WAR|date=March 28, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line between leftist activists and communists became increasingly blurred, as a significant number of KM advanced activists joined the party of the Communist Party also founded by [[Jose Maria Sison]].&lt;ref name="ndfp.org"/&gt;

He lamented that the powerful Lopez family blamed him in their newspapers for the riots thus raising the ire of demonstrators. He mentioned that he was informed by his mother of a planned assassination paid for by the powerful oligarch, [[Eugenio Lopez Sr.]] (Iñing Lopez). He narrated how he dissuaded his supporters from the Northern Philippines in infiltrating the demonstration in Manila and inflicting harm on the protesters, and how he showed to the UP professors that the Collegian was carrying the communist party articles and that he was disappointed in the faculty of his ''[[alma mater]]'' for becoming a spawning ground of communism. He also added that he asked Ernesto Rufino, Vicente Rufino, and [[Carlos Palanca]] to withdraw advertisements from ''The Manila Times'' which was openly supporting revolution and the communist cause, and they agreed to do so.

====Rumored coup d'état and assassination plot====
{{Primary sources|section|date=November 2018}}

Rumors of coup d'état were also brewing. A report of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that shortly after the [[Philippine presidential election, 1969]], a group composed mostly of retired colonels and generals organized a revolutionary junta with the aim of first discrediting President Marcos and then killing him. The group was headed by Eleuterio Adevoso, an official of the opposition Liberal Party. As described in a document given to the committee by a Philippine Government official, key figures in the plot were Vice President Fernando Lopez and Sergio Osmena Jr., whom Marcos defeated in the 1969 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/18/archives/us-killer-reported-hired-in-a-plot-against-marcos-details-reported.html|title=U.S. Killer Reported Hired In a Plot Against Marcos|first=John W. Finney Special To The New York|last=Times|date=February 18, 1973|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcos even went to the U.S. embassy to dispel rumors, spread by the Liberal Party, that the U.S. supported a coup d'état.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}

While a report obtained by ''[[The New York Times]]'' speculated that rumors of a coup could be used by Marcos to justify [[martial law]], as early as December 1969 in a message from the U.S. Ambassador to the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, the ambassador said that most of the talk about revolution and even assassination has been coming from the defeated opposition, of which Adevoso is a leading activist. He also said that the information he has on the assassination plans are 'hard' or well-sourced and he has to make sure that it reaches President Marcos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foreign relations of the United States, 1969–1976, V. 20: Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5r7jrDoHM4C&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=Eleuterio+Adevoso+marcos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s0SAL5EClK&amp;sig=lWD8dbvgl3d46qKmmwcOI7DV6nc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Eleuterio%20Adevoso%20marcos&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v20/d202|title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1969–1976, Volume XX, Southeast Asia, 1969–1972 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the crisis, Marcos wrote an entry in his diary in January 1970:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}} "I have several options. One of them is to abort the subversive plan now by the sudden arrest of the plotters. But this would not be accepted by the people. Nor could we get the Huks (Communists), their legal cadres and support. Nor the MIM ([[Maoist International Movement]]) and other subversive [or front] organizations, nor those underground. We could allow the situation to develop naturally then after massive terrorism, wanton killings and an attempt at my assassination and a coup d'etat, then declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus – and arrest all including the legal cadres. Right now I am inclined towards the latter."

==== Events leading up to Proclamation 1081 ====
{{main|Proclamation No. 1081}}

At the height of the armed communist insurgency in the Philippines, [[Philippine Military Academy]] instructor Lt Victor Corpuz led [[New People's Army]] rebels in a raid on the PMA armory, capturing rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, a bazooka and thousands of rounds of ammunition in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/CH30Ae02.html|title=Asia Times: Victor Corpus and Jose Almonte: The righteous spies|website=www.atimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, China, which was then actively supporting and arming communist insurgencies in Asia as part of [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's war#List of People's Wars|People's War Doctrine]], transported 1,200 M-14 and AK-47 rifles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/60279-ak47-communist-rebels|title=AK-47: NPA rebels' weapon of choice|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the NPA to speed up NPA's campaign to defeat the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNlJoXfAH3c|title=MV Karagatan, The Ship of the Chinese Communist|last=I-Witness|first=GMA 7|publisher=YouTube|date=November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2012/07/30/832892/untold-story-karagatan-i-witness|title=Untold story of Karagatan in I-Witness|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to interviews by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' with unnamed former [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] Officials "the (Communist) party leadership planned – and three operatives carried out – the (Plaza Miranda) attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution... (Communist Party Leader) Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the anonymous former  officials said.

Martial Law was put on vote in July 1973 in the [[Philippine Martial Law referendum, 1973]] and was marred with controversy&lt;ref name="philippinesReadr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politicalEconomyOfAuthoritarianism"/&gt; resulting to 90.77% voting yes and 9.23% voting no.

A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], which had been called for in 1970 to replace the Commonwealth era [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]], continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and allowing Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973. The constitution was approved by 95% of the voters in the [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|Philippine constitutional plebiscite]].

After putting in force amendments to the constitution, legislative action, and securing his sweeping powers and with the Batasan, his supposed successor body to the Congress, under his control, President Marcos lifted martial law on January 17, 1981. However, the suspension of the privilege of the [[writ of habeas corpus]] continued in the autonomous regions of [[Western Mindanao]] and [[Central Mindanao]]. The opposition dubbed the lifting of martial law as a mere "face lifting" as a precondition to the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In many tongues, pope championed religious freedoms|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/03/Worldandnation/In_many_tongues__pope.shtml|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos had a vision of a ''Bagong Lipunan'' (New Society) similar to [[Indonesia]]n president [[Suharto]]'s "[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order administration]]", China leader Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward and Korean [[Kim Il-Sung]]'s [[Juche]]. He used the years of martial law to implement this vision. According to Marcos's book ''Notes on the New Society'', it was a movement urging the poor and the privileged to work as one for the common goals of society and to achieve the liberation of the Filipino people through self-realization.

During his martial law regime, Marcos confiscated and appropriated by force and duress many businesses and institutions, both private and public, and redistributed them to his [[Marcos Cronies|cronies]] and close personal friends. Two of these friends were [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo "Danding" Cojuangco Jr.]], who would go on to control [[San Miguel Corporation]], and [[Ramon Cojuangco]], late businessman and chairman of [[PLDT]], and father of Antonio "Tony Boy" Cojuangco (who would eventually succeed his father in the telecommunications company), both happened to be cousins of [[Corazon Aquino]]. These associates of Marcos then used these as fronts to [[money laundering|launder proceeds]] from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as "[[crony capitalism]]" for personal benefit. Graft and corruption via bribery, [[racketeering]], and [[embezzlement]] became more prevalent during this era. Marcos also silenced the free press, making the press of the state propaganda the only legal one, which was a common practice for governments around the world that sought to fight communism.

By 1977, the armed forces had quadrupled and over 60,000 Filipinos had been arrested for political reasons. In 1981, Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] praised Marcos for his "adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic processes".{{refn|name=BushMarcos|group=lower-alpha|There is some disagreement between sources about whether President Bush said ''principle''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Tony|title=America's Mission: The United States and the Worldwide Struggle for Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u–je3hFa1cC&amp;pg=PA281|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-4202-6|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shain|first=Yossi|title=Marketing the American Creed Abroad: Diasporas in the U.S. and Their Homelands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC&amp;pg=PA79|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64225-5|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''principles''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitz|first=David F.|title=The United States and Right-Wing Dictatorships, 1965–1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EV440YU6toC&amp;pg=PA232|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45512-1|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones1983"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mother Jones Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT15|date=June 1983|publisher=Mother Jones|page=35|issn=0362-8841}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  No American military or politician in the 1970s ever publicly questioned the authority of Marcos to help fight communism in South East Asia.

Marcos and his close [[Rolex 12]] associates like [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] used their powers to settle scores against old rivals such as the Lopezes who were always opposed to the Marcos administration. Enrile and the Lopezes ([[Eugenio Lopez Sr.]] and [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]]) were [[Harvard]]-educated Filipino leaders. Leading opponents such as Senators [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]], [[Jose Diokno]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and many others were imprisoned for months or years. This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|author1=Chaikin, David |author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.

Between 1972 and 1976, Marcos increased the size of the Philippine military from 65,000 to 270,000 personnel, in response to the fall of South Vietnam to the communists and the growing tide of communism in South East Asia. Military officers were placed on the [[board of directors|boards]] of a variety of media corporations, public utilities, development projects, and other private corporations, most of whom were highly educated and well-trained graduates of the Philippine Military Academy. At the same time, Marcos made efforts to foster the growth of a domestic weapons manufacturing industry and heavily increased military spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moran, Jon|title=Patterns of Corruption and Development in East Asia|work=Third World Quarterly|volume=20|issue=3|date=June 1999|page=579|doi=10.1080/01436599913695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the declaration of martial law in 1972 until 1983 the U.S. government provided $2.5 billion in bilateral military and economic aid to the Marcos regime, and about $5.5 billion through multilateral institutions such as the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bello, Walden|title=Edging toward the Quagmire: The United States and the Philippine Crisis|work=World Policy Journal|volume=3|issue=1|date=Winter 1985–1986|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1979 [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] report it was stated that U.S. officials were aware, as early as 1973, that Philippine government agents were in the United States to harass Filipino dissidents. In June 1981, two anti-Marcos labor activists were assassinated outside of a union hall in Seattle. On at least one occasion, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents blocked [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigations of Philippine agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shalom, Stephen R.|title=Imperial alibis: rationalizing U.S. intervention after the cold war|publisher=[[South End Press]]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-89608-448-3|page=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7PfJvj9c7sC&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many human rights abuses were attributed to the [[Philippine Constabulary]] which was then headed by future president [[Fidel Ramos]]. The [[Integrated Civilian Home Defense Forces|Civilian Home Defense Force]], a precursor of Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU), was organized by President Marcos to battle with the communist and Islamic insurgency problem, has particularly been accused of notoriously inflicting human right violations on leftists, the NPA, Muslim insurgents, and rebels against the Marcos government.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, under martial law the Marcos administration was able to reduce violent urban crime, collect unregistered firearms, and suppress communist insurgency in some areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines/Martial-law|title=Philippines - Martial law - history - geography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marcos regime instituted a mandatory youth organization, known as the [[Kabataang Barangay]], which was led by Marcos's eldest daughter Imee. Presidential Decree 684, enacted in April 1975, required that all youths aged 15 to 18 be sent to remote rural camps and do volunteer work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCoy, Alfred W.|title=An Anarchy of Families: State and Family in the Philippines|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-299-22984-9|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fawaNZu-yqUC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wurfel, David|title=Filipino Politics: Development and Decay|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1988|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-oK4ZetPIAC&amp;pg=PA130|isbn=978-0-8014-9926-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Marcos, members of his [[Rolex 12]] circle like Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Chief of Staff of the Philippine Constabulary [[Fidel Ramos]], and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines [[Fabian Ver]] were the chief administrators of martial law from 1972 to 1981, and the three remained President Marcos's closest advisers until he was ousted in 1986. Other peripheral members of the [[Rolex 12]] included [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Eduardo "Danding" Cojuangco Jr.]] and [[Lucio Tan]].

====Normalization of ties with Communist China and effort to isolate local communist rebels====
Marcos recognized the need to established a peaceful relationship with [[China]]. In his 1969 State of the Nation Address, he said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/1969/01/27/ferdinand-e-marcos-fourth-state-of-the-nation-address-january-27-1969/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113024503/http://www.gov.ph/1969/01/27/ferdinand-e-marcos-fourth-state-of-the-nation-address-january-27-1969/|archivedate=2016-11-13|title=Ferdinand E. Marcos, Fourth State of the Nation Address|date=January 27, 1969|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We, in Asia must strive toward a modus vivendi with Red China. I reiterate this need, which is becoming more urgent each day. Before long, Communist China will have increased its striking power a thousand fold with a sophisticated delivery system for its nuclear weapons. We must prepare for that day. We must prepare to coexist peaceably with Communist China.|Ferdinand Marcos|January 1969}}

Prior to 1975, the Philippine government maintained a close relationship with the [[Kuomintang]]-ruled Chinese government which fled to [[Taiwan]] (Republic of China), despite the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Communist Victory]] in 1949, and saw Communist [[China]] (People's Republic of China) as a security threat due to China's financial and military support of Communist rebels in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Hong|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-2969147911/sino-philippines-relations-moving-beyond-south-china|title=Sino-Philippines Relations: Moving beyond South China Sea Dispute?|journal= Journal of East Asian Affairs|page=57|year=2012|accessdate=6 March 2015|subscription=yes|via=[[Questia]]|issn=1010-1608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1975, President Marcos went to the People's Republic of China and signed a Joint Communiqué normalizing relations between the Philippines and China. Among other things, the Communiqué recognizes that "there is but one China and that Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory…" In turn, Chinese Prime Minister [[Zhou Enlai]] also pledged that China would not intervene in the internal affairs of the Philippines nor will it seek to impose its policies in Asia, a move which isolated the local communist movement that China had financially and militarily supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://pascn.pids.gov.ph/files/Discussions%20Papers/1999/pascndp9916.pdf|title=The Political Economy of Philippines-China Relations|author=Benito Lim|work=Discussion paper|publisher=Philippine APEC Study Center Network|date=September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/mappingmilitants/cgi-bin/groups/view/149|title=Communist Party of the Philippines–New People's Army - Mapping Militant Organizations|first=Daniel|last=Cassman|website=web.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' in an interview with former Philippine Communist Party Officials, revealed that, "they (local communist party officials) wound up languishing in China for 10 years as unwilling "guests" of the (Chinese) government, feuding bitterly among themselves and with the party leadership in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

The government subsequently captured NPA leaders [[Bernabe Buscayno]] in 1976 and [[Jose Maria Sison]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu"/&gt;

====First parliamentary elections after martial law declaration====
The [[Philippine parliamentary election, 1978]] was held on April 7, 1978 for the election of the 166 (of the 208) regional representatives to the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (the nation's first parliament). The elections were participated by several parties including Ninoy Aquino's newly formed party, the '''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]''' (LABAN) and the regime's party known as the '''[[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]]''' (KBL).

The Ninoy Aquino's LABAN party fielded 21 candidates for the Metro Manila area including Ninoy himself and Alex Boncayao, who later was associated with Filipino communist death squad Alex Boncayao Brigade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Alex-Boncayao-Brigade|title=Alex Boncayao Brigade - Filipino death squad|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roces"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/354387/lakas-ng-bayan-candidates|title=Lakas ng Bayan candidates|first=ROSES &amp;amp;amp; THORNS By Alejandro R.|last=Roces|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that killed U.S. army captain [[James N. Rowe]]. All of the party's candidates, including Ninoy, lost in the election.

Marcos's KBL party won 137 seats, while Pusyon Bisaya led by [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], who later became the Minority Floor Leader, won 13 seats.

====Prime Minister====

In 1978, the position returned when Ferdinand Marcos became Prime Minister. Based on ''Article 9'' of the 1973 constitution, it had broad executive powers that would be typical of modern prime ministers in other countries. The position was the official head of government, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. All of the previous powers of the President from the 1935 Constitution were transferred to the newly restored office of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister also acted as head of the National Economic Development Authority. Upon his re-election to the Presidency in 1981, Marcos was succeeded as Prime Minister by an American-educated leader and [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] graduate, [[Cesar Virata]], who was elected as an Assemblyman (Member of the Parliament) from Cavite in 1978. He is the eponym of the Cesar Virata School of Business, the business school of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].

===Third term (1981–1986)===
{{Main|Philippine presidential election and referendum, 1981}}
[[File:MarcosinWashington1983.jpg|thumb|upright|President Ferdinand E. Marcos in Washington in 1983.]]

{{quote|We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic process, and we will not leave you in isolation.|U.S. Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] during Ferdinand E. Marcos inauguration|June 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953029,00.html | work=Time | title=Philippines: Together Again | date=July 13, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BushMarcos group=lower-alpha /&gt;}}

On June 16, 1981, six months after the lifting of martial law, the [[Philippine presidential election and referendum, 1981|first presidential election in twelve years]] was held. President Marcos ran and won a massive victory over the other candidates.&lt;ref name="Steinberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philippines: a singular and a plural place |first=David Joel |last=Steinberg|publisher=Westview Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8133-3755-5 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major opposition parties, the [[United Nationalists Democratic Organizations]] (UNIDO), a coalition of opposition parties and LABAN, boycotted the elections.

After the lifting of Martial Law, the pressure on the Communist CPP-NPA alleviated. The group was able to return to urban areas and form relationships with legal opposition organizations, and became increasingly successful in attacks against the government throughout the country.&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu"/&gt; The violence inflicted by the communists reached its peak in 1985 with 1,282 military and police deaths and 1,362 civilian deaths.&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu"/&gt;

====Aquino's assassination====
{{Main|Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.}}
On August 21, 1983, opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]] was assassinated on the tarmac at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]]. He had returned to the Philippines after three years in exile in the United States, where he had a heart bypass operation to save his life after Marcos allowed him to leave the Philippines to seek medical care. Prior to his heart surgery, Ninoy, along with his two co-accused, [[New People's Army|NPA]] leaders [[Bernabe Buscayno]] (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, were sentenced to death by a military commission on charges of murder, illegal possession of firearms and subversion.&lt;ref name="asianjournalusa.com"/&gt;

A few months before his assassination, Ninoy had decided to return to the Philippines after his research fellowship from [[Harvard University]] had finished. The opposition blamed Marcos directly for the assassination while others blamed the military and his wife, Imelda. Popular speculation pointed to three suspects; the first was Marcos himself through his trusted military chief Fabian Ver; the second theory pointed to his wife Imelda who had her own burning ambition now that her ailing husband seemed to be getting weaker, and the third theory was that [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.|Danding Cojuangco]] planned the assassination because of his own political ambitions.&lt;ref name="inquirerOrderedHit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20090819-221072/Who-ordered-the-hit-on-Ninoy-Aquino|title=Who ordered the hit on Ninoy Aquino?|last=Rodis|first=Rodel|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=2009-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002103332/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/columns/columns/view/20090819-221072/Who-ordered-the-hit-on-Ninoy-Aquino|archivedate=October 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1985 acquittals of Chief of Staff General [[Fabian Ver]] as well as other high-ranking military officers charged with the crime were widely seen as a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]] and a miscarriage of justice.

On November 22, 2007, Pablo Martinez, one of the convicted suspects in the assassination of Ninoy Aquino Jr. alleged that it was Ninoy Aquino Jr.'s relative, Danding Cojuangco, cousin of his wife Corazon Cojuangco Aquino, who ordered the assassination of Ninoy Aquino Jr. while Marcos was recuperating from his kidney transplant. Martinez also alleged only he and Galman knew of the assassination, and that Galman was the actual shooter, which is not corroborated by other evidence of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.newsbreak-knowledge.ph/2007/11/23/transcript-of-abs-cbn-interview-with-pablo-martinez-co-accused-in-the-aquino-murder-case/|title=Transcript of ABS-CBN Interview with Pablo Martinez, co-accused in the Aquino murder case|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impeachment attempt====

In August 1985, 56 Assemblymen signed a resolution calling for the [[impeachment]] of President Marcos for alleged diversion of U.S. aid for personal use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Blitz, Amy|title=The contested state: American foreign policy and regime change in the Philippines|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8476-9934-6|pages=167–168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2rdOhMdCDEC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing a July 1985 ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' exposé of the Marcos's multimillion-dollar investment and property holdings in the United States.

The properties allegedly amassed by the First Family were the Crown Building, Lindenmere Estate, and a number of residential apartments (in New Jersey and New York), a shopping center in New York, mansions (in London, Rome and Honolulu), the Helen Knudsen Estate in Hawaii and three condominiums in San Francisco, California.

The Assembly also included in the complaint the misuse and misapplication of funds "for the construction of the [[Manila Film Center]], where X-rated and pornographic films{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} are exhibited, contrary to public morals and Filipino customs and traditions."  The impeachment attempt gained little real traction, however, even in the light of this incendiary charge; the committee to which the impeachment resolution was referred did not recommend it, and any momentum for removing Marcos under constitutional processes soon died.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

====Physical decline====

{{See also|People Power Revolution}}
During his third term, Marcos's health deteriorated rapidly due to kidney ailments, as a complication of a chronic autoimmune disease ''[[lupus erythematosus]]''.

===Snap election, revolution===

{{Main|Philippine presidential election, 1986|People Power Revolution}}
In late 1985, in the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a "[[snap election]]" with more than a year left in his term. He selected [[Arturo Tolentino]] as his running mate. The opposition to Marcos united behind two American-educated leaders, Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], and her running mate, [[Salvador Laurel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pollard, Vincent Kelly|title=Globalization, democratization and Asian leadership: power sharing, foreign policy and society in the Philippines and Japan|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7546-1539-2|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L37RZlzA530C&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Parnell, Philip C.|chapter=Criminalizing Colonialism: Democracy Meets Law in Manila|editor1=Parnell, Philip C. |editor2=Kane, Stephanie C.|title=Crime's power: anthropologists and the ethnography of crime|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6179-2|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2hpz4_fob4C&amp;pg=PA214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that Marcos's World War II medals for fighting the Japanese Occupation was first questioned by the foreign press. During a campaign in Manila's [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] district, Marcos retorted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-23/news/mn-28079_1_war-record|title=Marcos Blasts U.S. Reports He Was a Phony War Hero :  American Records Fail to Back Him|first=From Times Wire|last=Services|date=January 23, 1986|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You who are here in Tondo and fought under me and who were part of my guerrilla organization—you answer them, these crazy individuals, especially the foreign press.

I will not pay any attention to their accusation.|Ferdinand Marcos|January 1986}}

Marcos was referring to both presidential candidate Corazon Aquino's father-in-law [[Benigno Aquino Sr.]] and vice presidential candidate Salvador Laurel's father, [[José P. Laurel]], who were leaders of the [[KALIBAPI]], a puppet political party that collaborated with the Japanese during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]]. Both were arrested and charged for treason after the war.&lt;ref name="Foreign Policy in Focus"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=September 21, 2015|title=What the Class Politics of World War II Mean for Tensions in Asia Today|url=http://fpif.org/what-the-class-politics-of-world-war-ii-mean-for-asia-today/|accessdate=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final tally of the COMELEC had Marcos winning with 10,807,197 votes against Aquino's 9,291,761 votes. On the other hand, the partial 69% tally of the [[National Movement for Free Elections]] (NAMFREL), an accredited poll watcher, had Aquino winning with 7,502,601 votes against Marcos's 6,787,556 votes. Cheating was reported on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namfrel.com.ph/v2/photogallery/1986-tallyboard2.php|title=NAMFREL|website=www.namfrel.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This electoral exercise was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering of election results.

Despite common knowledge that Marcos cheated the elections, some claim that Marcos is the one that had been cheated by NAMFREL because his Solid North votes were transmitted very late to the tabulation center at the PICC. Two Namfrel volunteers were hanged in Ilocos. The Ilocano votes were enough to overwhelm Cory's lead in Metro Manila and other places.&lt;ref name="Manila Times"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manila Times|title='Setting the record straight on Edsa 1'|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/virtual-reality-by-tony-lopez/141677/setting-the-record-straight-on-edsa-1.html|accessdate=August 30, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610115431/http://manilastandardtoday.com/opinion/columns/virtual-reality-by-tony-lopez/141677/setting-the-record-straight-on-edsa-1.html|archivedate=June 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alleged fraud culminated in the walkout of 35 COMELEC computer technicians to protest the manipulation of the official election results to favor Ferdinand Marcos. The walkout of computer technicians was led by Linda Kapunan&lt;ref name="militaryIntervention1986197"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-iv-military-intervention-in-the-philippines-1986-1987/ |title=The Final Report of the Fact-Finding Commission: IV: Military Intervention in the Philippines: 1986 – 1987|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006015437/http://www.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-iv-military-intervention-in-the-philippines-1986-1987/|archivedate=2016-10-06|publisher=Official Gazette of the Government of the Philippines|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the technicians were protected by [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement|Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM)]] officers led by her husband Lt.

The failed election process gave a decisive boost to the "[[People Power Revolution|People Power]] movement."  Enrile and Ramos would later abandon Marcos's 'sinking ship' and seek protection behind the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]], backed by fellow-American educated [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.]], [[Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala]], and the old political and economic elites. At the height of the revolution, Juan Ponce Enrile revealed that a purported and well-publicized ambush attempt against him years earlier was in fact faked, in order for Marcos to have a pretext for imposing martial law. However, Marcos never ceased to maintain that he was the duly elected and proclaimed president of the Philippines for a fourth term, but unfairly and illegally deprived of his right to serve it. On February 25, 1986, rival presidential inaugurations were held,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Crisostomo |first=Isabelo T. |publication-date=|title=Cory, Profile of a President: The Historic Rise to Power of Corazon. |publication-place= |publisher= Branden Books|isbn= 978-0-8283-1913-3|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iW_ddLowBYkC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Cory+Aquino+in+Club+Filipino |accessdate= 2007-12-03 |date=1987-04-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but as Aquino supporters overran parts of Manila and seized state broadcaster [[PTV-4]], Marcos was forced to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Paul Sagmayao |first=Mercado |authorlink= |first2=Francisco S.|last2=Tatad |title=People Power: The Philippine Revolution of 1986: An Eyewitness History |publisher=The James B.

===Fleeing from the Philippines to Hawaii===
[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos on a walk with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]].]]
At 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] ([[GMT+8]]) on February 25, 1986, Marcos talked to [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Paul Laxalt]], a close associate of the United States President, Ronald Reagan, asking for advice from the [[White House]]. Laxalt advised him to "cut and cut cleanly", to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-02-26/news/8601140956_1_marcos-final-destination-marcos-flight-ferdinand-e-marcos |title=Marcos Flees, Aquino Rules |newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=February 26, 1986|last=Lama|first=George de|last2=Collin|first2=Dorothy|accessdate=February 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, Marcos talked to [[Juan Ponce Enrile|Enrile]], asking for safe passage for him and his family, and included his close allies like General Ver. Finally, at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the Marcos family was transported by four [[Sikorsky S-61R|Sikorsky HH-3E]] [[helicopter]]s&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Halperin, Jonathan J.|title=The Other Side: How Soviets and Americans Perceive Each Other|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-687-9|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H1so7Od--csC&amp;pg=PA63|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles City]], Pampanga, about 83&amp;nbsp;kilometers north of Manila, before boarding [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] [[C-130]] planes bound for [[Andersen Air Force Base]] in [[Guam]], and finally to [[Hickam Air Force Base]] in [[Hawaii]] where Marcos arrived on February 26.

As per the official 23-page US Customs record, the two C-141 transport planes that carried the Marcos family and their closest allies had 23 wooden crates; 12 suitcases and bags, and various boxes, whose contents included enough clothes to fill 67 racks; 413 pieces of jewelry; 24 gold bricks, inscribed "To my husband on our 24th anniversary"; and more than 27m Philippine pesos in freshly printed notes. The jewelry included 70 pairs of jewel-studded cufflinks; an ivory statue of the infant Jesus with a silver mantle and a diamond necklace. The total value of these items was $15 millon.&lt;ref name="daview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Nick|title=The $10bn question: what happened to the Marcos millions?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/10bn-dollar-question-marcos-millions-nick-davies|accessdate=29 June 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, when protestors stormed Malacañang Palace shortly after their departure, it was famously discovered that Imelda had left behind over 2,700 pairs of shoes in her closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Ferdinand E.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] hierarchy and Manila's [[middle class]] were crucial to the success of the massive crusade, but only within Metro Manila because no mass demonstrations or protests against Marcos occurred in the provinces and islands of Visayas and Mindanao.

====Plans to return to the Philippines and 'The Marcos Tapes'====
More than a year after the People Power Revolution, it was revealed to the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific|United States House Foreign Affairs subcommittee]] in 1987 that Marcos held an intention to fly back to the Philippines and overthrow the Aquino government. Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos' trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.

According to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos' interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.

On January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan "in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, "Yes." Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to "last an army three months."

Marcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. ″What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,″ Marcos told Chastain. ″Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.″

Learning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence. This information eventually reached President Ronald Reagan, who placed Marcos under "island arrest", further limiting his movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/1b750440d5a491184f5b2a91533774c1|title=Former Philippine President Marcos Reveals Plan to Invade Homeland|work=AP News|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-10/news/mn-1939_1_president-marcos|title=10,000 Troops, Billions in Gold:  House Panel Hears Tapes of Marcos Plotting coup|last=GETLIN |first=JOSH |date=1987-07-10 |work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
{{see also|Burial of Ferdinand Marcos}}
[[File:Ferdinand E. Marcos Presidential Center sign.jpg|thumb|The body of Ferdinand Marcos was stored in a refrigerated crypt at the [[Ferdinand E. Marcos Presidential Center]] in Batac, Ilocos Norte until 2016.]]
In his dying days, Marcos was visited by Vice President [[Salvador Laurel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/04/world/aquino-s-vice-president-asks-sympathy-for-ailing-marcos.html |title=Aquino's Vice President Asks Sympathy for Ailing Marcos |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting with Laurel, Marcos offered to return 90% of his ill-gotten wealth to the Filipino people in exchange for being buried back in the Philippines beside his mother, an offer also disclosed to [[Enrique Zobel]]. However, Marcos's offer was rebuffed by the [[Presidency of Corazon Aquino|Aquino government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doylaurel.ph/from_the_lips_of_a_dying_president.html|title=Two Great Activities in the Philippines|publisher=doylaurel.ph|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}{{vs|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.philstar.com/opinion/142497/doy-macoy-yorac-corner|title=Doy on Macoy |publisher=The Philippine Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1036706|title=Marcos' message to Mrs. Aquino|website=CNN iReport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos died in [[Honolulu]] on the morning of September 28, 1989, of kidney, heart, and lung ailments. Marcos was interred in a private mausoleum at [[Byodo-In Temple]] on the island of Oahu where his remains were visited daily by the Marcos family, political allies and friends.

The Aquino government refused to allow Marcos's body to be brought back to the Philippines. The body was only brought back to the Philippines four years after Marcos's death during the term of President [[Fidel Ramos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-20/news/mn-15027_1_imelda-marcos|title=4 Years After Death, Marcos' Body to Go Home for Burial|first=BOB|last=DROGIN|date=July 20, 1993|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 2016, his remains were interred inside a refrigerated crypt in [[Ilocos Norte]], where his son, Ferdinand Jr., and eldest daughter, Imee, have since become the local governor and congressional representative, respectively. [[Bust of Ferdinand Marcos|A large bust]] of Ferdinand Marcos (inspired by [[Mount Rushmore]]) was commissioned by the tourism minister, [[Jose D. Aspiras|Jose Aspiras]], and carved into a hillside in Benguet. It was subsequently destroyed; suspects included left-wing activists, members of a local tribe who had been displaced by construction of the monument, and looters hunting for the legendary [[Yamashita's gold|Yamashita treasure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2612709.stm |title=Philippines blast wrecks Marcos bust  |date=December 29, 2002 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion on his burial remains split: 50 percent of the 1,800 respondents of a survey conducted by [[Social Weather Stations|SWS]] in February 2016 said Marcos "was worthy to be buried at the Libingan ng Mga Bayani" while the other half rejected a hero's burial, calling him a "thief".&lt;ref name="ABS-CBN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/halalan2016/focus/03/13/16/is-philippines-ready-for-a-state-burial-for-marcos/|title=Is Philippines ready for a state burial for Marcos?|date=14 March 2016|work=[[ABS-CBN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2016, the remains of Marcos were buried at the [[Heroes' Cemetery|Libingan ng mga Bayani]] despite opposition from various groups. The burial came as unexpected to many, as the Supreme Court's ruling still allowed 15 days for the opposition to file a motion for reconsideration. On the morning of November 18, using Philippine Armed Forces helicopters, his family and their supporters flew his remains from Ilocos to Manila for a private burial.

[[File:Marcos burial Ateneans protest.jpg|thumb|Students of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] along [[Katipunan Avenue]] protesting against the burial of Marcos insisting that the former President is not a hero, but a dictator.]]
Various protest groups formed immediately upon hearing the news of the unexpected burial. Among those who gathered to oppose the burial were youth groups and opponents of the burial of Ferdinand Marcos in the ''Libingan ng mga Bayani''. The League of Filipino Students described the transfer of Marcos' remains as being done like "a thief in the night." They also criticized the government's involvement in the burial of the former president who they described as a "fascist dictator". The [[Kabataan Partylist]] also condemned the burial, labeling it as a "grave travesty" and as "''galawang Hokage''" in reference to the burial of Marcos being planned and conducted unbeknownst to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Galawang Hokage: Youth protest sudden Marcos burial at LNMB|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/589346/news/nation/galawang-hokage-youth-protest-sudden-marcos-burial-at-lnmb|work=GMA News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21-year period of Philippine economic history during Ferdinand Marcos’ regime - from his election in 1965 until he was ousted by the People Power Revolution in 1986- was a period of significant economic highs and lows.&lt;ref name="Galang20110221"&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/content/172779/martial-law-costly-lessons-in-economic-development/story/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EJGuido&amp;CheDeLosReyes20170921"&gt;{{Citation | last = Guido | first =Edson Joseph | author-link = | last2 = de los Reyes | first2 = Che | author2-link = | title = The best of times?

==== Reliance on US trade ====
As a former colony of the United States, the Philippines was heavily reliant on the American economy to purchase agricultural goods such as sugar,&lt;ref name="Larkinsugar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft4580066d&amp;brand=ucpress=all|title=Sugar and the Origins of Modern Philippine Society|last=Larkin|first=John A.|date=1993|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; tobacco, coconut, bananas, and pineapple&lt;ref name="Quirinosugar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCdLAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=history+us+philippine+trade&amp;dq=history+us+philippine+trade&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXh_H7tZfLAhXGHx4KHc_pAU84FBDoAQhMMAc=all|title=History of the Philippine Sugar Industry|last=Quirino|first=Carlos|date=1974|publisher=Kalayaan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nadeausugar"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7YyfxKKPzwC&amp;dq=history+us+philippine+trade&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s=all|title=The History of the Philippines|author=Kathleen M.

====Economy during martial law (1973–1980)====

According to World Bank Data, the Philippine's Annual Gross Domestic Product quadrupled from $8 billion in 1972 to $32.45 billion in 1980, for an inflation-adjusted average growth rate of 6% per year, while debt stood at US$17.2 billion by the end of 1980.&lt;ref name="data.worldbank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nberc9047 /&gt; Indeed, according to the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation, the Philippines enjoyed its best economic development since 1945 between 1972 and 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1984/05/the-roots-of-the-philippines-economic-troubles|title=The Roots of the Philippines' Economic Troubles|first=Edward|last=L.|website=The Heritage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy grew amidsts two severe global oil shocks following the [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[1979 energy crisis]] – oil price was $3 / barrel in 1973 and $39.5 in 1979, or a growth of 1200%. By the end of 1979, debt was still manageable, with debt to Debt-GNP ratio about the same as South Korea, according to th US National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;ref name=nberc9047 /&gt;

Foreign capital was invited to invest in certain industrial projects. They were offered incentives, including tax exemption privileges and the privilege of bringing out their profits in foreign currencies. One of the most important economic programs in the 1980s was the ''Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran'' (Movement for Livelihood and Progress). This program was started in September 1981. It aimed to promote the economic development of the [[barangay]]s by encouraging its residents to engage in their own livelihood projects. The government's efforts resulted in the increase of the nation's economic growth rate to an average of six percent or seven percent from 1970 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Aniceto C.

====Economy after martial law (1981–1985)====

[[File:Heads of State Cancun Summit 1981.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Marcos at the [[North–South Summit]] on International Cooperation and Development in [[Cancun]] alongside other world leaders including [[Indira Gandhi|I. Gandhi]], [[François Mitterrand|F. Mitterrand]], [[Ronald Reagan|R. Reagan]], [[Margaret Thatcher|M. Thatcher]], [[Kurt Waldheim|K. Waldheim]], [[Zhao Ziyang]]; October 23, 1981.]]
The Philippine economy, heavily reliant on exports to the United States, suffered a great decline after the Aquino assassination in August 1983 because Filipino business and political leaders who studied in Harvard, Yale, and other US universities began lobbying American and foreign firms to discourage them from investing in the Philippines. This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.

In an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts – to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.

However, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.&lt;ref name="albert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=25 November 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=027594137X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility. The unemployment rate increased from 6.25% in 1972 to 11.058% in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/philippines/unemployment_rate.html|title=Philippines Unemployment Rate|work=IndexMundi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the severe 1984–1985 recession, the Philippine economy annual growth rate from 1972 to 1985 of 3.4% is significantly lower than the 5.4% growth rate achieved by other countries in ASEAN (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore) in the same time period.&lt;ref name="truthAboutEconomy" /&gt;

=====Creation of a credit bureau=====

In 1981, Ferdinand Marcos issued ''Letter of Instructions No. 1107'' mandating the Central Bank of the Philippines to analyze the probability of establishing and funding the operation of a [[credit bureau in the Philippines]] due to the disturbing increase of failures on corporate borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno1941.html#.VaN-RPmqqko|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|last=Diaz|first=Ronald Echalas|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In adherence to the order, [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] organized the Credit Information Exchange System under the department of Loans and Credit. It was created to engage in collating, developing and analyzing credit information on individuals, institutions, business entities and other business concerns. It aims to develop and undertake the continuing exchange of credit data within its members and subscribers and to provide an impartial source of credit information for debtors, creditors and the public. On April 14, 1982, [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.]] was incorporated as a non-stock, non-profit corporation. CIBI was created pursuant to LOI No. 1107 dated February 16, 1981 and was further strengthened by PD No. 1941 which recognizes and supports CIBI as a suitable [[credit bureau]] to promote the development and maintenance of rational and efficient credit processes in the financial system and in the economy as a whole.
In 1997, Credit Information Bureau, Inc. was incorporated and transformed into a private entity and became [[CIBI Information, Inc.]] [[CIBI]] is a provider of information and intelligence for business, credit and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acraa.com/images/pdf/DCRA.pdf|title=Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Domestic Credit Rating Agencies|date=April 2011|publisher=Association of Credit Rating Agencies in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also supplies compliance reports before accrediting suppliers, industry partners and even hiring professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/142269/rp%C2%92s-biggest-credit-research-firms-form-alliance|title=RP's biggest credit research firms form alliance|work=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Economic controversies=====
According to the book ''The Making of the Philippines'' by Frank Senauth (p.&amp;nbsp;103):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frank Senauth|title='The Making of the Philippines'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-_X3Tn3NTQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=From+1972+to+1980,+agricultural+production+fell+by+30%25+philippines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Uf-BOiorxO&amp;sig=CZG0WV5Do07dVEsDsHaBSysOS_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=From%201972%20to%201980%2C%20agricultural%20production%20fell%20by%2030%25%20philippines&amp;f=false|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marcos himself diverted large sums of government money to his party's campaign funds. Between 1972 and 1980, the average monthly income of wage workers had fallen by 20%. By 1981, the wealthiest 10% of the population was receiving twice as much income as the bottom 60%.&lt;ref name="Morada-1998-p554"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Morada, Noel M. |author2=Collier, Christopher|chapter=The Philippines: State Versus Society?|editor=Alagappa, Muthiah|title=Asian security practice: material and ideational influences|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8047-3348-9|page=554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1t2DRZeDVx8C&amp;pg=PA554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The country's total external debt rose from US$2.3 billion in 1970 to US$26.2 billion in 1985 during Marcos's term. Marcos's critics charged that policies have become debt-driven with rampant corruption and plunder of public funds by Marcos and his [[Marcos Cronies|cronies]]. This held the country under a debt-servicing crisis which is expected to be fixed by only 2025. Critics have pointed out an elusive state of the country's development as the period is marred by a sharp devaluing of the Philippine Peso from 3.9 to 20.53. The overall economy experienced a slower growth GDP per capita, lower wage conditions and higher unemployment especially towards the end of Marcos's term after the 1983–1984 recession. Some of Marcos's critics claimed that poverty incidence grew from 41% in the 1960s at the time Marcos took the Presidency to 59% when he was removed from power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/thought-leaders/123773-marcos-economic-disaster|title=Ferdinand Marcos' economic disaster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rappler.com/views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|publisher = Rappler| title=Marcos Economy Golden Age of PH?

From 1972 to 1980, agricultural production fell by 30%. After declaring martial law in 1972, Marcos promised to implement agrarian reforms. However, the land reforms served largely to undermine Marcos's landholder opponents, not to lessen inequality in the countryside,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kang, David C.|title=Crony capitalism: corruption and development in South Korea and the Philippines|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-521-00408-4|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im465FAopWMC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged conversion to cash tenancy and greater reliance on farm workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sidel, John Thayel|title=Capital, coercion, and crime: bossism in the maPhilippines|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8047-3746-3|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0it4S_WGapIC&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Marcos, timber products were among the nation's top exports but little attention was paid to the environmental impacts of deforestation as cronies never complied with reforestation agreements. By the early 1980s, forestry collapsed because most of the Philippines' accessible forests had been depleted—of the 12 million hectares of forestland, about 7 million had been left barren."&lt;ref name="grafStaggering3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos/3|title=Marcos Graft Staggering – Investigators Trace Billions In Holdings|last=Crewdson|first=John|date=March 23, 1986|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyce, James K.|title=The political economy of the environment|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84376-108-2|pages=43–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=izGVtg8KE-YC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the book claimed that agricultural production declined by 30% in the 1970s and suggested that timber exports were growing in the same period, an article published by the World Bank on Philippine Agriculture says that crops (rice, corn, coconut, sugar), livestock and poultry and fisheries grew at an average rate of 6.8%, 3% and 4.5%, respectively from 1970 to 1980, and the forestry sector actually declined by an annual average rate of 4.4% through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPHILIPPINES/Resources/Habito-word.pdf|title=Philippine Agriculture over the Years: Performance, Policies and Pitfalls|author1=Cielito F.

Despite claims made by the book that land reforms served largely to undermine Marcos's landholder opponents, Marcos's government did not distribute to small farmers his political rival Ninoy Aquino's family's 6,453 hectare [[Hacienda Luisita]] plantation, the biggest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/181877/news/specialreports/hacienda-luisita-s-past-haunts-noynoy-s-future|title=Hacienda Luisita's past haunts Noynoy's future|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/18261/gloria-macapagal-arroyo-farmers-victorious-vs-aquino-hacienda|title=Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, farmers victorious vs Aquino hacienda|first=Rigoberto|last=Tiglao|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960 the [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] and [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] Foundations had worked with the [[Carlos P.

Marcos left a mixed legacy for future generations. On one hand, many laws written by Marcos are still in force and in effect. Out of thousands of proclamations, decrees, and executive orders, only a few were repealed, revoked, modified or amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=325266 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907134306/http://www.philstar.com/ArticlePrinterFriendly.aspx?articleId=325266 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 7, 2012 |title=Imee's '20–20' |work=The Philippine Star |date=March 10, 2006 |first=Marichu A. |last=Villanueva |accessdate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, his twenty years in power represent the bloodiest in the history of Philippines, with more extra judicial killings of civic people than those that occurred during parallel Latin American dictators like [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]. More importantly, many people who rose to power under Marcos continued to remain in power or even ascended higher after his exile, thus leaving a further imprint on present-day Filipino affairs. One of these was [[Fidel Ramos]], a general promoted by Marcos who supervised many terror killings and tortures, who later switched sides and subsequently fought elections and became president himself.&lt;ref name="mccoy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCoy|first1=Alfred|title=Dark Legacy: Human rights under the Marcos regime|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/062.html|website=www.hartford-hwp.com|publisher=Kim Scipes / extracts from "Closer Than Brothers: Manhood at the Philippine Military Academy" (New Haven: Yale University Press)|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Massive foreign loans also enabled Marcos to build more schools, hospitals and infrastructure than all of his predecessors combined,&lt;ref name="lacsamana1990p189" /&gt; but at great cost. Today, according to Ibon Foundation, Filipino citizens are still bearing the heavy burden of servicing public debts incurred during Marcos's administration, with ongoing interest payments on the loan schedule by the Philippine government estimated to last until 2025–59 years after Marcos assumed office and 39 years after he was kicked out.&lt;ref name="ibonMarcosDept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-33/4-33-marcosdebt.html|title=Taxpayers To Pay Marcos Debt Until 2025, IBON features Vol X No. 42|last=Padilla|first=Arnold|publisher=[[Ibon Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corazon Aquino had an opportunity to default and not pay foreign debt incurred during the Marcos administration. However, due to Finance Secretary [[Jaime Ongpin]]'s warning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/10/business/philippine-debt-dispute.html|title=Philippine Debt Dispute|first=|last=Reuters|date=August 10, 1987|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the consequences of a debt [[Default (finance)|default]], which includes isolating the country from the international financial community and hampering the economic recovery, Corazon Aquino honored all the debts incurred during the Marcos Administration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2011/02/cory-aquinos-betrayal-of-people-power/|title=Cory Aquino's betrayal of 'People Power'|website=asiancorrespondent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to expectations of left-learning organizations like Ibon foundation which advocated for non-payment of debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-33/4-33-marcosdebt.html|title=Bulatlat.com|website=www.bulatlat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime Ongpin, who is a brother of Marcos trade minister [[Roberto Ongpin]], was later dismissed by Cory Aquino and later died in an apparent suicide after "he had been depressed about infighting in Aquino's cabinet and disappointed that the 'People Power' uprising which had toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos had not brought significant change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/737701/ongpin-last-top-official-take-his-life|title=Ongpin last top official to take his life|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 Global Transparency Report, Marcos appeared in the list of the World's Most Corrupt Leaders, listed in second place behind [[Suharto]], the former President of Indonesia.&lt;ref name="transparency.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921295.html |title=World's Ten Most Corrupt Leaders1 |publisher=Infoplease.com Source: Transparency International Global Corruption Report 2004.|date= |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jovito Salonga]], [[monopoly|monopolies]] in several vital industries were created and placed under the control of [[Marcos Cronies|Marcos cronies]], such as the [[coconut]] industries (under [[Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]]), the [[tobacco]] industry (under [[Lucio Tan]]), the [[banana]] industry (under [[Antonio Floirendo]]), the [[sugar]] industry (under Roberto Benedicto), and [[manufacturing]] (under Herminio Disini and Ricardo Silverio). The Marcos and Romualdez families became owners, directly or indirectly, of the nation's largest corporations, such as the Philippine Long Distance Company (PLDC), of which the present name is [[Philippine Long Distance Telephone]] (PLDT), [[Philippine Airlines]] (PAL), [[Meralco]] (an electric company), [[PMFTC, Inc.|Fortune Tobacco]], numerous newspapers, radio and TV broadcasting companies (such as [[ABS-CBN]]), several banks (most notably the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank; PCIBank of the Lopezes [now [[BDO Unibank|BDO]] after merging with Equitable Bank and after BDO acquired the merged [[Equitable PCI Bank|Equitable PCI]]]), and [[real estate]] in New York, California and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/064.html |title=Jovito R.

During the ICIJ's (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists) expose of [[offshore leaks]] in April 2013, the name of his eldest daughter, [[Imee Marcos]], appeared on the list of wealthy people involved in offshore financial secrecy.

The court dismissed the interpleader lawsuit filed to determine the rights of 9,500 Filipino human rights victims (1972–1986) to recover USD35 million, part of a USD2 billion judgment in U.S. courts against the Marcos estate, because the Philippines government is an indispensable party, protected by [[sovereign immunity]].

'''Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa''' ({{IPA-pt|fɨɾˈnɐ̃du pɨˈsoɐ|lang}}; 13 June 1888 – 30 November 1935), commonly known as '''Fernando Pessoa''', was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the [[Portuguese language]]. He also wrote in and translated from English and French.

Pessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he dreamed up approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them ''pseudonyms'' because he felt that did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them [[Heteronym (literature)|''heteronyms'']]. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.

==Early years in Durban==

[[File:Fernando Pessoa Largo de São Carlos2035.JPG|thumb|200px|Pessoa's birthplace: a large flat at São Carlos Square, just in front of Lisbon's opera.]]
Pessoa was born in [[Lisbon]] on 13 June 1888. When Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pessôa, died of [[tuberculosis]] and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.

After the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to João Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa in the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Durban]], capital of the former British [[Colony of Natal]]. Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:

[[File:FP triciclo.jpg|thumb|200px| Last year in Lisbon before moving to Durban, 1894, aged 6.]]

{{bquote 
|There is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 July 1893. My mother's second marriage (which took place on 30 December 1895) is another date which I can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results – the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming Portuguese Consul in Durban (Natal), I was educated there, this English education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.
The dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):

1st. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon beginning January 1896.

Return – left Durban in the afternoon of 1st. August 1901.

The young Pessoa received his early education at St. Joseph Convent School, a Catholic grammar school run by Irish and French nuns. He moved to the [[Durban High School]] in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature. During the [[Matriculation examination|Matriculation Examination]], held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the [[University of Cape Town]]), in November 1903 he was awarded the recently created [[Queen Victoria]] Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, in the evening shift.

[[File:Pessoa 1898.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in Durban, 1898, aged 10.]]

Meanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.&lt;ref name = "Zenith, Richard 2008"&gt;Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias Século XX: Fernando Pessoa'', Lisboa: Círculo de Leitores.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of sixteen, ''[[The Natal Mercury]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themercury.co.za/ ''The Natal Mercury'']&lt;/ref&gt; (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem "Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...", under the name of C. R. Anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: "I read with great amusement...". In December, ''The Durban High School Magazine'' published his essay "Macaulay".&lt;ref&gt;Monteiro, Maria da Encarnação (1961), ''Incidências Inglesas na Poesia de Fernando Pessoa, Coimbra:  author ed.''&lt;/ref&gt; From February to June 1905, in the section "The Man in the Moon", ''The Natal Mercury'' also published at least four sonnets by Fernando Pessoa: "Joseph Chamberlain", "To England I", "To England II" and "Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, H. D. (1984), ''Os Dois Exilios'', Porto: Centro de Estudos Pessoanos&lt;/ref&gt; His poems often carried humorous versions of [[Anonymity|Anon]] as the author's name. Pessoa started using [[pen names]] quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a French noble. In addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other meaningful names.

In the preface to ''The Book of Disquiet'', Pessoa wrote about himself:

{{bquote|Nothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd. The circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon – perhaps, in fact, it’s true for all lives – of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.}}

[[File:Pessoa13.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pessoa in 1901, aged 13.]]
The young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:
{{bquote |I cannot tell you exactly how long I knew him, but the period during which I received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together. How old he was at this time I don’t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]

He was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]

He was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of "spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness". [...]

He took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford E. Geerdts, letter to ''Dr. Faustino Antunes'', 10 April 1907. In Pessoa, Fernando (2003). ''Escritos Autobiográficos, Automáticos e de Reflexão Pessoal'', ed. Richard Zenith. Lisboa: Assírio &amp; Alvim, pp. 394–398.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ten years after his arrival, he sailed for [[Lisbon]] via the [[Suez Canal]] on board the "Herzog", leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems "Opiário" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]]) published in March 1915, in ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' nr.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23620 ''Orpheu'' nr.1]&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ode Marítima" (dedicated to the futurist painter [[Santa-Rita Pintor]]) published in June 1915, in ''Orpheu'' nr.2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23621 | title = Orpheu | issue = 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[Álvaro de Campos]].

==Adult life in Lisbon==

[[File:Papel timbrado da Empresa Ibis 1.jpg|thumb|200px|"Ibis Enterprise", the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.]]

While his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. After a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a [[student strike]] against the dictatorship of Prime Minister [[João Franco]] put an end to his formal studies. Pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at  R.G. Dun &amp; Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&amp;B, Dun &amp; Bradstreet). His grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the "Empreza Ibis". The venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name [[ibis]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibe name "ibis" has a very long literary tradition: the elegiac poem ''Ibis'' by [[Ovid]] was inspired in the lost poem of the same title by [[Callimachus]].&lt;/ref&gt; the sacred bird of [[Ancient Egypt]] and inventor of the alphabet in [[Greek mythology]], would remain an important symbolic reference for him.

Pessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] and Crown Prince [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Luís Filipe]] in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful [[5 October 1910 revolution|republican revolution]] in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Portuguese | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | series = Fotobiografias do Século XX | title = Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = Círculo de Leitores | page = 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal ''A Águia'', which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-[[Camões]]. In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa, [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]] and [[Almada Negreiros]], created the literary magazine ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://purl.pt/12089/2/ | language = Portuguese | title = Orpheu | editor-first = António | editor-last = Ferro | place = Lisboa | date = Jan–Mar 1915 | publisher = Orpheu, Lda. | issue = 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced [[modernist]] literature to Portugal. Only two issues were published (Jan–Feb–Mar and Apr–May–Jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties. Lost for many years, this issue was finally recovered and published in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = Portuguese | title = Orpheu | editor-first = Arnaldo | editor-last = Saraiva | place = Lisboa | publisher = Edições Ática | issue = 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other writers and poets, ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' published Pessoa, orthonym, and the modernist [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]], Álvaro de Campos.

Along with the artist Ruy Vaz, Pessoa also founded the art journal ''Athena'' (1924–25),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://casafernandopessoa.cm-lisboa.pt/bdigital/0-28MN/2/0-28MN_item2/index.html | language = Portuguese | title = Athena | date = Oct 1924 – Feb 1925 | editor-first = Fernando Pessoa | editor-last = Ruy Vaz | place = Lisboa | publisher = Imprensa Libanio da Silva | issue = 1–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he published verses under the  [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]] Alberto Caeiro and Ricardo Reis. Along with his profession, as free-lance commercial translator, Fernando Pessoa undertook intense activity as a writer, literary critic and political analyst, contributing to the journals and newspapers ''A Águia'' (1912–13), ''A República'' (1913), ''Theatro'' (1913), ''A Renascença'' (1914), ''O Raio'' (1914), ''A Galera'' (1915), ''Orpheu'' (1915), ''O Jornal'' (1915), ''Eh Real!'' (1915), ''Exílio'' (1916), ''Centauro'' (1916), ''A Ideia Nacional'' (1916), ''Terra Nossa'' (1916), ''O Heraldo'' (1917), ''Portugal Futurista'' (1917), ''Acção'' (1919–20), ''Ressurreição'' (1920), ''Contemporânea'' (1922–26), ''Athena'' (1924–25), ''Diário de Lisboa'' (1924–35), ''Revista de Comércio e Contabilidade'' (1926), ''Sol'' (1926), ''O Imparcial'' (1927), ''Presença'' (1927–34), ''Revista Solução Editora'' (1929–1931), ''Notícias Ilustrado'' (1928–30), ''Girassol'' (1930), ''Revolução'' (1932), ''Descobrimento'' (1932), ''Fama'' (1932–33), ''Fradique'' (1934) and ''Sudoeste'' (1935).

==Pessoa the ''flâneur''==

[[File:Pessoabaixa.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa, [[flâneur|a ''flâneur'']] in the streets of Lisbon.]]

After his return to Portugal, when he was seventeen, Pessoa barely left his beloved city of Lisbon, which inspired the poems "Lisbon Revisited" (1923 and 1926), under the [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[Álvaro de Campos]]. From 1905 to 1920, when his family returned from [[Pretoria]] after the death of his stepfather, he lived in fifteen different locations in the city,&lt;ref&gt;Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias do Século XX: Fernando Pessoa''. Lisboa: Círculo de Leitores, pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt; moving from one rented room to another depending on his fluctuating finances and personal troubles.

Pessoa adopted the detached perspective of the [[flâneur]] ''Bernardo Soares'', another of his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]].&lt;ref&gt;Guerreiro, Ricardina (2004), ''De Luto por Existir: a melancolia de Bernardo Soares à luz de Walter Benjamin''. Lisboa: Assírio &amp; Alvim, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; This character was supposedly an accountant, working for ''Vasques'', the boss of an office located in Douradores Street. ''Soares'' also supposedly lived in the same downtown street, a world that Pessoa knew quite well due to his long career as freelance correspondence translator. Indeed, from 1907 until his death in 1935, Pessoa worked in twenty-one firms located in Lisbon's downtown, sometimes in two or three of them simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa, João Rui de (2010), ''Fernando Pessoa Empregado de Escritório'', 2nd ed. Lisboa: Assírio &amp; Alvim.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Book of Disquiet]]'', ''Bernardo Soares'' describes some of those typical places and its "atmosphere". In his daydream soliloquy he also wrote about Lisbon in the first half of 20th Century. ''Soares'' describes crowds in the streets, buildings, shops, traffic, river Tagus, the weather, and even its author, Fernando Pessoa:

[[File:Brasileira 1911.jpg|thumb|200px|Coffee house "[[A Brasileira]]", established in 1905, the year Pessoa returned to Lisbon.]]

{{bquote 
|Fairly tall and thin, he must have been about thirty years old. He hunched over terribly when sitting down but less so standing up, and he dressed with a carelessness that wasn’t entirely careless. In his pale, uninteresting face there was a look of suffering that didn’t add any interest, and it was difficult to say just what kind of suffering this look suggested. It seemed to suggest various kinds: hardships, anxieties, and the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having already suffered a lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 2002 | title = The Book of Disquiet| place = London | publisher = Penguin Books | isbn =  978-0-14-118304-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A statue of Pessoa sitting at a table (below) can be seen outside [[A Brasileira]], one of the preferred places of young writers and artists of [[Geração de Orpheu|''Orpheu'''s group]] during the 1910s. This coffeehouse, in the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] district of [[Chiado]], is quite close to Pessoa's birthplace: 4, São Carlos Square (in front of the Opera House, where stands another statue of the writer),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saocarlos.pt/ Teatro Nacional de São Carlos], Lisbon's Opera House.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most elegant neighborhoods of Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Dias | first = Marina Tavares | year = 2002 | title = Lisboa nos Passos de Pessoa: uma cidade revisitada através da vida e da obra do poeta |trans-title=Lisbon in Pessoa's footsteps: a Lisbon tour through the life and poetry of Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = Quimera}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Pessoa was a frequent customer at Martinho da Arcada, a centennial coffeehouse in Comercio Square, surrounded by ministries, almost an "office" for his private business and literary concerns, where he used to meet friends in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1925, Pessoa wrote in English a guidebook to Lisbon but it remained unpublished until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.livroshorizonte.pt/catalogo_detalhe.php?idLivro=895 | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | title = Lisboa: o que o turista deve ver | language = Portuguese, English | place = Lisboa | publisher = Livros Horizonte | edition = 3rd | year = 2006 | origyear = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 2008 | title = Lisbon: what the tourist should see | place = Exeter, UK | publisher = Shearsman Books | access-date = 28 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110402025713/http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/catalog/2008/pessoa_lisbon.html | archive-date = 2 April 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and occultism==

Pessoa translated a number of Portuguese books into English,&lt;ref&gt;Botto, António (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5OLjUwbV34sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Botto&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oZWQT42cG4LC0QWVy_jSAQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Botto&amp;f=false ''The Songs of António Botto''] translated by Fernando Pessoa. Edited and with an introduction By Josiah Blackmore. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-7101-4}},&lt;/ref&gt; and into Portuguese ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]],&lt;ref&gt;Published in a serial in the Portuguese Journal ''Ilustração'', from 1 January 1926, without a reference to the translator, as usual.&lt;/ref&gt; and the short stories "The Theory and the Hound", "The Roads We Take" and "Georgia's Ruling" by [[O. Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Athena'' nr. 3, December 1924, pp. 89–102 and nr. 5, February 1925, pp. 173–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa also translated into Portuguese the poetry "[[Godiva]]" by [[Alfred Tennyson]], "[[Lucy]]" by [[William Wordsworth]], "[[Barbara Frietchie]]" by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]],&lt;ref&gt;''A Biblioteca Internacional de Obras Célebres'', volumes VI pp. 2807-2809, VII pp. 3534-3535, XX pp. 10215‑10218.&lt;/ref&gt; "Catarina to Camoens" by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]],&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Pessoa, ''Obra Poética'', Rio de Janeiro: José Aguilar Editora, 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[The Raven]]", "[[Annabel Lee]]" and "[[Ulalume]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]&lt;ref&gt;''Athena'' nr. 1, October 1924, pp. 27–29 and nr. 4, January 1925, pp 161–164.&lt;/ref&gt; who, along with [[Walt Whitman]], strongly influenced him.

As a translator, Pessoa had his own method:

[[File:Pessoa medium.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa's mediumship: &lt;br/&gt;Automatic writing sample.]]

{{bquote 
|A poem is an intellectualized impression, an idea made emotion, communicated by others by means of a rhythm. This rhythm is double in one, like the concave and convex aspects of the same arc: it is made up of a verbal or musical rhythm and of a visual or image rhythm which concurs inwardly with it. The translation of a poem should therefore conform absolutely (1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem, (2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image.
It was on this criterion that I based my translation into Portuguese of Poe’s “Annabel Lee” and “Ulalume”, which I translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1967 | title = Páginas de Estética e de Teoria e Crítica Literárias| place = Lisbon | publisher = Ática | isbn = }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, Pessoa translated into Portuguese some books by the leading [[theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], and [[Mabel Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://purl.pt/14427/2/ ''A Voz do Silêncio''] (The Voice of Silence) at the Portuguese National Library.
&lt;br/&gt;Besant, Annie (1915), ''Os Ideaes da Theosophia'', Lisboa: Livraria Clássica Editora.&lt;br/&gt;
Leadbeater, C. W. (1915), ''Compêndio de Theosophia'', Lisboa: Livraria Clássica Editora.&lt;br/&gt;

Collins, Mabel (1916), ''Luz Sobre o Caminho e o Karma'', Lisboa: Livraria Clássica Editora.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912–14, while living with his aunt "Anica" and cousins,&lt;ref&gt;Ana Luísa Pinheiro Nogueira, his mother's sister was also his godmother, a widow with two children, Maria and Mário. She traveled to Switzerland in November 1914, with her daughter and son-in-law, recently married.&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa took part in "semi-spiritualist sessions" that were carried out at home, but he was considered a "delaying element" by the other members of the session. Pessoa's interest in [[spiritualism]] was truly awakened in the second half of 1915, while translating theosophist books. This was further deepened in the end of March 1916, when he suddenly started having experiences where he became a [[Mediumship|medium]], which were revealed through [[automatic writing]]. On 24 June, Pessoa wrote an impressive letter to his aunt and godmother, then living in Switzerland with her daughter and son in law, in which he describes this "mystery case" that surprised him.

Besides automatic writing, Pessoa stated also that he had "astral" or "etherial visions" and was able to see "magnetic auras" similar to radiographic images. He felt "more curiosity than fear", but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because "there is no advantage, but many disadvantages" in speaking about this. Mediumship exerted a strong influence in Pessoa's writings, who felt "sometimes suddenly being owned by something else" or having a "very curious sensation" in the right arm, which was "lifted into the air" without his will. Looking in the mirror, Pessoa saw several times what appeared to be the [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]]: his "face fading out" and being replaced by the one of "a bearded man", or another one, four men in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1999 | title = Correspondência 1905–1922 | place = Lisbon | publisher = Assírio &amp; Alvim | isbn = 978-85-7164-916-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carta astral ricardo reis.jpg|thumb|200px|Astral chart of the [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] ''Ricardo Reis'' by Fernando Pessoa.]]

Pessoa also developed a strong interest in [[astrology]], becoming a competent astrologist. He elaborated more than 1,500 [[astrological chart]]s, including well-known people like [[William Shakespeare]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Chopin]], [[Robespierre]], [[Napoleon I]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Wilhelm II]], [[Leopold II of Belgium]], [[Victor Emmanuel III]], [[Alfonso XIII]], or the Kings [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebastian]] and [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles]] of Portugal, and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]. In 1915, he created the heteronym ''Raphael Baldaya'', an astrologist who planned to write "System of Astrology" and "Introduction to the Study of Occultism". Pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 [[Portuguese real|réis]] and made horoscopes of customers, friends and also himself and, astonishingly, of the heteronyms and also of journals as ''Orpheu''.

Born on 13 June, Pessoa was native of Gemini and had Scorpio as rising sign. The characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth. It means that Pessoa and his heteronyms altogether comprised the full principles of ancient knowledge. Those heteronyms were designed according to their [[horoscope]]s, all including [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the planet of literature. Astrology was part of his everyday life and Pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Cardoso | first = Paulo | year = 2011 | title = Fernando Pessoa, cartas astrológicas | place = Lisbon | publisher = Bertrand editora | isbn = 978-972-25-2261-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: FP_last_writing.jpg|thumb|300px|Pessoa's last writing: 29-11-1935 &lt;br/&gt;"''I know not what tomorrow will bring''". &lt;br/&gt; He died next day, 30 November 1935.]]

As a [[mysticist]], Pessoa was an enthusiast of [[esotericism]], [[occultism]], [[hermetism]], [[numerology]] and [[alchemy]]. Along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to [[neopaganism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], [[rosicrucianism]] and [[freemasonry]], which strongly influenced his literary work. He has declared himself a Pagan, in the sense of an "intellectual mystic of the sad race of the Neoplatonists from Alexandria" and a believer in "the Gods, their agency and their real and materially superior existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://multipessoa.net/labirinto/filosofia/17|title= Pessoa é solicitado para escrever um volume teórico de introdução ao Neopaganismo Português|author=Pessoa, Fernando |date= 1917|website= |publisher= MultiPessoa|access-date= 13 February 2018|language=Portuguese |quote=Eu sou um pagão decadente, do tempo do outono da Beleza; do sonolecer [?] da limpidez antiga, místico intelectual da raça triste dos neoplatónicos da Alexandria.

Como eles creio nos semi-deuses, os homens que o esforço e a (...) ergueram ao sólio dos imortais; porque, como disse Píndaro, «a raça dos deuses e dos homens é uma só».

Creio, como os neoplatónicos, no Intermediário Intelectual, Logos na linguagem dos filósofos, Cristo (depois) na mitologia cristã.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His interest in occultism led Pessoa to correspond with [[Aleister Crowley]] and later helped him to elaborate a fake suicide, when Crowley visited Portugal in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.nthposition.com/themagicalworldof.php | publisher = Nthposition | title = The magical world of Fernando Pessoa}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa translated Crowley's poem "Hymn To Pan"&lt;ref&gt;''Presença'' nr. 33 (July–October 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; into Portuguese, and the catalogue of Pessoa's library shows that he possessed Crowley's books ''Magick in Theory and Practice'' and ''Confessions''. Pessoa also wrote on Crowley's doctrine of [[Thelema]] in several fragments, including ''Moral''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Pessoa's declared about secret societies:

{{bquote |I am also very interested in knowing whether a second edition is shortly to be expected of Athur Edward Waite’s ''The Secret Tradition in Freemasonery''.

For all I know, you may already have issued such an edition; if so, I have missed the reference in ''The Times Literary Supplement''. Since I am writing on these subjects, I should like to put a question which perhaps you can reply to; but please do not do so if the reply involves any inconvenience. I believe ''The Occult Review'' was, or is, issued by yourselves; I have not seen any number for a long time.

Literary critic [[Martin Lüdke]] described Pessoa's philosophy as a kind of [[pandeism]], especially those writings under the [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] Alberto Caeiro.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Lüdke]], "Ein moderner Hüter der Dinge; Die Entdeckung des großen Portugiesen geht weiter: Fernando Pessoa hat in der Poesie Alberto Caeiros seinen Meister gesehen", ("A modern guardian of things; The discovery of the great Portuguese continues: Fernando Pessoa saw its master in the poetry of Alberto Caeiro"), ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 18 August 2004.

Sein Pan-Deismus basiert auf einer Ding-[[metaphysics|Metaphysik]], die in der modernen Dichtung des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts noch Schule machen sollte." ''Translation'': "Caeiro interposes the distinction between the light and what "philosopher thoughts" want to constitute behind him. The things, as he sees them, are as they seem. His pandeism is based on a metaphysical thing, which should still become a school of thought under the modern seal of the twentieth century."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing a lifetime==
[[File:Pessoacopo.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in 1929, drinking a glass of wine in a tavern of Lisbon's downtown.]]

In his early years, Pessoa was influenced by major English classic poets such as [[Shakespeare]], [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], or romantics like [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Wordsworth]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | title = Fotobiografias do Século XX: Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = Círculo de Leitores | pages = 40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Lisbon in 1905, Pessoa was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolists]] and [[decadentism|decadentists]] [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Maurice Rollinat]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]; mainly by [[Portuguese poetry|Portuguese poets]] as [[Antero de Quental]], [[Gomes Leal]], [[Cesário Verde]], [[António Nobre]], [[Camilo Pessanha]] or [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]]. Later on, he was also influenced by [[modernism|modernists]] as [[W. B. Yeats]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]], among many other writers.&lt;ref name= "Zenith, Richard 2008"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], Pessoa wrote to a number of British publishers, namely Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. (currently [[Constable &amp; Robinson]]), in order to print his collection of English verse ''The Mad Fiddler'' (unpublished during his lifetime), but it was refused. However, in 1920, the prestigious literary journal ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' included one of those poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Terlinden | first = Anne | year = 1990 | title = Fernando Pessoa, the bilingual Portuguese poet: A Critical Study of "The Mad Fidler" | place = Bruxelles | publisher = Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pofTVSteuaIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-2-8028-0075-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the British publication failed, in 1918 Pessoa published in Lisbon two slim volumes of English verse: ''[[Antinous]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://purl.pt/13961/2/ | title = Antinous | publisher = at the Portuguese National Library}}f.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[35 Sonnets]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.pt/13963/2/ ''35 Sonnets''] at the Portuguese National Library.&lt;/ref&gt; received by the British literary press without enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Literary Supplement'', 19 September 1918. ''Athenaeum'', January 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with some friends, he founded another publishing house, Olisipo, which published in 1921 a further two English poetry volumes: ''English Poems I–II'' and ''English Poems III'' by Fernando Pessoa. In his publishing house, Olisipo, Pessoa issued also some books by his friends: ''A Invenção do Dia Claro'' (The invention of the clear day) by [[José de Almada Negreiros]], ''Canções'' (Songs) by [[António Botto]], and ''Sodoma Divinizada'' (Divinized Sodome) by [[Raul Leal]] (Henoch).&lt;ref&gt;Pessoa translated into English the poetry book ''Songs'' by António Botto ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5OLjUwbV34sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=antonio+botto&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gd7FUIihK8jOhAefqICABA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=antonio%20botto&amp;f=false ''The Songs of António Botto, translated by Fernando Pessoa'']) and left unfinished the translation of ''The invention of the clear day'' by Almada Negreiros&lt;/ref&gt; Olisipo closed down in 1923, following the scandal known as "Literatura de Sodoma" (Literature of Sodome), which Pessoa started with his paper "António Botto e o Ideal Estético em Portugal" (António Botto and the aesthetical ideal in Portugal), published in the journal ''Contemporanea''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/CONTEMPORANEA/Contemporanea.htm''Contemporanea''], May–July 1922, pp. 121–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, Pessoa described himself as "a British-style conservative, that is to say, liberal within conservatism and absolutely anti-reactionary," and adhered closely to the [[Herbert Spencer|Spencerian]] individualism of his upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreto |first1=Jose |title=Salazar and the New State in the Writings of Fernando Pessoa |journal=Portuguese Studies |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his brand of nationalism as "mystic, cosmopolitan, liberal, and anti-Catholic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreto |first1=Jose |title=Salazar and the New State in the Writings of Fernando Pessoa |journal=Portuguese Studies |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an outspoken elitist and aligned himself against communism, socialism, fascism and Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Serrão (int. and org.) | first = Joel | year = 1980 | title = Fernando Pessoa, Ultimatum e Páginas de Sociologia Política | place = Lisboa | publisher = Ática.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He initially rallied to the [[First Portuguese Republic]] but the ensuing instability caused him to reluctantly support the military coups of 1917 and [[28 May 1926 coup d'état|1926]] as a means of restoring order and preparing the transition to a new constitutional normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreto |first1=Jose |title=Salazar and the New State in the Writings of Fernando Pessoa |journal=Portuguese Studies |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=170-172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sadlier |first1=Darlene J. |title=Nationalism, Modernity, and the Formation of Fernando Pessoa's Aesthetic |journal=Luso-Brazilian Review |date=Winter 1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a pamphlet in 1928 supportive of the military dictatorship but after the establishment of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]], in 1933, Pessoa became disenchanted with the regime and wrote critically of Salazar and fascism in general, maintaining a hostile stance towards its corporatist program, illiberalism, and censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreto |first1=Jose |title=Salazar and the New State in the Writings of Fernando Pessoa |journal=Portuguese Studies |date=2008 |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=170-173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 1935, Pessoa was banned by the Salazar regime, after he wrote in defense of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlene Joy Sadlier ''An introduction to Fernando Pessoa: modernism and the paradoxes of authorship'', University Press of Florida, 1998, pp. 44–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maconaria.net/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79 Maconaria.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The regime also suppressed two articles Pessoa wrote in which he condemned Mussolini's [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invasion of Abyssinia]] and fascism as a threat to human liberty everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barreto |first1=José |title=Fernando Pessoa e a invasão da Abissínia pela Itália fascista |journal=Análise Social |date=2009 |volume=XLIV |issue=193 |pages=693-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 1935, Pessoa was taken to the Hospital de São Luís, suffering from abdominal pain and a high fever; there he wrote, in English, his last words: "I know not what tomorrow will bring."&lt;ref name="Ciuraru"&gt;[https://www.poetrysociety.org/psa/poetry/crossroads/tributes/fernando_pessoa_his_heteronyms/ Fernando Pessoa &amp; His Heteronyms], by Carmela Ciuraru&lt;/ref&gt; He died the next day, 30 November 1935, around 8 pm, aged 47.

In his lifetime, he published four books in English and one alone in Portuguese: ''Mensagem'' (Message). However, he left a lifetime of unpublished, unfinished or just sketchy work in a domed, wooden trunk (25,574&lt;ref&gt;Caption to photo 32, opposite page 115, in: Lisboa, E. and Taylor, L. C., eds; with an introduction by Paz, O. (1995), ''A Centenary Pessoa'', Manchester: Carcanet Press Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; manuscript and typed pages which have been housed in the Portuguese National Library since 1988). The heavy burden of editing this huge work is still in progress. In 1985 (fifty years after his death), Pessoa's remains were moved to the [[Jerónimos Monastery|Hieronymites Monastery]], in Lisbon, where [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Luís de Camões]], and [[Alexandre Herculano]] are also buried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosteirojeronimos.pt/pt/index.php?s=white&amp;pid=227&amp;identificador Mosteiro dos Jerónimos] Fernando Pessoa&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa's portrait was on the 100[[Portuguese escudo|-escudo]] banknote.

==Heteronyms==
[[File:Lisboa-Pessoa-A Brasileira-1.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa's statue outside Lisbon's famous coffeehouse «[[A Brasileira]]».]]

Pessoa's earliest [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]], at the age of six, was '''Chevalier de Pas'''. Other childhood heteronyms included '''Dr. Pancrácio''' and '''David Merrick''', followed by '''Charles Robert Anon''', an English young man that became Pessoa's ''[[alter ego]]''. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the [[University of Lisbon]], '''Alexander Search''' took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search is English, he was born in Lisbon as his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another ''alter ego'', '''Álvaro de Campos''', supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer, born in [[Tavira]] and graduated in [[Glasgow]]. Translator Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith, Penguin classics, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pessoa himself, there were three main heteronyms: '''Alberto Caeiro''', '''Álvaro de Campos''' and '''Ricardo Reis'''. The heteronyms possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pessoa wrote on the heteronyms:
{{bquote |How do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as "me myself" instead of "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...).&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Pessoa, letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13 January 1935, transl. by Richard Zenith, in Pessoa, Fernando (2003), ''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith. London: Penguin classics, p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Alberto Caeiro===

Alberto Caeiro was Pessoa's first great heteronym; it is summarized by Pessoa as follows: "He sees things with the eyes only, not with the mind. He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower... the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him... this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it. The stupendous fact about Caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absence of sentiment, he makes poetry."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

What this means, and what makes Caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.

He manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. [[Octavio Paz]] called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.&lt;ref&gt;Paz, Octavio (1983), "El Desconocido de Si Mismo: Fernando Pessoa", in ''Los Signos en Rotacion y Otros Ensayos'', Madrid: Alianza Editorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.

Caeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.

As such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply—is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply—are.

Caeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Pessoa, Fernando, Notas Para Recordação do Meu Mestre Caeiro ''in Presença'' nr. 30, Jan.-Feb. 1930, Coimbra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro—who was Pessoa's first major heteronym—as essential in founding the later poetic ''personas'': By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.&lt;ref&gt;Sheets, Jane M., Fernando Pessoa as Anti-Poet: Alberto Caeiro, ''in Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', Vol. XLVI, Nr. 1, January 1969, pp. 39–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ricardo Reis===
In a letter to William Bentley,&lt;ref&gt;This letter, to the director of the journal ''Portugal'', was written on 31 October 1924, to announce Pessoa's art journal ''Athena''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pessoa wrote that "a ''knowledge'' of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of [[António Vieira]], as his stile and diction that of [[Horace]] (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')".&lt;ref&gt;Pessoa, Fernando (1999), ''Correspondência 1923–1935'', ed. Manuela Parreira da Silva. Lisboa: Assírio &amp; Alvim, p.53, {{ISBN|972-37-0531-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reis, both a character and a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Marilyn Scarantino|title=Pessoa's Poetic Coterie: Three Heteronyms and an Orthonym|journal=Luso-Brazilian Review|date=1 January 1977|volume=14|issue=2|pages=254–262 |jstor=3513064}}&lt;/ref&gt; sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, "See life from a distance. Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you." Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility. "Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.

Believing in the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]], yet living in a [[Christian]] Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his [[epicureanism|epicureanist]] philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.

Where Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, "the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes".

In his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural ("My sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right."), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.

Ricardo Reis is the main character of [[José Saramago]]'s 1986 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]''.

===Álvaro de Campos===
{{Main|Álvaro de Campos}}

Álvaro de Campos manifests, in a way, as an hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to [[Walt Whitman]]'s desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.

As a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.

One of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:

{{bquote|How should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?&lt;br&gt;
Be what I think? But I think of being so many things!}}

[[File:1edicao Mensagem 1934.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mensagem'', first edition, 1934.]]

''Mensagem'',&lt;ref name="FPMessagemEdEF2016"&gt;{{cite book |author-last= Pessoa |author-first= Fernando |editor-last= Freitas |editor-first= Eduardo |year=2016 |language= Portuguese 
|title= A Mensagem: Editado por Eduardo Filipe Freitas |website= amazon.com 
|location= |publisher= CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform
|url= https://www.amazon.com/Mensagem-Editado-Eduardo-Freitas-Portuguese/dp/1535199091/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473508471&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=eduardo+filipe+freitas
|isbn= 978-1-535-19909-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:&lt;ref&gt;''Message'', Tr. by [[Jonathan Griffin]], Exeter: Shearsman Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first, called "Brasão" (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese coat of arms]]. The first two poems ("The castles" and "The escutcheons") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the [[Portuguese discoveries|Golden Age of Discovery]].

The second Part, called "Mar Português" (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to [[Portuguese Empire|its seaborne Empire]] that ended with the death of [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] at [[Ksar el-Kebir|El-Ksar el Kebir]] (''Alcácer-Quibir'' in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.

The third Cycle, called "O Encoberto" ("The Hidden One"), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the [[Fifth Empire]] (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come Science (understanding) through a reawakening of "The Hidden One", or "King Sebastian". The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.

King Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.

One of the most famous quotes from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''O Infante'' (belonging to the second Part), which is ''Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce'' (which translates roughly to "God wishes, man dreams, the work is born"). Another well-known quote from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''Ulysses'', "O mito é o nada que é tudo" (a possible translation is "The myth is the nothing that is all"). This poem refers to  [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], king of [[Ithaca]], as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).&lt;ref&gt;

===Literary essays===

In 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as ''The New Portuguese Poetry'') for the cultural journal ''A Águia'' (The Eagle), founded in [[Porto|Oporto]], in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascença Portuguesa.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, Fernando Cabral (coord.) (2008). ''Dicionário de Fernando Pessoa e do Modernismo Português''. Alfragide: Editorial Caminho.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first years of the [[Portuguese Republic]], this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]], philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortesão, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called Saudosismo.&lt;ref&gt;The Portuguese Republic was founded by the revolution of 5 October 1910, giving freedom of association and publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Pessoa contributed to the journal ''A Águia'' with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nrs. 9,11 and 12). These writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]] and [[Mário Beirão]]. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. On the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet – a super-[[Camões]] – pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Pessoa, Fernando (1993). ''Textos de Crítica e de Intervenção''. Lisboa: Edições Ática.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical essays===
The philosophical notes of young Fernando Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of [[Philosophy]] more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length oscillates between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.

Pessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:

[[File:A Mensagem. Fernando Pessoa.jpg|thumb|300px|A passage from his famous poem "Mar Português" from "Message", in the city of [[Lagos, Portugal]].]]

# Relative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege "Spirit" or "Matter" as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.
# Absolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist "deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience".
# The materialistic [[Pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and the spiritualizing Pantheism of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], "admit that experience is a double manifestation of any thing that in its essence has no matter neither spirit".
# Considering both elements as an "illusory manifestation", of a transcendent and true and alone realities, there is [[Transcendentalism]], inclined into matter with [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], or into spirit, a position where [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] could be emplaced.
# A terminal system "the limited and summit of metaphysics" would not radicalize – as poles of experience one of the singled categories – matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as "the essence of the universe" and defends that "an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves". The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There ''is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of [[Hegel]].''
Such [[pantheist]] [[transcendentalism]] is used by Pessoa to define the project that "encompasses and exceeds all systems"; to characterize the new poetry of '''Saudosismo''' where the "typical contradiction of this system" occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive "to find in everything a beyond".

'''Frederick Augustus Aiken''' (September 20, 1832 – December 23, 1878) was an American [[lawyer]], [[journalist]] and [[soldier]]. A veteran of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Aiken was called on to serve as one of the defense attorneys for [[Mary Surratt]], who was tried for conspiracy in the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="TWitCW"&gt;[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=753/Frederick Aiken The Attorney - Historians Weigh In]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Information on Aiken's early life is largely unknown; his date of birth, city of birth, and even his full name varies depending on source. His official birth records, as well as the [[1840 United States Census|1840]] and [[1850 United States Census|1850]] census records, indicate that he was born Frederick Augustus Aiken on September 20, 1832, in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], to Susan (née Rice) and Solomon S. Aiken.&lt;ref name="AFC"&gt;[http://www.theamericanfilmcompany.com/films/detail/the-conspirator/ The American Film Company | Films]&lt;/ref&gt; His obituary in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' uses the middle name "Argyle", an 1837 birth year, and claims he was born in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name="Aikenbio"&gt;[http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=287 Frederick A. Aiken biography | This Week in the Civil War]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[Hardwick, Vermont]] when Aiken was ten years old. He attended [[Middlebury College]] where he studied journalism, and later became editor of the ''Burlington Sentinel''. Aiken married Sarah Weston, daughter of a Vermont judge, on June 1, 1857. In 1859 he was admitted to the Vermont bar, and in 1860 the Aikens moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where Aiken served as secretary to the [[Democratic National Committee]] and supported the candidacy of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Breckinridge]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. When the Civil War began, Aiken also wrote a letter to [[Jefferson Davis]], offering his services to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] as a reporter.&lt;ref name="AFC"/&gt;

==Civil War==
Despite his [[Doughface|apparent sympathies]] for the Confederacy as indicated by his support of Breckinridge (who became a general in the Confederate Army) and his letter to Davis, Aiken served in the [[Union Army]] during the Civil War, but like his birth records, his war service also remains largely unknown, other than the fact that he had earned the rank of [[colonel]] by war's end.&lt;ref name="Aikenbio"/&gt; Two pieces of correspondence concerning his war service appear in the [[Official Records of the American Civil War|Official Records of the War of the Rebellion]]. The first is a dispatch from then-Captain Aiken to General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]] during the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] in 1862, referring to Aiken as an acting aide-de-camp; the other is a dispatch from Hancock himself, praising Aiken and other officers, and referring to him as a volunteer aide-de-camp to Hancock's division commander, General [[William Farrar Smith]].&lt;ref name="AFC"/&gt; His obituary points to his being wounded in combat, including a battle during which he had two horses shot from under him, but it is not revealed what battles he participated in besides Williamsburg.&lt;ref name="Aikenbio"/&gt;

==Mary Surratt trial==
[[File:Mary Surratt.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[Mary Surratt]] in 1850]]
President Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, and his assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]], was himself killed less than two weeks later. Booth's accomplices were all arrested before the end of April, and brought before a military tribunal chaired by Major General [[David Hunter]]. The sole female defendant was Mary Surratt, the owner of the [[Mary E. Surratt Boarding House|boarding house]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] where Booth and the other conspirators had often met. Mrs. Surratt's official defense counsel was [[Reverdy Johnson]], a former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and then-[[United States Senate|Senator]] from Maryland; however, several members of the panel challenged Johnson's right to defend Surratt as he had objected to requiring [[Loyalty oath#Civil War and Reconstruction|loyalty oaths]] from voters during the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. Though the objection was withdrawn, Johnson nonetheless did not participate much in the process, and left much of the legal defense to Aiken and John Clampitt, who had recently set up their own law practice in Washington.

Still relatively new to their professions and without Johnson's active participation in the case, Aiken and Clampitt were woefully unprepared for their task. Their defense relied on trying to debunk the testimony of the prosecution's two chief witnesses, [[John M. Lloyd]] and [[Louis J. Weichmann]], but instead ended up strengthening the prosecution's case. Ultimately, the defense was unsuccessful, and Mary Surratt was sent to the gallows on July 7, 1865.&lt;ref name="TWitCW"/&gt;

Aiken's involvement in Mary Surratt's defense is dramatized in the 2010 film ''[[The Conspirator]]'', where he was portrayed by [[James McAvoy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0968264/&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the trial==
Aiken and Clampitt's law practice dissolved in 1866, likely as a result of the backlash of the trial. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Aiken was arrested in June 1866 when he cashed a check with a merchant but did not have the funds to cover the amount.&lt;ref name="AFC"/&gt; His obituary stated that he had also been tapped to serve as defense counsel for Jefferson Davis, but the former Confederate President was eventually released without trial.&lt;ref name="Aikenbio"/&gt; In 1868, Aiken returned to journalism, and served as the first city editor of the ''Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="AFC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aikenbio"/&gt;
[[Image:Frederickaikengrave.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The new gravestone for Frederick Aiken]]

Aiken died in Washington on December 23, 1878, as a result of heart-related illness, possibly resulting from wounds he incurred during the war. He is buried in [[Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)|Oak Hill Cemetery]] in Washington, where his grave was originally unmarked. However, the Surratt Society of [[Clinton, Maryland]] (the town formerly known as Surrattsville) conducted a campaign to raise funds to place a tombstone on the unmarked grave. On June 14, 2012, a gravestone was placed at the site, in a dedication ceremony attended by descendants of Aiken's family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boothiebarn.wordpress.com/2012/06/16/the-marking-of-frederick-aikens-grave/ The Marking of Frederick Aiken's Grave]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiken was portrayed by [[James McAvoy]] in the 2010 film ''[[The Conspirator]]'' which was directed by [[Robert Redford]].

'''Georgiana Burne-Jones, Lady Burne-Jones''' (Birmingham, 21 July 1840 – 2 February 1920), the second oldest of the [[MacDonald sisters|Macdonald sisters]], was the wife of [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]], mother of painter [[Philip Burne-Jones]], aunt of novelist [[Rudyard Kipling]], confidante and friend of [[William Morris]] and [[George Eliot]], and something of a painter and engraver in her own right. She was a Trustee of the [[South London Gallery]] and was elected to the parish Council of [[Rottingdean]], near [[Brighton]] in Sussex. 

She is known for the biography of her husband, ''The Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones'' and for publishing his ''[[The Flower Book (Edward Burne-Jones)|Flower Book]]''. She became the mother-in-law of [[John William Mackail]], who married her daughter Margaret. Their children were the novelists [[Angela Thirkell]] and [[Denis Mackail]].

==Early life==
Georgiana, always called "Georgie", was born in [[Birmingham]] on 21 July 1840,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; one of eight surviving children born to the Reverend George Browne Macdonald (1805–1868), a Methodist minister, and his second wife Hannah (née Jones) (1809–1875).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Macdonald family moved frequently since the usual time in each of George's postings was three years, returning to Birmingham in September 1850, where Georgiana's elder brother Harry attended [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]]. Through him Georgiana and her sisters were introduced to a group of students who would become known as the [[Birmingham Set]] or "Pembroke Set" at the [[University of Oxford]], most of whom were from Birmingham or had studied at King Edward's. Among them was the young [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (then plain Edward or Ned Jones).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 24–32&lt;/ref&gt; Edward went up to [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]], to study [[theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Newall|first=Christopher|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|title=Jones, Sir Edward Coley Burne-, first baronet (1833–1898)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4051|accessdate=26 November 2012|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he met [[William Morris]] as a consequence of a mutual interest in poetry. The two Exeter undergraduates formed a very close and intimate society, which they called "The Brotherhood", with other members of the Birmingham set. The members of the Brotherhood read [[John Ruskin]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]], visited churches, and worshipped the [[Middle Ages]]. At that time neither Burne-Jones nor Morris knew [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] personally, but both were much influenced by his works, and met him by recruiting him as a contributor to their ''Oxford and Cambridge Magazine'' which Morris founded in 1856 to promote their ideas.&lt;ref name="DNB1909"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Burne-Jones, Edward Coley|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Morris, William (1834–1896)|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Rossetti's influence both Burne-Jones and Morris decided to become artists, and Burne-Jones left college before taking a degree to pursue a career in art.

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti Drawing of Georgiana Burne-Jones.jpg|right|thumb|''Georgiana Burne-Jones'' by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, about the time of her marriage in 1860]]
Georgiana moved to London with her family in 1853, following the death of her sister Carrie from tuberculosis; first to Sloane Square, and then to 33 Walpole Street. The family then moved to 17 Beaumont Street in Marylebone, in August 1856. After a brief family relocation to Manchester, Georgiana moved on her marriage into Russell Street in 1860.&lt;ref name="Memorials"&gt;Burne-Jones (1904), ''The Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones'', Vol 1, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through her friendship with, and eventual engagement to Edward, at age 15 in June 1856, she was able to visit the studio where he worked with Rossetti and Morris. She was also introduced to John Ruskin. She said, "I wish it were possible to explain the impression made upon me as a young girl whose experience so far had been quite remote from art, by sudden and close intercourse with those to whom it was the breath of life... I felt in the presence of a new religion."&lt;ref name="Memorials"/&gt;

The artist [[Ford Madox Brown]] and his wife Emma invited Georgiana to an extended stay at their London home in April, 1860, so that she could spend time with Edward, and the two were married two months later.&lt;ref name="Flanders72"&gt;Flanders (2001), pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Green Summer (1864).jpg|right|thumb|''Green Summer'', watercolour by Edward Burne-Jones, 1864. Louisa and Agnes Macdonald, Jane Morris, and others listening to Georgiana reading aloud in the garden at Red House.]]
Georgiana and Edward married in Manchester on 9 June 1860. Georgiana was 19, and Edward 27. They had been engaged for four years to the day. Between them they had ₤30 and a deal table containing her engraving tools,&lt;ref name="Flanders72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd71"&gt;Todd (2001), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; but "Light-hearted indifference, however, to many things generally regarded as essential lent boldness to domestic arrangements, and I remember thinking it quite natural that in the middle of the morning I should ask our only maid - a pretty one - to stand for me that I may try to draw her; to which she, being good tempered as well as pretty, cheerfully consented."&lt;ref name="Memorials"/&gt;

Georgiana moved on her marriage into rented rooms in Great Russell Street.&lt;ref name="Memorials" /&gt; The early years of their marriage were idyllic; they spent a summer with William and [[Jane Morris]] at [[Red House (London)|Red House]], working together on decorating projects. Their first child, Philip, was born on 21 October 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; But in the summer of 1864 little Phil caught [[scarlet fever]], and Georgiana soon contracted the dread disease, which brought on the premature birth of her second child, Christopher, who was also infected and died soon after. Georgiana was ill for months, and on her recovery refused to return to their old rooms where so much tragedy had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2001), pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;
The family soon moved to 41 Kensington Square, and their daughter Margaret was born there in the summer of 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman (1998), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2001), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

After Georgiana's marriage, her sisters [[Louisa Baldwin|Louisa]], Alice and Agnes, married [[Alfred Baldwin (politician)|Alfred Baldwin]], [[John Lockwood Kipling]] and [[Edward Poynter]] respectively. Their youngest sister, Edith, cared for their parents in the family home and published a brief family history.&lt;ref name=Wolverhampton&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=David |title=A brief history of the Macdonald sisters |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/genealogy/Macdonald/page3.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419143305/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/genealogy/Macdonald/page3.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=20 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==

Georgiana attended the Government School of Design, which was part of the South Kensington museums complex in a building that is now part of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. Georgiana dismissed her time at the school in a single sentence in ''Memorials'' by saying she had not learned anything of importance.&lt;ref name="Memorials"/&gt;

In 1856, Georgiana took lessons from [[Ford Madox Brown]] and remembered, "Madox Brown's incredible kindness in allowing me and Miss Seddon, sister to his dead friend [[Thomas Seddon]] the artist, to come and try to paint from a model in his studio".&lt;ref name="Memorials"/&gt;

There are few surviving examples of her artwork. One of her woodcuts and a small, exquisitely coloured watercolour and pencil rendering of a dead bird show a focus on small scale personal drawings and woodcuts to be used as book illustrations. The bird was done in 1857 and is held by the [[Tate Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/macdonald-dead-bird-n04941 'Dead Bird', Georgina Macdonald (Lady Burne-Jones)] at tate.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, the decorative arts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co., "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," was jointly created by William Morris, Madox Brown, Burne-Jones, [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], Rossetti, [[Peter Paul Marshall|P. P. Marshall]], and [[Philip Webb]] to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Jane Morris directed the embroidery arm, and Georgiana was employed painting tiles,&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2001), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; but with the birth of her son Philip in October of that year she gave up the art studio to become a full-time caregiver. "I remember the feeling of exile with which I now heard through its closed door the well-known voices of friends together with Edward's familiar laugh, while I sat with my little son on my knee and dropped selfish tears on him as 'separator of companions and the terminator of delights'".&lt;ref name="Memorials"/&gt;  As late as 1868 she was still attempting to learn to etch but none of her work was published.

==Friendships==
[[File:Frederick Hollyer Morris and Burne-Jones Families 1874.jpg|right|thumb|The Morris and Burne-Jones families, 1874.]]
In 1867 the Burne-Jones family moved again, to the Grange, an 18th-century house set in a large garden in [[North End Road, Fulham|North End Road]], [[Fulham]], London. For much of the 1870s Burne-Jones did not exhibit, following a spate of bitterly hostile attacks in the press, and a passionate affair (described as the "emotional climax of his life"&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Wildman (1998), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;) with his Greek model [[Maria Zambaco]] which became a public scandal bordering on farce when she tried to commit [[suicide]] by throwing herself in [[Regent's Canal]] in 1869.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), p. 118-120&lt;/ref&gt; During these difficult years Georgiana developed a close friendship with William Morris, whose wife Jane had fallen in love with Rossetti. Morris and Georgiana may have been in love, but if he asked her to leave her husband (as some of his poetry of these years suggests), she refused.&lt;ref name=Flanders72 /&gt;

Of the Zambaco affair, which would sputter on for some years, Georgiana wrote to her dear friend [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]] "Dearest Rosalind, be hard on no one in this matter, and exalt no one, and may we all come through it at last. I know one thing, and that is that there is enough love between Edward and me to last out a long life if it is given us".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wildman (1998), p. 260. The letter is dated 18 February 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, the Burne-Joneses remained together for another 30 years, as did the Morrises. William Morris and Georgiana remained close until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders, ''Circle of Sisters'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Another close friend was [[George Eliot]], whom Georgiana met in February 1868. The self-educated novelist encouraged her young friend to make up for her lack of education, and Georgiana studied to improve her scant French and German, and took Latin lessons. They remained close until Eliot's sudden marriage in 1880, of which Georgiana had no inkling in advance, left her feeling betrayed and untrusted. The rift was never mended, for Eliot died that December.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (19887), pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
[[File:Edward Poynter portrait of Georgiana Burne-Jones.jpg|left|thumb|''Georgiana Burne-Jones'' by [[Edward Poynter]], c. 1870]]
In 1880 the Burne-Joneses bought Prospect House in [[Rottingdean]], near [[Brighton]] in Sussex, as their holiday home, and in 1889 they acquired Aubrey Cottage next door to create [[North End House]], reflecting the fact that their Fulham home was in North End Road. Georgiana loved her new country house and garden, and became active in village affairs. Rottingdean became her home in way that it never was for her husband, who preferred the Grange and its studio.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), pp. 222–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she had abandoned organized religion at the time of her marriage, Georgiana's Methodist upbringing emphasized service to the community, and she had been a supporter of William Morris's [[William Morris#Socialism|active role]] in the [[Social Democratic Federation]] and later the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]].&lt;ref name="Taylor155"&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 155-56&lt;/ref&gt;  Her close friends Morris, [[John Ruskin]], and Rosalind Howard were all involved in progressive causes. Georgiana's first steps into public service came as a supporter of the [[South London Gallery|South London Fine Art Gallery]], which had been established in 1891 to arts education for the working classes of South London. Georgiana encouraged the loan of her husband’s paintings and those of others in her circle. She and [[Walter Crane]] championed the addition of a library to the gallery. She became the only woman on the committee established to turn governance of the gallery over to the local authority, and discovered a talent for detail-oriented committee work.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 155–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001) p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1880s Burne-Jones had begun hyphenating his name, merely - as he wrote later - to avoid "annihilation" in the mass of Joneses,&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 150-51&lt;/ref&gt; and thus Georgiana became Lady Burne-Jones when her husband reluctantly accepted a [[baronet]]cy in 1894, partially at least as the title would descend to his son Philip, who ran with the smart set around the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and cared very much for the honour. Jane Morris wrote that her husband had commented "Well, a man can be an ass for the sake of his children", but in general the Socialists of their circle and Georgiana herself were appalled.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the new Lady Burne-Jones took her first steps into elected office, winning a seat on the parish council of her beloved Rottingdean (an office established by the [[Local Government Act 1894|Local Government Act of 1894]]), to the apparent delight of both her husband and her old friend William Morris.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; She supported interests of the working class and women's issues, taking positions in her electioneering materials that were radical for the wife of a baronet and simply baffling to the villagers of Rottingden. But her day-to-day work in the parish focused on street lighting, fire brigades, and the provision of a village nurse for the community.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 158–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widowhood and memorials==
[[File:Georgiana Burne-Jones by Edward Coley Burne-Jones.jpg|left|thumb|''Georgiana Burne-Jones and her children'' by Edward Burne-Jones, begun 1883]]William Morris died after a lingering illness in October 1896. Edward Burne-Jones, who had been Morris's friend and partner since their college days, was devastated, and his health declined substantially. In 1898 he had an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered, when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died of a heart attack in the early hours of 17 June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at [[Westminster Abbey]]. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured. Burne-Jones was cremated and his ashes were buried in a grave lined with moss and roses at the village church in Rottingdean.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), pp. 162-63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd (2001), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Burne-Jones had dreaded that someone unsympathetic would attempt his biography, and had asked his wife to take up the task. Georgiana, now aged 58, began work within months of Edward's death, reveling in memory. In a letter to [[F. G. Stephens]], she wrote, "There are so few left now who can recall those early days when Gabriel [Rossetti] was in his glory and Edward and Morris sat at his feet and rejoiced in his light".&lt;ref name="Taylor166"&gt;Quoted in Taylor (1987), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

''Memorials of Edward Burne-Jones'' was published six years later, in 1904, in two volumes, and remains a standard reference. In keeping with the standards of the times, much of the vagaries of his personal life were glossed over (the years of the episode with Maria Zambaco fall neatly into a period somewhere between the end of Volume 1 and the beginning of Volume 2).&lt;ref name="Taylor166" /&gt;

While she worked on the ''Memorials'', Georgiana remained active on the Rottingdean parish council, and her politics became if anything more radical as she grew older. At the outbreak of the [[Boer War]], England was swept up in a wave of pro-war patriotism, but Georgiana opposed Britain's action in [[South Africa]]. When news of the relief of the siege of [[Mafeking]] arrived, Georgiana hung a banner at North End House reading "We have killed and also take possession," paraphrasing a verse from the Bible. Her nephew, [[Rudyard Kipling]], rushed to her house to ensure she would not fall victim to an outraged mob of villagers.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Georgiana arranged the publication of ''[[The Flower Book (Edward Burne-Jones)|The Flower Book]]'', a limited-edition facsimile of an album of watercolour flower paintings by Edward Burne-Jones. Three hundred copies were issued in cooperation with the [[Fine Art Society]] of London. It was printed by Henri Piazza, who hand-stencilled watercolour over [[collotype]]s using the [[Stencil|pochoir]] technique to produce brilliant colours.
These copies of the ''Flower Book'' were sold in both bound and unbound form, with the unbound copies contained in a clamshell box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artknowledgenews.com/26_01_2012_03_02_17_the_delaware_art_museum_features_edward_burne_jones_flower_book_illustrations.html Art Knowledge News] The Delaware Art Museum Features Edward Burne-Jones "Flower Book Illustrations"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wildman (1998), pp. 285–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgiana Burne-Jones died on 2 February 1920 after a short illness.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders (2001), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Her son [[Philip Burne-Jones|Philip]], who had become a portrait painter, died in 1926. Her daughter Margaret married [[John William Mackail]] (1850–1945), the friend and biographer of Morris, and Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1911–1916, and died in 1953. Their children were the novelists [[Angela Thirkell]] and [[Denis Mackail]].

==In Portraits==
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Portrait of Georgiana Burne-Jones 1863.jpg|right|thumb|''Georgiana Burne-Jones'' by Edward Burne-Jones, 1863.]]
Georgiana Burne-Jones, in common with others of her circle, is portrayed in a number of drawings and paintings by her husband and other artists. A portrait by her husband, dated 1863 and now in the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] portrays the 22-year-old Georgiana in a format heavily influenced by [[Renaissance]] portraiture, including the Latin inscription. It is one of Burne-Jones's first attempts at formal portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1956p3/portrait-of-georgiana-burne-jones-1840-1920/|title=Portrait of Georgiana Burne-Jones (1840–1920)|accessdate= 3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Green Summer'', a watercolour by Burne-Jones painted at Red House in the summer of 1864 while Georgiana's sisters Louisa and Agnes were visiting London, depicts Louisa, Agnes, Jane Morris, and others listening to Georgiana reading aloud.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1987), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  A version in oils was painted in 1868.

A portrait of Georgiana drinking tea of ca. 1870 was painted by her brother-in-law, the artist [[Edward Poynter]].

Burne-Jones's best-known portrait of his wife was begun in 1883, and shows her holding an herbal, with her children in the background, Philip (aged about 22) at his easel and Margaret (about 17) standing behind him. Burne-Jones tinkered with the portrait for years, and it remained unfinished at his death. It was never exhibited in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Wildman (1998), p. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6634">'''Harold Hall "Doc" Keen''' (1894–1973) was a British [[engineer]] who produced the engineering design, and oversaw the construction of, the British [[bombe]], a [[codebreaking]] machine used in [[World War II]] to read German messages sent using the [[Enigma machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known as "Doc" Keen because of his habit of carrying tools and paperwork in a case resembling a [[doctor's bag]]. After the war he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|O.B.E.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keen|2012|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career before World War II ==
Keen was born in the borough of [[Shoreditch]] in east [[London]] in 1894. By age 18 he had moved to [[Kentish Town]] and began studying [[Electrical Engineering]]. In 1912 he joined the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] (BTM), established to import and assemble American [[punched card]] technology. In 1916, Keen joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] and was assigned to the ground staff of a [[bomber]] squadron in northern [[France]]. In 1919 he returned to BTM and married an Eva Burningham. In 1921, Keen moved with BTM to [[Letchworth]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. Two years later, he was appointed head of the Experimental Department, and his innovations there gained him the reputation as the leading British innovator of punched-card technology; Keen was granted more than sixty [[patent]]s. In the 1930s he became Chief Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keen|2012|pp=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II – British bombes==
{{Main|Bombe}}

[[File:Bletchley Park Bombe4.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The working rebuilt bombe at [[Bletchley Park]] museum. Each of the rotating drums simulates the action of an Enigma rotor. There are 36 Enigma-equivalents and, on the right hand end of the middle row, three ''indicator'' drums. [[John Harper (computer engineer)|John Harper]] led the 'Phoenix' team that built this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Harper | first = John  | author-link = John Harper (computer engineer) | title = The British Bombe: The Rebuild Project | year = 2008 | url = http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm | accessdate = 11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially switched on by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], patron of the [[British Computer Society]] on 17 July 2008.]]

A machine called the [[bomba (cryptography)|''cryptologic bomb'']] (Polish: ''bomba kryptologiczna'') had been produced by the Polish codebreakers in their successful breaking of Enigma before 1939. It was, however, useful only as long as the Germans continued with particular weaknesses in operating procedure, which they gradually tightened up, so that the Polish success rate diminished dramatically. [[Alan Turing]] designed the British bombe on a more general principle, the assumption of the presence of text, called a ''[[Known-plaintext attack|crib]]'',  that cryptanalysts could predict was likely to be present at a defined point in the message. This technique is termed a ''[[known plaintext attack]]'' and had been used to a limited extent by the Poles, e.g., the Germans' use of "ANX" — German for "To," followed by "X" as a spacer.

As chief engineer at the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]] at [[Letchworth]] Keen was approached to turn these ideas into a working reality. The first bombe, which was based on Turing's original design, was installed in Hut 1 at Bletchley Park on 18 March 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Ransom|Knight|1988|p=954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named "Victory". The second bombe, named "''Agnus dei''", later shortened to "Agnes", or "Aggie", was equipped with an important additional feature, the ''diagonal board'' that had been designed by [[Gordon Welchman]]. It was installed on 8 August 1940; "Victory" was later returned to Letchworth to have a diagonal board fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bletchley Park Jewels | chapter = Outstations - A Brief History | url = http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/Outstations/Wavendon.htm | accessdate = 1 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1940, 178 messages were broken on the two machines, nearly all successfully. Because of the danger of bombes at Bletchley Park being lost if there were to be a bombing raid, five bombe outstations&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Bletchley Park Jewels | chapter = Outstations from the Park | url = http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/outstations/outstations.htm | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were established, at [[Adstock]], [[Gayhurst]], [[Wavendon]], [[Stanmore]], and [[Eastcote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Toms | first = Susan  | title = Enigma and the Eastcote connection | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ruislip.co.uk/eastcotemod/enigma.htm | accessdate = 16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombe was referred to by Group Captain Winterbotham as a "Bronze Goddess" because of its colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Winterbotham|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devices were more prosaically described by operators as being "like great big metal bookcases".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Stewart, 'Bombe' Operator, interviewed in "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155383/episodes The Men Who Cracked Enigma]", UKTV History Channel documentary series "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157073/ Heroes of World War II]", 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Jacob of Nisibis''' ({{lang-syr|ܝܥܩܘܒ ܢܨܝܒܢܝܐ}}, ''{{transl|sem|Yaʿqôḇ Nṣîḇnāyâ}}'',  [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Ἅγιος Ἰάκωβος Ἐπίσκοπος Μυγδονίας''), also known as '''Saint Jacob of Mygdonia''',&lt;ref name=SYNAX/&gt;{{#tag:ref|'''[[Nusaybin|Antiochia Mygdonia]]''' was a Seleucid colony in ancient Mesopotamia. In the classical Roman period it was known as '''Nisibis'''. Today it is the Turkish town of '''Nusaybin'''.|group=note}}, '''Saint Jacob the Great''',&lt;ref name="Venables"/&gt; and '''Saint James of Nisibis''', was the Bishop of Nisibis until his death.

He was lauded as the "Moses of Mesopotamia", and was the spiritual father of the renowned writer and theologian Saint [[Ephrem the Syrian]].&lt;ref name="Venables"&gt;Venables (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Jacob was present at the [[First Council of Nicaea|first ecumenical council]] at [[Nicaea]], and is venerated as a saint by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], and [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Biography==
Saint Jacob was the son of prince Gefal,&lt;ref name="OCA"/&gt; and was born in the city of Nisibis in Mesopotamia in the 3rd century AD.&lt;ref name="Venables"/&gt; It is claimed that he was a relative of Saint [[Gregory the Illuminator]].&lt;ref name="Venables"/&gt; According to [[Gennadius of Massilia]], Saint Jacob became a [[Confessor of the Faith]] for his suffering during persecution by Emperor [[Maximian]].&lt;ref name="Venables"/&gt; Saint Jacob became an [[anchorite]] in c. 280 in the mountains near Nisibis where, according to Saint [[Theodoret|Theodoret of Cyrrhus]], he survived on herbs and fruits, and chose to wear no clothes, build shelter, or light fires for warmth.&lt;ref name="Hinson"&gt;Hinson (1995), pp. 198-199&lt;/ref&gt; The saint became famous, and received visits from Sheria, [[Adiabene (East Syriac Ecclesiastical Province)#The diocese of Erbil|Bishop of Arbela]] (r. 304-316), according to the ''[[Chronicle of Arbela]]''.&lt;ref name="Vööbus28"&gt;Vööbus (1951), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The saint resolved to climb [[Mount Judi|Mount Qardu]], traditionally believed to be the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]], and recover a fragment of the ark upon hearing from the hermit Maroukeh that local people doubted the [[Genesis flood narrative|Great Flood]].&lt;ref name="AAC"&gt;''[http://stjamesevanston.org/our-church/about/saint-james-of-nisibis Our Patron Saint James of Nisibis].'' Armenian Apostolic Church&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Jacob ascended the mountain and rested close to the summit; in his sleep, an angel placed a fragment of the ark close to him, and instructed him to awake.&lt;ref name="AAC" /&gt; The saint brought the relic to the hermit Maroukeh and, according to the saint's hagiography, a [[sacred spring]] appeared where the saint had rested, reputed to have healing properties.&lt;ref name="AAC" /&gt;

A number of miracles are credited to Saint Jacob by Saint Theodoret in ''Historia Religiosa'' (Religious History), in which the saint had a boulder explode beside a Persian judge who had given an unjust judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1971), pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in one incident, Saint Jacob cursed boastful, promiscuous women by a spring so that their hair became white, and the spring disappeared.&lt;ref name="SOCA"&gt;''[http://www.soc-wus.org/ourchurch/St.%20James%20of%20nisibis.htm St. James (Jacob) bishop of Nisibis, July 15].'' Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch: Archdiocese of the Western U.S.&lt;/ref&gt; The women subsequently repented, and the spring returned, however, the women's hair remained white.&lt;ref name="SOCA"/&gt; As well as this, a group of people attempted to deceive the saint whereby they asked for money to fund the burial of a man they had lain down and covered with a sheet with the illusion of death; consequently, the man died, and the people repented and thus the man was resurrected as a result of Saint Jacob's prayers.&lt;ref name="SOCA"/&gt;

Disagreement exists as to the date of the saint's consecration as bishop of Nisibis as it is argued it took place in c. 300,&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt; and he is recorded as the city's first bishop by Saint [[Ephrem the Syrian]].&lt;ref name="Bundy2000"&gt;Bundy (2000), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; However, Saint Jacob is credited as the successor of Babu, the first bishop of Nisibis (r. 300-309), by the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Vailhé (1911)&lt;/ref&gt; who Saint Ephrem states was in fact Saint Jacob's successor.&lt;ref name="Bundy2000"/&gt; In his ''Chronography'', [[Elijah of Nisibis]] states that Saint Jacob was consecrated bishop in 308.&lt;ref name="Vööbus28" /&gt;

The ''[[Chronicle of Edessa]]'' states that the saint constructed the [[Mor Yakup Church|first church]] in [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] in c. 313-320.&lt;ref name="Bundy"/&gt; Miles, [[Beth Huzaye (East Syriac Ecclesiastical Province)#The diocese of Susa|Bishop of Susa]], is said to have contributed a large quantity of silk from [[Adiabene]] to the church's construction.&lt;ref name="Venables"/&gt; The foundation of the [[School of Nisibis]] is also attributed to Saint Jacob.&lt;ref name="SOCA"/&gt; Saint Jacob attended the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, and opposed [[Arius]].&lt;ref name="Bundy"/&gt; Saint Ephrem purportedly accompanied the saint to the council, however, this is considered apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews (2006), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Jacob attended the funeral of Saint [[Metrophanes of Byzantium]] in 326.&lt;ref name=SYNAX&gt;Great Synaxaristes: {{gr icon}} ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/1052/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ἅγιος Ἰάκωβος Ἐπίσκοπος Μυγδονίας].'' 31 Οκτωβρίου. ΜΕΓΑΣ ΣΥΝΑΞΑΡΙΣΤΗΣ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Jacob was present at the siege of Nisibis by [[Shapur II]], ''Shahanshah'' of [[Sasanian Empire|Iran]], in 337/338,{{#tag:ref|From 337-350, [[Shapur II]] attacked Nisibis on three occasions, as it was the great city of Northern Mesopotamia and the bulwark of the eastern provinces: 
* the first Siege of Nisibis took place in A.D. 338; 
* the second in A.D. 346; 
* and the third in A.D. 350, lasting three months.|group=note}} and according to Saint Theodoret, with encouragement from the city's population and Saint Ephrem, Saint Jacob ascended the walls and prayed for the city, and cursed the besiegers.&lt;ref name="Lightfoot124"&gt;Lightfoot (1988), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'' relates that he died on 15 July, the thirtieth day of the siege, according to the ''Chronicle of 724''.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Burgess, pp. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Gennadius and Saint Ephrem record that Saint Jacob was buried within the walls of Nisibis.&lt;ref name="Burgess" /&gt; Saint Theodoret adds that the Iranian army was afflicted by a swarm of gnats and flies summoned by the saint, and Shapur II subsequently abandoned the siege.&lt;ref name="Lightfoot124"/&gt; 

The saint is counted amongst the signatories of the [[Synods of Antioch|Council of Antioch]] in 341,&lt;ref name=BARING-GOULD/&gt; however, his presence at the council is unrecorded in other sources.&lt;ref name="Venables"/&gt; In 350, according to the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', Saint Jacob helped defend Nisibis against [[Shapur II]] again, and as he was wearing the imperial regalia, was confused for Emperor [[Constantius II]].&lt;ref name="Whitby"&gt;Whitby (1998), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Shapur II challenged the saint to fight outside the city, where it was revealed he was an apparition and the Iranian army withdrew as a result.&lt;ref name="Whitby" /&gt;

==Relics==

The fragment of Noah's Ark discovered by Saint Jacob was later brought to [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]] in [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name="AAC" /&gt;

Saint Theodoret relates that the bones of Saint Jacob were transferred from Nisibis to [[Edessa]] following the city's cession to Iran on 22 August 363.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey (2005), p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/nisibis-city-in-northern-mesopotamia NISIBIS].'' Encyclopaedia Iranica&lt;/ref&gt; The saint's relics were later moved to [[Constantinople]] in 970,&lt;ref&gt;Cross &amp; Livingstone (2005), p. 861&lt;/ref&gt; according to the Menologion of the [[Mekhitarists|Armenians at Venice]].

Fragments of the skull of Saint Jacob were donated to [[Hildesheim Cathedral]] in [[Germany]] in 1367 by Lippold von Steinberg after the Battle of Dinklar.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140808143031/http://www.bistum-hildesheim.de/bho/dcms/sites/bistum//nachrichten.html?f_action=show&amp;f_newsitem_id=14228 Kunstschätze erhalten].'' Bistum Hildesheim {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, the relics of Saint Jacob were brought from the Armenian Church of Saint George in [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]], to [[Canada]], where it was taken to the Armenian Church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator in [[Montreal]] on 17 June, and the Armenian Church of the Holy Trinity in [[Toronto]] on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 June 2018|title=Holy Relics of Sourb Hagop of Mtsbin (St. Jacob of Nisibis) in Montreal|url=http://hayernaysor.am/en/archives/286250|work=Hayern Aysor|access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

Several homilies previously attributed to Saint Jacob by Gennadius of Massilia and others are now understood to be the work of Saint [[Aphrahat|Aphraates]].&lt;ref name="Bundy"/&gt; The misidentification arose from Aphraates' assumption of the name Jacob upon becoming bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Albert (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; Letters and canons, as well as other works, formerly attributed to the saint are known to be written in a later period.&lt;ref name="Bundy"/&gt;

'''Jakob Frank Denzinger''' (June 29, 1924 &amp;ndash; February 11, 2016) was a concentration camp and extermination-death camp guard during the [[Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany]] at five separate concentration camps across three countries, as well as a member of the [[SS-Totenkopfverbände]].&lt;ref name=associatedpress1 /&gt; In 1956, Denzinger fled to the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1972. Denzinger fled the US in 1989 in advance of his denaturalization. An [[Associated Press]] investigation reported in October 2014 that despite being denaturalized, Denzinger was still receiving monthly [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] payments.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson1 /&gt;

==Early life==
Jakob Frank Denzinger was born in [[Osijek]], [[Croatia]], then in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], as an ethnic German.&lt;ref name=jspace1&gt;{{cite news|title=Croatia Opens Investigation Into Alleged Nazi Guard|url=http://www.jspacenews.com/croatia-opens-investigation-alleged-nazi-guard/|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=JSpace News|date=17 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had at least one brother, named Andrija Denzinger, who is married to Julia Denzinger.&lt;ref name=brother1&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazi death camp monster, 90, wanted for slaughtering thousands of Jews at Auschwitz is tracked down to river-side flat in Croatia|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2556784/Nazi-death-camp-monster-90-wanted-slaughtering-thousands-Jews-Auschwitz-tracked-river-flat-Croatia.html|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Daily Mail|date=11 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrija is six years younger than Jakob, and he also lives in Osijek along with his wife, only a few miles from Jakob's flat. In 1950, Jakob married Maria ("Mary"), who was born in Cepin, Croatia on January 17, 1927.&lt;ref name=Mariamary&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria "Mary" Denzinger|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/ohio/obituary.aspx?pid=170826374|website=Legacy|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi era==
During [[World War II]] Denzinger was a concentration camp guard at five separate concentration and extermination-death camps: The extermination-death camps at [[Auschwitz Concentration Camp|Auschwitz]] and Mauthausen; and concentration camps [[Plaszow concentration camp|Plaszow]],  [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]].&lt;ref name=Schiessl1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiessl|first1=Christoph|title=The Search for Nazi Collaborators in the United States|date=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109090079|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ExsfSp67pg8C&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Jakob+Denzinger+and+auschwitz&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TYhFVPXEMaTuiALD4oCIAw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jakob%20Denzinger%20and%20auschwitz&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of 18 in 1942, Denzinger began serving in the Schutzstaffel.&lt;ref name=detroitnews1&gt;{{cite news|title=Expelled Nazis paid millions in Social Security by U.S.|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/19/nazis-social-security/17589735/|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Detroit News|date=19 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting the next year, he served in the Auschwitz extermination-death camp from May 1943 to March 1945.&lt;ref name=associatedpress1&gt;{{cite news|title=Suspected Nazi Guard Stripped of U.S. Citizenship|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Suspected-Nazi-Guard-Stripped-Of-U-S-Citizenship/id-733e94be567bd02690eaed72c388dc0c|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Associated Press|date=1 Dec 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On April 24, 1945, Denzinger was taken prisoner by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in France.&lt;ref name=DORH&gt;{{cite news|title=DORH receives information on Jakob Decinger|url=http://dalje.com/en-croatia/dorh-receives-information-on-jakob-decinger/497833|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=Dalje|date=30 Jan 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021182432/http://dalje.com/en-croatia/dorh-receives-information-on-jakob-decinger/497833|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was presumably held until the end of the war, 2 September 1945.

==Life in America==
Denzinger obtained an entry visa into the United States at the American Embassy in [[Frankfurt, Germany|Frankfurt]]. In October 1956, he entered the US and became naturalized in 1972.&lt;ref name=DORH /&gt; He settled in [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=jewishcommittee1&gt;{{cite book|last1=American Jewish Committee|title=American Jewish year book, 1991, Volume 91|date=1991|publisher=American Jewish Committee|isbn=9780827604025|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working as a plastics executive, Denzinger "had acquired the trappings of success: a [[Cadillac DeVille]] and a [[Lincoln Town Car]], a lakefront home, investments in oil and real estate."&lt;ref name=businessman1&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Akron businessman Jakob Denzinger among dozens of suspected Nazis living on Social Security|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/akron-canton-news/former-akron-businessman-jakob-denzinger-among-dozens-of-suspected-nazis-living-on-social-security|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=News Net 5|date=20 Oct 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022222402/http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/akron-canton-news/former-akron-businessman-jakob-denzinger-among-dozens-of-suspected-nazis-living-on-social-security|archivedate=22 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving in West Germany, Denzinger soon moved to his native Osijek, Croatia, where as of 2014 he lived "in a spacious apartment".&lt;ref name=Rising1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rising|first1=David|title=AP investigation finds Nazi war crime suspects collected millions in U.S. Social Security|url=http://www.cp24.com/world/ap-investigation-finds-nazi-war-crime-suspects-collected-millions-in-u-s-social-security-1.2061295|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=CP24|date=19 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the U.S. Justice Department's [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]] came under scrutiny of Congress and the press when reports in the press revealed that Denzinger and others were collecting [[Social Security (United States)|American Social Security]] benefits while living abroad.&lt;ref name=Herschaft1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herschaft|first1=David|title=Former guards at Nazi death camps are collecting social security payments from the U.S. government, probe finds|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/10/20/former-guards-at-nazi-death-camps-are-collecting-social-security-payments-from-the-u-s-government-probe-finds/|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=National Post|date=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=socialsec2&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazis who left US still received social security|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-29694228|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=BBC|date=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chandler1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chandler|first1=Adam|title=The Ex-Nazis Collecting Social Security|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/the-ex-nazis-collecting-social-security/381672/|accessdate=21 October 2014|publisher=The Atlantic|date=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denzinger was one of these men, collecting $1500 a month, about twice the average take home pay of Croatian workers.&lt;ref name=businessman1 /&gt;

'''John Graham Mellor''' (21 August 1952 – 22 December 2002), known by his stage name '''Joe Strummer''', was an English musician, singer, actor and songwriter who was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of [[the Clash]], a [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1976 as part of the original wave of British punk.

Their second album, ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' (1978) reached number 2 on the UK charts. Soon after, they achieved success in the US, starting with ''[[London Calling]]'' (1979), and peaking with 1982's ''[[Combat Rock]]'', reaching number 7 on the US charts and being certified 2× platinum there. The Clash's explosive political lyrics, eclectic musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock music in general, and [[alternative rock]] in particular.&lt;ref name="bbcco-Strummer"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their music incorporated [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|rap]], and [[rockabilly]].

Strummer's musical experience included stints with [[the 101ers]], [[Latino Rockabilly War]], [[the Mescaleros]], and [[the Pogues]], in addition to his own solo music career. His work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests, including acting, creating [[film score]]s for television and movies, songwriting, [[Broadcasting|radio broadcasting]], and a position as a radio host on a BBC show titled ''London Calling''.

Strummer and the Clash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 2003. In his remembrance, Strummer's friends and family established [[the Joe Strummer Foundation]] (initially known as Strummerville), a non-profit organisation which gives opportunities to musicians and support to projects around the world that create empowerment through music.

==Early life==
Joe Strummer was born John Graham Mellor in [[Ankara]], Turkey, on 21 August 1952. His mother, Anna Mackenzie (1915-1986), a [[crofter]]'s daughter born and raised in [[Bonar Bridge]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]], was a nurse. His British father, Ronald Ralph Mellor (1916-1984), M.B.E., was a clerical officer- later attaining the rank of second secretary- in the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|foreign service]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-88710&lt;/ref&gt; born in [[Lucknow]], India. Ronald Mellor, whose father was a railway official in India, had an [[Armenians|Armenian]] maternal grandfather and a [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] paternal grandmother.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} The family spent much time moving from place to place, and Strummer spent parts of his early childhood in [[Cairo]], [[Mexico City]] and [[Bonn]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
At the age of 9, Strummer and his older brother David, 10, began boarding at the [[City of London Freemen's School]] in Surrey. Strummer rarely saw his parents during the next seven years.

{{quote|[A]t the age of nine I had to say good-bye to them because they went abroad to Africa or something. I went to boarding school and only saw them once a year after that – the Government paid for me to see my parents once a year. I was left on my own, and went to this school where thick rich people sent their thick rich kids. Another perk of my father's job – it was a job with a lot of perks – all the fees were paid by the Government.|Joe Strummer{{sfn|Coon|1977}} }}

He developed a love of rock music listening to records by [[Little Richard]] and the [[Beach Boys]] as well as American folk-singer [[Woody Guthrie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Will Gilgrass |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nowplaying/2012/12/strummer6music---help-pick-the.shtml |title=Blogs - Now Playing @6Music - #Strummer6Music |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strummer would even go by the nickname "Woody" for a few years.&lt;ref name="trackMARX-Joe_Strummer"/&gt; Strummer would later say that "the reason [he] played music was the Beach Boys".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rollingstoneextras.com/playlists/view/sean-lennon The Playlist Special – Sean Lennon], ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1970 his brother David had become estranged from his family and had joined the [[British National Front|National Front]]. His suicide in July profoundly affected Strummer, as did having to identify his body after it had lain undiscovered for three days.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}

After finishing his time at City of London Freemen's School, Ashtead Park, Surrey, in 1970, Strummer moved on to the [[Central School of Art and Design]] in London,&lt;ref name=bowe&gt;Brian J.

He played in two bands, the Vultures and the 101ers, but when The Sex Pistols supported the 101ers in west London in 1976, Strummer saw the possibilities open up for him and was inspired to form The Clash.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Mellor shared a flat in the north London suburb of Palmers Green with friends Clive Timperley and [[Tymon Dogg]]. In 1971 Strummer became a vegetarian and remained one until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJTLIOdfysA |title=Joe Strummer chicken story |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-02-03 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 Strummer moved to [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales. He did not study at [[University of Wales, Newport|Newport College of Art]] but met up with college musicians in the Students' Union in Stow Hill and became vocalist for Flaming Youth, renaming the band the Vultures.&lt;ref name="trackMARX-Joe_Strummer"&gt;{{cite web

|quote=a) Joe Strummer was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1952 &amp; christened John Graham Mellor. His family spent time in Ankara, Cairo, Mexico City &amp; Bonn, before Mellor returned to the UK to attend the City of London Freemen's School in Surrey. Mellor left school &amp; enrolled at Central College of Art but left "after about a week", heading straight for the underground &amp; squat culture. Mellor spent time living in Wales, playing in knock-about bands and using the nickname "Woody" inspired by Woody Guthrie's name.  &lt;br /&gt; b) The Vultures in time led to The 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols.  Mellor adopted the stage name of "Joe Strummer". Impressed by the power of the [[Sex Pistols]], the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were "yesterday's papers" by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of The Clash. &lt;br /&gt; c) "This is my Indian summer ... I learnt that fame is an illusion &amp; everything about it is just a joke. I'm far more dangerous now, because I don't care at all." – Joe Strummer to Chris Salewicz – 2000.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vultures included three former members of Rip Off Park Rock &amp; Roll Allstars, the original college band co-founded by Terry Earl Taylor. For the next year he was the band's part-time singer and rhythm guitarist. During this time Strummer also worked as a [[gravedigger]] in [[St Woolos Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Don J Whistance's Clash Site - [http://www.theclash.org.uk/joetheearlyyears.htm "Joe the Early years"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JoeStrummer.org - [http://www.joestrummer.org/bio.php "Bio"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the band fell apart and he moved back to London where he met up again with [[Tymon Dogg]]. He was a street performer for a while and then decided to form another band with his West London roommates. The band was called [[the 101ers]],&lt;ref name="bbcco-Strummer" /&gt; named after the address of their squat (101 Walterton Road, in [[Maida Vale]]).&lt;ref name="trackMARX-Joe_Strummer" /&gt;{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}

The band played many gigs in London pubs, playing covers of popular American [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[blues]] songs. In 1975 he stopped calling himself "Woody" Mellor and adopted the stage name of Joe Strummer, and insisted that his friends call him by that name. The name "Strummer" apparently referred to his role as rhythm guitarist, in a rather self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by his girlfriend at the time, [[The Slits]] drummer [[Palmolive (musician)|Palmolive]]. The group liked the song "Keys to Your Heart", and picked it as their first single.{{sfn|Coon|1977}}

==Career==

===The Clash (1976–86)===
{{Main|The Clash}}
On 3 April 1976, the then-unknown [[Sex Pistols]] opened for The 101ers at a venue called the Nashville Rooms in London, and Strummer was impressed by them.&lt;ref name="bbcco-Strummer" /&gt; Sometime after the show, Strummer was approached by [[Bernie Rhodes]] and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. Jones was from the band [[London SS]] and wanted Strummer to join as lead singer. Strummer agreed to leave the 101ers and join Jones, bassist [[Paul Simonon]], drummer [[Terry Chimes]] and guitarist [[Keith Levene]].{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} The band was named [[the Clash]] by Simonon and made their debut on 4 July 1976 in [[Sheffield]], opening for the [[Sex Pistols]] at the Black Swan (also known as the Mucky Duck, now known as the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]]).{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  On 25 January 1977, the band signed with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] as a three-piece after Levene was fired from the band and Chimes quit. [[Topper Headon]] later became the band's full-time drummer.

During his time with the Clash, Strummer, along with his bandmates, became notorious for getting into trouble with the law. On 10 June 1977, he and Headon were arrested for spray-painting "The Clash" on a wall in a hotel. On 20 May 1980, he was arrested for hitting a violent member of the audience with his guitar during a performance in [[Hamburg]], Germany. This incident shocked Strummer, and had a lasting personal impact on him. Strummer said, "It was a watershed—violence had really controlled me for once". He determined never again to fight violence with violence.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}

Before the album ''[[Combat Rock]]'' was released in 1982, Strummer went into hiding and the band's management said that he had "disappeared". Bernie Rhodes, the band's manager, pressured Joe to do so because tickets were selling slowly for the Scottish leg of an upcoming tour.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}  It was planned for Strummer to travel, in secret, to Texas and stay with his friend, musician [[Joe Ely]]. Uneasy with his decision, Strummer instead decided to genuinely disappear and "dicked around" in France. During this time, Strummer ran the [[Paris Marathon]] in April 1982. He claimed his training regimen consisted of 10 pints of beer the night before the race. For this period of time, Joe's whereabouts were not only a mystery to the public, but the band's management as well. Joe later said this was a huge mistake and you "have to have some regrets". This was in spite of the popular success of the single "[[Rock the Casbah]]". During this time band members began to argue a lot, and with tensions high, the group began to fall apart.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}

In September 1983, Strummer issued the infamous "Clash Communique", and fired Mick Jones.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} Topper Headon had earlier been kicked out of the band because of his heroin addiction, and Terry Chimes was brought back temporarily to fill his place until the permanent replacement, Pete Howard, could be found.  This left the band with only two of its original members, Strummer and Simonon.  Rhodes persuaded Strummer to carry on, adding two new guitarists.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  Under this lineup, "The Clash Mark Two", they released the album ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' in 1985. The album was panned by fans and critics alike and Strummer disbanded the Clash.

At the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Clash was said to be "considered one of the most overtly political, explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history".&lt;ref name="rockhall-The_Clash"&gt;{{cite web

|quote=a) Quite simply, the Clash were among the most explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history. &lt;br /&gt;b, c) If not exactly a reunion, it was a rapprochement. On 15 November 2002, Jones and Strummer shared the stage for the first time in nearly 20&amp;nbsp;years, performing three Clash songs during the encore of a London benefit show by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. This raised hopes for a Clash reunion, which were dashed when Strummer died of a heart attack on 22 December 2002.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their songs tackled social decay, unemployment, racism, police brutality, political and social repression, and militarism in detail. Strummer was involved with the [[Anti-Nazi League]] and [[Rock Against Racism]] campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by the anarchist organisation [[Class War]]. The Clash's ''[[London Calling]]'' album was voted best album of the 1980s by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine (although it was released in late 1979 in the UK, it was not released until 1980 in the US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Solo career and soundtrack work (1986–1999)===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Joe-Strummer.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Strummer, backing with the Pogues in Japan.]]
A year later, Strummer worked on several songs for the 1986 film ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', including "Love Kills" and "Dum Dum Club". Strummer also later worked with Mick Jones and his band [[Big Audio Dynamite]], contributing to the band's second studio album by co-writing most of the songs as well as producing the album along with Jones.

In 1987, he played a small part in the film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'', directed by [[Alex Cox]], as a character named "Faucet" and wrote and performed on the film's [[Walker (album)|soundtrack]].  He starred in another Cox film that same year called ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'', as the character Simms. ''Straight to Hell'' also featured London-Irish folk/punk band [[the Pogues]], both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist [[Philip Chevron]], who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: "When I was sick in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon and he was on tour in the US as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped to the top of the guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage." This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.

In 1989, Strummer appeared in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' as a drunken, short-tempered drifter named Johnny (whom most characters refer to as Elvis, much to Johnny's dismay). He made a cameo appearance in [[Aki Kaurismäki]]'s 1990 film ''[[I Hired a Contract Killer]]'' as a guitarist in a pub, performing two songs ("Burning Lights" and "Afro-Cuban Bebop"). These were released as a promotional 7-inch single limited to a few hundred copies, credited to "Joe Strummer &amp; the Astro Physicians". The "Astro Physicians" were in fact the Pogues ("Afro-Cuban Bebop" got a re-release on the Pogues' 2008 box set). During this time Strummer continued to act, write and produce soundtracks for various films, most notably the soundtrack for ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997).

In 1989 Strummer produced a solo record with the band the Latino Rockabilly War in 1989. The album ''[[Earthquake Weather (album)|Earthquake Weather]]'' was a critical and commercial flop, and resulted in the loss of his contract with [[Sony Records]].  He also did the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Permanent Record (film)|Permanent Record]]'' with this band.

Strummer was asked by the Pogues, who were fracturing as a band, to help them produce their next album, released in 1990 as ''[[Hell's Ditch]]''. In 1991, he replaced [[Shane MacGowan]] as singer of the Pogues for a tour after MacGowan's departure from the band. One night of this tour was professionally recorded, and three tracks ("I Fought the Law", "London Calling", and "Turkish Song of the Damned") have seen release as b-sides and again on the Pogues' 2008 box set.

On 16 April 1994, Strummer joined Czech-American band Dirty Pictures on stage in Prague at the Repre Club in Obecni Dum at "Rock for Refugees", a benefit concert for people left displaced by the war in Bosnia. Although the set appeared impromptu, Strummer and the band had spent the days leading up to the event rehearsing and "hanging out" in Prague. The show began with "London Calling" and without pause went into "Brand New Cadillac". In the middle of the song, the power went out.  Once the power was back on, Strummer asked the audience whether or not they would mind if the band started over. They then began again with "London Calling" and continued on for another half-hour.

After these self-described "wilderness years", Strummer began working with other bands; he played piano on the 1995 UK hit of [[The Levellers (band)|the Levellers]], "Just the One" and appeared on the [[Black Grape]] single "England's Irie" in 1996. In 1997, while in New York City, he worked with noted producer and engineer [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] on remixed Clash and 101ers reissue dub material. In collaboration with percussionist Pablo Cook, Strummer wrote and performed the soundtrack to ''Tunnel of Love'' (Robert Wallace 1997) that was featured in the Cannes Film Festival in the same year.

In 1998, he made a guest appearance on the animated television show, ''[[South Park]]'' and appeared on the album ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]'' featuring songs from and inspired by the series.

During this time, Strummer was engaged in a legal dispute with the Clash's record label, [[Epic Records]]. The disagreement lasted nearly eight years and ended with the label agreeing to let him record solo records with another label. If the Clash were to reunite though, they would have to record for Sony. During the nineties, Strummer was a DJ on the [[BBC World Service]] with his half-hour programme ''London Calling''. Samples from the series provide the vocals for "Midnight Jam" on Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros' final album ''[[Streetcore]]''.

===The Mescaleros and other work (1999–2002)===
In the mid-to-late 1990s, Strummer gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called [[the Mescaleros]]. Strummer and the band signed with [[Mercury Records]], and released their first album in 1999, which was co-written with [[Antony Genn]], called ''[[Rock Art and the X-Ray Style]]''. A tour of England, Europe, and North America soon followed; sets included several Clash fan favourites.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

{{listen|filename=StrummerCashRedemptionSong.ogg| title=Redemption Song | description= [[Joe Strummer &amp; the Mescaleros]]| format=[[Ogg]]}}
In 2001, the band signed with Californian punk label [[Hellcat Records]] and released their second studio album, ''[[Global a Go-Go]]''. The album was supported with a 21-date tour of North America, Britain, and Ireland. Once again, these concerts featured Clash material ("[[London's Burning (The Clash song)|London's Burning]]", "Rudie Can't Fail", "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]"), as well as covers of [[reggae]] and [[ska]] hits ("[[The Harder They Come (song)|The Harder They Come]]", "A Message to You, Rudy") and the band regularly closed the show by playing the [[Ramones]]' "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]". He covered [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[Redemption Song]]" with [[Johnny Cash]]. In the same year, a Strummer and the Mescaleros' version of the song "[[Minstrel Boy]]" was used for the end credits of the film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On 15 November 2002, Strummer and the Mescaleros played a benefit show for striking fire fighters in London, at the Acton Town Hall. [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] was in the audience, and joined the band on stage during the Clash's "Bankrobber". An encore followed with Jones playing guitar and singing on "White Riot" and "London's Burning". This performance marked the first time since 1983 that Strummer and Jones had performed together on stage.&lt;ref name="rockhall-The_Clash" /&gt; Jones later remarked that it was totally unplanned and that he felt compelled to join Strummer on stage.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Strummer's final regular gig was at Liverpool Academy on 22 November 2002, yet his final performance, just two weeks before his death, was in a small club venue 'The Palace' in Bridgwater, Somerset, near his home. Shortly before his death, Strummer and [[U2]]'s [[Bono]] co-wrote a song, "[[46664]]", for [[Nelson Mandela]] as part of a campaign against AIDS in Africa. He had been scheduled to play at that fundraising concert in February 2003 on [[Robben Island]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Mick Jones later recorded a version of the song in studio, with his vocals and guitar work.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Personal life==
In 1975, after being offered £120 ({{Inflation|UK|120|1975|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), Strummer [[marriage of convenience|married]] Pamela Moolman, a South African citizen, so she could obtain British citizenship (foreign wives of male Britons could obtain British nationality via marriage until the coming into force of the [[British Nationality Act 1981]]). He bought his signature [[Fender Telecaster]], later painted black, with the money. In 1978, Strummer started a relationship with Gaby Salter shortly after her 17th birthday.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} The couple remained together for 14 years and had two daughters, Jazz and Lola, but did not marry as Strummer had been unable to locate and divorce Moolman.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} During his relationship with Salter, he had multiple affairs spanning the 1980s.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}

In 1993, Strummer began an affair with Lucinda Tait, which finally ended his relationship with Gaby Salter.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} Strummer and Tait married in 1995 and remained so until his death in 2002.

Strummer was a [[socialist]]. He stated about his socialist views, "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Salewicz|title=Redemption Song: The Definitive Biography of Joe Strummer|year=2006|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
{{quote box
 | quote  = On-stage Strummer wires himself up into an inhuman dynamo of sweaty, trembling flesh, fearful enough to have one wondering when the ambulance brigade will rush to his rescue with a straight-jacket. While he tilts his bullet head at acute angles, his agonising face screwed into an open wound, he wields his Telecaster like a chain saw. His magnetism is totally original – more like an Olympic strong man imploding all his energy into a final record-breaking lift than anything seen on a rock'n'roll stage before. &lt;br /&gt;Off-stage, he's the Clash member with the lowest profile.

On 22 December 2010, CJAM 99.1 FM, a radio station in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Canada, declared the eighth anniversary of Strummer's death the "Joe Strummer Day to confront poverty in Windsor-Detroit." {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}For 24-hours, the station played nothing but Strummer-related music, wrapping the sounds around reports about poverty from North America's hardest hit economic region—Windsor-Detroit.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} CJAM (which is located near the banks of the Detroit River, a kilometre from downtown Detroit) and its board of directors have since decided to make it an annual event, and  hosted its 7th Annual Joe Strummer Day on 22 December 2016.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In January 2011 a motion was started to grant Strummer his own street in the Spanish city of [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_28717.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116181642/http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_28717.shtml|date=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2012 which would have been Strummer's 60th birthday, Hellcat Records released an exclusive 57 song digital download album titled ''Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros, The Hellcat Years''. The album features Strummer's three Hellcat albums along with various b-sides and live songs including Strummer's 15 November 2002 concert with Mick Jones. Hellcat announced to re-release remastered versions of Strummer's three Hellcat records on both CD and vinyl in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cericola |first=Rachel |url=https://www.wired.com/geekmom/2012/08/new-joe-strummer-album |title=Hellcat Records Celebrates 60 Years of Joe Strummer With Digital Release &amp;#124; GeekMom |website=Wired.com |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hellcat released Strummer's 15 Nov. 2002 concert, ''[[Live at Acton Town Hall]]'' on 23 November 2012 as an exclusive limited to 2200 copies 2 LP vinyl for [[Record Store Day]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In January 2013, Joe Strummer had a plaza named in his honour in the Spanish city of Granada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21041591#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa |title=BBC News - Joe Strummer has a Spanish plaza named in his honour |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placeta Joe Strummer is at N37.16892 W3.58771 (722m) on a junction between three narrow roads the Calle Vistillas de Los Angeles, the Cuesta Escoriaza and the Calle Paseo Palmas.

In June 2013 a mural of Strummer was unveiled on the corner of [[Portobello Road]] and Blenheim Crescent and attended by a number of Strummer's former friends including Mick Jones and [[Ray Gange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Joe Strummer mural unveiling|url=http://www.theclashblog.com/joe-strummer-mural-unveiling-a-special-guest-post-and-report-from-ladbroke-grove/|work= |website=Theclashblog.com |date=15 June 2013 |accessdate=9 July 2015}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2013 interview, Mick Jones confirmed that Strummer had intentions of reforming the Clash and new music was even being written. In the months prior to Strummer's death, he and Jones got together to write new music. Jones said at the time he assumed the new songs would be used on albums with the Mescaleros. A few months following their work together, Jones ran into Strummer at an event and asked him what he intended to do with those songs. Strummer informed Jones that they were going to be used for the next Clash record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/story/mick-jones-secret-strummer-tunes-could-have-sparked-the-clash-s-comeback_3892188 |title=The Clash - Mick Jones: 'Secret Joe Strummer Tunes Could Have Sparked The Clash's Comeback'|publisher=Contact Music|accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, actor [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]] portrayed Strummer in the film ''[[London Town (2016 film)|London Town]]'' which tells the story of a Clash-obsessed teenager who crosses paths with Joe Strummer by happenstance in 1979 and finds his life changing as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/videos/see-joe-strummer-portrayed-in-london-town-trailer-w439500 |title=See Jonathan Rhys Meyers Play Joe Strummer in 'London Town' Trailer|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was met with mostly negative reviews.

It was discovered following Strummer's death that he was an archivist of his own work, having barns full of writings and tapes. Over 20,000 items were stored in the Joe Strummer archive and on 28, September 2018, a 32 song compilation album titled ''[[Joe Strummer 001]]'' will be released. The album, which was overseen by Strummer's widow Linda and producer Robert Gordon McHarg III, will feature 32 songs, 12 of which have never been released. The set spans Strummer's career from The 101ers to the Mescaleros and will feature some unheard demos from The Clash following the departure of Mick Jones along with an unreleased song recorded by Jones and Strummer in 1986. The set will also feature two of Strummer's final recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/joe-strummer-rare-unreleased-album-2347300|title=Joe Strummer's rare and unreleased songs to be released on new album|date=29 June 2018|publisher=NME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, [[Warner/Chappell Music]] signed a publishing contract with the Strummer estate. The deal includes Strummer's solo career, ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' by the Clash, the soundtracks to three films, and his compositions with the 101ers and the Mescaleros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/record-labels/8476542/warnerchappell-signs-joe-strummer-solo-catalog|title=Warner/Chappell Signs Joe Strummer Solo Catalog|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical equipment==
[[File:Joe Strummer Live by Joe Kerrigan.jpg|thumb|upright|Strummer in 2001 with his guitar]]
Strummer's main guitar throughout his career was a 1966 [[Fender Telecaster]] that he acquired in its original sunburst finish during the middle of 1975, when he was playing with [[The 101ers]]. After joining The Clash, the guitar's body and pickguard were refinished in grey auto primer and then painted black. Over the years, the guitar would see numerous sticker configurations, with the most prominent and longest-lasting one stating "Ignore Alien Orders". Years of heavy wear and taped on setlets remain on the guitar to this day, and the only known modifications to it included the installation of an individual, 6-saddle bridge, and Fender "f-style" tuning machines.

In 2012 modern artist [http://www.karlhaglund.com Karl Haglund] paid tribute to this guitar in one of his iconic guitar paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlhaglund.com/gallery/still-life-and-guitars/14586985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013233149/http://www.karlhaglund.com/gallery/still-life-and-guitars/14586985|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strummerguitar.com/evolutionofalegend.html |title=A tribute to Joe Strummers Fender Telecaster guitar |website=Strummerguitar.com |date=1976-04-10 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fender Custom Shop]] has created a Joe Strummer tribute Telecaster with a reliced flat black finish.&lt;ref name="fender-js" /&gt;

Strummer was naturally left-handed, but was taught to play guitar right-handed by his close friend [[Tymon Dogg]]. Strummer had reckoned his left-handedness on a right-hand guitar as a drawback and claimed it caused him to be underdeveloped as a guitarist, although his style of playing was unique.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

He also used three [[Fender Esquire]] models, one from 1952, a white blonde with slab fretboard from the mid-1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/Magazine/Issue/2010/Jun/Maximum_Energy_The_Gear_of_the_Original_Punks.aspx?Page=2 |title=Maximum Energy: The Gear of the Original Punks |publisher=Premier Guitar |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another from early to mid-1960s with a white pick guard and rosewood fingerboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strummerguitar.com/evolutionofalegend.html |title=A tribute to Joe Strummers Fender Telecaster guitar |website=Strummerguitar.com |date=10 April 1976 |accessdate=2012-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Esquire is a one-pickup version of the Telecaster. Prior to using any Telecaster oriented guitar, before buying his 1966 model, he used as main guitars a [[Gretsch White Falcon]] and a 1964 [[Hofner]] Verithin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strummerguitar.com/evolutionofalegend.html |title=A tribute to Joe Strummers Fender Telecaster guitar |website=Strummerguitar.com |date=1976-04-10 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For amplification Strummer was known to use amplifiers such as a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier|Jazz Chorus]], a Selmer Bassman while he was in the 101ers, a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] [[Vox AC30|AC30]] and various [[Marshall amplifiers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websitetoolbox.com/tool/post/strummernews/vpost?id=2044598 |title=Unknown Forum |website=Websitetoolbox.com |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his main amplifier was a [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] HD 212,150.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockstarsguitars.com/product.php?c=1&amp;cat=111&amp;scat=216] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217011818/http://www.rockstarsguitars.com/product.php?c=1&amp;cat=111&amp;scat=216|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strummer commented on his choice of amplifier with "I don't have time to search for those old Fender tube amps. The Music Man is the closest thing to that sound I've found" and that the "plastic motif on the front is repulsive."&lt;ref&gt;''Musician Magazine'' 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Khnumhotep (pronunciation: xaˈnaːmaw-ˈħatpew) and Niankhkhnum (pronunciation: nij-daˌnax-xaˈnaːmaw){{r|Kammerzell2001|pp=230}} were ancient Egyptian royal servants. They shared the title of Overseer of the [[Manicurist]]s in the Palace of King [[Nyuserre Ini]], sixth [[pharaoh]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Fifth Dynasty]], reigning during the second half of the 25th century BC. They were buried together at Saqqara and are listed as "royal confidants" in their joint tomb.{{r|Rice2001|pp=98}}

==Family==
'''Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum''' were ancient Egyptian royal servants and are believed by Thomas Dowson, Greg Reeder, and some other scholars to be the first recorded [[same-sex couple]] in [[history]].{{r|Dowson2007|pp=96ff}}{{r|Reeder2000|pp=200-201}} The proposed romantic relationship between Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum is based on depictions of the two men standing nose to nose and embracing.{{r|McCoy1998}}{{r|Holland2006}} Niankhkhnum's wife, depicted in a banquet scene, was almost completely erased in antiquity, and in other pictures Khnumhotep occupies the position usually designated for a wife. Their official titles were "Overseers of the Manicurists of the Palace of the King" (see sections Titularies, Banquents and music). Critics argue that both men appear with their respective wives and children, suggesting the men were brothers, rather than lovers.{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=22}}{{r|Oakes2003|pp=88}}

Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are depicted in the tomb with their respective families. It has been proposed that they were the sons of Khabaw-khufu and Rewedzawes. They appear to have had three brothers named Titi, Nefernisut, and Kahersetef. Three possible sisters are also attested. They are named Neferhotep-hewetherew, Mehewet and Ptah-heseten. Niankhkhnum's wife was named Khentikawes. The couple appear in the tomb with three sons named Hem-re, Qed-unas and Khnumhezewef, and three daughters, Hemet-re, Khewiten-re and Nebet. At least one grandson is attested, Irin-akheti, the son of Hem-re and his wife, Tjeset.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Khnumhotep had a wife by the name of Khenut. Khnumhotep and Khenut had at least five sons named Ptahshepses, Ptahneferkhu, Kaizebi, Khnumheswef and Niankhkhnum the younger (possibly named after the tomb owner), as well as a daughter named Rewedzawes.{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=55-61}}

==Titularies==
Egyptian tombs feature lists of titles and epithets honoring the deceased or held during life, often giving titles for other persons who appear on a wall, as in the funeral procession scene discussed in another section of this article. Inscriptions embodied magic. Informing visitors merely a secondary purpose, Ipet in his 4th Dynasty Meidum tomb regards the hieroglyphs as "his gods;" the animal heads surmounting certain gods' bodies were also readable as words.{{r|Wilkinson1994|pp=150}}{{r|Hornung1982|pp=117}} For Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, the titulary may be condensed as follows:{{r|TLA|}}{{r|group=note|note1}}{{r|group=note|note2}}{{r|group=note|note3}}

Titles and names go above the embracing pair portrait, identical except for name itself. These correspond to numbers (2), (4), (6), (8) in this section.

Representative items empaneled here do not exhaust the set. These titles related to each man's job in the bureaucratic state, but more importantly, signified rank and power relative to other officials at court.{{r|Baud2005}}{{r|Barta2001|pp=60, 72-73}} They also help date burials, as changes in the mix of titles in circulation and in the way they were spelled are well-documented. The ''wab''-priests, armed with brooms, handled cleanliness, ritual purity, and portage of offerings in areas of the temple outside the inner sanctuary where the god's cult statue was kept and where the higher, ''Hm nTr'' priests worked.{{r|Teeter2011|pp=20-21, 26}} We see that a ''Hm nTr'' at the solar temple was not above putting in stints as a humbler ''wab'' at the pyramid complex—if his titulary reflects his actual work, a matter deeply in question.{{r|Eyre2013|pp=55, 359}}{{r|Baines1985|pp=470}}

===Translation into modern languages===
Translation of Egyptian terms varies considerably between authors: Raymond O. Faulkner's 1962 concise dictionary (p.&amp;nbsp;239) renders titulary noun ''sHD'' as "inspector" based on New Kingdom historical sources, with added question mark. Ranier Hannig, from period sources, calls the ''sHD'' an "Untervorsteher" (subordinate official),{{r|Hannig2003|pp=1178}} of rank lower than the ''m-r''; in particular, the ''sHD jrj.w an.wt pr aA'' who supervises manicurists in the palace is an Untervorsteher.{{r|Hannig2003|pp=1179}} Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep held the title ''m-r'' "overseer" of the manicurists in addition to their ''sHD'' stations. ''Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae'' has followed Hannig on this issue, but cautions that its text translations, here taken from Moussa &amp; Altenmüller's 1977 publication of the tomb, are not definitive. Baud considers emerging local overlordships and subdivision of the bureaucracy in the Old Kingdom the primary phenomena responsible for multiple titles pertaining to one occupational field.{{r|Baud2005|pp=91-94}}{{r|group=note|note5}}

Uncertainty increases when abstract concepts are at hand: Old Kingdom pyramids were named using constructions scholars haven't yet parsed completely, so that modern book translations only gloss the original meanings. For instance, to English-speaking ears, the near-synonyms "abide" and "endure" display a species difference within the genus of "things which survive a long time," the former more animate than the latter, yet both can be used to translate the word ''mn'' found in 5th and 6th Dynasty pyramid names.{{r|Fischer1996|pp=73}}

===The religious and mortuary establishments===
We should note the two temples mentioned, the solar and the one beside the pyramid, are distinct, about a mile (1.5&amp;nbsp;km) apart in the [[Abusir]]-[[Abu Gorab|Abu Ghurab]] necropolis district southwest of modern Cairo, and, like most cemeteries, sited in the desert just beyond reach of the annual Nile flood. Each 5th Dynasty pyramid furthermore came with two temple enclosures, a mortuary establishment in the shadow of the pyramid itself and a valley temple at the edge of the cultivated land, a causeway connecting these. The solar temple had similar auxiliary structures.{{r|Arnold1999|pp=93-95}}{{r|group=note|note4}}{{r|Dunn_Solar}}

Suspicion that [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]], the most prolific of the 5th-Dynasty monument builders, usurped his predecessor [[Neferirkare Kakai|Neferirkare's]] valley temple and causeway for his own pyramid project arises, even in popular literature, as his causeway runs directly toward [[Neferirkare Kakai|Neferirkare's]] pyramid a considerable distance before detouring, a thing no other causeway at [[Abusir]] does.{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=33, 121}}{{r|Fodors|pp=151}}{{r|Dunn_Pyramid}}{{r|Dunn_Solar|pp=map}} Such usurpation is common, and not necessarily directed at promoting self in lieu of family line: New Kingdom practice of [[Thutmose III]] while erasing [[Hatshepsut]]’s cartouches at Medinet Habu was to substitute not his own cartouches, but those of Thutmoses I and II, his immediate ancestors.{{r|Bard|pp=12}}{{r|Dorman2005|pp=267}} Ladislav Bareš, of the Czech Egyptological school which has excavated at [[Abusir]] and [[Saqqara]] over decades, believes [[Neferirkare Kakai|Neferirkare]] was [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre’s]] father, and that the elder died leaving mortuary construction unfinished.{{r|Bares2000|pp=xiv, 1-3}} In this case, completion of family dynastic monumental statements, not usurpation, would be the applicable motive. (Observe that the 5th and most other numbered dynasties in Egypt cover more than one family line.) Ćwiek demurs, but places 'usurpation' in single quotes.{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=33}} The result was an unusual L-shaped floor plan in a location shoehorned between existing pyramids and mastabas, a problem the sun temple escaped.{{r|Verner2002|pp=62-65}}
{{clear}}

===The ''Hrj sStA'' and control of information by the state===
The title ''Hrj sStA'' "keeper of the secrets" is attested for 13 individuals during the [[Ancient Egypt|Old Kingdom]], at least once elaborated to the form ''Hr sStA mdw-nTr'' "keeper of the secrets of the god's words," meaning the hieroglyphic language used on monuments.{{r|Barta2001|pp=75}}{{r|Allen2010|pp=44}} In contrast with the hieratic script used for everyday record-keeping, already an elite activity no more than one percent of the population engaged in, the content of hieroglyphic texts was closely controlled property of the state and permission from the king was probably required for inscriptions in one's tomb, as we see in a royal authorization for Rawer, an official under [[Neferirkare Kakai|Neferirkare]] buried at [[Giza]], to do so. Indeed, the 5th Dynasty marks the appearance in quantity of extended prose documents carrying legal force.{{r|Allen2010|pp=6}}{{r|Baines1983|pp=584}}{{r|Eyre2013|pp=79–81}}

The [[Pyramid Texts]] (in prefatory stages of development during [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]]'s reign, then first inscribed in and around the burial chamber of King Unas) were reserved for royals only; a democratization of magic spells for the afterlife which would yield the [[Coffin Texts]] and [[Book of the Dead]] remained yet to come, although physical offering goods royal mortuary texts called for could be listed by name and icon in private tombs, and offering formulas for non-royal burials were available. (The term "democratization" and the process attending it is a topic of research and controversy.){{r|Hays2011|pp=116}} The ''Hrj sStA'' was at times in charge of enforcing these rules, or at least the will of the king expressed through the vizier, as shown by the 6th-Dynasty tomb of Khenu at Deir el-Gabrawi: Khenu held the title ''Hrj sStA n Hwt wrt'' "chief of secrets in the great hut," the vizier's bureau.{{r|Garcia2012|pp=1}} In parallel with the rise of legal documents, the Pyramid Texts increased the complexity of religion, adding the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Osirian]] underworld to the deceased's experience in complementarity with already-prevalent solar themes.{{r|Malek2000|pp=98–99, 102–103}}{{r|Taylor2001|pp=192-198}}{{r|Allen2010|pp=322}}

===The ''jmAx'' concept as proximity to king and god, in life and hereafter===
''jmAx xr nTr aA'' "honored one near the great god" is a euphemism for "dead," appearing frequently in tombs and on slab stelae, even though it, like the word (and goddess) ''mAat'', evokes a multifarious idealization of relationships between social and cosmological ranks.

Epithets beginning with ''jmAx'' are common throughout Egyptian history from the 4th Dynasty on,{{r|Fischer1996|pp=194}} tending toward greater specificity in later periods. An official or family member could possess several, both ''jmAx xr nTr aA'' "honored before the great god" (when dead){{r|TLA|pp=Szene 34}} and ''jmAx xr nswt'' "honored before the king" (presumably in life).{{r|TLA|pp=Szenen 13}} It is important to realize that king and god themselves can be one and the same, especially upon death, as Amenemhat I would be in the early [[Ancient Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] story of Sinuhe.{{r|Allen2015|pp=59}} The goal of kingship, after maintaining social order (''mAat'') in Egypt, was to ascend and unite with the sun disk of Heliopolitan theology, maintained from [[Ancient Egypt|Old Kingdom]] until the arrival of Christianity.{{r|Allen2010|pp=121}}{{r|Taylor2001|pp=141}}Since ''jmAx'' can also be translated as "provided for," the connection an official's tomb holds with royal subsidy is made implicit; although officials built their tombs using mainly their own resources once the 4th Dynasty (and Khufu's largess at [[Giza]]) ended.{{r|Malek2000|pp=103}}{{r|Allen2006|pp=14}}

If the efficacy of ''jmAx'' status in garnering support from the living world is unknown, the title holders were expected to confer favors in return, from the necropolis as beings in their afterlife corpora, denoted by the word ''Ax'' "akh" and perceived as effective against illness or through dreams. Respects paid the dead were a crucial matter: Egyptians wrote letters to them, an activity which peaked during the [[Ancient Egypt|Old and Middle Kingdoms]].{{r|Taylor2001|pp=42}} Royal mortuary cults continued operations at [[Abusir]] through the end of the 6th Dynasty; maintenance for private cults being less secure.{{r|Bares2000|pp=1–3}} [[Saqqara]] was still receiving interments of officials in the [[Ancient Egypt|Middle and New Kingdom]] periods,{{r|Penn}}{{r|Friends}} where a hypothesis that burial grounds were segregated according to professional line has been advanced; this is uncertain, as is whether the pattern was based on older precedent.{{r|Ravens2000|pp=xiv, 1-3}} The 1st Dynasty drew such a pattern in stark outlines: Kings chose Abydos while the dignitaries were buried at Saqqara, but not so in the 2nd, when royal burials at Saqqara alongside officials commenced.{{r|Kemp2006|pp=99-100, 201}}{{r|Regulski2009|pp=222-223}}

==The Tomb==
{{coord|29.86795|N|31.219416|E|type:landmark_dim:100_region:EG|display=title}}

[[File:Egyptmotionseries.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption.|Two wrestlers, tomb of [[Baqet III]] at Beni Hasan, 11th Dynasty (ca. 2000 BC), [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The hieroglyphic text above the figures is a standard votive formula to the god Osiris, ultimately on behalf of the tomb owner.{{r|Newberry|pp=47, Pl. V}}]]
[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Refer to caption.|The [[mastaba]] of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum.]]

The tomb of Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum was discovered by Egyptologist [[Ahmed Moussa (Egyptologist)|Ahmed Moussa]] in the [[necropolis]] at [[Saqqara, Egypt]] in 1964, during the excavation of the causeway for the pyramid of King [[Unas]].{{r|Rice2001|pp=98}} It is the only [[tomb]] in the necropolis where men are displayed embracing and holding hands. In addition, the men's chosen names (both [[theophoric name|theophorics]] to the creator-god [[Khnum]]) form a linguistic reference to their closeness: Niankhkhnum means "life belongs to Khnum" and Khnumhotep means "Khnum is satisfied;"{{r|Dunn_Tomb}} both names honor the god of pottery, responsible for shaping the human body before its birth, as in the midwife episode of Papyrus Westcar, where King Khufu's children are born. Khnum, active in the Elephantine Island region (the first Nile cataract, near modern Aswan), was also associated with the onset of the annual Nile inundation, especially during the early Dynastic period.{{r|Pinch2002|pp=153-155}}

The precise king and regnal date of this tomb are unknown; style places it in the latter 5th Dynasty under [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]] or [[Menkauhor Kaiu|Menkauhor]]. No human remains were discovered inside.{{r|PorterMoss|pp=644}} It is believed the tomb was built in stages, first a sequence of two chambers cut into the limestone of a low escarpment in the northern area of Saqqara, then a surface-built mastaba structure added to mate with the earlier construction. This would have occurred as the two intended occupants gained resources.

In a [[banquet]] scene (treated in a later section), Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep are entertained by dancers, clappers, musicians and singers; in another, they oversee their funeral preparations. In the most striking portrayal, the two embrace, noses touching, in the most intimate pose allowed by canonical [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]], surrounded by what would appear to be their heirs. The superstructure of their tomb 
: "''was almost completely destroyed because king [[Unas]] built his [tomb] causeway over it. It has been reconstructed using the decorated blocks that were found during excavation, and is now open to the public. The part of the tomb that was put into the rock is well preserved. The quality of the painted reliefs is excellent, especially in the first of the rock cut chambers. The various scenes on the western side of the tomb include fishing and fowling in the marshes, stock breeding, papyrus gathering and fights among the boatmen. Opposite are agricultural scenes and scenes of sculptors and jewellers at work''."{{r|Oakes2003|pp=88}}

The [[Old Kingdom]] necropolis revolved around the king's pyramid complex{{r|Arnold1999|pp=93-95}} and its satellite cemeteries, in which queens, princes, and high officials were interred, queens often in small pyramids of their own, others entombed in underground apartments but memorialized above ground by a substantial building for the deceased's offering chapels and grave goods, the mastaba. This rectangular monument is often 60 feet (18m) or more on its long side and 15 feet (5m) high, and erected directly over the burial site. At [[Giza]], these tombs formed a city of the dead, laid out on a grid of streets and avenues,{{r|Janosi1999|pp=27–29, Figs. 13–17}}{{r|Taylor2001|pp=148-151}} although later in this article, we see that the necropolis was a bustling center of activity for the living. Layout at Saqqara is similar but less regular. Maps of [[Saqqara]] and of [[Abusir]], the home of Nysurre's pyramid, are online at Rice University and at Tour Egypt, a brief overview at the latter.{{r|Rice}}{{r|Dunn_Saqqara}}{{r|Dunn_Solar}}

During initial development of the necropolis at [[Saqqara]] in the 2nd and 3rd Dynasties, the mastaba, a mud-brick and/or limestone superstructure built on the surface over a shaft leading to the actual burial chamber below ground, had an elaborate niched and fluted façade. This is called the palace serekh design.{{r|EEF}} The 4th Dynasty simplified the mastaba so that those of Khufu's reign at Giza, as well as the 5th Dynasty monuments at Saqqara, have smooth sides;{{r|Janosi1999}} Niankhknum and Khnumhotep's beautifully restored structure encased in stone. The exterior has a batter angle like a fortress, the wall sloped back as it rises, except for the topmost course, which forms a vertical cornice.

Unfortunately, the artwork inside did not always fare as well. Some of the blocks were re-used in Unas' causeway and nearly all of them, whether removed from situ or not, suffered moisture and salt damage. Preservation improves in the rock-cut section. Most of the reliefs are legible enough for line drawings to be made of them; allowing their texts and graphical data to come down to us.

=== Forecourt entrance with architrave and pillars ===
We progress inward from the tomb entrance as a visitor would. A two-pillared portico makes up the eastern half of the mastaba's façade. The front is inscribed with Niankhkhnum depicted on the left, Khnumhotep on the right. These two reliefs are virtually identical, only the names being different.

=== Interior of forecourt ===
This space is fairly small. The west side is decorated with a funerary procession for Niankhkhnum and the east side shows a matching funerary procession for Khnumhotep.

[[File:Niankhkhnum_and_Khnumhotep_fishing_and_fowling,_composite_scene,_Dyn._5,_ancient_Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men standing on small boats; more in caption.|Khnumhotep (left) and Niankhknum (right) enjoy taking game in the papyrus marshes that dot Egypt's landscape. See text for discussion; click image to enlarge and view tiny family members dispersed about the men. Osirisnet{{r|Osirisnet}}]]The uppermost south wall shows the two men seated before an offering table. Niankhkhnum is seated on the right, while Khnumhotep is seated on the left. The table with offerings stretches out between them. Below the offering scene the two men are depicted netting fowl and fishing. On the left, below this lintel, Khnumhotep stands on a papyrus boat, spearing fish in the water that floods the bases of papyrus stalks he drifts among. He is accompanied by his wife Khenut, sons and a daughter. On the right, Niankhkhnum is depicted in a similar manner, aiming his throw stick at the waterfowl although the active arm is now missing from this piece. The birds flush at the disturbance. He is accompanied by his wife Khentkawes, who was a priestess of Hathor, and sons and a daughter as well.{{r|PorterMoss}} Such hunting in its various forms has been a pursuit of the entitled nobility throughout history. Note that the wives are sniffing lotus blossoms as they hang their free arms upon the legs of their husbands. This scene is a composite made by subtracting a doorway which actually stands between the two men's boats in the tomb; done here to save space. However, one might be tempted to read it as if the door weren't there; analogous Egyptian murals exist with no splitting of the scene into two halves, often with the same person performing the fishing and fowling on both boats. The 18th Dynasty Theban tomb of Nakht (TT52) was an instance. Egyptians would understand a convention that the person engaged in the two activities at consecutive times. Here, since two friends are present, they can be imagined doing it together. The families come along for the outing, drawn at much smaller scales to show relative social status. Their names and titles are written beside each.{{r|PorterMoss|pp=642}}

=== Vestibule ===
[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep scene 1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Refer to caption.|East wall in the first chamber.]]
At the entrance scenes of baking bread and brewing beer are depicted. Barley is carefully measured out and turned into bread. Some of the bread is mixed with a date beverage and fermented to produce some type of beer. Other scenes include goat herding, ship building, harvesting scenes, sailing, netting of birds, etc. The east wall contains a legal text. Below this text several people are depicted thought to be the family of the two men. At the very bottom ships are shown. The men are shown standing before the main cabin of the ship.{{r|PorterMoss}}
{{clear}}

=== Court (open to sky) ===
An undecorated space which serves to connect the vestibule and chambers on the north end of the mastaba with the abutting rock-cut sections of the tomb to their south. Modern security grates now obstruct much of the full sun that would have flooded this small, walled yard, yet little or no sun fell on the vestibule to the outer rock-cut hall described below, as its entrance faces north.{{r|PorterMoss}}

=== Vestibule ===
This should not be confused with the previously-mentioned vestibule at the public entrance; here we are arriving from an enclosed court. With names, titles, and standing portraits of the two men, it is much smaller than the other vestibule and without pillars. The lintel's inside surface features another cattle count scene, and each tomb owner appears on one of the side walls with his wife, amid a flow of yet more offerings from the herds.{{r|PorterMoss}}

=== Outer hall ===
[[File:Mastaba of Niankhkhum and Khnumhotep embrace 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Refer to caption.|Niankhkhnum (standing, left) and Khnumhotep (right, with his right arm on Niankhkhnum's shoulder), accompanied by their offspring (hieroglyphic notations ''msw.f''). On west wall of outer hall, between double doors.{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=148–150, Plate 73}}]]
This outer hall, an antechamber to the final, inner hall, marks the tomb's first, rock-cut phase of construction, and is fully decorated. Before the mastaba was added, it would have been the first room a visitor entered after passing through the forecourt, which was relocated northeast to the far side of the mastaba where it is now. Here, people engage in agricultural occupations including the weighing of corn and grain, the ploughing of fields, and harvesting.

A double doorway to the inner hall is on the west wall, with a broad pillar dividing the doors. Its surface depicts the two men, their children, drawn much smaller to reflect a lesser status, in tow behind each parent.{{r|PorterMoss}} The respective wives do not appear in this scene. Niankhkhnum has three sons and three daughters, Khnumhotep five sons and one daughter, some of whom may be adopted or conceived by a second wife or mistress as they lack the shendyt kilts worn by the others. All the children except Niankhkhnum's youngest son, who still runs naked with his shaved head bearing the single sidelock of youth, are adults despite the scale they are drawn at.{{r|Wilkinson1994|pp=38}} Ptahshepses (not the vizier discussed below), a son of Khnumhotep, wore the youth sidelock in the marsh scene of the forecourt but not so here. Either inconsistency intrudes, or the art, completed over years, reflects some changes of status which transpire during the tomb's construction.

=== Inner hall ===
[[File:Niankhkhnum_and_Khnumhotep_embracing,_at_the_false_doors_in_their_tomb,_Dyn._5,_ancient_Egypt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7 |right|alt=Niankhknum and Khnumhotep embracing. Refer to text.|See text for discussion. Reeder.{{r|Reeder2000|pp=194}}]]Entering either of the double doors, we note more registers, of birds and of men leading animals, on the thicknesses of the jambs. Now on the reverse side of the dividing pillar, we see Niankhknum and Khnumhotep embracing again, and a third time on the opposite wall of this small chamber. They are without their children in this innermost sanctuary. Each man has a "false door," a carved, slot-like niche surrounded by inscriptions which was produced in the royal workshops and installed in the tomb. Niankhknum's is seriously damaged.{{r|PorterMoss}} The false door provided an accessway for the deceased, as a spiritual being, to reach offerings left at the tomb by the living. These offerings were to be set on plinths in front of the false doors.{{r|Taylor2001|pp=155-159}}{{r|Robins2008|pp=19, 55}} Behind the false doors is a small statue closet known as the serdab. A statue of each man would have been placed here, facing the chamber as if to watch visitors come and go, but invisible to the offering-bringers since the false doors are actually solid. Unfortunately, it appears that tomb robbers removed the statues in antiquity; they are no longer extant.{{r|Janosi1999|pp=31}}{{r|PorterMoss|pp=644}}

Frontalism in art poses a problem the artist must solve when rendering persons who face one another or sit together: This style makes it less obvious that the two men are facing each other in an embrace. Only heads and legs orient that way in profile; the torso must be shown in frontal aspect. Side-by-side seating puts one person behind the other in a "doubled" chair, as in the banquet scene (Banquets and music section below). Variety of plant species in a wetland can result in a "composite" plant being painted.{{R|Hagen2007|pp=19, 55}}{{R|Roehrig2005|pp=47-48}} The integrated false doors of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep face the pair of real doors by which people enter the tiny room. The common door frame for the false doors is covered with offering texts (see image in Titulary section). Not only is each transom provided with an offering table scene, the side walls repeat it, for each man, yet now combine it with gathering of goods from the fields. Activity of the butchers receives special emphasis in the lowest, "foreground" registers on both side walls.{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=Plates 86-89}} Niankhkhnum takes the ideologically more favorable south half of the inner hall, but otherwise the two are treated equally.{{r|Baines1985|pp=464}}
{{clear}}

== Offering formulas in the tomb ==
According to Taylor, belief that the deceased physically occupies the grave or tomb dates back to predynastic times, when goods including tools and weapons were placed in the grave during the funeral, a practice which inspired the palace serekh design we mentioned above: For high dignitaries, the early dynastic mastaba reflected the palace they had occupied during life; this "tomb-as-residence" idea remained current up through Roman Egypt, although by Nysuerre's day the art program had moved indoors, obviating the need for serrated exterior walls.{{r|Taylor2001|pp=149}}

[[File:NDt-Hr offerings in tomb of Niankhkhnum &amp; Khnumhotep.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Rows of men at work. Refer to caption.|Detail of scene between double door to inner hall. Offering-bearers deliver goods to the tomb owners, some (not shown) arriving by boat. For hieroglyphs circled in red, see text. Altenmüller.{{r|Altenmueller2006|pp=33}}]]
Besides its unusual construction with both rock-cut and mastaba sections, this tomb is remarkable for the variety of offering-scene layouts and formulas introduced. Within the 5th Dynasty, it is an example of the invocation ''Htp dj nswt'' "an offering the king gives..." to the god, here [[Ancient Egyptian deities|Anubis]], the jackal-headed deity of embalming, in a role that marks royal support for the burial.{{r|Allen2006|pp=14}}{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=55, Plate 3, Fig. 4}} In all such formulas, the deceased is understood as ultimate beneficiary, as the specified food, drink, raiment, and luxury goods are meant to sustain the ka component of a person's soul in the afterlife. Allen's grammatical analysis of this formula identifies the god (Osiris, Anubis, or Wepwawet) as the ''agent'' of the gift via direct genitive connection between the god's name and the combination ''Htp-dj-nswt'', which he takes as a compound word. In his interpretation, the god, acting physically through the king, blesses the deceased.{{r|Allen2010|pp=366}}

As seen above, offerings can occur at table, with the tomb owner seated before them, or in the field with workers delivering them to the owner. The latter can be considered tributary due to the owner's status under royal patronage; in temples they may devolve to the local or state gods in question and are usually tendered by the king. In such cases, the terms ''jnw'' "that which is brought" and ''bAkw'' "works done" come into play. The main point is that they are royal transactions, either diplomatic, when the king receives from foreign emissaries, or redistributive, as when taxes in kind flow to the royal magazines or temples.{{r|Gordon1998|pp=201}}

Altenmüller discusses another kind of offering, the ''nDt-Hr'' "greeting,"{{r|Altenmueller2006|pp=32–35}} extended to a private citizen although undoubtedly as reward for service to the crown. These come from estates (''njwwt'' "towns") the king has granted the deceased, or which the latter has inherited in the line of succession to a grant made in a previous generation.{{r|Kemp2006|pp=166-171}} The depictions emphasize agricultural produce—wine, figs, raisins—and desert animals, brought in procession under the watchful eye of a scribe, who holds his inventory sheet at far left in the illustration. Circled in red is a text for viewing the ''nDt-Hr''-offerings:

''mAA nDt-Hr jnnt m njwwt.f nbt''
"See the greetings-offerings which are being brought from all his villages."

The formulas in the tomb of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep refer anachronistically to the ''pr-dSrt'' "red house," a collections and storage center which had not been active since the 3rd Dynasty.{{r|group=note|note11}} In these greetings offerings, no invocation to the god is made.{{r|Altenmueller2006|pp=34-35}}

===Religious motive===
Dining scenes in Egyptian art refer to the afterlife, often in groups seated on the ground as the large dinner tables familiar to us were unknown to Egypt. Ritual purity becomes a matter of special concern in this context: Museums exhibit the ceramic washing bowls, one to pour from and one to catch the dribbling water.{{r|Baines2014|pp=3-4}} Magical utterances and libation precede the meal of the dead; in the soon-forthcoming Pyramid Texts of Unas, we read

"These your cool waters, Osiris—these your cool waters, oh Unis…I have come having gotten Horus’s eye, (Spell 21). Wash yourself, Unis, and part your mouth with Horus’s eye. You shall summon your ka—namely, Osiris—and he shall defend you from every wrath of the dead. Unis, receive to yourself this your bread, which is Horus’s eye (Spell 66)."{{r|Allen2005|pp=19, 23}}

Although no 5th Dynasty private tombs call the owner Osiris or mention Horus' eye, Taylor indicates some elements of what became the Pyramid Texts were adapted for non-royal use;{{r|Taylor2001|pp=192–198}} particularly the ''qbH'' "libation" water{{r|Hannig2003|pp=1332}} streaming from a red jar on the slab stela of Nefret-iabet (Louvre 15591, Dyn. 4, reign of Khufu), afront her face so as to suggest its use directly. Ziegler calls this a funeral meal as well as an offering table scene, yet it must have taken place after her death, if at all, given that linen for her mummy is specified on the piece's right half.{{r|Ziegler1999|pp=242-244}} Numerals "1000" count most of the items pictured, clearly demonstrating the stela's purpose as an offering list. By invocation and magic, if the living were to stop donating to her tomb establishment, then she would still be provided for. The "one thousand in beer, one thousand in bread" phrases{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 31}} which introduce Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep's offering table in the rock-cut section of their tomb evokes stelae such as Neferet-iabet's, themselves once affixed to mastaba facades as found in situ for Wep-em-neferet (possible husband of Nefret-iabet) at Khufu's Giza cemetery. The heart is never eaten and remains absent from offering lists.{{r|Ziegler1999|pp=245-246}}{{r|Verner1986|pp=31}}

===The musicians===
The upper register of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep (corresponding to Ti's) resembles these scenes on slab stelae, without text beyond the two men's names and titles.{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 31}} Niankhkhnum's wife, seated next to him at the left edge, has been erased; the doubled chair and partially visible label on this side reveals her. She was a ''rxt nswt'' "king's acquaintance." Clearly the ensemble of musicians and dancers is formulaic, as this tomb and Ti's bear similar graphic layouts. Nonetheless, a written music program preserves the orders an instructor-maestro (labeled as such by the word ''sbA'' behind his head{{r|Hannig2003|pp=1097}}) gives his troupe, accompanied by ''mmt''- and ''mAt''-flutes and ''sqr m bnt'' "plucking of the harps:"

''Hsjt j.jrj m nw n snwj ntrwj pr r.k jr.s''
"Singing: Do it thus for the two divine brothers: Begin for them now," the instructor exhorts (hieroglyphs near center right in banquet scene image under the section heading; these are circled in red). About it we hear a mysterious comment:

''m.k Trf jTt'' "Look, the ''Trf''-dance is taken" (lower left corner of image, not circled).{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 31}}

All the men in the second register who aren't playing an instrument are clapping or slapping their thighs except the instructor, standing bent forward at far right. Fourth from left, named Ankhredwi-nesut and playing a flute, is someone who may know the tomb owners, as he is mentioned several times on other walls of this tomb. In the bottom register, another woman, Hemet-Re, possibly Niankhkhnum's daughter and entitled a "keeper of the king's things," stands before six ''Hst'' "female singers" at her right. She is backed by seven ''jbAw'' "male dancers" with hands upraised. Fourth from left in this register is the person who announces that the dance has been taken, clapping as he does so. In front of him, a pair of men kneel. Each clasps one of the other's hands overhead while pointing his other arm toward the ground.{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=142–147, Plate 70, Fig. 25}}{{r|TLA|pp=31}} Altenmüller has more recently refined the translation to read, "Singing, in this (tomb) as the offering ritual is performed.  The (song) of the divine brother. Go up to him." This English wording folds the divine brothers into a song title, reducing their number to just one.{{r|Altenmueller2008|pp=26}}

Observing that festive scenes are more concentrated at Saqqara than elsewhere during the 5th Dynasty, Altenmüller goes on to compare several scenes from this genre, placing them in the context of a family and the gods it associates with, which becomes a heritable scheme along with the titles. At Saqqara, many reliefs involve sniffing the lotus blossom, an activity we saw Khentikawes engage in during her husband's bird hunt.{{r|Altenmueller2008|pp=17, 25}} Returning our gaze to the top register above the music, we see that Khnumhotep is holding a lotus blossom in his lap with his left hand. If he is watching the dancers, they are in front of him, not in a basement below. Complexities encountered in music and dance remain poorly understood today, although Allen thinks that literature was written in meter as well.{{r|Allen2015|pp=2-3}}  Officials, who sometimes were women, presided over musical festivities: In a 4th Dynasty mastaba at Giza, the owner Ity and his wife both bore the ''rx nswt'' "king's acquaintance" title:

''rx nswt jmj-r Hxt pr aA jtj rx nswt Hmt.f mrt.f wsrt-kA'' "Acquaintance of the king, master of the king's music
Acquaintance of the king, his wife, his beloved Wasretka."{{r|Weeks1994|pp=59}}

===Furniture===
[[File:Carpenter_planing_a_backrest_(above),_detail_from_a_Sahure_banquet_scene,_Dynasty_5,_ancient_Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Montage of two scenes. All men in them are squatting. Refer to caption.|(top) Carpenter planing a backrest, (bottom) Relief from Sahure's causeway depicting a feast of his craftsmen. Three of these are labeled as ''mDH qdw'' "supervisor of sculptors."{{r|Hannig2003|pp=581}}{{r|Borchardt1913|pp=122, Plate 54}}]]On the adjoining east wall, near another seated portrait of Khnumhotep,{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=Plate 62}} a carpenter makes a furniture item probably used at banquets: a portable wooden recliner or backrest,{{r|Brovarski1996|pp=151}} an angled plate set on the ground or on a bench to lean against, so that one is lying down with upper body propped up. Furniture, vital to the deceased's sense of wellness, was placed inside the tomb before it was sealed, as were amulets and adornment: To the right, closer to Niankhnum and the banquet scene, are jewelers at work.{{r|Verner1986|pp=23}}{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=Plate 64}} Banqueting could take place in the "presence" of the king even if persons of differing rank did not eat together: A relief from Sahure's causeway shows (in part) a feast craftsmen and their overseers enjoy at the king's behest, divine presence signified by the lion emerging beside a papyrus umbel;{{r|Baines2014|pp=27}} the goddesses Bastet and Sekhmet are associated with royal sustenance at the mortuary complex. In the tomb of Iny (late Dynasty 6), a boastful text explains this:

"I was seated eating bread in the (royal) daily round, and great was His Person's (''Hm.f'', the king) satisfaction at seeing me eat, more [so] than [for] any peer of mine."{{r|Baines2014|pp=5}}

This sentence, written a bit later historically, carries an autobiographical tone, blurring the distinction between life and hereafter, although we assume real-life, non-funerary meals must have been served at court. The tomb is largely a continuation of normal everyday life, the thing the dead wanted most: they were not excluded from the society of the living.{{r|Taylor2001|pp=41}} At 5th Dynasty Saqqara, the deceased Rashepses can contemplate a sculptor reaching for a tray of fruit, even if with fewer words.{{r|Baines2014|pp=5}}

Conventions treating a limited number of themes made up the Old Kingdom art corpus; rules meant to relate what is shown on the wall with what happens in an ideal life, so that the dead can continue to have access to it. Egyptian perspective encompasses both space and time on the two-dimensional relief; heads, arms, and legs in profile but torso frontal. What is above may really lie behind; what is behind may be "pluralized" with multiple outlines as animals often are, while left and right sometimes represent consecutive action as discussed later. Statues of course look forward as expected.{{r|Hagen2007|pp=9-10}}{{r|Robins2008|pp=19, 55}}{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=148-149}} Figures face the tomb entrance where possible, looking out toward the world of the living.{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=22, 148-149}}{{r|Robins2008|pp=72–74}} Lower registers tend to comprise foregrounds, denoting a venue closer to the reader than the top registers do. Seriation of episodes is read horizontally within a register, the people and objects assembled in groups distinguished by what they are doing or by the direction they face. Choice of sunk versus raised relief conveys meaning; the latter used in the intimate rear areas of tombs, the former at the entrance.{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=22}}

First designed for royalty, art is extended to private citizens, minus the king's privileged contacts with deity. Niankhnum and Khnumhotep's tomb uses sunk relief at the entrance to its rock-cut section, which had faced the public before the owners added the mastaba. The two officials could emulate King Khafre's 4th Dynasty practice of gouging a titulary into pillars, but only in limestone, not the hard granodiorite Khafre used.{{r|Chauvet2008|pp=44-45, 48}}{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=98-100}} The banquet scene exemplifies an Egyptian desire to impose structure on life and death, yet in an exuberant manner, its figures imbued with color.

==Career==
Since personal information modern reviewers desire is usually unavailable, a situation true for Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep, routines of daily life must be pieced together from archaeological inference or read between lines of surviving texts, all of which (including the accounting data) express elite viewpoints. Kemp discusses methods for obtaining knowledge under such constraints, pointing out that local religion came with a varnish distinct from that of the state cults.{{r|Kemp2006|pp=112-113, 134}} Art cannot be totally divorced from reality; the agricultural year and cattle counts seen on walls happened. Yet text orbits near myth. So the cattle count is as much ritual as systematic tax collection, and so a lion goddess, addressing King Nyuserre as "my son," gives him milk from her teat at his valley temple.{{r|Eyre2013|pp=277}}{{r|Warden2013|pp=236}}{{r|Arnold1999b|pp=352}}

Relatively few Egyptians could read and write, skill among the literate distributed unevenly as well after schooling based upon individual tutelage—its ad hoc nature evidenced by mistranscription of hieratic source material by draftsmen (''zXAw-qdwt'' "outline scribes") arranging formal inscriptions on walls and statues.{{r|Allen2010|pp=467}}{{r|Baines1983|pp=577, 583-584}} Living conditions could turn harsh, even for middle classes: In a somewhat later, 12th Dynasty social context, the prosperous tenant farmer Heqanakht orders cutbacks for his household, citing that year's suboptimal Nile flood and hunger in the land. Insects ate a substantial fraction of stored grain supplies at New Kingdom Amarna, a condition we have little reason to imagine spared 5th Dynasty communities near Memphis. Iconography and portrait placement assign Niankhkhnum a slight priority over Khnumhotep in the joint tomb.{{r|Allen2002|pp=16-17}}{{r|Zakrzewski2015|pp=318}}{{r|Baines1985|pp=464}}

===Bureaucrats===
[[File:Heb-Sed_festival_of_King_Niuserre,_Dyn._5,_ancient_Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=King seated beneath a canopy looking out at crowd. More in caption.|Heb-Sed festival of Nyuserre from his solar temple. The enshrined king wears the white crown of Upper Egypt at left; standard-bearers at right. In top register beside his pavilion is the personification of Heliopolis, with hieroglyphic label. Ćwiek (2003){{r|Cwiek2003|pp=232, Fig. 70}}]]A solar temple separate from the pyramid complex was a feature unique to the seven 5th-Dynasty kings from Userkaf to Menkauhor, of which two have been excavated in modern times. Nyuserre's was richly decorated with reliefs, today in a fragmentary condition. These temples centered on worship of the ''bn-bn'' "Benben" stone, a cultural artifact inherited from the predynastic era and, by alliteration, tied to the Benu Bird, a theme of plenty later in the Book of the Dead.{{r|Kemp2006|pp=137-141, fig. 48}}{{r|VonDassow1997|pp=73, Plates 7, 27}}{{r|UCL}}{{r|group=note|note6}} Where Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep spent most of their day cannot be determined; the palace, the solar or the pyramid temple, or their own residential compounds all possibilities. The solar temple was used, however, for the king's ''hb-sd'' "Heb-sed," the festival celebrating his 30th anniversary on the throne. Nyuserre's reliefs depict, as had Djoser's back in the 3rd Dynasty, the king watching tributary files pass in review and demonstrating his physical fitness in a game where he ran to and fro between two posts on a marshaling ground.{{r|Kemp2006|pp=104-107}}{{r|Cwiek2003|pp=123}} While at least part of the king's funeral was held at the pyramid complex, his other major monument, the pyramid was never meant to be left unattended after services, as graves of modern heads of state are. Accounting papyri at Abusir detail a persistent mortuary cult's receipt of goods over decades.{{r|Arnold1999|pp=94}}{{r|Ziegler1999b|pp=350-351}}

The vizier, highest official beneath the king, handled Old Kingdom administration. Absent indexed state archives, business transactions proceeded face-to-face, or sometimes by letter while participants kept copies of any legal documents generated. Each proof might be in duplicate, one for consultation, the other sealed to frustrate tampering—by Ramesside times both ingeniously accommodated on the same papyrus roll, where the seal blocked only half its length. In other words, there were bureaus and scribes but no constitutional underpinnings behind them: Whoever held greatest personal influence at a given moment took the decisions and implemented these through his own patronage as best he could, an arrangement not noted for efficiency, yet remarkably effective in seeing a king's monuments through to completion.{{r|Eyre2013|pp=64-65, 259, 342-343}}{{r|Kemp2006|pp=179-180, 201-203}}

On duty at the sun temple, Niankhkhnum or Khnumhotep may have watched over subordinate officials, such as the ''m-r pr Sna'' "overseer of the magazines" who in turn supervised crews of porters stocking and withdrawing material from the granaries and store-rooms. This suggests either that the ''m-r'' ranks below the ''Hm-nT''r priest, at least within the temple enclosure, or that the appellations ''m-r'', ''sHD'', ''Hm-nTr'', and ''wab'' aren't reliable status indicators. Barta reports Helck's assertion that the ''pr Sna'' was a group of workshops making processed goods in the temple precinct. The Abusir papyri, a set of accounting spreadsheets, relates the ''pr Sna'' to the pyramid temple, where Niankhkhnum was "only" a ''wab'', adding to the confusion temple bureaucracy presents to scholars.{{r|Barta2001|pp=61}} It is clear no legal separation of temple from palace existed; Old Kingdom temples were named after the king, who also supported later temples dedicated to gods (such as Karnak). That theft could be a problem is seen in New Kingdom legal disputes; presumably the senior officials were expected to monitor it.{{r|Teeter2011|pp=21}} A police captain is named and illustrated among the genuflectors in the funeral procession at the mastaba.{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}}

===Manicurists, hairdressers, and adorners===
[[File:Manicurist.png|thumb|align=right|alt=Two men squatting; one is doing the other’s fingernails. More in caption.|Manicurist at work, Dyn. 5 (reconstruction). He holds tablet for steadying client's hand by pressing it against his knee; trims nails with a flint knife. One is among reliefs in this tomb.{{r|PorterMoss|pp=642}}]]Care of the king's body and wardrobe in preparation for his public appearances required a large number of aides, apparently working in different ateliers each under its own leadership. In addition to the manicurists whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep supervised (discussed in the titulary section of this article), the palace had attendants under one or more men holding the title ''jrj nfr HAt'' "keeper of the headdress," responsible for the king's wigs and headcloths, ''jrw Snj'' " hairdressers,{{r|Hannig2003|pp=189}} who kept him shaven, and an ''m-r n jzwj Xkrwt nswt'' "overseer of the two chambers of king's adorners."{{r|Barta2001|pp=74}} The post of ''Xkrt nswt'' "adorner of the king" was always held by women, who were legally, if not socially, equal to men in Egypt.{{r|Teeter2011|pp=8}} Neferhotep-Hathor is labeled with this status at the funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep.{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}}

How, or how often, personnel in the hairdressers' shop, which from titulary evidence stands higher than the manicurists in 5th and 6th Dynasty prestige rankings, communicated with the latter remains unknown. No hairdressers are labeled at the funeral procession. Ptahshepses, the keeper of the headdress who became Nyussere's vizier,{{r|Barta2001|pp=73}} and Ti, overseer of the pyramids and sun temples, are two officials whom Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep may have worked with. They were buried at Abusir and Saqqara, respectively. Ti's large mastaba and extra titles suggest attainment of high rank.{{r|PorterMoss|pp=468-478}} Both Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum are attested on a harvest scene in the splendid burial estate of Ptahshepses, where they may have been quarry supervisors, yet named as ''jr ant pr aA'' "palace manicurists," quite junior to titulary in their own tomb, which could mean Ptahshepses died while they were younger.{{r|Baines1985|pp=469}}{{r|Verner1986|pp=68}} A door jamb, besides ''TAtj'' "vizier," displays the title ''HAt-a'' "one whose arm is in front," a pure honorific Allen distinguishes from the ''m-r'' and ''jrj'' titles specifying responsibility domains we've encountered up to now. We observe that his ''jrj nfr HAt'' "keeper of the headdress" epithet, recorded in many of the rooms, is spelled with the mouth sign (Gardiner D21), not the eye sign (D4), so that it shares the introductory word of ''jrj-pat'' "hereditary prince," another of Allen's honorifics.{{r|Verner1986|pp=34}}{{r|Hannig2003|pp=178}}{{r|Allen2010|pp=34}} This fact traverses ground in explaining the apparently higher standing of the hairdressers' shop. Such arcane hierarchy isn't foreign to our own day, where the president of the United States commands TV makeup artists and speechwriters all having different effective ranks within the White House staff.

==Funeral procession==
Longevity and circumstances of the tomb owners' deaths are unknown. The limestone sarcophagi beneath the mastaba were ransacked and wooden coffins of later date interred in the burial chambers. Booth, citing others, adheres to the theory that Khnumhotep died first, leaving Niankhkhnum to complete the tomb's art. This conclusion was drawn from Khnumhotep's ''jmAx'' epithets (see Titulary section), a style of beard he wears, and exclusion of his wife at the banquet scene when Niankhknum's was originally there.{{r|Booth2015|pp=ch.5 at n.92}}{{r|Reeder2000|pp=200-201}} Upon reaching the portico, the visitor beholds on the side walls men towing shrine boats along canals, the herald announcing them carrying a pole standard reminiscent of official colors at the king's Heb-Sed festival. Such boats might carry the mummy or statue of the deceased.{{r|Jones1995|pp=48, Front cover}} There is a statue transported here; men and oxen in an upper register drag it overland in order to load it on the boat.{{r|PorterMoss|pp=642}} Contra the impression we get from Jones' model boat, the statue is already inside its shrine before loading, so that the shrine structure seen on the boats here may actually belong to the cargo, a breakaway of material parts the model conceals from us. (That may apply to mummy boats, too, given their similar functionality.)

===Legal text===
Main presentation of the funeral is in the vestibule after the forecourt (see color photo in Tomb section), introduced by the two owners encouched arm-in-arm for dictation of a text giving legal instructions to survivors and caretakers. Below their names and titles, it reads, in part,

"They say: Concerning those brothers and mortuary priests (''Hm-kA'') who will act for us in the necropolis, we will not allow our children, our two wives, or any man to (have mandates over) them...Further, if any mortuary priest gives his things (assets entrusted to him) in payment to any personnel, from him will be withdrawn all that was given him as a mortuary priest of his workgroup...We have created what we have made for you so that these voice offerings are effective for the akhs (transformed souls) of the offerings-receivers who are the inhabitants of the necropolis."{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}}{{r|group=note|note7}}

===The mourners and relatives===
[[File:Funeral_procession_of_Niankhkhnum_and_Khnumhotep,_Dyn._5,_ancient_Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A scene presented in narrow, horizontal rows, one above another. Four of the rows show people walking in single file. In the first two rows, they carry offerings. Those in the third row have titles in hieroglyphic above them. Most put one hand on their heart as they walk. So do the people in the next row, who are smaller and lack titles. The bottom row shows two boats with oars, one following the other. Caption and text discuss this scene.|Funeral procession of Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep. Again, note how size denotes social status in art. Bottom register is a "foreground." What onlookers see are the boats. The lining-up to honor the deceased probably occurs at the tomb in the desert, a guarded area not open to the public except by permission to enter for some reason, say to bring offerings to one of the tombs. The duo likely had a private cult establishment at their mastaba, or priests from the necropolis staff rotated in and out to service this tomb. Osirisnet.{{r|Osirisnet}}]]There follow two registers of offering-bearers (image at right; the preceding legal text is cropped out), and then larger figures, the principals honoring the deceased, led by the ''sHD wjA'' "inspector of the shrine boat," Khabau-Khufu (named in recognition of the 4th Dynasty king who made the largest Giza pyramid).{{r|Hannig2003|pp=1180}}{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}} Familial relationships stay unclear in Egyptian tombs: Only the pictures of wives (''Hmt.f'' "his wife"), daughters (''zAt.f''), and sons (''zA.f'') bore genealogical notations; even the ego need not be obvious when not drawn at full scale because so many people shared identical names, a situation we face with "John Smith" in a phone book. Reeder identifies Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep themselves at the rear of Khabau-Khufu's line; he and the woman behind him are Niankhkhnum's parents. This woman and Khnumhotep are the only paraders who do not place their left hands upon their hearts, but use them to hold the hand or arm of the person in front of them, suggesting a degree of intimacy between them and the persons they grasp (Khabau-Khufu or Niankhkhnum, respectively).{{r|Reeder2000|pp=197}} More of the deceased's children plus some of foggier status appear, including Ankhredwi-nesut, police captain Khnumhezuf, palace manicurist Kasetef, and Hemre's wife Tjeset.{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}}{{r|group=note|note9}} Sekhem, a scribe of the ''pr HD'' "white house," is both here and behind Niankhkhnum in the forecourt marsh scene, where he had a namesake on Khnumhotep's side, albeit with additional post of inspector of ''Hm-kA'' priests marked. Court decorum would prescribe the guest list and the order they marched in, knowledge lost to modern scholars.

In Reeder's interpretation, absence of Khnumhotep's parents here matching absence of his wife at the banquet, is consistent with Khnumhotep predeceasing his afterlife roommate; for the relief was drafted in advance, before both men were dead. Other officials in line and in the next register (where figures are smaller) include supervisors of weavers, manicurists, ''Hm-kA'' priests, and scribes.{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}}{{r|group=note|note10}} In fact, on Egyptian monuments it's hard to tell who's still alive: Hemre, a probable son of Niankhkhnum, appears elsewhere seated with his wife and receiving a goose from his own son, a scene which emulates the offerings tendered the tomb owners. The dynamics force us to appreciate the sincerity of their afterlife beliefs. Uncertain precise relationship connects Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep as well; Altenmüller considers them brothers, Baines that they were twins, and Reeder that they were same-sex conjugal or domestic partners evidenced by iconography normally used for husband and wife, or, with Khnumhotep, for women (sniffing the lotus blossom). Baines points out that embraces derive from religious and royal precedent, as we saw when a lion goddess suckled Nyuserre (Career section), and a theme Hatshepsut would later develop to high art as offspring of Amun. It is safe to conclude sufficient trust to embark on a yearslong joint tomb project showing them in close contact; the king also permitting them at court in an era where assassination posed real threat.{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=90-92}}{{r|Baines1985|pp= 463,468}}{{r|Reeder2000|pp=197-99,207}}

===The boat convoy===
In the bottom register, two new canopy ships (not the shrine boats in the forecourt discussed above) are rowed on a final "journey to the Beautiful Places in the Midst of the Honored Ones, the journey to the Field of Offerings" (''sqdwt r swt nfrwt m-m jmAxw, sqdwt r sxt Htp''), the leading craft decorated with a hedgehog's-head prow and known as the ''Hnt.''{{r|Hannig2003|pp=850}}{{r|MoussaAltenmueller|pp=91}} The pilots give each crew instructions on where to land, the one in the rear boat cautioning his oarsmen not to hit the hedgehog boat. This setting is a formula with variations also enumerated at Abusir and (minus hedgehog prow) in the Giza mastaba of Iymery, where the watercourse traveled is dubbed "the Canal of the West." In the Egyptian schema, these funeral boats were skippered by the deceased themselves, as they stand in front of the cabin or sit at the stern. The cabin or shrine, roofed with decorative reed matting, shelters the deceased's afterlife corporum, what we think of as a soul even though its structure was more elaborate, more rooted in physicality, than the modern Christian soul conceptions usually are. For us, the watery trip to the West completes a visual connection between soul and the statue or mummy actually carried as cargo in the shrine boats. Since the hedgehog and its companion sport canopies of a different design, we're not sure what was on their manifiests, although the deceased manage to find themselves standing or seated in authority on the decks here, just as in the shrine boats. Barta informs us that in the dual tomb of Fetekty and Mety, a third craft laden with beer trailed the hedgehog, perhaps indicating travel to a funerary meal near the burial site.{{r|Barta2001|pp=82-84}}{{r|Weeks1994|pp=31}}{{r|TLA|pp=Szene 12}}

===Social implications===
The privilege found in Old Kingdom tombs no longer represents operation of an admirable political system. Elite presence imposed hardship on peasants working the fields and paying rents; within the literate class itself, subordinates' resentment of superiors' petty gestures strikes a familiar chord today. Roles were gendered. Physical violence and corporal punishment were common and accepted as normal. Escape hatches leading to mobility taken for granted today opened rarely then. However, the ability to express emotion in writing, particularly of affection or loss, underwent refinement among an elite which after all had come to power over Egypt as warriors employing brutal force. (See the decapitated prisoners on the Narmer palette.){{r|Assman2002|pp=150}}{{r|group=note|note8}} Despite acute limitations of administration and political will, by the 5th Dynasty Egypt had already become capable as a provider state for those outside the highest official circles. Organized recognition of feelings and interests in a broader range of people, as when Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep make concessions to mortuary priests and ask for official integrity in their legal text, began to set a stage for codification of legal procedure (which Egypt achieved in the Ptolemaic period) and extension of rights to individuals and groups within a society.{{r|Baines2013|pp=42, 59, 138, 261}}{{r|Eyre2013|pp=91-94}}{{r|Kemp2006|pp=191-192, 205-209}}{{r|Manning2012|pp=112-114}}

&lt;ref name=note3&gt;To avoid display problems, the MDC system is used here to transliterate Egyptian words, hence note that ''A'' and ''a'' are different. The complete set of consonantal “letters” (in lexical order for consulting an Egyptian dictionary) are '''''A, j, y, a, w, b, p, f, m, n, r, h, H, x, X, z, s, S, q, k, g, t, T, d, D''''', set apart in italics. Other systems exist with special fonts; the ''A'' looks like ''3'' and the ''a'' like ''‘'' in books using these. ([[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|Wikipedia list here]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note4&gt;See also maps on pp. 22-23. There was a harbor and port for docking the ships of state at the entrance to the valley temple, which they accessed from the Nile by going up a canal. The valley temple was a few yards (meters) beyond the line where arable land wetted by the annual Nile flood stops abruptly. A causeway, roofed so that dignitaries (especially women) need not face the brutal sun, led uphill to the pyramid and its temples. Women are rendered in yellow pigments instead of red ochre because they spent less time outdoors.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note5&gt;The titulary in this article elects Egyptian ''sHD'' = Aufseher = "inspector," ''jmAx'' = Ehrwürdigkeit = "honored," ''nb'' = Herr = "lord," ''jr'' or ''jrj'' = Verwalter = "doer, maker, keeper, or supervisor," ''Hr'' or ''Hrj'' = Hüter = "guardian," ''m-r'' or ''jmj-r'' = Vorsteher = "overseer." This runs contra German-speaking ''Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae''; yet English-language books almost always call the ''m-r'' an "overseer," and, less consistently, call the ''sHD'' an "inspector." Literally, ''jmj-r'' means "one whom the mouth is in," that is, a word-giver, grammatically a reverse nisbe, while ''sHD'' is a causative verb meaning "to make bright." (Allen, 2010, pp. 93, 469)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note6&gt;In BOD Spell 83, ''jwnw'' "Iunu" is Heliopolis, now reduced to a Middle Kingdom obelisk of Senwosret I and some foundation walls in a Cairo city park but long the center of solar theology and its priests.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note7&gt;In the German this reads, " Sie sagen: Was anbetrifft jene (Stiftungs-)Brüder und jene Totenpriester, die für uns wegen des Totenopfers für uns in der Nekropole handeln...Was ferner anbetrifft irgendeinen Totenpriester, der irgendeinem Menschen seinen Anteil gegen eine Gegenleistung gibt, von ihm fortzunehmen ist jede zu ihm gegebene Sache, die (dann) gegeben wird zu den Priestern seiner Phyle...Wir haben dieses für euch Gemachte gemacht, damit diese Totenopfer vortrefflich sind den Verklärungsseelen der Opferempfänger und den Bewohnern der Nekropole." I have summarized the redundant clauses for brevity.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note8&gt;For violence against women in an everyday context at a scribal registration table, see Percy Newberry (1893), [http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/newberry1893bd2 ''Beni Hasan II''], Egypt Exploration Society, Plate VII, Register 3. With his stick, a man strikes the top of the head of a kneeling woman who is nursing a baby, yelling at her to stand up (hieroglyphic notation above woman) so as to yield the way to a file of young donkeys being brought forward for inventory. The tomb owner, [[Baqet III]], holding staff and scepter, appears to watch this and other action dispassionately. 11th Dynasty, Beni Hasan tomb 15. Translation with small drawing of this scene, Joris Borghouts (2010), ''Egyptian: An Introduction to the Writing and Language'', Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note9&gt;Perhaps "guard" should be compared with "police" in this context, showing the danger of modern terminology in translation. Police in ancient Egypt, unlike ordinary door guards, most likely did gather personal intelligence and search for wanted persons. However, they protected only the state; as a rule, they did not investigate crimes against citizens. The revenge system, or a lawsuit if the victims could afford to pursue it, were the only redresses available for crimes that did not involve state officials or property. See Eyre, C. (2013), ''The Use of Documents in Pharaonic Egypt'', Oxford, pp. 178, 307-308 for administrative papyri used in the prosecution of Ramesside-era tomb robbers. See again Eyre, C. (1984), "Crime and Adultery in Ancient Egypt," ''Jl. of Egyptian Archaeology'' '''70''', pp. 92-105 for a general discussion of how Egypt handled antisocial behavior, esp. pp. 92-94 where the corruption case of Paneb arises. Resort to New Kingdom evidence is due to so little surviving from the Old Kingdom. 5th Dynasty police agencies were probably less evolved, deploying fewer personnel.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note10&gt;All tomb scenes were carved and painted during the prospective occupant's lifetime. Hence they showed an idealization of what was supposed to happen, in terms of mortuary beliefs; they are not records of who was present at a funeral or even of what they did there. From Jones' boats, however, we know that papyriform funeral boats were built and used. An enormous ship of state Khufu buried in a special pit beside his pyramid has been restored and is on display at Giza. There were pits for four more boats, with a boat inside one of these left in situ for future archaeologists. Khufu's boats were made of wood, while the smaller private boats were usually made from bundles of papyrus stalks.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=note11&gt;5th Dynasty tax collection by scribes is depicted in the tomb of Ti with postures of obeisance, see Wilkinson (1994), ''Symbol and Magic in Egyptian Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 208. For enforcement of taxes we have detail information from New Kingdom Thebes; see Haring, B.J (1997), ''Divine Households: Administrative and economic aspects of the New Kingdom royal memorial temples in Western Thebes'', Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten. Note labor conscription and exemptions, and the status of many peasants as serfs tied to the land.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurie Dann''' (née '''Wasserman'''; October 18, 1957 – May 20, 1988) was an American murderer who shot and killed one boy, [[Nick Corwin]], and wounded two girls and three boys in a [[Winnetka, Illinois]] elementary school. She then took a family hostage and shot another man, non-fatally, before killing herself.

==Early life==
Dann was born in [[Chicago]] and grew up in [[Glencoe, Illinois|Glencoe]], a north suburb of Chicago. She was the daughter of an accountant, Norman Wasserman, and his wife, Edith Joy.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite book

Those who knew Dann described her as shy and withdrawn.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt; She graduated from [[New Trier High School]] in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], in 1975.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt; Her grades were poor in high school, but she was able to attend [[Drake University]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. When her grades improved, she transferred to the [[University of Arizona]] with the goal of becoming a teacher. She began dating a [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] student, and the relationship soon became serious, but she was becoming possessive and demanding.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;  In the summer of 1977 she attended the [[University of Wisconsin]] in Madison, taking a course in home economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1988-06-05-8801040887-story.html#|title=THE MANY FACES OF LAURIE DANN|first=George Papajohn and Joel Kaplan. Ray Gibson, William Recktenwald, John O`Brien, Steve Johnson, Barbara Mahany and Stevenson Swanson contributed to this|last=report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, with the relationship failing, Dann moved back to her parents' home.  She then transferred to [[Northwestern University]] to complete her degree, but she dropped out of all her classes and never graduated.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

==Marriage and divorce==
She met and married Russell Dann, an executive in an insurance broker firm in September 1982, but the marriage quickly soured as Russell's family noted signs of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and other strange behavior,&lt;ref name=Day/&gt; including leaving trash around the house.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt; She saw a [[psychiatrist]] for a short period, who identified her childhood and upbringing as a cause of her problems.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

Laurie and Russell Dann separated in October 1985.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt; The divorce negotiations were acrimonious, with Laurie claiming that Russell was [[domestic violence|abusive]]. In the following months, the police were called to investigate various incidents, including several harassing phone calls made to Russell and his family.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;  In April 1986, Laurie Dann accused Russell of breaking into and [[vandalism|vandalizing]] her parents' house, where she was then living. Shortly after, she purchased a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[.357 Magnum]], telling the salesman that she needed it for self-defense. The police were concerned about her gun ownership and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Dann and her family that she should give up the gun.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;

In August 1986, she contacted her ex-boyfriend, who was by then a [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] at a hospital, and claimed to have had his child. When he refused to believe her, Dann called the hospital where he worked and claimed he had [[rape]]d her in the emergency room.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news

In September 1986, Russell Dann reported he had been stabbed in his sleep with an [[icepick]]. He accused Laurie of the crime, although he had not actually seen his attacker. The police decided not to press charges against Laurie based on a medical report which suggested that the injury might have been self-inflicted, Russell's abrasive attitude towards the police, and his failed [[polygraph]] test.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt; Russell and his family continued to receive harassing hang-up phone calls, and Laurie was arrested for calls made to Russell's sister. The charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

Just before their divorce was finalized in April 1987, Laurie accused Russell of raping her. There were no physical signs supporting Laurie's claim, although she passed two polygraph tests.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;  In May 1987, Laurie accused Russell of placing an incendiary device in her home.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt; No charges were filed against Russell for either alleged event. Laurie's parents believed her claims and supported and defended her throughout. By this time, Laurie Dann was being treated by another psychiatrist for [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and a "chemical imbalance"; the psychiatrist told police that he did not think Laurie was [[suicide|suicidal]] or homicidal.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

==Final year==
Dann worked as a babysitter, and some employers were happy with the care she provided their children.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  Others made complaints to the police about damage to their furniture and the theft of food and clothes.  Despite the complaints, no charges were pressed. Dann's father did pay for damages in one case.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

In the summer of 1987, Dann sublet a university apartment in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Once again, her strange behavior was noted, including riding up and down in elevators for hours, wearing rubber gloves to touch metal, and leaving meat to rot in sofa cushions. She took no classes at the university.

In the fall of 1987, Dann claimed she had received threatening letters from Russell and that he had [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her in a parking lot, but the police did not believe her. A few weeks later, she purchased a [[.32 S&amp;W Long|.32-caliber]] [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] revolver.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;

With her condition deteriorating, Dann and her family sought specialized help.  In November 1987, she moved to [[Madison, Wisconsin]], to live in a student residence while being observed by a psychiatrist who specialized in obsessive-compulsive disorder. She had already begun taking [[clomipramine]], a drug for OCD, and her new psychiatrist increased the dosage, adding [[lithium carbonate]] to reduce her mood swings and initiating [[behavioral therapy]] to work on her phobias and ritualistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt; Despite the intervention, her strange behavior continued, including riding elevators for long periods, changing television channels repetitively, and an obsession with "good" and "bad" numbers. There were also concerns about whether she was [[bulimic]].

Dann purchased a .22 semi-automatic [[Beretta]] at the end of December 1987. In March 1988, she stopped attending her appointments with the psychiatrist and behavior therapist.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt; At about the same time, she began to make preparations for the attacks. She stole books from the library on [[poisons]], and she diluted [[arsenic]] and other chemicals from a lab. She also shoplifted clothes and wigs to disguise herself and was arrested for theft on one occasion. Both her psychiatrist and her father tried to persuade her to enter the hospital as an inpatient, but she refused.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

Dann continued to make numerous hang-up phone calls to her former in-laws and babysitting clients. Eventually, the calls escalated to death threats. An ex-boyfriend and his wife also received dozens of threatening calls. In May 1988, a letter, later confirmed to have been sent by Laurie Dann, was sent to the hospital administration where her ex-boyfriend then worked, again accusing him of sexual assault. Since the phone calls were across state lines, the [[FBI]] became involved, and a federal indictment against Dann was prepared. However, the ex-boyfriend, fearful of publicity,&lt;ref name=Day/&gt; and concerned about Dann getting bail and then attempting to fulfill her threats against him, decided to wait until other charges were filed in Illinois.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;  In May 1988, a [[janitor]] found her lying in the fetal position inside a garbage bag in a trash room.  This precipitated a search of her room and her departure back to Glencoe.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

==Attacks==
During the days before May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann prepared rice cereal snacks and juice boxes poisoned with the diluted arsenic she had stolen in Madison. She mailed them to a former acquaintance, ex-babysitting clients, her psychiatrist, Russell Dann, and others. In the early morning of May 20, she personally delivered snacks and juice "samples" to acquaintances, and families for whom she had babysat, some of whom had not seen her for years.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name =MOI/&gt; Other snacks were delivered to [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Psi Upsilon]], and [[Kappa Sigma]] [[fraternity house]]s and Leverone Hall at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]].&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name =MOI/&gt; Notes were attached to some of the deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;Sources ascribe similar notes to different recipients. For example, Associated Press articles mention that a note "Love your little sisters. Enjoy" was sent to a family, while a Chicago Tribune article, and Kaplan et al. book suggests that similar notes ("Love, your little sisters. Enjoy" and "To the ATOs, from your little sisters") were received by fraternities. Similarly, a longer text "I'm going to be in Glencoe when your in town-look forward to seeing you guys.  I was going to send you coffee cake, but I was making rice crispy treats for school and decided to send some. Enjoy. Love, Laurie" was sent by mail  according to the Kaplan et al. book, and attached to the fraternity deliveries according to the Egginton book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray Gibson and Linnet Myers, "School Killer Left A Trail Of Poison Fraternities, Homes Receive Tainted Food", ''Chicago Tribune'' (22 May 1988) 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TS&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drinks were often leaking and the squares unpleasant-tasting, so few were actually consumed. In addition, the arsenic was highly diluted so nobody became seriously ill.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;

At about 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on the 20th, Dann arrived at the home of the Rushe family, former babysitting clients in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], to pick up their two youngest children. The family had just told Dann they were moving away.&lt;ref name = MOI/&gt; Instead of taking the children on the promised outing, she took them to Ravinia Elementary School in Highland Park, Illinois, where she erroneously believed that both of her former sister-in-law's two sons were enrolled (in fact, one of Dann's intended targets was not even a student at the school).  She left the two children in the car while she entered the school and tried to detonate a fire bomb in one of the school's hallways. After Dann's departure, the small fire she set was subsequently discovered by students, and quickly extinguished by a teacher.  She drove to a local daycare attended by her ex-sister-in-law's daughter and tried to enter the building with a plastic can of gasoline, but was stopped by staff.

Next Dann drove the children back to their home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, but the boys spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to set fire to the house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape).&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name =MOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. She wandered into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a .22 semi-automatic [[Beretta]] pistol. Her [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] .357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt; Dann then reentered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into the corner of the room. The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a .32 Smith &amp; Wesson from the waistband of her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nicholas Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car.&lt;ref name =MOI/&gt;

Dann was prevented from leaving the area by car because the roads were closed for a funeral cortege. She decided to drive her car backwards down the nearby street, but the road dead-ended into a private drive. Abandoning her car, she removed her bloodstained shorts and tied a blue garbage bag around her waist. With her two remaining guns she made her way through the woods and came upon the house of the Andrew family. Dann entered the house and met a mother and her twenty-year-old son, who were in the kitchen. She claimed she was raped and had shot the rapist in the struggle.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=halperin&gt;{{Cite journal

The Andrews were sympathetic&lt;ref name=halperin/&gt; and tried to convince her that she need not fear the police because she had acted in self-defense.  Mrs. Andrew gave Dann a pair of her daughter's pants to wear. While she was putting them on, Philip Andrew was able to pick up and pocket the Beretta.  He suggested that she call her family.  Dann agreed and called her mother, telling her she had done something terrible and that the police were involved.  Philip took the phone and explained Dann's story about the rape and shooting, suggesting that Mrs. Wasserman come to get Dann; Mrs. Wasserman said she could not come because she did not have a car.

Mr. Andrew arrived home, and they continued to argue with Dann, insisting she give up the second gun. Dann called her mother again and this time Mr. Andrew spoke with Mrs. Wasserman, asking her to persuade Dann to give up the gun. While Dann spoke with her mother, Mrs. Andrew left the house and alerted the police. Mr. Andrew told Dann that he would not remain in the house if she did not put down the gun, and also left the house.  Dann ordered Philip to stay. Just before noon, seeing the police advancing on the house she shot Philip in the chest, but he managed to escape out the back door before collapsing and being rescued by the police and ambulance personnel.

With the house surrounded, Dann went upstairs to a bedroom. The Wassermans and Russell Dann were brought to the house.  At about 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., an assault team entered the house while Mr. Wasserman attempted to get Dann's attention with a bullhorn. The police found her body in the bedroom; she had shot herself in the mouth.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

All but one of the victims wounded by Dann recovered from their injuries, including the schoolgirl who was shot and suffered severe internal injuries. The victims, school children, and parents received extensive support to help them cope with the [[PTSD|psychological after-effects]] of the attacks.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news

Parents and members of the community subsequently devoted many years to [[gun control]] policy.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6154968|title=School shooting remembered 20 years later|date=May 20, 2008|publisher=ABC local news|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philip Andrew gave interviews about gun control from his hospital bed, and later became active in local and state gun control organizations as the executive director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; he subsequently became a lawyer and then an [[FBI]] agent.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=halperin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-20-dann-anniversarymay20,0,5288021.story?page=2|title=Old hurts, new lives emerge two decades after Dann shootings|last=Black |first= Lisa |author2=Rubin, Bonnie Miller |date=May 20, 2008|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dann shootings also fueled the debate about criteria for committing [[mental illness|mentally ill]] people to mental health facilities against their will. Some favored the [[involuntary commitment]] of a person who is determined to be mentally ill and incapable of making informed decisions about treatment; [[civil libertarian]]s like Benjamin Wolf (staff counsel for the [[ACLU]] of Illinois&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;) opposed the idea saying, "It would be a shame if we cut back on the civil liberties of literally millions of mentally ill people because of the occasional bizarre incident."

A book called ''Murder of Innocence'' was written by [[Eric Zorn]] about the tragedy, and a made-for-television film of the same name was based on it.  In the film, Dann's name is changed to Laurie Wade. She was played by [[Valerie Bertinelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MURDER OF INNOCENCE (2013)|url=http://filmrise.com/murder-innocence/|website=FilmRise.com|publisher=Fisher Klingenstein Films|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search for a rationale==
Some blamed Dann's family for defending and protecting her in spite of the signs of her deteriorating mental health.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; Investigations were hampered by the Wassermans' refusal to be interviewed by police&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite news

On the night of Dann's death, the Wassermans allowed only a very brief search of her bedroom, after which they cleaned it and removed potential evidence.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt; The police were criticized for not sealing off Dann's room as part of the crime scene.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;  Parents of the shooting victims subsequently sued the Wasserman family for damages.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

Further criticism was directed at Dann's psychiatrists for failing to identify or take action regarding the signs of Dann's decreasing mental stability.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; At the time of her suicide, Dann was taking an unlicensed drug [[clomipramine]].&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;&lt;ref name=drug&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Ray |title=Winnetka Killer Treated With Psychiatric Drug |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1988-06-02 |url=http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lauriedann.html#Treated |accessdate=2007-02-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213052715/http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lauriedann.html |archivedate=2007-02-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of this drug were initially considered as contributing factors to Dann's mental well-being, but ultimately ruled out.&lt;ref name=drugFDA&gt;{{cite news |title=Drug Dann Used Gets FDA Approval |pages= |language= |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1988-06-08 |url=http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lauriedann.html#Drug |accessdate=2007-07-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402124116/http://www.theawarenesscenter.org/lauriedann.html |archivedate=2007-04-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two newspaper clippings were found among Dann's possessions after her death. One described a man who randomly killed two people in a public building. The other described a depressed young man who had attempted to commit suicide in the same way that Dann did; he survived and discovered that his brain injury had cured him of his obsessive-compulsive disorder.&lt;ref name=Day/&gt;

One theory of Dann's rationale was that she targeted people who had "disappointed" her in some way: her ex-husband, her former sister-in-law (through the firebombing attempts at her children's schools and daycare), her ex-boyfriend and his wife, the family who was moving away, as well as former friends and babysitting clients.&lt;ref name=MOI/&gt;

Dann was also briefly investigated as a possible suspect in the [[Chicago Tylenol murders]], but no direct connection was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mNkVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8RIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3227,6319355&amp;dq=tylenol+laurie+dann&amp;hl=en|title=Tragedy in Winnetka: the answers are few|date=25 May 1988|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]'', author [[Warren Farrell]] suggested that Laurie Dann's actions were an example of women's violence against men. He claimed, erroneously, that all of Dann's victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Therefore my suggestion that she was a parallel force to the celebrated University of Montreal killer who focused on women, was not accurate."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">Saint '''Leo of Cappadocia''' was a [[Christian]] [[saint]].

Leo was an ascetic from [[Cappadocia]] whose life and [[martyrdom]] is described in [[John Moschos]]' "[[Pratum Spirituale]]" ("The Spiritual Meadow"). Leo was distinguished by his warm [[hospitality]] to all his visitors, whom he considered to be sent by God. He had the habit of saying with an enigmatic smile: "Now I am on my way to become an Emperor". (The word "Basileos" -"king" in [[Byzantium]] meant also "Emperor".) He was frequently derided, and even considered to be out of his wits, for this saying, since there had never been an emperor from Cappadocia.

Once pagan soldiers attacked the surroundings of the town near which Leo lived. With all the inhabitants he took refuge within the walls of the town. Only few old men were caught by the intruders. Leo left the fortress and went to the enemy camp offering himself to the pagans in the place of the old men, who because of their weakness would be of no use to them, whereas Leo had sufficient strength to be of profit. The pagans agreed, released the elders and took Leo instead. However, when Leo was loaded with sacks and asked to follow the soldiers, it turned out that Leo himself was not apt for such physical labors (even though he tried to keep his word and serve them) being weakened by his constant [[prayer]]s and [[vigil]]s. The pagans, believing that Leo had tricked them in order to rescue his older compatriots, were enraged and [[behead]]ed him.

Only then did the people realize that when Leo had spoken about becoming an emperor, he meant not earthly, but heavenly empire, for he fulfilled the commandment of the Savior: "There is no greater love than that when one lays down his soul for brethren", and therefore received the crown of heavenly kingdom from Him.

'''Léon Mignon''' ([[Liège]], 9 April 1847 – [[Schaerbeek]], 30 September 1898) was a Belgian sculptor working in a [[Realism (arts)|realist]] idiom, known for his depiction of [[bull]]s.

Born at Liège, Léon Mignon completed his studies at the Académie royale des Beaux-Arts de Liège in 1871. He made his first showing at the Salon of Ghent, and obtained a fellowship from the Fondation Darchis for further study in Italy.

He set up his studio in [[Paris]] in 1876 in collaboration with [[Paul de Vigne]], then settled permanently at [[Schaerbeek]]. He won a gold medal at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] for his sculpture ''Li Tore'', the Bull-Tamer (''illustration'') which provoked polemics from critics for its combination of nudity with forthright realism.

''Li Tore'', set up at Liège, became the mascot of the students, who hid it in the cellars of the Académie  to protect it during [[World War II]]. The bull has become an [[emblem]] for all Liège, with the city motto ''"Liège, forcer l’avenir!"'', "Liège, make the future happen!"

A bronze on a similar theme, his ''Le Dompteur de Taureaux'' (1881), which had been noticed at the retrospective exhibition of Belgian sculpture the previous year (in its plaster model), and was championed by Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns, Minister of the Interior, stands on the Terrasses d'Avroy, Liège. Though a scarf had been added to the model to disguise the figure's nudity, the sculpture scandalised the editors of the Catholic daily, ''La Gazette de Liège.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wittert.ulg.ac.be/expo/19e/album/173_mignon_tore.html Vers la modernité. Le XIXe siècle au Pays de Liège].&lt;/ref&gt;

One among his ''[[animalier]]'' sculptures is to be seen at the [[Botanical Garden of Brussels]]: ''The Olive Tree, or Peace'', representing an agricultural worker with his ox. His early ''Combat de taureaux dans la campagne romaine'' is conserved in the Musée Royal des Beaux-Arts, Brussels.

Other sculptures include ''Hide-and-Seek'' and ''Lady Godiva''.

Both Schaerbeek and Liège possess a rue Léon Mignon.

'''Mariella Mehr''' (born 27 December 1947 in [[Zürich]]) is a Swiss writer.

Mariella Mehr was born a member of the nomadic [[Yeniche people|Yeniche]] people. She was a victim of the ''[[Kinder der Landstrasse|Hilfswerk für die Kinder der Landstrasse]]'' (loosely translated, "Relief Organisation for Rural Street Children"), which separated Yeniche children from their parents. Mehr was moved between 16 orphanages and three reformatories as a child. She was committed to a [[mental institution]] four times and spent nineteen months in a women's prison.

Mehr published her first work in 1975, and her first novel, ''Steinzeit'', in 1981. She champions the causes of outsiders and oppressed minorities. Her work was recognized in 1998 with an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Basel]].

In 2000, she resigned from the authors' club ''[[Gruppe Olten]]'', because the group struck from its mission statement the goal of realising a "democratic socialist society".

Mariella Mehr currently lives in [[Tuscany]].

'''Me Me Lai''' (born 3 November 1951), sometimes billed as '''Me Me Lay''', is a Burmese-British actress and television host who worked mainly in British and Italian films, most notably in the horror genre.

==Life==
She was born on the night of 3 November 1951 in [[Burma]] to a Burmese mother and an English father. She moved to [[England]] in her teens, where she soon started her acting career, at first in television series like ''[[Paul Temple]]'' and ''[[Jason King (TV series)|Jason King]]''. Soon, she made the transition to acting in movies, starting with the 1971 Mike Raven horror movie ''[[Crucible of Terror]]'', soon followed by the 1972 sex comedy ''[[Au Pair Girls]]'' directed by [[Val Guest]].

Lai came into her own during the era of [[Cannibal film|Italian cannibal films]], playing lead roles in two genre-defining movies: ''[[Man from Deep River]]'' (1972) by [[Umberto Lenzi]], and ''[[Ultimo Mondo Cannibale|Last Cannibal World]]'' (1977) by [[Ruggero Deodato]]. Lai appears nude throughout most of the film, which includes an explicit shot of her [[vulva]]. Additionally, she also had a part in ''[[Eaten Alive!]]'' (1980), again by [[Umberto Lenzi]], in which one of her scenes from ''Last Cannibal World'' was re-used. Outside the cannibal genre, she had a brief role as a Chinese brothel girl in [[Blake Edwards]]'s 1978 comedy ''[[Revenge of the Pink Panther]]''.

Me Me Lai also was co-hostess of British game shows ''[[The Golden Shot]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'', and appeared on the 1970s [[Yorkshire Television]] programme ''Origami'', with [[Robert Harbin]].

Her last movie was [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' in 1984.

'''Michael Howard''' (1948–2015) was an English practitioner of [[Luciferianism|Luciferian]] Witchcraft and a prolific author on [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] topics. From 1976 until his death he was the editor of ''[[The Cauldron]]'' magazine.

Born in [[London]], Howard developed an interest in [[supernatural]] subjects through fiction literature, later exploring [[Tibetan Buddhism]] after a [[near death experience]]. He proceeded to study at an agricultural college in [[Somerset]], learning about the local folklore from an elderly farm worker, in particular folk beliefs about magic and witchcraft. He advanced his knowledge of esoteric subjects through reading books by prominent occult authors like [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Helena Blavatsky]], and in 1964 joined the fledgling [[Witchcraft Research Association]], becoming particularly interested in the articles in its newsletter that were authored by the witch [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]]. Returning to the London area, in 1967 he developed a friendship with the Luciferian [[ceremonial magic]]ian [[Madeline Montalban]], joining her Order of the Morning Star. In 1969 he was initiated into [[Gardnerian Wicca]], joining a coven of its practitioners, and in the early 1970s became a member of [[Christine Hartley]]'s [[Co-Masonry|Co-Masonic]] lodge in [[West London (sub region)|West London]].

In 1975, Howard published his first book, ''Candle Magic'', which was followed the next year by the beginning of ''The Cauldron''. From 1977, the magazine became the vehicle for Bill Liddell's controversial articles about the nineteenth century cunning man [[George Pickingill]], and it would also serve as a platform for articles by a wide range of esotericists. In 1999, Howard was contacted by [[Andrew Chumbley]], and in 1999 he joined Chumbley's "[[Traditional Witchcraft]]" order, the [[Cultus Sabbati]].

The [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White described Howard as a "prominent figure in the British Craft movement",{{sfn|Doyle White|2011a|p=45}} while Hutton characterised him as "the most open-minded of Pagan editors".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=219}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Howard was born in London in 1948.{{sfn|Greene|2015}} In his early teenage years, he developed an interest in [[Western esotericism]], [[occultism]], and the [[paranormal]], primarily through the fictional stories of writers like [[Dennis Wheatley]], [[M. R. James]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[Sax Rohmer]], [[Arthur Machen]], [[Robert E. Howard]], and [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=3}} Aged fourteen, he underwent an emergency operation and an associated [[near death experience]], subsequently embarking on a study of [[spirituality]], in particular through books on [[Tibetan Buddhism]] by authors like [[Lobsang Rampa]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=3}} He was intrigued by the prospect of magical practices continuing in Britain after reading a March 1963 article in the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'' detailing a "Black Magic Rite" alleged to have taken place near to the village of [[Clophill]] in [[Bedfordshire]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=3}} Shortly after, he watched a television interview with the prominent Wiccan [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], whose arguments against a hostile Christian clergyman impressed Howard.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=3}}

He went on to study at an agricultural college in [[Somerset]], as part of which he was assigned to a work placement on a [[smallholding]] between [[Wincanton]] and [[Castle Cary]] which was run by two elderly spinster sisters.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=4}} An elderly man who sometimes worked on the farm recounted to Howard various aspects of local folklore, including a belief in [[witchcraft]]. The old man informed him that the spinsters nailed [[rowan]] twigs above the doors to their barn and cowshed on [[May Eve]] and [[Halloween]] in order to ward off [[fairies]] and "black witches", also telling him that there were solitary female "witches" living on the border between [[Devon]] and Somerset who used magic to either curse or cure ailments.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=4}}

Following his graduation, Howard gained employment on a farm in [[Gloucestershire]], and on his day off each week he travelled to [[Gloucester]] or [[Cheltenham]]. In the latter was a second-hand bookstore where he purchased a number of books on esoteric subjects, including [[John Symonds]]' biography of the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], ''The Great Beast'', Crowley's own ''[[Magick in Theory and Practice]]'', [[Robert Graves]]' ''[[The White Goddess]]'', [[Dion Fortune]]'s ''The Sea Priestess'' and ''Moon Magic'', [[Margaret Murray]]'s ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', [[Montague Summers]]' ''Witchcraft and Black Magic'', [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', and [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' and ''[[Isis Unveiled]]''.{{sfn|Howard|2010|pp=4–5}} It was also while working for this farm that he met a local [[cunning folk|cunning man]], who also worked as a hedge layer and fence-repairer. This man taught Howard more about folk magic, and hinted that there were groups of folk magicians active in the [[Cotswolds]] who were involved in a tradition that was separate from Gardner's Wicca.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=5}} After a short time in Gloucestershire, Howard moved to [[Middlesex]] to be closer to his mother, who was terminally ill.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=5}} Here he was employed as a gardener at [[Stanmore]], although he later left this position in order to become an office worker.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=5}} In coming years he would work in various managerial and executive positions for [[EMI]], [[Sotheby's]], and [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise]].{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=5|2a1=Greene|2y=2015}}

===The Order of the Morning Star and Wicca===

In 1964 he joined the short-lived [[Witchcraft Research Association]], and through reading its newsletter, ''Pentagram'', he discovered the writings of the Witch [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=5}} Although Howard claimed that he was "never totally convinced" of Cochrane's claim to have come from a hereditary tradition of witches stretching back generations, he added that Cochrane's writings "had a lasting influence on my progress through the Craft".{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=5}} Searching for an occult organisation in which to involve himself, he visited the headquarters of the [[Society of the Inner Light]] in [[Hampstead]], although being nineteen at the time he was deemed too young to join.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=9}}

In 1967, Howard wrote to the Luciferian ceremonial magician and astrologer [[Madeline Montalban]] after reading one of her articles in ''Prediction'' magazine; she invited him to visit her at her home. The two became friends, with Montalban believing that she could see the "Mark of [[Cain]]" in his [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]].{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1pp=5–6}} She invited him to become a student of the ONS, which he duly did.{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=6|2a1=Gregorius|2y=2013|2p=243}} Although his parents disapproved of his interest in magic, over the coming year he spent much of his time with her, and in 1968 they went on what she called a "magical mystery tour" to the [[West Country]], visiting [[Stonehenge]], [[Boscastle]] and [[Tintagel]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|pp=7–8}}

In 1969, he was initiated into [[Gardnerian Wicca]], something Montalban disapproved of, and their friendship subsequently "hit a stormy period" with the pair going "[their] own ways for several years."{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=8}} Howard's Gardnerian initiator had also been involved in The Regency, a group founded by members of Cochrane's Clan of Tubal Cain after Cochrane's death in 1966.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=8}} The Wiccan group that Howard was part of merged the Gardnerian structure with additional elements borrowed from ceremonial magic, the Regency, and Cochrane's practices.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=8}} This coven corresponded with an American, [[Jessie Bell]], and initiated her into the tradition by proxy, sending her a copy of their own variant of the Gardnerian [[Book of Shadows]]. Claiming that the Goddess had commanded her to do so, she published the work as ''[[Lady Sheba's Book of Shadows]]'', much to the coven's disapproval.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=8}}

During the 1970s he befriended [[Christine Hartley]], a longstanding member of the Society of the Inner Light, and he accompanied her to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] performed by the [[Liberal Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|pp=8–9}} At her invitation, he joined her [[Co-Masonry|Co-Masonic]] lodge in West London, which had an [[Ancient Egypt]] theme.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=9}} He also enquired about joining the West London-based [[Ancient Order of the Pyramid and the Sphinx]], a ceremonial magic group which was run by [[Tamara Bourkon]], but declined membership when it was revealed that he would have to adopt [[vegetarianism]], [[celibacy]], and [[teetotalism]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=10}}

===Publications and ''The Cauldron''===

At Montalban's recommendation, Howard began writing on esoteric subjects, with his first publication being an article on [[elemental]]s which appeared in ''Prediction'' in 1971.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=7}} He continued to write articles and book reviews for the magazine for thiry years, until his friend, Jo Logan, retired as its editor.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=7}} In 1975 his first book, ''Candle Burning: Its Occult Significance'', was published by [[Thorsons]].{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Greene|2y=2015}} The publisher had initially proposed a book on this subject to [[W. E. Butler|W. G. "Ernest" Butler]], a friend of Hartley's, but he did not feel capable of the task, instead suggesting Howard's name to them.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=8}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The original, if in retrospect rather naive, premise behind [''The Cauldron''] was based on the ideals of the old Witchcraft Research Association. My idea was to bring together different individuals, covens and traditions in an independent literary forum to promote informed discussion and tolerance. Obviously that was a rather optimistic goal, but over thirty years later the magazine is still growing strong while many others have fallen by the wayside. So we must be doing something right!"|source=— Michael Howard, 2010.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=10}}}}

In 1974, he and a female friend had established an esoteric magazine titled ''Speculum''. It ran for ten issues before folding after his co-editor found the project too difficult due to pre-existing work commitments.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=10}} In 1976 Howard then established ''The Cauldron'', a magazine catering for modern Pagan Witches, after the idea was suggested to him in a conversation with the Gardnerian Madge Worthington. After ''The Wiccan'', it was only the second British outlet to do so, and gave space to practitioners of traditions other than the [[Gardnerian Wicca]] which dominated ''The Wiccan''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=371|2a1=Howard|2y=2010|2p=10}} 100 copies of the first issue were produced on a second-hand roneo duplicator which Howard had purchased from the redundancy payment given to him by EMI.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=10}} 25 copies were placed in the [[Atlantis Bookshop]] while the rest were sent to ''Speculum'' subscribers to complete their outstanding subscriptions.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=10}} Over the coming forty years, ''The Cauldron'' published articles by a range of individuals associated with the study or practice of magic, including [[Ronald Hutton]], Caroline Tully, [[Philip Heselton]], Geraldine Beskin, Sorita d'Este, [[Rae Beth]], [[Gareth Knight]], [[Evan John Jones (witch)|Evan John Jones]], and [[Nigel Pennick]].{{sfn|Greene|2015}}

In 1977 Howard was contacted by E. W. Liddell, who was then publishing controversial articles on the Essex cunning man [[George Pickingill]] in ''The Wiccan''. Liddell ceased writing for ''The Wiccan'' and began producing articles for ''The Cauldron'' instead.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=10}} Howard also published a number of articles on the subject of Luciferianism within ''The Cauldron'', using the pseudonym of 'Frater Ashtan'.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=11}} Many of these were published in a collected form as ''The Pillars of Tubal Cain'', brought out by Capall Bann in 2000.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=11}}

In 1992, Howard was contacted by [[Andrew Chumbley]], who sent him a copy of his work, ''Azoetia: A Grimoire of the Sabbatic Craft'', to review for ''The Cauldron''.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=11}} This resulted in a correspondence that lasted for several years before Howard met with Chumbley and his wife.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=11}} Chumbley invited Howard to join his occult order, the [[Cultus Sabbati]], with Howard doing so in 1999.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=11}} Howard moved to Wales, where he lived for two decades.{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=9}} A Jacobite, he was a member of the [[Royal Stuart Society]].{{sfn|Howard|2010|p=9}} In 2015, he died of complications surrounding renal failure while in Devon, surrounded by friends and family.{{sfn|Greene|2015}} The news was publicay announced by Xoanon and on ''The Cauldron'' website, while it was also announced that the magazine itself would be discontinued.{{sfn|Greene|2015}}

==Luciferianism==
The [[religious studies]] scholar Fredrik Gregorius believed that Howard's work "blurred" the boundary between Luciferianism and [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Gregorius|2013|p=243}} Many of these books had been published by Capall Bann, a small esoteric publishing company primarily associated with Pagan topics.{{sfn|Gregorius|2013|p=244}}

'''Mohamed Seghir Boushaki''' ({{IPA-ar|محمد الصغير بوسحاقي|lang}}&lt;!--, [[Tifinagh]]: Moⵀⴰⵎⴻⴷ ⵚⴻⴳⵀⵉⵔ Boⵓⵙⵀⴰⴽⵉ--&gt;), (born {{date|1869-11-27}} in [[Thénia]], [[Boumerdès Province]], [[Kabylie]], [[Algeria]]; died 1959 in Thenia, Algeria) was an Algerian [[Berbers|Berber]] [[politician]] after the [[French conquest of Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6466914t|title=Journal officiel de la République française.

== Presentation ==
Mohamed Seghir Boushaki was born in 1869 in the village of "Thala Oufella" ({{lang-kab|ⵟⵀⴰⵍⴰ Oⵓⴼⴻⵍⵍⴰ}}) called "Soumâa" (called {{lang-ar|الصومعة}}) because of the ruins of [[:fr:Benian ntâa Soumâa|Benian ntâa Soumâa]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b72002410|title=Carte de l'Algérie divisée par tribus / par MM.

This ancient Berber citadel of Benian ntâa Soumâa was built by King Nubel when the region of [[Thenia]] was the capital of [[Kabylie]] and [[:fr:Mitidja|Mitidja]] in [[North Africa during Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Tarikh.Al-jazair.Al-am/kitab#page/n541/mode/2up |title=كتاب تاريخ الجزائر العام للشيخ عبد الرحمان الجيلالي |website=Archive.org |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands ranging from "Oued Boumerdès" and "Oued Mghaldène" in the west to "[[:fr:Oued Isser|Oued Isser]]" to the east of the village "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)" belonged to the tribe of "Aïth Aïcha" to which Mohamed belonged Seghir Boushaki before the [[French conquest of Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/fr/record/9200365/BibliographicResource_1000054848897.html |title=Carte de l'Algérie divisée par tribus / par MM.

Just two years after the birth of Mohamecd Seghir, all of Kabylie rallied to the "[[Mokrani Revolt]]" on March 16, 1871 to expel the [[Troupes coloniales|French colonial troops]] from the plain and the heights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/RepertoireAlphabtiqueDesTribusEtDouarsDeLalgrie1879/N5860320_PDF_1_-1DM#page/n93/mode/2up|title=Repertoire Alphabétique des tribus et douars de l'Algérie 1879|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat of the [[Rahmaniyya|brotherhood of the Rahmaniya]] in this [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] uprising, the tribal leaders were deported to [[New Caledonia]], among them "Ahmed Ben Belkacem" the chief of the "Aïth Aïcha" who was close to Mohamed Seghir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordj.info/spip.php?article1467|title=Liste des déportés algériens en Nouvelle-Calédonie, 1867-1895 - Bordj info|first=|last=R.B.|website=Bordj.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ahmed Ben Belkacem", born in 1837 and son of Ahmed, was deported under the "Number 18744".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bordj.info/IMG/jpg/Docu2.jpg |format=JPG |title=318 List |website=Bordj.info |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood ==
Mohamed Seghir Boushaki grew up in a large family where his elder brother "Ali Boushaki" (1855 - 1965) was his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.dz/books?id=OyvgS7tbAxQC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Imperial Identities: Stereotyping, Prejudice and Race in Colonial Algeria|first=Patricia M. E.|last=Lorcin|date=16 July 1999|publisher=I.B.Tauris|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their father "Mohamed Boushaki" (1834-1889), known as "Moh Ouaâli" ({{lang-ar|موح واعلي}}}, was one of the survivors of the French expedition against the town of [[Dellys]] from May 7 to May 17, 1844 and which had decimated dozens of villages of Kabylie, including "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.dz/books?id=mUBYtw9hRNMC&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=saint arnaud marechal de france|first=Louis de|last=Charbonnières|date=1 January 1960|publisher=Nouvelles Editions Latines|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Mohamed Seghir's grandfather, "Ali Boushaki" (1823 - 1844) who was married to "Khdaouedj Dekkiche" of [[Souk El-Had]], was one of the Kabyle [[martyr]]s during the fighting against the French Conquest of Kabylie, leaving his son "Moh Ouaâli" orphaned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.dz/books?id=sL3Tvgrs0DEC&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Une grande figure, Saint-Arnaud maréchal de France|first=Louis de|last=Charbonnières|date=1 January 1960|publisher=Nouvelles Editions Latines|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massacre of [[Jacques Leroy de Saint Arnaud]] completed and the village of "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)" devastated, the widowed grandmother "Khdaouedj Dekkiche" could only preserve her child "Moh Ouaâli" taking him with her to her parents in the village of "Igueraïchene" {{lang-ar|إيقرعيشن}} at [[Souk El-Had]] until her puberty and the reconstruction of his native village in "Aïth Aïcha" tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerclealgerianiste.fr/index.php/archives/encyclopedie-algerianiste/histoire/histoire-militaire/generalites-militaires/232-le-marechal-de-saint-arnaud-l-algerie-et-la-france|title=Le maréchal de Saint-Arnaud, l'Algérie et la France - Géneralités militaires|website=Cerclealgerianiste.fr|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his return to "Thala Oufella" in 1852 at the age of 18, "Mohamed Boushaki (Moh Ouaâli)" married his cousin "Aïcha Ishak-Boushaki" who bore "Ali Boushaki" In 1855 and then of "Mohamed Seghir Boushaki" in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedie-afn.org/24_OFFICIERS_DE_L%E2%80%99ARM%C3%89E_BELGE|title=24 OFFICIERS DE L’ARMÉE BELGE - 1830-1962 ENCYCLOPEDIE de L'AFN|website=Encyclopedia-afn.org|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Mohamed Seghir Boushaki began his [[Islamic studies|coranic studies]] in the reconstructed [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]] in the village of "Thala Oufella" near the [[mausoleum]] of his great-grandfather "[[:fr:Sidi Boushaki|Sidi Boushaki]]" (1394-1853) who was one of the [[Berbers|berber]] [[scholar]]s and [[theologian]]s before the arrival of the [[Ottoman Algeria|Ottomans]] in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jeanyvesthorrignac.fr/wa_files/INFO_20614_20MENERVILLE.pdf |format=PDF |title=Menerville |website=Jeanyvesthorrignac.fr |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the plain of [[Mountain pass]] of "Aïth Aïcha" tribe, north of "Thala Oufella" village, was colonized as early as 1871 by [[Alsace|Alsatian]] and [[Lorraine]] farmers who came from [[France]] to found the town of [[Ménerville]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anom.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/geo.php?lieu=Bellefontaine%20(Alg%C3%A9rie) |title=Recherche géographique |website=Anom.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mekerra.fr/images/alsaciens/alsaciens-lorrains-emigration.pdf |format=PDF |title=Alsaciens - Lorrains en Algerie |website=Mekerra.fr |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, from 1874 to 1881, Mohamed Seghir grazed the herds of the village with his brother Ali and his cousins while continuing his [[Islam|Muslim teaching]] in his native village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.departement06.fr/documents/Import/decouvrir-les-am/rr191-indigenes.pdf |format=PDF |title=INDIGENES ET COLONISATION DANS LA PRESSE NICOISE DE LA BELLE EPOQUE |website=Departement06.fr |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of the [[:fr:Bureaux arabes|Arab offices]] in Kabylie and the establishment of the [[:fr:État civil français en Algérie|registers of the civil state]] by the governor [[Louis Tirman]], new [[patronym]]s were attributed to the families of "Aïth Aïcha" tribe, and [[identity papers]] were handed to the villagers, allowing Mohamed Seghir Boushaki to continue his studies at [[Tizi Ouzou]] in the "Zawiya of Sheikh Mohand Ameziane" where he became acquainted with many of the futur notables of the [[Great Kabylie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=RHJ_016_0093|title=Le statut des musulmans en Algérie coloniale|first=Patrick|last=Weil|date=22 February 2017|publisher=|issue=16|pages=93–109|via=Cairn.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seddouk-ouffella.com/documents/article/la-tarika-rahmania|title=Seddouk Ouffella, village de Cheikh Ahaddad|website=Seddouk-ouffella.com|accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deep [[recitation]]s and [[exegesis]] received by Mohamed Seghir in the Tizi Ouzou Zawiyas, as well as the measured attendance of French settlers, allowed him to anchor in the [[Arab-Berber|Berber-Arab culture]] on the one hand, and to open up on the accomplished fact of the European presence in Kabylie of another coast, thus endowing him with the major [[trilingual]] asset for the pursuit of his political and social journey.

== Work ==
[[File:Confédérations et tribus de la Grande Kabylie (Tamawya Taqbaylit) Algérie.jpg|thumb|[[:fr:Tribus de la Kabylie|Kabylie tribes]]]]
After ten years of [[Islamic studies]] in Great Kabylie, Mohamed Seghir Boushaki settled in his village "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)" in 1891 and began to work in [[agriculture]] and [[commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kouider Djouab |url=http://www.djazairess.com/fr/lnr/244086 |title=La ville "lieu du Soldat", une histoire méconnue |website=Djazairess.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He specializes in [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob tree]] [[arboriculture]] by weaving a professional [[carob bean]] harvesting network for sale in the state and for processing into [[locust bean gum]] and [[carob bean]] [[molasses]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170222082624/http://dspace.univ-tlemcen.dz/bitstream/112/304/1/Etude-de-la-valeur-nutritive-de-la-caroube-de-differentes-varietes-Algeriennes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon gained notable profits which allowed him to rent a house in the [[French Colonial|French colony]] of "[[Thénia|Ménerville (Thénia)]]" bordering "Oued Arbia" in which he married in 1898 at the age of 29 with "Fatma Cherifi" issue of a rich family residing in "[[Sidi Daoud]]" along "[[:fr:Sebaou|Oued Sebaou]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.memoria.dz/jui-2012/figures-historiques/17-ans-lutte-l-emir-visit-trois-fois-la-kabylie |title=En 17 ans de lutte, l’Emir a visité trois fois la Kabylie |language=fr |website=Memoria.dz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Seghir assiduously transformed the mesh of collection of [[carob bean]] in Kabylie into a network of inter-village alliances by marriage in the former [[Algiers Department]] regrouping the current wilayas of [[Algiers]], [[Boumerdes]], [[Tizi Ouzou]], [[Bouira]], [[Blida]] and [[Tipaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmoudjahid.com/fr/mobile/detail-article/id/15651 |title=Histoire : Sidi M'hamed Bou Qobrine le saint aux deux tombeaux |website=Elmoudjahid.com |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While remaining a fervent supporter of the [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Tariqa]] of the [[Rahmaniyya]], he frequently frequented the two [[mosque]]s of [[Sidi M'hamed Bou Qobrine]] in [[Bounouh]] ([[Boghni]]) and [[Mohamed Belouizdad|Hamma]] (Algiers), and as soon as he had his first boy in 1907, he named him "M'Hamed Boushaki" in memory of the kabyle [[theologian]] "M'Hamed Ben Abderrahmane El Azhari".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.djazairess.com/fr/horizons/108610 |title=Sidi M'hamed Bou Qobrine |website=Djazairess.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His intense commercial activity allowed him to attend the weekly markets throughout Kabylie where trading transactions and marriage agreements were negotiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-en-questions.fr/guerre%20algerie/deux%20peuples-marche%20kabyle%20.html |title=Le marché en Kabylie pendant la guerre d'algerie |website=Histoire-en-questions.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War I ==
[[File:Plan de Thénia des Béni Aïcha dans le territoire des Khachna à l'est d'Alger.jpg|thumb|[[Thénia]] in Khachna Region]]
Mohamed Seghir Boushaki lost his first wife "Fatma Cherifi" in 1914 shortly before the outbreak of the [[World War I]] when he had reached the age of 45, leaving him several orphaned children to his charge and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sourcesdelagrandeguerre.fr/?p=3240|title=Retrouver un soldat algérien dans les archives françaises|date=28 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then quickly remarried with "Khdaouedj Tafat Bouzid" from the village "Aïth Thafath" in [[Chabet el Ameur]], who took care of the orphans and then bore him several other new toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lerhumel.free.fr/Ebooks/Description%20de%20l'Alg%E9rie%201847.pdf |format=PDF |title=Description et Division De L'Algerie |website=Lerhumel.free.fr |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French colonial empire|colonial French]], surrounded by the German troops and [[Stormtrooper]], appealed to the young Algerians in the ranks of its army in the metropolis with the promise to give them in exchange more rights citizens in Algeria and why not the total independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.dz/books?id=zK-hAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Chroniques tizi-ouziennes et regionales, 1914-1928|first=Jean de|last=Crescenzo|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Lulu.com|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several young kabyles of the Khachna and Great Kabylie were recruited on French front in Europe, among them close relatives of Mohamed Seghir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k63719824 |title=La Tranchée : organe officiel de l'Amicale des mutilés du dépt. d'Alger et de la Fédération départementale des victimes de la guerre &amp;#124; 1937-12 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these kabyle soldiers is the son of his brother "Ali Boushaki", his nephew "Abderrahmane Boushaki" who was a [[corporal]] in the "[[:fr:1er régiment de tirailleurs algériens|1st regiment of Algerian sharpshooters]]" from 1914 to 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6475945b |title=Journal officiel de la République française.

The distinctions and decorations after the return of the nephew "Abderrahmane Boushaki" mutilated from France gave him as well as his family and his tribe a growing notoriety in the French colonial administration in Algeria after 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6586446v |title=L'Algérie mutilée : organe de défense des mutilés, réformés, blessés, anciens combattants, veuves, orphelins, ascendants de la Grande Guerre : bulletin officiel de l'Amicale des mutilés du département d'Alger &amp;#124; 1925-04-01 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Seghir Boushaki began his [[militant]] [[career]] in [[politics]] as part of the [[Assimilation (French colonialism)|French colonial administration]] from 1918 onwards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://insaniyat.revues.org/13001?lang=ar|title=Tizi-Ouzou : historique d’un col et son urbanisation|first=Saïd|last=Doumane|date=31 December 2011|publisher=|issue=54|pages=13–29|via=insaniyat.revues.org|doi=10.4000/insaniyat.13001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perso.netopi.fr/lkeller/palestro/souvenirs/archives/cfa.htm |title=Arrivée du train à Palestro |website=Perso.netopi.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Seghir's [[political strategy]] was not to move to Algiers to reside there because comfortable transport was available by the [[railway line]] connecting Tizi Ouzou to Algiers which had been completed in 1888 after that linking Bouira to Algiers had previously been inaugurated in 1886&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cerclealgerianiste.fr/index.php/archives/encyclopedie-algerianiste/territoire/villes-et-villages-d-algerie/algerois/97-tizi-ouzou |title=Tizi-Ouzou &amp;#124; Algérois |website=Cerclealgerianiste.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piedsnoirs-aujourdhui.com/reali9.html |title=Les Chemins De Fer |website=Piedsnoirs-aujourdhui.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aged 49 at the end of the [[World War I]] with nearly ten children in his charge and responsibility, Mohamed Seghir could not venture to live in the Algiers [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] by taking the risk of forgetting himself and dissolving in the details of the colonial city life far from the expectations of the [[Kabylian]] villagers perched on the heights of their mountains and contemplating the European settlers who robbed them of their arable land and their pastures.

The new privileged status of his nephew "Abderrahmane Boushaki" as a [[veteran]] allowed the "[[Igawawen|Arch of Aïth Aïcha]]" to rebuild the "Zawiya of [[:fr:Sidi Boushaki|Sidi Boushaki]]", destroyed in 1844 at the village of "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)", with a [[prayer]] room, a [[Madrasa|Coranic school]], a [[basement]] with [[Water well|well]], and a house for the [[Hafiz (Quran)|Quran teacher]].
A French [[architect]] had designed the Zawiya of the village in a [[Berbers|Berber]]-[[Moorish]] style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/medit_0025-8296_1964_num_5_2_1118|title=Les hommes et leurs activités dans la plaine des Issers|first=Yves|last=Sarthe|publisher=|volume=5|issue=2|pages=133–145|doi=10.3406/medit.1964.1118}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.dz/books?id=L-AJ174uPtwC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Alsaciens et Lorrains en Algérie: histoire d'une migration, 1830-1914|first=Fabienne|last=Fischer|date=1 January 1999|publisher=SERRE EDITEUR|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the rich baker "Mohamed Naïth Saïdi" from the region of [[Larbaâ Nath Irathen]] to settle in the colonial town of [[Thenia|Ménerville (Thenia)]] was a decisive turning point in the area of "Aïth Aïcha", because he married a cousin of Mohamed Seghir Boushaki, And built an entire district in a [[Moorish]] style in the center of which a first mosque was built in [[Lower Kabylia]] after [[French colonization]].

It followed the successive arrival of many Kabylian families from [[Djurdjura]], such as "Redjouani" and "Djennadi", to settle among the European settlers in [[Thenia|Ménerville (Thenia)]] and thus promote the emergence of a nationalist consciousness halfway between Tizi Ouzou and Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.edu.dz/images/N_65-66-MEYNIER.pdf |format=PDF |title=L’Algérie et les Algériens sous le système colonial.

== Jonnart Law ==
[[File:Charles Jonnart 1918.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Jonnart]]]]
The consecration of the process of reappropriation of public, institutional and [[social space]] in Kabylie by the original inhabitants found a legal breach through the [[Jonnart Law]] proclaimed on [[4 February]] 1919 by [[Charles Jonnart]] and allowing the Algerians to elect and be elected to the [[People's Municipal Assembly|municipal assemblies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algeria.com/forums/history-histoire/22056-les-premi%E8res-%E9lections-alg%E9riennes-1919-1925-a.html |title=Les premières élections algériennes (1919-1925) |website=Algeria.com |date=2007-11-30 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75791317 |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1919-12-02 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=1919-12-02 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the first post-war [[municipal elections]] took place in Algeria on November 30, 1919, in which Mohamed Seghir Boushaki and [[:fr:Khaled el-Hassani ben el-Hachemi|Emir Khaled]] participated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7579128r |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1919-11-29 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=1919-11-29 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.dz/books?id=zK-hAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Chroniques tizi-ouziennes et regionales, 1914-1928|first=Jean de|last=Crescenzo|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Lulu.com|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle of Mohamed Seghir after 1919 revolves around the struggle in [[:fr:Statut juridique des indigènes d'Algérie|colonial legality]], while remaining hostile to naturalization but also fighting for equality between native Algerians and French colonizers in a very difficult context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/remmm_0035-1474_1966_num_2_1_929|title=Enquête sur les origines du nationalisme algérien.

The election of [[Mayor]] of [[Thenia|Ménerville (Thenia)]] and his deputies took place on Sunday, December 7, 1919, in the elections of the Municipality where "César Boniface" as [[mayor]], and his deputies "Auguste Schneider", "Georges Egrot" And "Samuel Juvin", were elected all with 23 votes out of a total of 24 voters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75791406 |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1919-12-11 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=1919-12-11 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7579130t |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1919-12-01 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=1919-12-01 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Seghir was elected as [[City council (France)|city councilor]] representing the [[:fr:Douar|Douar]] of "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)" in the Municipality of Ménerville within the "César Boniface" team for 5 years from 1920 to 1925.

Several other [[:fr:Conseillers municipaux en Algérie|Algerian councilors]] sat at the Ménerville Town Hall next to Mohamed Seghir and represented their respective Douars surrounding the colonial city.

== Entryism ==
[[File:الأمير خالد.jpg|thumb|[[:fr:Emir Khaled|Emir Khaled]]]]
As early as 1920, Mohamed Seghir Boushaki with [[:fr:Emir Khaled|Emir Khaled]] integrated the political strategy of [[wikt:entrenchment|entrenchment]] into the administrative apparatus and the colonial cultural sphere, equipped with the elective immunity that enabled them to travel the [[Department of Algiers]] without hindrance to meet the nationalist elites of all edges.

This electoral [[entablature]] enabled Mohamed Seghir to benefit from several privileges of the position of municipal councilor such as obtaining a concession to operate a farmland of 70 hectares located south-east of the city of Merverville on the flank of the village "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)" and a short distance from [[:fr:Oued Isser|Oued Isser]].

The "Emir Khaled" took advantage of this [[entryism]] and [[Entryism|infiltration]] to visit also the villages and villages of the Department of Algiers, as his grandfather the [[Emir Abdelkader]] also used to preach more rights to Algerians than those granted by the [[Jonnart Law]].

An abundant political activity of Mohamed Seghir with the Emir Khaled continued until the exile of this last in 1923 by the colonial administration towards [[Egypt]] to try to temper the emancipatory impetus Algerian and Kabyle.

In 1924, Mohamed Seghir obtained a permit to open a "Moorish Café" in downtown Ménerville overlooking the bustling Avenue de la Republique, where his son M'Hamed Boushaki (1907-1995) went To work with his brothers until the outbreak of the [[Algerian War|Algerian independence revolution]] in November 1, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k57765481 |title=La Tafna. Journal de l'arrondissement de Tlemcen &amp;#124; 1907-09-11 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little by little Mohamed Seghir became part of the colonial political game and began to position his cousins and relatives in administrative and service jobs in the "Canton of Alma (Boudouaou)" and in Algiers in order to reinforce the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] presence in the capital of their despoiled ancestral land.

== Sufism ==
[[File:Bounouh CheikhBenAbderrahmane 22Mar.png|thumb|[[:ar:زاوية بونوح|Bounouh Zaouiya]]]]
Mohamed Seghir Boushaki did not however break his spiritual and family ties with the followers of the Zawiyas Rahmaniyya of Tizi Ouzou who often visited him at his home in Ménerville, made a passage to his "Moorish Café" during their movements and sat as him in the 27th electoral circle of [[Tizi Ouzou]] like him in the 29th constituency of [[Boudouaou|Alma (Boudouaou)]].

During the religious festivals, human foot convoys of Kabyle Sufis linked the villages of the "Aïth Aïcha" with those of the "Aïth Guechtoula" of Boghni with psalmodies, recitations and intonations all along the route of about 40&amp;nbsp;km.

The [[pilgrim]]s and Kabyle disciples started from the Zawiyas of [[:fr:Sidi Boushaki|Sidi Boushaki]] to reach the [[:ar:زاوية بونوح|Bounouh Zaouiya]] in order to celebrate the [[Mawlid]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nawel Ben |url=http://www.djazairess.com/fr/lemidi/1009150501 |title=Bounouh ou le bercail de Sidi Abderrahmane |website=Djazairess.com |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Seghir then built a volunteer house of passengers at "Thala Oufella (Soumâa)" to welcome these [[Sufi]] disciples during their religious wanderings.

He had previously sent his son "M'Hamed Boushaki" as well as his other brothers to study in the "[[Boumerdès|Boumerdassi]] Zawiya" south of [[Tidjelabine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnopolis-net.over-blog.com/2015/01/confreries-soufies-en-kabylie.html |title=Confréries soufies en kabylie - Ethnopolis |website=Ethnopolis-net.over-blog.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, his elder brother "Ali Boushaki" (1855-1965) had taken a [[theologian]] route to become one of the [[mufti]]s of [[:fr:Basse Kabylie|Lower Kabylie]] according to the [[Maliki]] rite and was named Mokaddem of the tarika Rahmaniyya in the region between The [[:fr:Mitidja|Mitidja]] and the [[Djurdjura]], as well as his position as [[Imam]] of the preaching at the Mosque of Ménerville.

== Lobbying ==
[[File:L'hémicycle du Sénat français en septembre 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Senate (France)|French Senate]]]]
Councilor Mohamed Seghir Boushaki excelled from 1920 to 1925 in political, social and religious lobbying during his first political mandate following the promulgation of the Jonnart Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75826757 |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1927-08-12 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Mohamed Seghir mobilized the ardor of many Algerian councilors for the making and signing of "Petition No. 30" dated July 18, 1920, where he protested with several of his colleagues to the [[Senate]] against the provisions of a bill tabled in the Chamber by the [[French Government]] on the regulation of the [[Indigénat]] system in Algeria and the accession of Algerians of origin to [[political rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7581527h |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1925-05-06 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "Petition No. 30" by Mohamed Seghir and his associates was examined by the [[:fr:Liste des sénateurs des Landes|Senator of the Landes]] of the time who was [[:fr:Charles Cadilhon|Charles Cadilhon]] as [[:fr:Rapporteur parlementaire|rapporteur]] of the senatorial session under the [[French Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7581529b |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1925-05-08 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohamed Seghir had thoroughly studied the decision-making mechanisms of the resolutions of the Petitions Committees under Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure of the [[Senate (France)|French Senate]] which stipulated that any senator could ask for the report in public sitting of a petition whatever the classification which the commission has assigned to him at his request, addressed in writing to the President of the Senate, so that this report is presented in the sitting the Senate. After the expiry of the period prescribed for the processing of a [[petition]], the resolutions of the Committee shall become final in respect of petitions which are not to be the subject of a public report and shall be referred to in the [[Journal officiel de la République française]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75841984 |title=L'Echo d'Alger : journal républicain du matin &amp;#124; 1935-05-25 |language=fr |website=Gallica.bnf.fr |date=1935-05-25 |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus "Petition No. 30" came into existence and was thoroughly discussed before being published in the Official Journal of May 20, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/sm/C_14629_15246.pdf |format=PDF |title=Les archives de la Chambre des députés sous la Troisième République (1919-1942) |website=Senat.fr |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the "[[:fr:Sénat (Troisième République)|Senate of the Third Republic]]" which had debated this petition under the presidency of [[Léon Bourgeois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/comptes-rendus-seances/3eme/pdf/1920/07/S19200730_1603_1646.pdf |format=PDF |title=Journal Officiel |date=1920-07-31 |website=Senat.fr |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his university education at the [[University of Toronto]], and earned his law degree from [[Osgoode Hall Law School]]. Later, Martin studied at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]], Geneva, on a scholarship.

Martin later opened a law practice in [[Windsor, Ontario]].

==Politics==

===MP===
A member of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in 1935 and entered the [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]] in 1945.  He went on to serve as a noted member of the cabinets of four Prime Ministers: [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], [[Louis St. Laurent]], [[Lester B. Pearson]] and [[Pierre Trudeau]].

Martin was viewed as one of the most left-wing members of the Liberal cabinet, and as [[Minister of National Health and Welfare (Canada)|Minister of National Health and Welfare]] from 1946 to 1957 he played an important role in the fight against [[polio]] and overseeing the creation of hospital insurance in Canada, and is sometimes recognized as a [[father of medicare]]. Martin served as [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]] in the Pearson government, and was instrumental in the acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapons for Canadian Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater, J. "Canadian Nuclear Weapons.", Chapter 1.  Dundurn Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Martin with Mackenzie King.jpg|thumb|left|Hon. Paul Martin (left) and Rt. Hon. W.L. [[Mackenzie King]] attending the opening session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], 23 October 1946]]

===Liberal leadership bids===
He ran for the Liberal leadership three times, in [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1948|1948]], in [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1958|1958]] and [[Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, 1968|1968]], but was defeated at all three [[Liberal leadership conventions]], first by Louis St. Laurent, then by Lester B. Pearson, then by Pierre Trudeau.

===Senator and beyond===
Trudeau appointed him to the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] in 1968.  He served as [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Canada)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]] until 1974 when he was appointed [[High Commissioner]] to the [[United Kingdom]]. He also served as Chancellor of [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] from 1972–1977, as a result of which the university named the Paul Martin Centre in his honour. Until his death Paul Martin was an Adjunct Professor of Political Science at the [[University of Windsor]].

His two volume memoirs, ''A Very Public Life'', was published in 1983 ({{ISBN|0888790929}}) and 1986 ({{oclc|165756245}} {{Google books|d37DmgEACAAJ|A very public life: So many worlds Volume 2 of A very public life}}).

==Honours==
In 1976 he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]]. In recognition of his accomplishments, Martin was granted the right to use the [[honorific]] [[Right Honourable]] in 1992, a rare honour for one who has never been Prime Minister, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor-General]] or [[Chief Justice of Canada]].

The [[University of Windsor]] has a Paul Martin Chair in law and political science, recently held by former Manitoba Premier [[Howard Pawley]] (until his retirement from the University of Windsor), and the Paul Martin Law Library. The City of Windsor had also renamed their "Post Office Building" the [[Paul Martin Sr. Building]] in his honour on November 18, 1994.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">'''Pirouz Davani''' (1961–1998~) ({{lang-fa|پیروز دوانی}}) is, or was, an [[Iran]]ian [[leftist]] activist and [[Editor-in-chief|editor]] of the ''Pirouz'' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ''"Victorious"'') newspaper. He disappeared on 28 August 1998 while leaving his residence in [[Tehran]]. Some have suggested that Davani was murdered.&lt;ref name=payvand&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/03/aug/1151.html ''Iranian journalist Pirouz Davani, missing for 5 years, is glaring case of impunity''] by [[Reporters Without Borders]] (Payvand, 29 August 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Pirooz Davani joined the [[Iranian Revolution]] against the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] as a youth. After the revolution succeeded he was arrested in 1981 "for his alleged links to the [[communist]] opposition" and was imprisoned.&lt;ref name=payvand/&gt;

Following the 1988 mass execution of political prisoners, he is reported to have launched a campaign against the government. "In winter of 1991, Pirooz was again arrested for his activities and after spending six months in solitary confinement, was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released from prison in 1995".

Following the election of president [[Mohammad Khatami]] he "established a cultural institute to publish and promote new interpretation of left's struggle for [[democracy]] in Iran", which "lead to creation of the Organisation of Unity for Democracy in Iran."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/2003/556/29471 Write On: Letters to Green Left Weekly - Pirooz Davani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622133245/http://www.greenleft.org.au/2003/556/29471 |date=2009-06-22 }} letter by Ardeshir Gholipoor&lt;/ref&gt;

He later established the ''Pirouz'' [[newspaper]] which was openly critical of the Government.

==Disappearance==
In September 1998, Davani's brother Majid announced that Davani had been "abducted" by "[[Plainclothes law enforcement|plain-clothes officers]]" from Iran's [[Ministry of Intelligence of Iran|Ministry of Intelligence]].&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;[http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles/arrests_continue.html ''Meanwhile, arbitrary arrests continue unabated''] ([[Iran Press Service]], 3 September 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Davani is thought he may have been a victims of Iran's [[Chain murders of Iran|"chain murders"]] of Iranian dissidents, though his body has never been recovered and no records of imprisonment have ever been published.&lt;ref name=RSF/&gt; His disappearance occurred several months before the murders of four other Iranian [[dissident]]s in November 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-press-service.com/ips/articles-2004/july/hunger_strike_22704.shtml ''A dozen of prominent Iranian political prisoners observes hunger strike''] by Safa Haeri ([[Iran Press Service]], 21 July 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1998, [[Amnesty International]] issued a public statement that they had received reports that Davani's mother had been contacted anonymously and told her son had been killed. According to unconfirmed reports at the time, she suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] upon hearing the news.&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/es/documents/mde13/023/1998/es/ ''Amnesty International calls for independent investigation into killings''] ([[Amnesty International]], 3 December 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, [[Reporters Without Borders]] reported:&lt;ref name=RSF&gt;[http://www.ifex.org/iran/2004/11/25/impunity_continues_to_triumph_in/ ''Impunity continues to triumph in Iranian justice system, says RSF''] - Press Release, [[Reporters Without Borders]] (Reprint: [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange|IFEX]], 25 November 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''The intelligence ministry officially recognized in January 1999 that some of its agents were involved and announced dozens of arrests. Fifteen intelligence ministry agents were convicted in January 2001 for the murder of the Forouhars. Three were sentenced to death. The other 12 received prison sentences. Three other suspects were acquitted. The Supreme Court upheld the verdict but only two persons were sentenced to 15 years in prison. The authorities never tried to establish the circumstances of Davani's disappearance...''

'''Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont''' (sometimes spelled '''Bellamont''', 1636 – 5&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;1700/01&lt;ref name=dates&gt;In the [[Julian calendar]], then in use in England, the year began on 25 March.  To avoid confusion with dates in the [[Gregorian calendar]], then in use in other parts of Europe, dates between January and March were often written with both years. Dates in this article are in the Julian calendar unless otherwise noted.&lt;/ref&gt;), known as '''The Lord Coote''' between 1683&amp;ndash;89, was a member of the English Parliament and a colonial governor.  Born in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], he was an early supporter of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], siding with them in the [[Glorious Revolution]].

In 1695 he was given commissions as governor of the provinces of [[Province of New York|New York]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay]], and [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], which he held until his death.  He did not arrive in the [[New World]] until 1698, and spent most of his tenure as governor in New York. He spent a little over a year in Massachusetts, and only two weeks in New Hampshire. His time in New York was marked by divisive politics resulting from [[Leisler's Rebellion]] (1689–91), and difficult and ultimately unsuccessful negotiations to keep the [[Iroquois]] from engaging in peace talks with [[New France]].  Frontier issues were also in the forefront during his time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, where lumber and security from the [[Abenaki]] threat dominated his tenure.

He was a major financial sponsor of [[William Kidd]], whose [[privateering]] was later deemed to have descended into [[piracy]].  Bellomont engineered the arrest of Kidd in Boston, and had him returned to England, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged.

==Early life and career==
Richard Coote was born in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1636. He was the second son, but the first to survive infancy, of Richard Coote, third son of [[Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet]], and Mary, daughter of Sir George St George. His father was created [[Earl of Bellomont|Baron Coote of Coloony]] in 1660 (on the same day as his uncle was created [[Earl of Mountrath]]), and he succeeded his father as Baron Coote on the latter's death on 10 July 1683.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is recorded of his early years.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1677 he is known to have killed a man in a duel for the affections of a young lady.  He did not marry her, however, and in 1680 he married Catherine, the daughter of Bridges Nanfan and the eventual heir to [[Birtsmorton Court]] in [[Worcestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Perry, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two sons.&lt;ref name=Burke135&gt;Burke, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the accession of the pro-Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] to the English throne, Coote, a Protestant, moved to the Continent and served as a captain of horse in the Dutch army.&lt;ref name=DP9/&gt;&lt;ref name=H125&gt;Henning, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the family's record of service to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], his absence from court eventually drew the king's attention, and he was summoned back to court in 1687.&lt;ref name=DP9&gt;De Peyster, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first to join [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 that brought [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] to the throne.  He was rewarded for this loyalty with an appointment as [[Treasurer to the Queen]] in 1689, a post he held until 1694.&lt;ref name=H125/&gt;&lt;ref name=DB10/&gt; It also drew unfavourable attention in the Irish Parliament. That body, still under the influence of James, [[Bill of attainder|attainted]] him and seized his lands. As a result of this, William on 2 November 1689 created him Earl of Bellomont,&lt;ref name=DB10&gt;De Peyster, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and granted him over {{convert|77000|acre|ha}} of forfeited Irish lands.  The land grant was highly controversial in Parliament, and was eventually rescinded by William.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford and Perry, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also rewarded with the governorship of [[County Leitrim]].&lt;ref&gt;Wills, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellomont was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Droitwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Droitwich]] from 1688 to 1695.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Coote, Richard|last=Stephens|first=Henry Morse|authorlink=Henry Morse Stephens}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1690s he became involved in the attempts by [[Jacob Leisler]]'s son to clear his father's name.  Leisler had been a leading force in [[Leisler's Rebellion|the New York rebellion]] against the [[Dominion of New England]] established by King James. Upon the arrival of [[Henry Sloughter]] as governor of New York, Leisler was arrested, tried, and executed for treason, and his properties were seized. Leisler's son Jacob Jr. traveled to England to argue the case for restoration of the family properties. Bellomont sat on the Parliamentary committee that examined the evidence, and spoke in Parliament in support of the Leisler's case. He strongly stated his view that Leisler and son-in-law Jacob Milborne had been "barbarously murdered" by Sloughter's actions in a letter to Massachusetts colonial agent [[Increase Mather]]. Young Leisler's efforts were successful: Parliament voted to reverse the attainder, and ordered that the family properties be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial governor==
The death in 1695 of Sir [[William Phips]] vacated the governorship of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]].  Colonial agents lobbied to select either [[Wait Winthrop]] or [[Joseph Dudley]], both native sons, to replace Phips, but the king, wanting someone who would better represent crown authority, selected Bellomont. Since William wanted someone who could exert authority over more of New England, he was also given the governorships of [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Province of New York|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, pp. 308–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DP24/&gt; The major concern that Bellomont was instructed to address was ongoing problems with [[piracy]], including the open commerce with pirates that went on in [[New York City]] and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Howard Pyle]]'s depiction of [[William Kidd]] aboard his ship in New York Harbor]]
Bellomont's commissions were not finalized until 1 June 1697.&lt;ref name=DP24&gt;De Peyster, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; While they were being worked on, New York colonial agent [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] proposed to Bellomont that a [[privateer]] be outfitted to combat piracy, and recommended [[William Kidd]] be its captain.&lt;ref name=L154/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  This scheme received the assent of King William, who issued a [[letter of marque]] to Kidd for the purpose, as well as a special commission for dealing with pirates.  Bellomont raised £6,000 (including £1,000 of his own money, and funds from some of the Lords of the Admiralty) to outfit Kidd's ship.&lt;ref name=L154&gt;Leonard, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, accompanied by his wife and her cousin, [[John Nanfan]], who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into [[Barbados]] before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;

His attempts to enforce the [[Navigation Acts]] predictably turned merchants and traders against him.  These attempts were also poorly executed by colonial officials whose interests lay more with those merchants than they did with the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; He raised the anger of Leisler's opponents by implementing the parliamentary act he had helped pass, and saw through the restoration of Leisler's properties.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; There was so much opposition within his council to this that he ended up purging the council of those opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Bellomont also approved the exhumation of the remains of Leisler and his son-in-law Jacob Milborne, which had been unceremoniously buried under the gallows from which they had been hanged. He sanctioned a proper burial, and provide an honour guard of 100 soldiers for the service.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellomont's support of the Leislerians proved to be costly, not just in terms of New York politics, but in Indian diplomacy as well.  [[Benjamin Fletcher]], Bellomont's predecessor in office, had taken advantage of the long period between Bellomont's appointment and arrival to make some questionable land grants, including extended leases to properties normally allocated for the governor's use,&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; and in territories that were still claimed by the [[Iroquois]]. When the provincial assembly passed a law retracting all of these irregular grants, it predictably angered a number of large landowners.&lt;ref name=L157/&gt; Land grants made in Iroquois territory to [[Godfridius Dellius]], the influential pastor of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] in [[Albany, New York|Albany]],&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and others were a specific subject of Iroquois complaints.  Even though Bellomont's law was passed, the grantees appealed to the Board of Trade, and the bill never received royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hector-Calliere.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hector de Callière]] was governor of [[New France]] while Bellomont governed New York.]]
Bellomont denied Dellius and other anti-Leislerians positions of importance in dealing with the Iroquois, resulting in the loss of experienced negotiators.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;  This affected internal Iroquois politics, since supporters of interaction with the English lost influence when their English counterparts were sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; This came at a particularly delicate time, when Bellomont was working to strengthen the [[Covenant Chain]] that had been neglected by Fletcher.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 191"&gt;Richter, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] ended war between the French and English in 1697, the French continued to make war on the Iroquois (primarily through their Algonquian allies in the [[Great Lakes]] region), and inflicted significant casualties on them. The Iroquois sought the assistance of the English to combat this, threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help.&lt;ref&gt;Richter and Merrell, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Bellomont and French Governor General [[Louis-Hector de Callière]] both claimed dominance over the Iroquois, and each refused to acknowledge the other's right to intercede on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; When Callière summoned the Iroquois to Montreal for negotiations in 1699, Bellomont was alerted, and successfully manoeuvred the Iroquois into not going by sending an emissary to Montreal and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from their course of action, and French-allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700.&lt;ref name=R188/&gt;

In negotiations with the Iroquois, Bellomont overlooked some of the social elements that Iroquois customs demanded, with the result that the parties ended with differing views of how successful their councils were. Bellomont believed they went well, even though it was fairly clear that the Iroquois negotiators were unhappy with how the discussion had gone.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 191"/&gt; He promised them the construction of a fort at [[Onondaga Reservation|Onondaga]], and even convinced the legislature to appropriate £1,000 for its construction, but the Iroquois were evasive on accepting this "gift", and never showed English engineers suitable locations for a fort.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, pp. 208–09&lt;/ref&gt; Bellomont's attempts to prevent the Iroquois from dealing with the French were negated by the French military successes of 1700, which brought the Iroquois to a peace council that resulted in the 1701 [[Great Peace of Montreal]].&lt;ref name=R188&gt;Richter, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts and New Hampshire===
[[File:Elisha Cooke SR.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bellomont's Massachusetts advisor, [[Elisha Cooke, Sr.]]]]
In May 1699 Bellomont sailed for [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=L157&gt;Leonard, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Bellomont spent 14 months in New England in 1699 and 1700, spending a few weeks of that time in New Hampshire and the rest in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Palfrey, pp. 175, 216&lt;/ref&gt; In Massachusetts he was treated politely, but his attempts to implement the crown's policies ran into trouble, as they had in New York. He was refused a salary by the colonial legislature, although the "gift" of £1,000 he received was more than that typically given other governors of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Palfrey, pp. 176–77&lt;/ref&gt; The legislature also made repeated attempts to limit appeals to London of judicial decisions handed down by provincial courts. Bellomont, as he was required to do, forwarded laws passed by the legislature to the Board of Trade for approval; these laws were repeatedly struck down because of provisions that attempted to limit royal prerogatives.&lt;ref&gt;Palfrey, pp. 172–75&lt;/ref&gt;  He also sided politically against Lieutenant Governor [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], who was an ally of Joseph Dudley, a Massachusetts native who had presided over the trial of Jacob Leisler. Instead he took council with the populist leader [[Elisha Cooke, Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Palfrey, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after his arrival in Boston, Bellomont engineered the arrest of William Kidd.  Rumors had reached the colonies that Kidd had descended into piracy, and he came to be viewed by Bellomont and the other high-profile investors in Kidd's ship as a liability.  In November 1698 the Admiralty issued orders to all colonial governors to apprehend Kidd.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; When he was informed by an agent of Kidd's in June 1699 that Kidd was in the area, Bellomont sent a message back to Kidd, promising clemency.&lt;ref name=Z231&gt;Zacks, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd responded that he would come, sending some of his treasures as a present to Lady Bellomont; she refused them.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kidd's arrival in Boston on 3 July, Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written account of his travels, which Kidd, after haggling over the time, agreed to deliver on the morning of 6 July. When he did not do so, Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest. It was executed as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, pp. 248–50&lt;/ref&gt; Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom, using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips.&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, pp. 253-54&lt;/ref&gt; Although a portion of Kidd's treasure was recovered, it did not buy Kidd's freedom, and he was shipped to London in April 1700, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, pp. 47–52&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the relative secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd,&lt;ref name=Z231/&gt; Bellomont was scrupulous in his dealings with other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business, despite being offered as much as £5,000 to overlook illicit activities.&lt;ref&gt;De Peyster, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Matters of frontier security and the lumber trade dominated his brief administration in New England.&lt;ref&gt;Palfrey, pp. 187, 217–18&lt;/ref&gt;  New England was recognized as an important source of ship masts for the [[Royal Navy]], and the Board of Trade and the Admiralty sought to reserve suitable trees for the crown's benefit. In both provinces he encountered opposition to entrenched land and timber interests that resented the intrusion of surveyors onto their lands, and interfered with their taking of lumber from lands that had not been granted and were thus reserved to the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Malone, pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Hampshire the timber dispute was overlaid by ongoing disputes between local landowners and [[Samuel Allen (New Hampshire)|Samuel Allen]], a London merchant who had acquired the territorial claims of the heirs of [[John Mason (governor)|John Mason]], the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners.&lt;ref name=D332/&gt; Allen, who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692,&lt;ref&gt;''American Quarterly Register'', p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.&lt;ref name=D332&gt;Doyle, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palfrey, pp. 215–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abenaki relations===
[[File:Abenakis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|18th century depiction of an [[Abenaki]] couple]]
The frontier situation that Bellomont encountered during his time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire was somewhat tense, because the [[Abenaki]] of northern New England (like the Iroquois in New York) had not been involved in the Treaty of Ryswick that ended King William's War. In the aftermath of the war they and the settlers of Maine and New Hampshire were extremely mistrustful of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt; The Abenaki felt threatened by English encroachment on their lands, and the settlers feared a return to significant French-inspired raiding of their settlements. Bellomont issued proclamations to distribute among the Abenaki denying plans to take their lands, but was unable to ease the underlying tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;  One reason for this was his naive assumption that Abenaki concerns were rooted in a French Catholic conspiracy. When English negotiators attempted to separate the Abenaki from their Jesuit missionaries, this upset ongoing trade negotiations, and did nothing to assuage Puritan New England concerns over the activities of "Popish Emissaries" intriguing to make war on them.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp. 148–51&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial legislature passed a law banning Roman Catholics from territory claimed by the province, which included Abenaki territory claimed by Governor Sir [[William Phips]] in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Bellomont engaged in fruitless attempts to convince the eastern Abenaki to migrate west, where they would come under Iroquois influence; this was unsuccessful, in part because the Abenaki and Iroquois had a history of conflict.&lt;ref name=Mor142&gt;Morrison, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these difficulties, he managed to achieve a precarious peace with the Abenaki in January 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Abenaki relations were also complicated by misunderstandings about sovereignty. The Abenaki viewed themselves as sovereign, while the English believed them to be subjects, either to themselves or to the French.  A prisoner exchange involving English held by the Abenaki and Indians held by the English was frustrated when Bellomont believed that it would be sufficient to negotiate with his counterpart in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] to obtain the release of the English prisoners.&lt;ref name=Mor142/&gt;

==Return to New York and death==
He returned to New York in 1700, where he resumed actions against piracy and illegal shipping.&lt;ref name=DP57/&gt; Following a conference with the Iroquois at Albany in early 1700/1 (which Bellomont characterized as "greatest fatigue [I] ever underwent"), he returned to New York City,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; where he succumbed to a severe case of [[gout]] on 5 March 1700/01. He was buried in the chapel of Fort William. When the fort was dismantled, his remains were moved to the yard of [[St. Paul's Chapel]].&lt;ref name=DP57&gt;De Peyster, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:St. Paul's Chapel, Manhattan (WTM by official-ly cool 037).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[St. Paul's Chapel]] yard, location of Bellomont's grave]]
Lieutenant Governor Nanfan acted as New York's governor until the arrival of [[Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon|Lord Cornbury]] in 1702.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Nanfan, during his brief tenure, reached the peace agreement that eluded Bellomont. In an agreement negotiated later in 1701, the Iroquois [[Nanfan Treaty|signed an agreement]] putting their westernmost territorial claims (spanning from present-day [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] to [[Chicago]] and northern [[Michigan]]) under the English crown's protection.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family, titles, and legacy==
Bellomont's eldest son, [[Nanfan Coote, 2nd Earl of Bellomont|Nanfan, Lord Coloony]], succeeded to the earldom on his death.  His second son [[Richard Coote, 3rd Earl of Bellomont|Richard]], succeeded in turn as 3rd earl on his elder brother's death. On the 3rd earl's death without surviving male heirs, the earldom became extinct, while the barony devolved on his cousin, [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont|Sir Charles Coote]], who was later also created [[Earl of Bellomont]].  He died without male issue, and all of the titles were then extinguished.&lt;ref name=Burke135/&gt;

Bellomont's rule in New York was not remembered fondly. One political opponent, noting that the provincial debt rose substantially during his tenure, wrote that the memory of Bellomont "will stink in the nostrills of all good men",&lt;ref name=B90&gt;Bonomi, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Livingston reported that the debt was "a greater Debt than I had ever seen".&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Bellomont's personal affairs were also difficult to tie up: his creditors tried (unsuccessfully) to prevent his wife's departure from the province in order to compel settlement of his personal debts. Bellomont's financial issues were not unique in this respect. Later governors (including Nanfan and Cornbury) were arrested on charges of malfeasance and personal indebtedness at the behest of their political opponents. New York's debt problems were not resolved until the [[Robert Hunter (governor)|Hunter]] administration in 1717.&lt;ref name=B90/&gt;

I think it sparks something in Robbie and he realises that he has feelings for her, which is not good when Holly is going out with his brother! That will be an ongoing thing. I didn't know it was going to happen until I read the scripts. At first I thought it was going to be a one-off thing and they'd be trying to hide it from Jason, but it's not - Robbie starts to develop feelings for her."&lt;ref name=Robolly/&gt; In an interview Wernham admitted that he would be surprised if his on-screen brother would let Robbie's affair with Holly go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a779023/hollyoaks-star-charlie-wernham-robbie-feels-terrible-about-betraying-jason/|title=Roscoe rivalry!

==Storylines==
Robbie arrives for his first day at college where the headteacher [[Patrick Blake (Hollyoaks)|Patrick Blake]] ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]) warns him not to cause trouble. He is mentored by [[Callum Kane]] ([[Laurie Duncan]]) but decides to truant college. Robbie begins to terrorise [[Doug Carter]] ([[PJ Brennan]]) and vandalise his delicatessen business. Doug reports Robbie to Patrick, much to his annoyance. Robbie and Callum notice Doug kissing [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) as they deface Patrick's car. Robbie puts pictures of the incident around college and John Paul loses his job. Robbie asks Callum to help him sell drugs and he agrees. Robbie helps [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) deliver drug orders to buyers. Robbie steals a van with Callum and [[Sinead O'Connor (Hollyoaks)|Sinead O'Connor]] ([[Stephanie Davis (actress)|Stephanie Davis]]) and runs over Sinead's brother [[Finn O'Connor (Hollyoaks)|Finn O'Connor]] (Keith Rice). Rather than help him, they drive off and Robbie threatens Sinead to convince Finn to lie to the police. Robbie plans an armed robbery at Price Slice and enlists the help of Finn and Callum, but Callum changes his mind and attempts to prevent the robbery but he is shot in the struggle. When Robbie's mother [[Sandy Roscoe|Sandy]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) learns of the robbery she sends him to stay with his aunt.

Robbie and Finn begin terrorising John Paul. They begin by teasing him about his sexuality and the situation ends when Finn rapes John Paul after hitting him over the head with a statue. Weeks later, when Finn is in hospital after a quad bike accident, Robbie continues teasing John Paul, locking him in a store cupboard and then teasing him over his sexuality again. This concludes when John Paul hits Robbie. When visiting Finn in hospital, Robbie finds out that he raped John Paul and is horrified, threatening to call the police. Since his discovery, Robbie begins to change and starts to stick up for John Paul, changing his statement when John Paul is up in court for hitting him. However, Finn changes it back and John Paul goes down. Robbie ditches his bad boy attitude and begins working towards his A-levels with the help of cover teacher [[Nancy Hayton|Nancy Osborne]] ([[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]]). He begins dating [[Phoebe McQueen]] ([[Mandip Gill]]). However, he begins to develop feelings for Nancy as she starts to help him with his A-level work more and kisses her. Phoebe finds texts on his phone apologising to Nancy and later sees them getting close. She decides to tell Nancy's boyfriend and ex-husband [[Darren Osborne|Darren]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]), who is Robbie's half-brother. However, they later reconcile.

Bad news for Robbie as he discover that his father [[Rick Spencer (Hollyoaks)|Rick Spencer]] (Victor Gardener) arrived on town to see him and Jason, but more tragedy strikes as Jason was suffered body dysmorphic disorder, and their father is knocked unconscious by Joe and later dies in hospital after being given an overdose of morphine by an unknown killer. Robbie and Jason are led to believe Joe's punch killed Rick and Jason forgives Joe, though Robbie resents him and begins to act recklessly by stealing cars and assaulting Dirk Savage after he belittled him in the street because Robbie was anonymously blackmailing [[Dirk Savage]] ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]). Robbie eventually owns up to his mistake and turns himself in to the police.

A day before being released John-Paul visits him to tell him that Phoebe has been shot. The next day, Robbie is released and goes straight to hospital and barricades himself in Phoebe's hospital room, terrified she will die during her brain surgery. Joe and Freddie talk him out and Phoebe has a successful operation. Phoebe then tells him it was Grace who shot her, and Robbie tries to get revenge on Grace. Before he can do any harm, Joe tells him that it was him who shot Phoebe. Robbie then disowns Joe and proposes to Phoebe, which she agrees. When Robbie went to buy an engagement ring, Phoebe is murdered by the Gloved Hand Killer. Believing Joe to be the reason she died, Robbie attacks him with a crowbar, causing him to lose the use of his legs. Joe then lies to the police for Robbie. Nancy comforts Robbie after Phoebe's death eventually leading to them having sex after Phoebe's funeral.

Robbie then returns to work for Trevor and when he finds out that he's planning to kill [[Kim Butterfield]] ([[Daisy Wood-Davis]]). He asks Trevor to let him send her out of the country instead. Trevor however puts drugs in Kim's bags and when Jason pull them over Robbie runs off with the bag to let Kim escape. Robbie and Jason argue, with Robbie revealing he told Jason's fiancée [[Holly Cunningham]] (Amanda Clapham) that her mother, [[Cindy Cunningham|Cindy]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]), kissed him. The fight turns physical ending with Robbie pushing Jason off a cliff. Robbie flees the scene and later has sex with Holly. [[Ben Bradley (Hollyoaks)|Ben Bradley]] ([[Ben Richards (actor)|Ben Richards]]) arrests Robbie but gives him a choice: inform him on Trevor or he'll make sure that Robbie will go back to prison and that Jason will know that he slept with Holly. Robbie agrees to work for him and informs him that Trevor and [[Ashley Davidson]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]) are planning to kidnap Patrick. Trevor and Ashley realise that somebody told the police and kidnap Holly, suspecting it was her. Robbie then texts Jason and he manages to convince Trevor and Ashley to let Holly go. Robbie then tells Ben he cannot work for him anymore and goes to tell Holly that he loves her, but found out that Jason bet him to it and they are back together, however Robbie and Holly pursue an affair behind Jason's back.

Months later, Jason finds out about Robbie and Holly on his and Holly's wedding day after [[Nico Blake]] ([[Persephone Swales-Dawson]]) sends a video of Robbie confessing his love to Holly, from [[Dr. Charles S'avage]]'s (Andrew Greenough) laptop, to Jason out of jealousy. Jason ends up taking steroids again and tries to force himself on to Holly. After convincing from Freddie, Holly lies to Robbie and tells him that she slept with Jason again, ending things between them.

'''Simeon Stylites III''' was a [[stylites|pillar hermit]] bearing the same name as [[Simeon Stylites]] and [[Simeon Stylites the Younger]].

He is honoured by both the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. He is hence believed to have lived in the fifth century before the breach which occurred between these Churches. However, very little certain is known of him. He is believed to have been struck by lightning upon his pillar, built near [[Hegca]] in [[Cilicia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10249">[[File:The last Jew in Vinnitsa, 1941.jpg|thumb|''The last Jew in Vinnitsa'']]'''''The last Jew in Vinnitsa''''' is a photograph taken during [[the Holocaust in Ukraine]] showing a Jewish man near the town of Vinnitsa ([[Vinnytsia]]) about to be shot dead by a member of ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]]'', a mobile [[death squad]] of the Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The victim is kneeling beside a mass grave already containing many bodies; behind a crowd of SS and [[Reich Labour Service]] men watch.&lt;ref name="pa5355"/&gt;

==History==
The photograph dates from some time between mid-1941, when [[Operation Barbarossa#Ukraine and Moldavia|the Germans occupied]] the [[Vinnytsia Oblast|oblast (region) of Vinnytsia]], and 1943.&lt;ref name="pa5355"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa5355|title=Photograph Number 64407: German soldiers of the Waffen-SS and the Reich Labor Service look on as a member of an Einsatzgruppe prepares to shoot a Ukrainian Jew kneeling on the edge of a mass grave filled with corpses.|work=Collections Search|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period there were numerous massacres of Jews in the oblast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/killing_sites_catalog_details_full.asp?region=Vinnitsa|title=Vinnitsa|work=Online Guide of Murder Sites of Jews in the Former USSR|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in the town itself on 16 and 22 September 1941 and April 1942, after which those spared were sent to labour camps and the [[Yerusalimka]] quarter largely razed.&lt;ref name="pa5355"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=686 |title=Vinnitsa, Vinnitsa County, Vinnitsa District, Ukraine |work=The Untold Stories |publisher=Yad Vashem |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/webart/UK-arch-d2.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Holocaust in Vinnitsa Oblast |last=Vinokurova |first=Faina A. |date=2002 |work=Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova |publisher=Routes to Roots Foundation |pages=332–335 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph was circulated in 1961 by [[United Press]] (UP) during the [[trial of Adolf Eichmann]].&lt;ref name="bulmash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.kenyon.edu/bulmash/1085/|title=2012.1.397 : "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa"|year=2016|work=Bulmash Family Holocaust Collection|publisher=[[Kenyon College]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UP had received it from Al Moss (b.1910) a Polish Jew who acquired it in May 1945 shortly after he was liberated from [[Allach (concentration camp)|Allach concentration camp]] by the [[American 3rd Army]].&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/vha3081|title=USC Shoah Foundation Institute testimony of Al Moss|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moss, living in Chicago in 1961, wanted people "to know what went on in Eichmann's time".&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt; The UP copy was published over a full page of ''[[The Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouzan|first1=Francoise S.|last2=Mikhman|first2=Dan|title=De la mémoire de la Shoah dans le monde juif|year=2008|publisher=CNRS éditions|language=French|isbn=9782271067630|page=306|chapter=La mémoire de la Shoah dans le vécu des Juifs aux Etats-Unis jusqu'au procès Eichmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later sources say that the original physical image was in an ''Einsatzgruppe'' member's photograph album,&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt; or removed from the pocket of a dead soldier;&lt;ref name="Knopp2014"/&gt; and that written on its reverse side was "Last Jew in Vinnitsa",&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt; now sometimes used as the image's name.&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopp2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanneh2015"/&gt;

==Significance==
The photograph has become iconic.  Some features are unusual among well-known Holocaust pictures: it was taken during the Holocaust rather than after its end, and presumably by someone complicit in the killing; it depicts ''Einsatzgruppen'' rather than [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] or [[extermination camp]]s; the focus is on a solitary victim rather than a multitude.&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gee2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rakitova2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staines2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wollaston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SollbergerBöning2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boehlke |first=Erik |editor-last1=Sollberger|editor-first1=Daniel |editor-last2=Böning|editor-first2=Jobst |editor-last3=Boehlke|editor-first3=Erik |editor-first4=Gerhard |editor-last4=Schindler |title=Das Geheimnis: Psychologische, psychopathologische und künstlerische Ausdrucksformen im Spektrum zwischen Verheimlichen und Geheimnisvollem |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgA-DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |date=2016-10-10 |publisher=Frank &amp; Timme  |language=German |isbn=9783732903016 |pages=238–239 |chapter=Geheime Botschaften in Bildern; 5 Entdeckungen bei genauem Hinsehen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Geller was born on 20 December 1946 in [[Tel Aviv]], which was then part of British-administered [[Mandatory Palestine]]. His mother and father were of [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian-Jewish]] and [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian-Jewish]] background respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1250577/Me-school-photo-Uri-Geller-remembers-bombs-curfews-shootings-Cyprus.html|title=Me and my school photo: Uri Geller remembers bombs, curfews and shootings in Cyprus|author=Swann, Yvonne|publisher=Mail Online |date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller is the son of Itzhaak Geller (Gellér Izsák), a retired army sergeant major, and Margaret "Manzy" Freud (Freud Manci). Geller claims that he is a distant relative of [[Sigmund Freud]] on his mother's side.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, Jonathan (1998) ''Uri Geller Magician or Mystic'', Orion Publishing Group, p. 13, {{ISBN|0-7528-1006-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 11, Geller's family moved to [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], where he attended [[high school]], the Terra Santa College, and learned English. At the age of 18,&lt;ref name=truth&gt;Randi, James(1982) ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]'', New York: Prometheus Books, p. 9, {{ISBN|0-87975-199-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he joined the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Army]]'s [[Paratroopers Brigade]],&lt;ref name="GuardianGeller"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3945740,00.html | title = Nintendo faces £60m writ from Uri Geller | accessdate = 2006-12-09 | author = Margolis, Jonathan |date=1999-12-29 | work = Guardian Unlimited | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | quote = ... the 53-year-old former Israeli paratrooper has always guarded unlicensed use of his name. | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; with which he served in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and was wounded in action.&lt;ref name="APwounded"&gt;{{cite news | author = Friedman, Matti | title = Bend it like Geller | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/bend-it-like-geller/2006/12/25/1166895234851.html | work = [[The Age]] | agency = Associated Press | accessdate = 2011-02-15 |date = 2006-12-28 | quote = He served in the Israeli paratroops, was wounded in 1967’s Six-Day War... | location=Melbourne}} (also in MSNBC [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/16056135/ns/today-entertainment/] and possibly other sites)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Uri Geller, The Geller Effect |author1=Geller, Uri  |author2=Playfair, Guy Lyon  |lastauthoramp=yes |pages= 6, 27, 79, 133 | quote = (p. 6) He served as a paratrooper during his military service in the Israeli Army and fought in the Six Day was of 1967, during which he was wounded in action.

(p. 133) He showed me the large scar where he had been operated on after being wounded in the Six Day War. It was close to his left elbow joint, and the stitch marks were easily visible. 'I'm not strong in this arm at all,' he added. 'I can't even lift a heavy suitcase with it' }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a photographic [[model (person)|model]] in 1968 and 1969; during that time, he began to perform for small audiences as a nightclub entertainer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944639,00.html?promoid=googlep The Magician And the Think Tank], [[Time (magazine)]] 12 March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; becoming well known in Israel.&lt;ref name="J_Post"&gt;"Telepathist Geller Termed a Fraud," ''Jerusalem Post'' 5 October 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Geller first started to perform in theatres, public halls, auditoriums, military bases and universities in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, Jonathan (1998). Uri Geller. Magician or Mystic?: Orinon Media. {{ISBN|0-7528-1006-5}}. pp. 92, 103, 107, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, Geller had become known in the United States and Europe. He also received attention from the [[scientific community]], whose members were interested in examining his reported psychic abilities. At the peak of his career in the 1970s, he worked full-time, performing for television audiences worldwide.

==Career==
Geller gained notice for demonstrating on television what he claimed to be [[psychokinesis]], [[dowsing]], and [[telepathy]].&lt;ref name="GellerBend"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4087777,00.html | title=Geller: I can bend metal  | publisher=The Guardian |date= 8 November 2000 | first=Uri | last=Geller  | accessdate =2007-10-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His performance included [[spoon bending|bending spoons]], describing hidden drawings, and making watches stop or run faster. Geller said he performs these feats through will power and the strength of his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.uri-geller.com/totallyjewish1.htm | title=Cyberspace Psychic | work=Totally Jewish |date=2000-07-25 | accessdate = 2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magicians and skeptics have noted that Geller has been caught cheating and his performances can be duplicated by [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] tricks.&lt;ref name="ScepdicGeller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Simon.

In fact Geller has actually been caught cheating. In one instance, although he pretended to cover his eyes while a secretary made a simple drawing, Geller actually peeked, thus enabling him to appear to read her mind and produce the drawing. Again, instead of bending a key "by concentration" as he pretended, Geller bent the  key against a table when he thought no one was looking."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hurley 2010"&gt;Hurley, Patrick J. (2010). ''A Concise Introduction to Logic''. 11th Edition. Wadsworth Publishing. p. 626. {{ISBN|978-0840034168}} "In fact Geller was just a clever trickster who duped his audiences. Geller's trickery was exposed in large measure by the magician James Randi. After watching videotapes of Geller's performances, Randi discovered how Geller performed his tricks, and in no time he was able to perform every one of them himself. Sometimes Geller would prepare a spoon or key beforehand by bending it back and forth several times to the point where it was nearly ready to break. Later, by merely stroking it gently, he could cause it to double over. On other occasions Geller, or his accomplices, would use sleight-of-hand maneuvers to substitute bent objects in the place of straight ones."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Geller published his first autobiography, ''My Story'', and acknowledged that, in his early career, his manager talked him into adding a magic trick to make his performances last longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri-geller.com/books/my-story/ms13.htm |title=13 |publisher=Uri-geller.com |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trick involved Geller appearing to guess audience members' license plate numbers, when in fact his manager had given them to him ahead of time. One of Geller's most prominent critics is the [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]], who has accused Geller repeatedly of trying to pass off magic tricks as paranormal displays. Randi often duplicated Geller's performances using stage magic techniques.&lt;ref name="Hurley 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcock 1981"&gt;[[James Alcock|Alcock, James]]. (1981). ''Parapsychology-Science Or Magic?: A Psychological Perspective''. Pergamon Press. pp. 139–40. {{ISBN|978-0080257730}} "It was through the diligent efforts of conjurer James ("The Amazing") Randi that Geller was finally, at least in most people's eyes, exposed. Randi demonstrated that he could by ordinary conjuring means duplicate Geller's feats. His perseverance in investigating and unveiling the circumstances of many of Geller's more spectacular performances (including the discovery of confederates who aided Geller when necessary) made it very difficult for anyone with any degree of critical thought to continue to accept Geller's claims."&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1980s Geller was described as "a millionaire several times over", and claimed to be performing mineral dowsing services for mining groups at a standard fee of £1 million.&lt;ref name="hattam"&gt;{{cite news | title=A cost-effective account of the spoons | work=The Financial Times | date=18 January 1986 | author=van Hattam, Margaret| quote=In 1974 the late Sir Val Duncan set a young Israeli the task of finding some bottles of olive oil he had buried in the garden of his Majorca home, assuring him that it would be his first step towards untold wealth. He was right. Today Uri Geller is a millionaire several times over. This is how it happened.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1986 the ''Australian Skeptic'' reported that Geller had been paid A$350,000 and granted an option of 1,250,000 Zanec shares at 20c each until 5 June 1987.&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic'', 2.6.86, 6.

[[File:Uri Geller.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Geller bending a spoon in a mall in Switzerland, 2005]]
Geller starred in the 2001 horror film ''Sanitarium'', directed by [[Johannes Roberts]] and James Eaves. In May 2002, he appeared as a contestant on the first series of the British [[reality TV]] show ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! (UK)#Series 1|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'', where he was the first to be eliminated and finished in last place. In 2005, Geller starred in ''Uri's Haunted Cities: Venice'', a XI Pictures/Lion TV production for [[Sky One]], which led to a behind the scenes release in early 2008 called ''Cursed''; both productions were directed by Jason Figgis. In early 2007, Geller hosted a reality show in Israel called ''[[The Successor (show)|The Successor]]'' ({{lang|he|היורש}}), where the contestants supposedly displayed supernatural powers; Israeli magicians criticized the program saying that it was all [[magic (illusion)|magic tricks]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6285005.stm | title=Uri Geller accused of TV trickery | publisher=BBC |date=21 January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007 [[NBC]] signed Geller and [[Criss Angel]] for ''[[Phenomenon (TV series)|Phenomenon]]'', to search for the next great [[mentalist]]; contestant Mike Super won the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tbo.com/entertainment/tv/MGBYA18H74F.html| title=NBC Offers Reality Show For Wanna-Be Mentalists With Uri Geller, Criss Angel | publisher=[[Tampa Tribune]] |date=17 July 2007|accessdate =2007-08-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020050232/http://www.tbo.com/entertainment/tv/MGBYA18H74F.html |archivedate = 2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, Geller began hosting the TV show ''[[The Next Uri Geller]]'', broadcast by [[ProSieben|Pro7]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prosieben.de/show_comedy/next_uri_geller/|title=The Next Uri Geller|publisher=Pro7|accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Geller began a show on Dutch television called ''De Nieuwe Uri Geller'', which shares a similar format to its German counterpart. The goal of the programme is to find the best mentalist in the Netherlands. In March 2008, he started the same show in [[Hungary]] (''A kiválasztott'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]). During the show, Geller speaks in both Hungarian and English. Geller also performs his standard routines of allegedly making stopped watches start, spoons jump from televisions, and tables move. Geller co-produced the TV show ''Book of Knowledge'', released in April 2008.&lt;ref name="variety 2008 show"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117983237.html?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562|title=Knowledge powers Mip TV slate|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=31 March 2008|first=John|last=Hopewell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, a similar show, called ''The Successor of Uri Geller'',&lt;ref name="antenna.gr 2009 show"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antenna.gr/webtv/categories?cid=3119|title=Ο ΔΙΑΔΟΧΟΣ ΤΟΥ URI GELLER|publisher=Antenna.gr|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; aired on Greek television.

==Paranormal claims==
Geller has claimed his feats are the result of [[paranormal]] powers&lt;ref name="GellerBend"/&gt; given to him by [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s,&lt;ref name="'70s 132"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; but critics such as James Randi have shown that Geller's tricks can be replicated with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] techniques.&lt;ref name="ScepdicGeller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alcock 1981"/&gt;

In the early 1970s, an article in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' reported that a court had ordered Geller to refund a customer's ticket price and pay court costs after finding that he had committed fraud by claiming that his feats were telepathic.&lt;ref name="J_Post"/&gt; In addition, a 1974 article also hints at Geller's abilities being trickery.&lt;ref name="Twirls"&gt;"Uri Geller Twirls the Entire World on His Little Finger; Only His Closest Acquaintances Know His Methods," ''[[Haolam Hazeh]],'' 1974-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; The article alleged that his manager Shipi Shtrang and Shipi's sister Hannah Shtrang secretly helped in Geller's performances.&lt;ref name="Twirls"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Booth (magician)|Booth, John]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. p. 55. {{ISBN|0-87975-358-7}} "The secret of [Geller']s ability to ascertain "psychically" what audience members were writing on a blackboard behind his back was exposed by his former girl friend, Hannah Shtrang. In the Israeli weekly paper, Ha'Olam Hazeh, 20 February 1974 she disclosed how Geller had taught her brother Shipi (who generally traveled with the magician) and herself how, while seated quietly in the hall at every show, to convey the writing information to him with surreptitious signals."&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Geller married Hannah and they had children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.randi.org/jr/043004bad.html | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710073924/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/043004bad%2Ehtml | archivedate= 10 July 2009 | title=Boring, Boring, Boring  | publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] | date=2004-04-30 | first=James | last=Randi  |authorlink=James Randi| accessdate =2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parapsychologist [[Andrija Puharich]] met Geller in 1971 and endorsed him as a genuine psychic. Under [[hypnosis]], Geller claimed he was sent to earth by extraterrestrials from a spaceship fifty-three thousand light years away.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Lawrence. (2011). ''Supernatural America: A Cultural History''. Praeger. pp. 100–01. {{ISBN|978-0313398995}} "After meeting Geller in Israel in 1971, Puharich was so taken with the twenty-three-year-old and his powers that he would describe the man in Messianic terms. More than just a particularly gifted psychic, Geller was an ambassador sent by extraterrestrials (from a spaceship called Spectra located some fifty-three thousands light years away) to prepare Earthlings for the conquest of their planet."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p.  211. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}} "Hypnotized by Puharich, Geller identified himself as "Spectra," a computer aboard a spaceship from a distant galaxy. Under the control of "Hoova," he was sent to intervene on earth and Puharich was to assist Geller. How much of this was due to Puharich's or Geller's fantasies and how much was a result of pure fabrication on the part of both is difficult to say. The "intelligences" that Uri drew upon were from outer space. For many, UFOlogy has become a new religion, replete with science-fiction imagery of the post-modern world. And Uri, like countless others, has embellished his mission with fanciful space-age symbols."&lt;/ref&gt; Geller would later deny the space-fantasy claims, but affirmed there "is a slight possibility that some of my energies do have extraterrestrial connection."&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Leslie. (1991). [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403801885.html "Uri Geller"]. In ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Gale Research. p. 655. {{ISBN|0-8103-4915-9}} "Although much of his [Puharich's] book was accurate factual reporting, many people were put off by the space-fantasy passages, and I admit that they caused me some embarrassment... You must remember that all of this fantasy material was obtained while I was under hypnosis. One reason I wrote ''My Story'' was to give my own version of events, though I must emphasize that there is a slight possibility that some of my energies do have extraterrestrial connection."&lt;/ref&gt; Puharich also stated that Geller [[Teleportation|teleported]] a dog through the walls of his house. However, science writer [[Martin Gardner]] wrote as "no expert on fraud was there as an observer" then nobody should take the claim of Puharich seriously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 356. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biography of Geller, ''Uri: A Journal of the Mystery of Uri Geller'' (1974) Puharich claimed that with Geller he had communicated with super intelligent computers from outer space. According to Puharich the computers sent messages to warn humanity that a disaster is likely to occur if humans do not change their ways.&lt;ref name="Evans1974"&gt;[[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Evans, Christopher]]. (1974). ''Integral fruitage''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. 25 April. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Christopher Evans]] who reviewed the book in the ''[[New Scientist]]'', wrote that although Puharich believed in every word he had written, the book was credulous and "those fans of Geller's who might have hoped to have used the book as ammunition to impress the sceptics. They will be the most disappointed of all".&lt;ref name="Evans1974"/&gt; Randi has written the biography contained "silly theories" but was "both a boost and a millstone to Geller".&lt;ref&gt;Randi, James. (1982). ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]''. Prometheus Books. p. 24. {{ISBN|978-0879751999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geller's [[spoon bending]] feats are discussed in ''The Geller Papers'' (1976), edited by [[Charles Panati]]. There was controversy when it was published. Several prominent magicians came forward to demonstrate that Geller’s so-called psychic talents could be easily duplicated by magic. Martin Gardner wrote that Panati had been fooled by Geller's trickery and ''The Geller Papers'' were an "embarrassing anthology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gardner |first= Martin |authorlink= Martin Gardner |year= 2003 |title= Are Universes Thicker Than Blackberries? |publisher= [[W.

Notable scientists, magicians, and [[Scientific skepticism|skeptics]] have suggested possible ways in which Geller could have tricked his audience by using [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]] techniques.&lt;ref name="ScepdicGeller"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/geller.html |title=The skeptic's Dictionary: Uri Geller |publisher=Skepdic.com |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indian-skeptic.org/html/fey2.htm |title=Richard Feynman on Uri Geller |publisher=Indian-skeptic.org |date=1997-10-23 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics, who include [[Richard Feynman]], James Randi and Martin Gardner, have accused him of using his demonstrations [[fraud]]ulently outside of the entertainment business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Gardner| title=Science: Good, Bad &amp; Bogus|publisher=Prometheus Books| year=1989|origyear=1981| isbn=0-87975-573-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]]-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who was an amateur magician, wrote in ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'' (1985) that Geller was unable to bend a key for him and his son.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, Richard]] (1985). ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his claims have been described by watchmakers as simply restarting a stopped mechanical clock by moving it around.&lt;ref name="Rensberger NYTimes 59"&gt;Rensberger, Boyce (13 December 1975) "Magicians Term Israeli 'Psychic' a Fraud," ''The New York Times'', p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Geller is well known for making predictions regarding sporting events. Skeptic James Randi and British [[tabloid newspaper]] ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' have demonstrated the teams and players he chooses to win most often lose.&lt;ref name="CurseSun"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/41238/The-curse-of-Uri-Geller.html | title=The Curse of Uri Geller | work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date=2007-04-01 | first= Veronica| last= Lorraine| accessdate = 2007-04-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Atkinson explored "predictions" Geller made over 30 years and concluded "Uri more often than not scuppered [i.e., destroyed] the chances of sportsmen and teams he was trying to help."&lt;ref name="CurseSun" /&gt; This was pointed out by one of Randi's readers, who called it "The Curse of Uri Geller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.randi.org/jr/062703.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20080211134918/http://www.randi.org/jr/062703.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2008-02-11| title=The Curse of Uri Geller | publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |date=2003-07-27| accessdate = 2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Euro 96]] football match between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], Geller, who was hovering overhead in a helicopter, claimed that he managed to move the ball from the penalty spot when Scotland's [[Gary McAllister]] was about to take a penalty kick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/84410/Scots-pyramid-island-a-bargain-for-psychic-Uri |title=Home of the Daily and Sunday Express &amp;#124; UK News :: Scots pyramid island a bargain for psychic Uri |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The penalty kick was saved and Scotland lost 2–0.

In another notable instance, in 1992, Geller was asked to investigate the kidnapping of Hungarian model Helga Farkas: he predicted she would be found alive and in good health, but she was never found and is widely believed to have been murdered by her kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delmagyar.hu/szeged_hirek/husz_eve_tunt_el_farkas_helga/2227351/|title=Húsz éve tűnt el Farkas Helga|website=delmagyar.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller was a friend of [[Bruce Bursford]] and helped him "train his mind" during some cycling speed record-breaking bids in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/638297.stm Record-breaking cyclist killed].

Since the publication of his first book, ''My Story'' in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Uri Geller, ''My Story'' (New York: Praeger, 1975). Uri Geller, ''Uri Geller's Fortune Secrets'' (London: Sphere, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed that his wealth originated from being commissioned as a mineral-dowser and not from bending spoons and forks.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In 2007, skeptics observed that Geller appeared to have dropped his claims that he does not perform magic tricks. Randi highlighted a quotation from the November 2007 issue of the magazine ''Magische Welt'' (Magic World) in which Geller said: "I'll no longer say that I have supernatural powers. I am an entertainer. I want to do a good show. My entire character has changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/149-swift-january-18-2008.html#i1 | title=Geller Reversal | publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |date=2008-01-18 | first=James | last=Randi |authorlink=James Randi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview, Geller told ''[[Telepolis]]'', "I said to this German magazine, so what I did say, that I changed my character, to the best of my recollection, and I no longer say that I do supernatural things. It doesn't mean that I don't have powers. It means that I don't say 'it's supernatural', I say 'I'm a mystifier!' That's what I said. And the skeptics turned it around and said, 'Uri Geller said he's a magician!' I never said that."&lt;ref name=Telepolis&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/27/27217/1.html | title=Forget the paranormal! | publisher=[[Telepolis]] |date=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that interview, Geller further explained that when he is asked how he does his stunts, he tells children to  "Forget the paranormal. Forget spoon bending! Instead of that, focus on school! Become a positive thinker! Believe in yourself and create a target! Go to university! Never smoke! And never touch drugs! And think of success!"&lt;ref  name=Telepolis/&gt;

In February 2008, Geller stated in the TV show ''The Next Uri Geller'' (a German version of ''[[The Successor (show)|The Successor]]'') that he did not have any supernatural powers, before winking to the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

===Parallels to stage magic===
Geller admits, "Sure, there are magicians who can duplicate [my performances] through trickery."&lt;ref name="UGSInterview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://simon-jones.org.uk/uri-geller-sceptical-interview/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224035757/http://simon-jones.org.uk/uri-geller-sceptical-interview/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-12-24 | title=Uri Geller – A Sceptical Perspective | publisher=WordSmith |date=October 1996| accessdate = 2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has claimed that even though his spoon bending can be repeated using trickery, he uses psychic powers to achieve his results.&lt;ref name="UGSInterview" /&gt; James Randi has stated that if Geller is truly using his mind to perform these feats, "He is doing it the hard way."&lt;ref name=NOVASecrets&gt;Interview with James Randi in ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' episode, "[[Secrets of the Psychics]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magicians note several methods of creating the [[illusion]] of a spoon spontaneously bending. Most common is the practice of [[misdirection (magic)|misdirection]], an underlying principle of many [[magic (illusion)|stage magic]] tricks.&lt;ref name=HarrisSecond&gt;Harris, Ben{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/2ndcoming/psychics.pdf |title=The Second Coming Psychics: All the Best from Skeptic 1986–1990 |accessdate=2007-03-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819083928/http://www.skeptics.com.au/journal/2ndcoming/psychics.pdf |archivedate=19 August 2006 |df=dmy }}, skeptics.com.au, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways in which a bent spoon can be presented to an audience as to give the appearance it was manipulated using supernatural powers. One way is through brief moments of distraction in which a magician can physically bend a spoon unseen by the audience,&lt;ref name=NOVASecrets /&gt; before gradually revealing the bend to create the illusion that the spoon is bending before the viewers' eyes.&lt;ref name=NOVASecrets /&gt; Another way is to pre-bend the spoon, perhaps by heating it, reducing the amount of force that  needed to be applied to bend it manually.&lt;ref name=NOVASecrets /&gt;

During telepathic drawing demonstrations, Geller claimed the ability to read the minds of subjects as they draw a picture. Although in these demonstrations he cannot see the picture being drawn, he is sometimes present in the room, and on these occasions can see the subjects as they draw. Critics argue this may allow Geller to infer common shapes from pencil movement and sound, with the power of suggestion doing the rest.&lt;ref name=HarrisSecond /&gt;

Watchmakers have noted that "many supposedly broken watches had merely been stopped by gummy oil, and simply holding them in the hand would warm the oil enough to soften it and allow watches to resume ticking."&lt;ref name="Rensberger NYTimes 59" /&gt;

In 1978, Yasha Katz, who had been Geller's manager in Britain, said that all performances by Geller were simply stage tricks, and he explained how they were really done.&lt;ref name="books.google"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, William D. (1991). ''Thinking Critically About New Age Ideas''. Wadsworth Publishing Company. p. 80. {{ISBN|978-0534143947}} "Skilled magicians can duplicate all of [Geller’s] illusions, and his manager has testified that Geller uses an accomplice in trickery. Geller is probably the most thoroughly exposed charlatan of all time, but he is still hailed by many believers as a genuine psychic."&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Geller accepted an award during a convention of magicians, the ''Services to Promotion of Magic Award'' from the Berglas Foundation. In his acceptance speech, Geller said that if he had not had psychic powers then he "must be the greatest" to have been able to fool journalists, scientists and [[David Berglas|Berglas]] himself.&lt;ref name="Service To Magic Award"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Service To Magic Award|url=http://www.magicconventionguide.com/2008/uri-geller-recieves-the-berglas-foundation-services-to-promotion-of-magic-award/|accessdate=3 December 2008|quote=Lets say I wasn’t real, lets say for the last years I’ve fooled the journalists, the scientists, my family, my friends... You... If I managed to fool them, I must be the greatest...I cannot bend spoons like some of the magicians, you, can, it blows my mind when I see that, I have no idea. I had the idea and cheekiness to call it psychic, in fact all I wanted was to be rich and famous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2012, Geller gave a lecture for magicians in the United States at the Genii Magazine 75th Birthday Bash.&lt;ref&gt;''Linking Ring Magazine''. August 2012, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific testing===

[[File:Drawing Experiments with Uri Geller.ogg|thumb|This clip, created by the Stanford Research Institute, shows Uri Geller performing drawing experiments for researchers.]]

Geller's performances of drawing duplication and cutlery bending usually take place under informal conditions such as television interviews. During his early career, he allowed some scientists to investigate his claims. A study was commissioned by the United States [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] as part of the [[Stargate Project]] and conducted during August 1973 at [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] (now known as SRI International) by parapsychologists [[Harold E. Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]]. Geller was isolated and asked to reproduce simple drawings prepared in another room. The experimenters concluded that Geller had "demonstrated his paranormal perceptual ability in a convincing and unambiguous manner".&lt;ref name="WaPO2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larimer|first1=Sarah|title=That time the CIA was convinced a self-proclaimed psychic had paranormal abilities|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/19/that-time-the-cia-was-convinced-a-self-proclaimed-psychic-had-paranormal-abilities/|website=[[Washington Post]]|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CIAsri"&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]| title=Experiments – Uri Geller at SRI, August 4–11, 1973| date=| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00791R000100480003-3.pdf  &lt;!--summary page https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp96-00791r000100480003-3 --&gt;|format=PDF | accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCsri"&gt;{{cite news| publisher=[[BBC]]| title=CIA releases 13m pages of declassified documents online| date=18 January 2017| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38663522| accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the same study in a 1974 article published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', they concluded that he had performed successfully enough to warrant further serious study,&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{Cite journal

In ''[[An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural]]'', Randi wrote: "Hal Puthoff and Russell Targ, who studied Mr. Geller at the Stanford Research Institute were aware, in one instance at least, that they were being shown a magician's trick by Geller."&lt;ref name=EncycClaims&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Geller,%20Uri.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711051000/http://www.randi.org/encyclopedia/Geller,%20Uri.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2009-07-11 | title=An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=1995 | first=James | last=Randi | authorlink=James Randi| accessdate = 2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Randi explained, "their protocols for this 'serious' investigation of the powers claimed by Geller were described by [[Ray Hyman]], who investigated the project on behalf of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, as 'sloppy and inadequate.'"&lt;ref name=EncycClaims /&gt; Critics have pointed out that both Puthoff and Targ were already believers in [[paranormal]] powers and Geller was not adequately searched before the experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Lawrence R. (2011). ''Supernatural America: A Cultural History''. Praeger. p. 101. {{ISBN|978-0-313-39899-5}} "The observers were more appalled, however, than impressed. The SRI staffers (physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, who specialized in lasers) “already believed in E.S.P., and therefore their goal was to make Geller as comfortable as possible in order to make him produce it” said one of the independent experts, Ray Hyman. Hyman, a University of Oregon psychologist (and amateur magician), added that the think tank’s work was “incredibly sloppy”. Geller was not psychic but a very gifted conjurer, Hyman concluded, employing classic mentalist’s tricks that would and should have been exposed by more objective methods. Over the course of his six-week stint at SRI (for which he was paid 100$ a day and all expenses), Geller had not even been searched for magnets, something that any good researcher would have known to do to instantly identify a fake. A magnet taped to one’s leg could make a Geiger counter click wildly, this a feat Geller had performed before researchers at the University of London who had been hoodwinked by the man."&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[C. E. M. Hansel]] and skeptic [[Paul Kurtz]] have noted that the experiments were poorly designed and open to trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M]]. (1989). ''The Search for Psychic Power''. Prometheus Books. pp. 257–60. {{ISBN|0-87975-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kurtz|Kurtz, Paul]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. p. 213. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}} "Skeptics have criticized the test for lacking stringent controls. They have pointed out that the pictures drawn by Geller did not match what they were supposed to correspond to but appeared, rather, to be responses to verbal cues. What constituted a “hit” is open to dispute. The conditions under which the experiments were conducted were extremely loose, even chaotic at times. The sealed room in which Uri was placed had an aperture from which he could have peeked out, and his confederate Shipi was in and about the laboratory and could have conveyed signals to him. The same was true in another test of clairvoyance, where Geller passed twice but surprisingly guessed eight out of ten times the top face of a die that was placed in a closed metal box. The probability of this happening by chance alone was, we are told, one in a million. Critics maintained that the protocol of this experiment was, again, poorly designed, that Geller could have peeked into the box, and that dozens of other tests from which there were no positive results were not reported."&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable critics of the experiments include [[psychology|psychologists]] [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann, who published a description of how Geller could have cheated in an informal test of his so-called psychic powers in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, David and Kammann, Richard (Summer 1977) "The Non-Psychic Powers of Uri Geller". ''Skeptical Inquirer'', '''1'''(2): 9–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Their 1978 article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = D. | last2 = Kammann | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1038/274680a0 | title = Information transmission in remote viewing experiments | journal = Nature | volume = 274 | issue = 5672 | pages = 680 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980 book ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]'' (2nd ed. 2000) described how a normal explanation was possible for Geller's alleged psychic powers.&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"&gt;[[David Marks (psychologist)|Marks, David]]; Kammann, Richard. (2000). ''[[The Psychology of the Psychic]]''. Prometheus Books. pp. 137–87. {{ISBN|1-57392-798-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marks and Kammann found evidence that while at SRI, Geller was allowed to peek through a hole in the laboratory wall separating Geller from the drawings he was being invited to reproduce. The drawings he was asked to reproduce were placed on a wall opposite the peep hole which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom enabling Geller to listen to the investigators' conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings. These basic errors indicate the high importance of ensuring that psychologists, magicians or other people with an in-depth knowledge of perception, who are trained in methods for blocking sensory cues, be present during the testing of psychics.&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"/&gt; Marks, after evaluating the experiments, wrote that none of Geller's paranormal claims had been demonstrated in scientifically controlled conditions, concluding that "Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever. However, I believe him to be a very clever, well-practiced magician."&lt;ref name="Marks 2000"/&gt;

==''The Tonight Show''==
In 1973, Geller appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'',  and this appearance is recounted in the ''[[NOVA (TV series)|NOVA]]'' documentary, ''James Randi – Secrets of the Psychics.''{{efn|A two-minute clip of this documentary with the Geller segment has been widely circulated on the Internet since James Randi acquired permission to use it from NBC, and Carson paid for the expensive, complex videotape transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-03/032307hope.html |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711011032/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D03/032307hope%2Ehtml |archivedate=11 July 2009 |title=Swift |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|James Randi discussed obtaining the clip of Uri Geller on ''The Tonight Show''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}}

In the documentary, James Randi says that "Johnny had been a magician himself and was skeptical" of Geller's claimed [[paranormal]] powers, so prior to the date of taping, Randi was asked "to help prevent any trickery." Per Randi's advice, the show prepared their own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff "anywhere near them." When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said "This scares me." and "As you know, I told your people what to bring." and "I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me." Geller was unable to display any [[paranormal]] abilities, saying "I don't feel strong" and he expressed his displeasure at feeling like he was being "pressed" to perform by Carson.&lt;ref name="'70s 132"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Randi - Secrets of the Psychics Documentary (Full)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MFAvH8m8aI|publisher=YouTube|author=JREF|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8:10}} According to Adam Higginbotham's Nov. 7, 2014 article in the ''New York Times'': {{Quote|text=The result was a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again. 'I sat there for 22 minutes, humiliated,' Geller told me, when I spoke to him in September. 'I went back to my hotel, devastated. I was about to pack up the next day and go back to Tel Aviv. I thought, That's it – I'm destroyed.'&lt;ref name =Higginbotham&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higginbotham |first1=Adam|title=The Unbelievable Skepticism of the Amazing Randi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/magazine/the-unbelievable-skepticism-of-the-amazing-randi.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, this appearance on ''The Tonight Show'', which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham, 
{{Quote|text=To Geller's astonishment, he was immediately booked on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''. He was on his way to becoming a paranormal superstar. 'That Johnny Carson show made Uri Geller,' Geller said. To an enthusiastically trusting public, his failure only made his gifts seem more real: If he were performing magic tricks, they would surely work every time.&lt;ref name =Higginbotham/&gt;}}

==Controversial performances==
{{wikinews|Criss Angel challenges Uri Geller and Jim Callahan over paranormal claims}}
As part of a mass demonstration, Geller’s photograph appeared on the cover of the magazine ''ESP'' with the caption "On Sept. 1, 1976 at 11pm E.D.T. THIS COVER CAN BEND YOUR KEYS." According to editor Howard Smukler, over 300 positive responses were received, many including bent objects and detailed descriptions of the surrounding circumstances including the bending of the key to the city of [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zem.demon.co.uk/espsucc.htm |title=Geller Experiment Successful – ESP Magazine |publisher=Zem.demon.co.uk |accessdate=2010-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901133354/http://www.zem.demon.co.uk/espsucc.htm |archive-date=1 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television presenter [[Noel Edmonds]] often used hidden cameras to record celebrities in ''[[Candid Camera]]''-like situations for his television programme, ''[[Noel's House Party]]''. In 1996, Edmonds planned a stunt in which shelves would fall from the walls of a room while Geller was in it. The cameras recorded footage of Geller from angles he was not expecting, and they showed Geller grasping a spoon firmly with both hands as he stood up to display a bend in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdTqpscvaw4|title=James Randi exposes Uri Geller |work=YouTube|accessdate=2010-07-27}} Excerpt from "James Randi's Solved Mysteries Workshop", a talk given by Randi during the 1998 Skeptics Society Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006 and early 2007, Geller starred in ''[[The Successor (show)|The Successor]]'', an Israeli television show to find his "successor."  During one segment, a compass was made to move, apparently as a result of Geller's paranormal abilities.  However, critics say slow motion footage of the episode showed Geller attaching a magnet to his thumb immediately prior to the compass's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|MVKNWgCGMd4|Uri Geller Exposed on Rffi Reshef with Compass Trick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i7|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml |archivedate= 10 July 2009 |title=James Randi's Swift |date= February 9, 2007 |publisher=Randi.org |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller denied that this was [[sleight of hand]], and said he welcomed the "mystical aura" that the publicity gave him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6285005.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Uri Geller accused of TV trickery |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geller performed the same compass trick in 2000 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC TV]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', which was later duplicated by Randi on the same show the following week.&lt;ref name="compass2000"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://randi.org/jr/01-26-2000.html | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710065707/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/01%2D26%2D2000%2Ehtml | archivedate= 10 July 2009 | title=The Moving Compass Trick | publisher=[[James Randi Educational Foundation]] |date=2000-01-26| first=James | last=Randi | authorlink=James Randi |accessdate = 2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==
Geller has litigated or threatened legal action against some of his critics with mixed success.&lt;ref name="truzzi"&gt;{{cite web |author = Truzzi, Marcello |date= May 1996 |work =''Psi Researcher'', the Parapsychological Association newsletter |issue = 21 |url= http://66.221.71.68/psir.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602021158/http://66.221.71.68/psir.htm|title=Psi Researcher |archivedate = 2 June 2008}} [http://www.rr0.org/data/1/9/9/6/05/AnEndToTheUriGellerVsRandiCsicopLitigations/index.html mirror]&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[libel]] allegations against James Randi and [[illusionist]] [[Gérard Majax]].

In 1971, a mechanical engineering student called Uri Goldstein attended one of Geller's shows, and subsequently sued the show's promoters for breach of contract. He complained that Geller had promised a demonstration of several psychic powers but had delivered only sleight-of-hand and stage tricks. The case came before the civil court in Beersheba.&lt;ref&gt;Randi, James (1982) ''The Truth About Uri Geller'', Prometheus Books, pp. viii, 198, 215, {{ISBN|0-87975-199-1}}. Randi quotes "Legerdemain ruled breach of contract", ''Jerusalem Post'', 5 January 1971. Quoted in [https://web.archive.org/web/20090609110044/http://www.urigeller.com/courts.htm An Apology from James Randi] Urigeller.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Geller was not present as the summons had been sent to the office of the promoter Miki Peled, who had ignored it as being trivial. Goldstein was awarded 27.5 [[Israeli lira|lira]] (around $5) for breach of contract. Later, Goldstein admitted that he went to the show specifically with the intention of suing to get his money back, and he had already found a lawyer to represent him prior to attending the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, Jonathan. (1998). ''Uri Geller Magician or Mystic''. Orion Publishing Group. p. 113. {{ISBN|0-7528-1006-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1989 interview with a [[Japan]]ese newspaper, James Randi was quoted as saying that Geller had driven a scientist to "shoot himself in the head" after finding out that Geller had fooled him. Randi afterwards claimed it was a metaphor lost in translation.&lt;ref name="cuckoos"&gt;[http://www.skepticfiles.org/randi/legal.htm Cuckoos and Cocoa Puffs by Carol Krol] Skeptical Eye – Vol. 8, No. 3, 1995, a newsletter published by the National Capital Area Skeptics (NCAS)&lt;/ref&gt; The story was also repeated in a Canadian newspaper, which quoted Randi as saying essentially the same thing: "One scientist, a metallurgist, wrote a paper backing Geller's claims that he could bend metal. The scientist shot himself after I showed him how the key bending trick was done."&lt;ref&gt;Orwen, Patricia (23 August 1986) [http://zammoth-jamesrandi.blogspot.com/ The Amazing Randi], ''[[Toronto Star]]''. p. M.1&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, Geller sued Randi in a Japanese court over the statements published in the Japanese newspaper. Randi claims that he could not afford to defend himself, therefore he lost the case by default. The court declared Randi's statement an "insult" as opposed to libel, and awarded a token judgement against Randi, only "one-third of one-percent of what he'd demanded".&lt;ref name="randi 1994"/&gt; Since the charge of "insult" is only recognized in Chinese and Japanese law, Randi was not required to pay.&lt;ref name="randi 1994"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/hotline/1994/0048.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070624182124/http://www.randi.org/hotline/1994/0048.html |archivedate=24 June 2007 |title=Randi's Geller Hotline for 1994: Recent Legal Developments |publisher=Randi.org |date=1994-12-11 |accessdate=2010-03-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geller_psir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri-geller.com/psir.htm |title=PSI Researcher |publisher=Uri-geller.com |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="randi 2007"&gt;{{cite web | last = Randi | first = James | authorlink=James Randi | date = 2007-02-09 | url = http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i6 | archiveurl = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D02/020209morebrowne%2Ehtml | archivedate = 10 July 2009 | title = More Geller Woo-Woo | work = SWIFT Newsletter | publisher = [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] | accessdate = 2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1995 Geller agreed not to pursue payment of the Japanese fine.&lt;ref name="truzzi"/&gt; Randi maintains that he has never paid even one dollar or even one cent to Geller.&lt;ref name="randi 2007" /&gt;
{{wikisource|Uri Geller vs. James Randi decision}}

In 1992, Geller filed a $15 million suit against Randi and [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] for statements made in an ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' interview on 9 April 1991,&lt;ref name="truzzi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuckoos"/&gt; but he was unsuccessful because the [[statute of limitations]] had expired.&lt;ref name="truzzi"/&gt; In 1994 Geller asked to dismiss without prejudice, and he was ordered to pay $50,000 for the publisher's attorney fees. After not paying in time, Geller was sanctioned with an additional $20,000. Due to the sanction, the suit was dismissed with prejudice, which, according to Randi's attorneys, means that Geller cannot pursue the same suit in any other jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="truzzi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CiscopLibel" &gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211180550/http://csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html | archivedate=2008-02-11| title = Uri Geller Libel Suit Dismissed | accessdate = 2006-12-08|date=August 1994 | author = Geller, Uri | work = Committee for Skeptical Inquiry | quote = Self proclaimed "psychic" Uri Geller had to dismiss a multi-million dollar libel suit and has to pay over $20,000 in sanctions in an action he brought against skeptical book publisher Prometheus Books of Amherst, New York.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/040/40.F3d.1300.93-7140.html ''Geller v.

In 1991, Geller sued [[Timex Group USA|Timex Corporation]] and the advertising firm [[Fallon Worldwide|Fallon McElligott]] for millions in ''Geller v. Fallon McElligott''&lt;ref&gt;(No. 90-Civ-2839, 22 July 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; over an ad showing a person bending forks and other items, but failing to stop a Timex watch. Geller was sanctioned $149,000 for filing a [[frivolous lawsuit]].&lt;ref name="randi 1994" /&gt;

In 1998, the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] (BSC) in the United Kingdom rejected a complaint made by Geller, saying that it "wasn't unfair to have magicians showing how they duplicate those 'psychic feats'" on the UK ''[[Equinox (television)|Equinox]]'' episode ''"[[Secrets of the Super Psychics]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;this film, made by [[Open Media]], was known on first transmission as ''Secrets of the Psychics'' but should not be confused with the earlier ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' film of the same name&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_n6_v22/ai_21275515 |title=UK broadcast commission rejects Geller's 'Secrets of the Psychics' complaint |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=November–December 1998 |first=Susan |last=Blackmore |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526200049/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_n6_v22/ai_21275515 |archivedate=26 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openmedia.co.uk/urigeller.htm |title=Broadcasting Standards Commission |publisher=Openmedia.co.uk |accessdate=2010-03-07 |date=17 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Geller issued a [[DMCA]] notice to YouTube to remove a video uploaded by Brian Sapient of the "Rational Response Squad" which was excerpted from an episode of the ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' television program titled ''"[[Secrets of the Psychics]]".'' The video included footage of Geller failing to perform.  In response, Sapient contacted the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], issued a DMCA counter-notice, and sued Geller for misuse of the DMCA.  Geller's company, Explorologist, filed a counter-suit.  Both cases were settled out of court; a monetary settlement was paid (but it is not clear by and to whom) and the eight seconds of footage owned by Explorologist were licensed under a noncommercial [[Creative Commons]] license.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/cases/sapient-v-geller Sapient v. Geller], Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property==

On 11 February 2009, Geller purchased the uninhabited 100-meter-by-50-meter [[The Lamb (island)|Lamb Island]] off the eastern coast of Scotland, previously known for its [[witch trials]], and beaches that [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] is said to have described in his novel ''[[Treasure Island]]''.  Geller claims that buried on the island is Egyptian treasure, brought there by [[Scota]], the mythological half-sister of [[Tutankhamen]] in Irish mythology, 3,500 years ago.  He claimed that he will find the treasure through [[dowsing]], despite dowsing being considered a pseudoscience. Geller also claimed to have strengthened the mystical powers of the island by burying there a crystal orb once belonging to [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'', 23 August 2010, 1. The article quoted Geller as saying that "I'm certain there are ancient Egyptian artifacts there.  It's only a matter of time until we find them."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7883836.stm | work=BBC News | title=Spoon-bender buys Scottish island | date=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a 12&amp;nbsp;foot tall statue of a gorilla made from approximately 40,000 metal spoons was unveiled in Geller's Berkshire garden by the [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], with the intention of possibly relocating it to [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27218699|title=Uri Geller spoon gorilla completed|date=1 May 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was welded by sculptor Alfie Bradley, and funded by the [[British Ironworks Centre &amp; Shropshire Sculpture Park|British Ironworks Centre]] of Oswestry. According to Bradley, many of the spoons were donated by schoolchildren from around the world. Speaking at the unveiling, Geller said "This will not raise money for charity. It will do something better. It will amaze sick children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-27453471|title=Uri Geller spoon gorilla unveiled|date=17 May 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 BBC documentary==
In 2013, a BBC documentary, ''The Secret Life of Uri Geller – Psychic Spy?'' featured Uri Geller, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], Christopher 'Kit' Green, Paul H. Smith, [[Harold Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]]. The documentary claimed Geller became a "psychic spy" for the [[CIA]], was recruited by [[Mossad]], and worked as an "official secret agent" in [[Mexico]], being a frequent guest of President [[José López Portillo]]. In the film, Geller claims to have erased [[floppy disc]]s carried by KGB agents by repeatedly chanting the word "erase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.springfilms.tv/productions/past-productions/uri-geller/|title=Spring Films entry|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028225327/http://www.springfilms.tv/productions/past-productions/uri-geller/|archivedate=28 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b037k0c5|title=The Secret Life of Uri Geller|work=BBC Two}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Jake Wallace|title=The Secret Life of Uri Geller, BBC Two, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10192027/The-Secret-Life-of-Uri-Geller-BBC-Two-review.html|accessdate=8 September 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=21 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Geller has lived in [[Jaffa]] in Israel since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uri Geller: 'The CIA wanted to turn me into a Cold War weapon'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/uri-geller-cia-wanted-turn-weapon/|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=11 March 2017|first=Judith|last=Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously lived in the village of [[Sonning|Sonning-on-Thames]], [[Berkshire]], in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.675099| title=Spoon-bending Psychic Uri Geller Coming Home to Israel| first=Judy |last=Maltz| date=8 September 2015| newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-24028902 |title=Uri Geller mystified by letterbox on Thames Sonning Bridge |year=2013 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is [[trilingual]], speaking fluent [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcast.tv2.hu/dynamic/f.html?video_id=374195 |title=TV2V |publisher=Webcast.tv2.hu |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an appearance on [[Esther Rantzen]]'s 1996 television talk show ''Esther'', Geller declared that he had suffered from [[anorexia nervosa]] and bulimia&lt;ref name="Glammonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.glammonitor.com/2015/male-eating-disorders-2949/|title=With Male Eating Disorders on the Rise, Uri Geller One of Few Advocates for Males|publisher=Glammonitor (New York, United States)|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for several years.&lt;ref name="HB anorexia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60353334.html|title=Anorexic men are suffering in silence|publisher=Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland)|date=1 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph anorexia"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/21/nprescott321.xml|title=Uri Geller: Bingeing is an addictive drug|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=2008-04-20|first=Uri|last=Geller|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written 16 [[fiction]] and [[non fiction]] books.

His friend [[Michael Jackson]] was [[best man]] when Geller renewed his wedding vows in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1206918.stm | title=Jackson fans await Geller wedding | publisher=BBC |date=2001-03-07| accessdate = 2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geller also negotiated the TV interview between Jackson with the journalist [[Martin Bashir]], ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2719763.stm | title=Jackson interview seen by 14m | publisher=BBC |date=4 February 2003 | accessdate = 2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geller is president of International Friends of Magen David Adom, a group that lobbied the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] to recognise [[Magen David Adom]] ("Red Star of David") as a humanitarian relief organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Red-Cross-panel-votes-to-admit-Israeli-agency-as-2557881.php Red Cross panel votes to admit Israeli agency as member], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', December 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 he tried to help the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[association football|football]] club [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] win a crucial end of season game by placing "energy-infused" crystals behind the goals at Exeter's ground (Exeter lost the game 5–1); he was appointed co-chairman of the club in 2002. The club was relegated to the [[Football Conference]] in May 2003, where it remained for five years. He has since severed formal ties with the club. He had also been involved with [[Reading F.C.]] and claimed in 2002 that he had helped them to avoid relegation by getting the club's supporters to look into his eyes and say "win, Reading, win". Reading manager [[Alan Pardew]] dismissed Geller's role in the club's survival - which was achieved thanks to a draw in the crucial match rather than a Reading victory - stating "as soon as we get a bit of joy, thanks to all the hard work and efforts of my staff and players, he suddenly comes out of the blue and tries to claim the limelight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/exeter_city/1998170.stm|title=Geller's straight approach|date=21 May 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Michael Jackson, the British television station [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] announced plans to screen an interview with Geller regarding his relationship with Jackson, entitled ''My Friend Michael Jackson: Uri's Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/itv-announce-my-friend-michael-jackson-uris-story/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209231945/http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/itv-announce-my-friend-michael-jackson-uris-story/|archivedate=2009-12-09 |title=ITV announce 'My Friend Michael Jackson: Uri's Story' @ Unreality Primetime |publisher=Primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk |date=2009-07-17 |accessdate=2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valide sultan''' ({{lang-ota|والده سلطان}}, lit. "mother sultan") was the title held by the "legal mother" of a ruling [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The title was first used in the 16th century for [[Hafsa Sultan (wife of Selim I)|Hafsa Sultan]], consort of [[Selim I]] and mother of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], superseding the previous title of ''[[Mahd-i Ulya (disambiguation)|mehd-i ulya]]'' ("cradle of the great").&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Ottoman Lady: A Social History from 1718 to 1918|first = Fanny|last = Davis|year = 1986|isbn = 0-313-24811-7|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DTIrK0et4LwC&amp;pg=PA11|chapter = The Valide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, this title was held by the living mother of a reigning sultan. The mothers who died before their sons' accession to the throne were never bestowed with the title of Valide Sultan. In special cases, there were grandmothers and stepmothers of a reigning sultan who assumed the title Valide Sultan.

==Term==
The word ''valide'' (والده) literally means "mother" in Ottoman Turkish, from Arabic. The [[Turkish phonology|Turkish]] pronunciation of the word ''valide'' is {{IPA-tr|vaː.liˈde|}}.

[[Sultan]] (سلطان) is an Arabic word originally meaning "authority" or "dominion". By the beginning of the 16th century, this title, carried by both men and women of the Ottoman dynasty, was replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably ''[[hatun]]'' for women and ''[[bey]]'' for men). Consequently, the title ''valide hatun'' (title for living mother of reigning Ottoman sultan before 16th century) also turned into ''valide sultan''. This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.

Western tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as "sultan", but the Ottomans themselves used "padişah" (emperor) or "hünkar" to refer to their ruler. The emperor’s formal title consisted of "sultan" together with "khan" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan’s children were also entitled "sultan", with imperial princes ([[şehzade]]) carrying the title before their given name, with imperial princesses carrying it after. Example, [[Şehzade Mehmed|Şehzade Sultan Mehmed]] and [[Mihrimah Sultan]], son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, the living mother and main consort of reigning sultans also carried the title after their given names, for example, [[Hafsa Sultan (wife of Selim I)|Hafsa Sultan]], Suleiman’s mother and first valide sultan, and [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]], Suleiman’s chief consort and first [[haseki sultan]]. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between [[Sultanate of Women]], as the position of main consort eroded over the course of 17th century, the main consort lost the title "sultan", which replaced by "kadin", a title related to the earlier "khatun". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title "sultan".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last = Peirce|first = Leslie P.|publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc.|year = 1993|isbn = 0-19-507673-7|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title ''valide'' carried before or after given name. According to a genealogical website, the formal way of addressing a ''valide'' is ''Devletlû İsmetlu'' (given name) ''Vâlide Sultân Aliyyetü'ş-Şân Hazretleri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey.htm |title=RoyalArk-Turkey |accessdate=2006-09-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020418161219/http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Turkey/turkey.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many westerner often translated their official title, ''sultan'', to title which not exist in Ottoman royalti officially, ''[[Sultana (title)|sultana]]'', possibly for distinguished them from Ottoman ruler and other male member of Ottoman dynasty.

== Role and position ==
[[File:De sultane-moeder.jpeg|thumb|225px|An [[Eighteenth Century]] painting of a Valide Sultan by [[Jean Baptiste Vanmour]].]]
Valide sultan was perhaps the most important position in the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the sultan himself. As the mother to the sultan, by [[Islam]]ic tradition ("A mother's right is God's right"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Love-Family/Holidays/Mothers-Day/Can-Muslims-Celebrate-Mothers-Day.aspx?p=2# |title=Muslims can celebrate Mothers Day because honoring your mother comes right after worshipping God. |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the valide sultan would have a significant influence on the affairs of the empire. She had great power in the court and her own rooms (always adjacent to her son's) and state staff.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt; Valide sultan also traditionally had access to considerable economic resources and often funded major architectural projects. In particular during the 17th century, in a period known as the "[[Sultanate of Women]]", a series of incompetent or child sultans raised the role of the valide sultan to new heights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Peirce|Peirce, Leslie P.]], ''The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0-19-508677-5}} (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful and well-known of all valide sultans in the history of the Ottoman Empire were [[Nurbanu Sultan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=the+most+powerful+valide+sultan&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNxpDXrvDWAhXHNhoKHQ5oDGAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=nurbanu&amp;f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Safiye Sultan]], [[Kösem Sultan]] and [[Turhan Hatice Sultan]].

Most harem women who were slaves were never formally married to the sultans. Nevertheless, their children were considered fully legitimate under [[Sharia|Islamic law]] if recognized by the father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Montgomery-Massingberd |editor-first=Hugh |editor-link=Hugh Massingberd |title=Burke's Royal Families of the World |volume=Volume II: Africa &amp; the Middle East |year=1980 |publisher=Burke's Peerage |location=London |isbn=978-0-85011-029-6 |page=238 |chapter=The Imperial Family of Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; However , only very few harem women who became Valide Sultans upon their son's ascension to the throne were indeed freed from slavery and married to their spouses , the former Ottoman Sultans. These Sultanas were [[Nurbanu Sultan]] , [[Kösem Sultan]] and [[Emetullah Rabia Gülnuş Sultan|Rabia Gülnuş Sultan]].

== List of Valide Sultans ==
The list does not include the complete [[list of mothers of the Ottoman sultans]]. Most who held the title of valide sultan were the biological mothers of the reigning sultans. The mothers who died before their sons' accession to throne, never assumed the title of ''valide sultan'', like [[Hürrem Sultan]], [[Muazzez Sultan]], [[Mihrişah Kadın]], [[Şermi Kadın]], [[Tirimüjgan Kadın]], [[Gülcemal Kadın]], and [[Gülüstü Hanım]]. In special cases, there were grandmothers and stepmothers of the reigning sultans who assumed the title of ''valide sultan'', like [[Kösem Sultan]] and [[Perestu Kadın]].

=== Exceptional cases ===
Normally, living mother of reigning sultan held title Valide Sultan. But in exceptional cases, there were women who didn't hold this title when their sons became Sultan.

Apparently, Mahfiruz fell into disfavour, was banished from the palace at some point before Osman's accession, and never recovered her status. Banishment in disgrace would explain both Mahfiruz's absence from the palace and her burial in the popular shrine of Eyüb rather than in her husband's tomb. The Venetian ambassador Contarini reported in 1612 that the sultan had a beating administered to a woman who had irritated Kösem, perhaps this woman was Mahfiruz&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Zalman Aran''' ({{lang-he|זלמן ארן}}, 1 March 1899 – 6 September 1970) was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] activist, educator and [[Israel]]i politician.

==Biography==
Aran was born '''Zalman Aharonowitz''' in 1899 in Yuzovka in the [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]]), and received a religious education in a [[heder]]. He later studied agriculture in [[Kharkov]].&lt;ref name="agency" /&gt; In his youth, he was active in [[Tze'irei Zion]], and in 1917 became a member of the "Self-Defense Organization Committee" of the movement. He worked as a teacher and a statistician from 1918 to 1923. In 1920, after the party split, he joined the Zionist Socialists and was a member of its secret Central Committee from 1924 to 1925.

In 1926, he immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], where he joined the [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] Party. He worked in building and road construction. In 1930, after Ahdut HaAvoda merged into [[Mapai]], he was appointed the new party's General Secretary in [[Tel Aviv]]. From 1936 to 1947 he worked in the [[Histadrut]] Executive Committee as Treasurer and Director of the Information Department, and was one of the founders of the School for Histadrut Activists. He also became a member of the Zionist Executive Committee in 1946 and a member of its Presidium in 1948.

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|1949]] he was elected to the [[Knesset]], and was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951]], [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|1955]], [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959]], [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965]]. He chaired of [[Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee]], and was also a member of the House Committee. In 1953 he was appointed [[Minister without Portfolio]] and, in 1954, [[Transportation Minister of Israel|Minister of Transportation]]. From 1955 to 1960 and again from 1963 to 1969, he was [[Education Minister of Israel|Minister of Education and Culture]].

As Israel's Minister of Education, he introduced "Jewish Identity" and Jewish tradition into the curriculum and promoted the expansion of technical education. In 1955, the Knesset accepted his reform program for the Israeli education system and his demands for a secondary education diploma,&lt;ref name=agency/&gt; as well as extension of Israel's compulsory education Law to the ages of 14 to 16.&lt;ref name="cms" /&gt; He also promoted the integration of children from different backgrounds into the same schools to accelerate Israel's melting-pot ideal and cut down socio-economic gaps in the Israeli society,&lt;ref name="cidor" /&gt; including recreational activities for [[development town]] residents.&lt;ref name="yanow" /&gt;

As a government minister in 1967, he initially supported the majority position which sought a diplomatic solution to [[Egypt]]'s closure of the [[Straits of Tiran]], rather than a pre-emptive strike, which he also felt posed a great risk to the home front and the [[Israeli Air Force]].&lt;ref name="oren" /&gt; He also opposed the occupation of [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="benziman" /&gt;

He died in 1970. The [[Tel Aviv University]] School of History and the central library of the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] were named after him, as were several schools in Israel.
