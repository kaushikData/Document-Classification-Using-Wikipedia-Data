      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16583">The '''2010 gang rapes in Cleveland, Texas''' were a series of acts of [[sexual violence]] committed by a group of adult men and teenage boys on an [[Minor (law)#United States|underage]] girl in the town of [[ Cleveland, Texas|Cleveland]], in [[Texas]], USA.
==Background==
The victim was the 11-year old daughter of [[Mexicans|Mexican]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]], living in [[Cleveland, Texas]], a "timber town"&lt;ref name=worst&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jarboe Russell|first1=Jan|date=July 2011 |title=The Worst Hard Time |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-worst-hard-time/ |dead-url=no |work=[[Texas Monthly]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of about nine thousand people in the  [[Greater Houston]] metropolitan area and [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty&amp;nbsp;County]]. Her father was a former [[construction worker]], unemployed at the time for a year and a half because of a back injury, while her mother was working making change in a [[Slot machine|slot game room]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The group of perpetrators included students at the local high school, two of whom were members of the basketball team and one the son of a school-board member, and persons with [[criminal record]]s, from [[Recreational drug use|selling drug]]s to [[robbery]] and, in one case, [[manslaughter]]. They ranged from [[Middle_school#United_States|middle school]]ers to one 27-year-old, at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C. |date=8 March 2011 |title=Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/09assault.html?hp |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Discovery==
On the Monday after [[Thanksgiving]] day, on 29 November 2010, a [[cell phone]] [[video clip]] with images of the sexual encounter between a group of males and a young female circulated in the cafeteria of Cleveland's high school. Some viewers recognized the girl as a [[Sixth grade#United States|6th grade]]r from the middle school next door.&lt;ref name=gq&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobie|first1=Kathie |date=6 September 2011 |title=The Girl from Trails End|url=https://www.gq.com/story/texas-gang-rape-11-year-old-girl-story|dead-url=no |work=[[GQ]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of the girl told a teacher what he had seen in the cell-phone video, as a school-district spokeswoman subsequently stated, and the police were alerted.&lt;ref name=sloppy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Williams|first1=Mary Elizabeth |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ sloppy, slanted child rape story |url=https://www.salon.com/2011/03/09/new_york_times_blames_11_year_old_rape_victim/|dead-url=no |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Investigation==
Police investigators identified and contacted the girl, whereupon she stated that, over the 2010 Thanksgiving holiday break, she was raped by a group of young men first at a house and then in a [[mobile home]]. According to a [[search warrant]] [[affidavit]] obtained by the media, police determined the video clip was recorded inside an abandoned mobile home on the city's northern outskirts, next to a [[Baptist church]].&lt;ref name=arrested&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lozano|first1=Juan A. |date=9 March 2011 |title=18 arrested in assaults on 11-year-old Texas girl|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41993963/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/arrested-assaults--year-old-texas-girl/#.W7cNP2j7Tcu|dead-url=no |work=[[NBC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the subsequent, criminal [[indictment]]s, the girl was assaulted on four separate occasions: the first in September, followed by three more throughout the fall of 2010. In January 2011, she was removed by [[social worker]]s from her parents' home and taken to [[foster care]].&lt;ref name=gq/&gt;

The investigation stirred [[Racism in the United States|racial tensions]] on account of the defendants all being [[African-American]]s and the girl [[Hispanic]],&lt;ref name=period&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hopper|first1=Jessica |date=18 March 2011 |title=Texas Girl Allegedly Gang Raped Over Three Month Period |url=https://abcnews.go.com/US/cleveland-texas-girl-allegedly-raped-multiple-times-court/story?id=13167326|work=[[ABC News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the town and nationwide.&lt;ref name=appear&gt;{{cite news |last1=Martinez|first1=Edecio |date=5 April 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas gang rape suspects appear in court |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cleveland-texas-gang-rape-suspects-appear-in-court/|work=[[CBS News]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was publicized nationwide in the States and also abroad.&lt;ref name=paris&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vely|first1=Yannick|date=9 March 2011 |title=Le Viol Collectif qui choque l’Amérique|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Actu/International/Le-viol-collectif-qui-choque-l-Amerique-146689|dead-url=no|language=French|trans-title=The Gang Rape that shocked America |work=[[Paris Match]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|author-link=Hadley Freeman|date=3 September 2013 |title=The painful lesson of the Cherice Moralez rape trial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/03/painful-lesson-cherice-moralez-rape|dead-url=no |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 4 April 2011,  nineteen defendants appeared in the court of [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty County]] district judge Mark Morefield for their [[arraignment]] hearing, with six of them pleading "not guilty."&lt;ref name=appear/&gt;

==Support for the accused==
The ''[[New York Times]]''' first report&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt; focused on the impact of the crime on the Cleveland community.&lt;ref group=note&gt;On the 8 March NYT article, a hospital worker, who said she knew several of the defendants, was quoted: “It’s just destroyed our community. These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.” Also quoted was the spokeswoman for the Cleveland Independent School District: “It’s devastating, and it’s really tearing our community apart. I really wish that this could end in a better light.” There were also quotes from local people who questioned the attitude of the victim's family, such as a neighbor of her parents: "Where was her mother? What was her mother thinking?”&lt;/ref&gt; The report came under criticism for its alleged "sympathy" for the accused,&lt;ref name=mj&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCleland|first1=Mac |date=9 March 2011 |title=The New York Times’ Rape-Friendly Reporting|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/new-york-times-texas-rape/|dead-url=no |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nymag&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amira|first1=Dan |date=11 March 2011 |title=A Lot of People in Cleveland, Texas, Blame 11-Year-Old for Being Raped|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] ''magazine'' |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite news |last1= Cobb|first1= William Jelani|author-link=William Jelani Cobb|date=29 March 2011 |title=Cleveland, Texas and Gender Jim Crow |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The Nation]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where the newspaper sent another reporter back at the place&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brisbane|first1=Arthur S.|date=11 March 2011 |title=Gang Rape Story Lacked Balance |url=https://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/gang-rape-story-lacked-balance/?smid=fb-nytimes|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published a self-critical article.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The 11 March NYT article stated: "The outrage [against the previous NYT report] is understandable. The story dealt with a hideous crime but addressed concerns about the ruined lives of the perpetrators without acknowledging the obvious: concern for the victim. While the story appeared to focus on the community’s reaction to the crime, it was not enough to simply report that the community is principally concerned about the boys and men involved – as this story seems to do. If indeed that is the only sentiment to be found in this community...it becomes important to report... as well [of] voices of professional authorities or dissenting community members who will at least address, and not ignore, the plight of the young girl involved."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quanell X]], [[community leader]] and head of the [[New Black Panthers]], was an "outspoken critic" of the  victim. In a [[press conference]] in front of a Cleveland church, he [[rhetorical question|asked rhetorically]] where the girl's parents were when this happened and why was "that child experiencing so much sex with so many African-American men." He also disputed the rape claims since, as he put it, the girl never actually yelled the word "rape" during the assault and did not make an "outcry" until after footage of the assault surfaced.&lt;ref group=note&gt;According to the ''[[Houston Press]]'' 2014 report, Quanell X  claimed the investigation into the rape was being "run by the [[KKK]]" and stated to the [[African American]] community of the town: "We do not want someone with a malicious, racist motive to rid your community of an entire generation of black men."&lt;/ref&gt; The media reported that the audience "cheered and hollered in agreement."&lt;ref name=cheered&gt;{{cite news |last1=Leicht|first1=Angelica|date=19 December 2014 |title=Why Does Quanell X Support Some Rape Victims But Shame Others?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/03/a_lot_of_people_in_cleveland_t.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Press]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florida]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] [[Kathleen Passidomo]] proposed that the state should step in and regulate the wardrobe of young girls.&lt;ref name=pasidomo&gt;{{cite news |last1=Linkins|first1=Jason|date=13 March 2011 |title=In Wake Of Texas Gang Rape, Florida Lawmaker Proposes School Dress Code Legislation|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/texas-gang-rape-aftermath-florida-law_n_836841.html|dead-url=no |work=[[Huffington Post]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasidomo referred to "an article about an 11 year old girl who was gang-raped in Texas by 18 young men because she was dressed like a 21-year-old [[prostitute]].”&lt;ref group=note&gt;Passidomo claimed that "it’s incumbent upon [the state] to create some areas where students can be safe in school and show up in proper attire, so what happened in Texas doesn’t happen to [Florida's] students.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
In Texas, [[sexual assault]] against a [[Minor (law)#United States|person under 17 years of age]] is a second degree [[felony]], and [[aggravated sexual assault]] a first degree felony.&lt;ref name=texaslaw&gt;{{cite web |url=https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm|title=Penal Code - Title 5, Chapter 22: Assaultive Offenses|publisher=[[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] |date=October 2017 |website=|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, twenty-one persons were charged with crimes related to the gang rape.&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite news |date=21 September 2012 |title=Texas: Four Get 15-Year Sentences in Gang Rape of 11-Year-Old Girl|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/us/four-sentenced-in-gang-rape-of-11-year-old-texas-girl.html|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=Associated Press|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two adult males requested trials, and juries handed each defendant a 99-year prison sentence. Eleven other adult males pleaded guilty to the charges against them and received 15-year sentences in exchange. All seven juveniles entered guilty pleas and received seven-year [[Probation|probated prison-sentences]].&lt;ref name=final&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=11 October 2013|title=21st assailant sentenced in Cleveland gang rape|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/21st-assailant-sentenced-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-4889262.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-first and last defendant pleaded guilty after a year long investigation whereby a [[DNA profiling|DNA specimen]] identified him as being at the [[crime scene]]. The defendant received a reduced seven-year sentence in exchange for pleading guilty to [[Indecent exposure|indecently exposing]] himself to a child. All defendants sentenced to prison would be [[Sex offender registry|registered]] as [[sex offender]]s for ten years after completing the sentence.&lt;ref name=final/&gt;

==Aftermath==
When the investigation started, the victim's family moved to another town after police detectives told the parents that they were in danger,&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite news |last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|last2=Goode|first2=Erica |date=28 March 2011 |title=3-Month Nightmare Emerges in Rape Inquiry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/us/29texas.html |dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|access-date=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the  girl who was reported as raped was placed by the [[Child Protective Services]] in the care of the Girls' Haven in [[Beaumont, Texas]]. In December 2011, she ran away from the residential facility and was "on the streets for about a week," as the [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]] prosecutor stated. He revealed that, at some point, she met a 30-year-old male with a prior conviction as a drug dealer in [[Fort Bend County]], who subsequently assaulted her at his apartment in Beaumont. The assailant was arrested and pleaded guilty in September 2012 to aggravated sexual assault of a child in exchange for deferred [[probation]].&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite news |last=Horswell  |first=Cindy   |date=29 December 2012|title=Defendant in Cleveland gang rape case gets life sentence|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Defendant-in-Cleveland-gang-rape-case-gets-life-4073766.php|dead-url=no |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the girl revealed she was pregnant, allegedly from her "15-year old boyfriend," and that they would keep the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=   |date=22 May 2013|title=Girl, 14, now pregnant — was victim at age 11 of repeated gang rape|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/girl-14-pregnant-victim-age-11-repeated-gang-rape-article-1.1351930|dead-url=no |work=[[The New York Daily News]] |location= |archiveurl= |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
{{Disability}}'''Ableism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|b|ə|l|ɪ|z|əm}}; also known as '''ablism''',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, "Oxford Dictionaries Online: 'ableism'", ''Oxford Dictionaries Online'', Retrieved 12 March 201h.&lt;/ref&gt; '''disablism''' (Brit. English), '''anapirophobia''', '''anapirism''', and '''disability discrimination''') is [[discrimination]] and social [[prejudice]] against people with [[disabilities]]. Ableism characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the non-disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Linton, Simi (1998). ''Claiming Disability Knowledge and Identity''. New York: New York University Press. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, people are assigned or denied certain perceived abilities, skills, or [[character orientation]]s.

There are stereotypes associated with various disabilities. These [[stereotype]]s in turn serve as a justification for ableist practices and reinforce discriminatory [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behavior]]s toward people who are disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Wüllenweber, Ernst; Theunissen, Georg; Mühl, Heinz (2006). ''Pädagogik bei geistigen Behinderungen: ein Handbuch für Studium und Praxis (Education for intellectual disabilities: A manual for study and practice)'' (in German). W. Kohlhammer Verlag. p. 149. {{ISBN|3-17-018437-7}}. Retrieved January 17, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Labeling affects people when it limits their options for action or changes their identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Geistige Behinderung - Normtheorien nach Speck und Goffman". Heilpaedagogik-info.de. Retrieved 2014-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ableist societies, people with disabilities are viewed as less valuable, or even less than human. The [[eugenics]] movement of the early 20th century could be considered an example of widespread ableism. The mass murder of disabled in Nazi Germany's [[Aktion T4]] could be an extreme example of ableism.

==Etymology==
Originated from -able (in disable, disabled) and plus [[-ism]]; first known use in 1985-1990.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ableism.  Merriam-Webster. n.d. Retrieved 2018-02-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ableism . Dictionary.com. n.d. Retrieved 2018-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Germany ===
[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] signed the secret euthanasia program decree, [[Aktion T4]], in 1939 that allowed the killing of selected patients with chronic neurological, psychiatric disorders. This program took the lives of about 70,000 men, women and children with disabilities; this program was officially halted by Hitler in 1941 under public pressure but was continued unofficially out of the public eye, taking an additional 200,000 until the fall of Hitler's reign in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.britannica.com/event/T4-Program retrieved 2018-04-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, disability discrimination became unlawful as a result of the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], and the [[Disability Discrimination Act 2005]]. These were later repealed, but the substantive law is replicated in the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Under the [[Equality Act 2010]] there are several types of discrimination that are prohibited. These are direct discrimination (s.13(1) [[Equality Act 2010]]), indirect discrimination (s.6 and s.19 [[Equality Act 2010]], [[harassment]] (s.26 [[Equality Act 2010]]), [[victimisation]] (s.27(2) Equality Act 2010), discrimination arising from disability (s.15(1) [[Equality Act 2010]] and failure to make reasonable adjustments (s.20 [[Equality Act 2010]]).

The legal definition of disability used in the law is:

''"A person (P) has a disability if P has a physical or mental impairment, and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities".''(Section 6(1), [[Equality Act 2010]])

Some conditions (such as blindness, [[AIDS]] and cancer) are included; others (such as drug and alcohol addictions) are excluded.

===United States===
Before the 1800s, perspective of disability was often in a religious lens. Individuals with disability were seen as evil or possessed by the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ableism123edu/history|title=History Perspective of Ableism in America|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=looks to be a self-published site?|date=June 2018}} Much like many minority groups, disabled Americans were often [[wikt:segregated|segregated]] and denied certain rights for a majority of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knightpoliticalreporting.syr.edu/?civilhistoryessays=a-civil-rights-history-americans-with-disabilities|title=A Civil Rights History: Americans with Disabilities|last=Faville|first=Andrea|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s shift from a religious view to a more scientific view took place and caused more individuals with disabilities to be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccj.org/ableism|title=Ableism|last=|first=|date=|website=NCCJ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public stigma began to change after [[World War II]] when many Americans returned home with disabilities and physical handicaps. In the 1960s, following the [[Civil rights movement|civil rights movement]] in America, the world began the [[Disability rights movement|disabled rights movement]]. The movement was intended to give all individuals with disabilities equal rights and opportunities. Until the 1970s, ableism in the [[United States]] was often codified into law. For example, in many jurisdictions, so-called "[[ugly law]]s" barred people from appearing in public if they had diseases or disfigurements that were considered unsightly.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.rootedinrights.org/the-ugly-laws-disability-in-public/ Retrieved 2018-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ====

Section 504 and other sections of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] enacted into law certain [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] penalties for failing to make public places comply with access codes known as the ADA Access Guidelines (ADAAG). These laws prohibit direct discrimination against disabled people in government programs, employment, public transit and public accommodations like stores and restaurants.

==== Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act ====
The [[Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act]] was passed to promote the fundamental right to vote by improving access for [[handicapped]] and [[elderly]] individuals to registration facilities and polling places for Federal elections by requiring access to polling places used in [[Federal elections in the United States|Federal elections]] and available registration and voting aids, such as instructions in large type &lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm Retrieved 2018-03-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 ====
The federal [[Fair Housing Act (United States)|Fair Housing Amendments Act]] of 1988 prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of disability and requires that newly constructed multi-family housing meet certain access guidelines while requiring landlords to allow disabled persons to modify existing dwellings for accessibility.

==== Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ====
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) was passed in on July 26, 1990 by the [[George H. W. Bush]] administration and amended on January 1, 2009. The act gave individuals with disabilities civil rights protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov|title=ADA.gov homepage|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ====
The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) is a four-part (A-D) piece of American legislation that ensures students with a disability are provided with [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE) that is tailored to their individual needs. IDEA was previously known as the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (EHA) from 1975 to 1990. In 1990, the United States Congress reauthorized EHA and changed the title to IDEA (Public Law No. 94-142). Overall, the goal of IDEA is to provide children with disabilities the same opportunity for education as those students who do not have a disability.

=== Workplace ===

In 1990, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] was put in place to prohibit private employers, state and local government, employment agencies and labor unions from discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in job applications, when hiring, firing, advancement in workplace, compensation, training, and on other terms, conditions and privileges of employment.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.ada.gov/ada_title_I.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], also known as the EEOC also plays a part in fighting against ableism by being responsible for enforcing federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/&lt;/ref&gt; Despite legislation to reduce disability discrimination, roughly 13.3 million Americans with disabilities report difficulty finding a job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/ableism123edu/facts|title=Facts About Institutional Ableism|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schools ===
Ableism often makes the world unwelcoming, and inaccessible to people with disabilities—especially in schools. An ableist would assert that children with disabilities need to assimilate to normative culture. For example, a student who experiences a disability needs to read text instead of listening to a tape recording of the text. In the past, schools focused too much on fixing the disability, but due to progressive reforms, school’s goals are centered on minimizing the impact of a student’s disability, and giving support, skills, and opportunities to live a full life. Moreover, schools must maximize access to the school community as whole.&lt;ref&gt;IDEA. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://sites.ed.gov/idea/about-idea/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Congress made into law the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]], which states that free and appropriate education is eligible to children with disabilities with insurance of necessary services.&lt;ref&gt;Hehir, T. (2007). Confronting Ableism. Educational Leadership, 64(5), 8-14. Retrieved May 2, 2018, from http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/feb07/vol64/num05/Confronting-Ableism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Congress later amended the law, in 2015, to include the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which guarantees equal opportunity for people with disabilities full participation in society, and the tools for overall independent success.

=== Media ===

Disabilities are not only misrepresented in the media but often underepresented as well. These common ways{{which|date=August 2018}} of framing disability are heavily criticized for being dehumanizing and failing to place importance on the perspectives of persons with disabilities. While roughly 20 percent of the population is disabled, only 2 percent of characters played in television and film have a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rudermanfoundation.org/white_papers/the-ruderman-white-paper-on-the-challenge-to-create-more-authentic-disability-casting-and-representation-on-tv/|title=The Ruderman White Paper on the Challenge to Create More Authentic Disability Casting and Representation on TV|work=Ruderman Family Foundation|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 95 percent of the time, disabled characters are played by actors and actresses who are not disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woodburn|first=Danny|date=July 2016|title=THE RUDERMAN WHITE PAPER ON EMPLOYMENT OF ACTORS WITH DISABILITIES IN TELEVISION|url=http://www.rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TV-White-Paper_7-1-003.pdf|journal=Ruderman Family Foundation|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruderman Family Foundation is a [[Private foundation|private philanthropic foundation]] established in 2002 in [[Boston]], USA, managed by the [[Jay Ruderman|Ruderman family]]. The foundation operates in America and in [[Israel]] in two main areas: [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] of people with [[disabilities]] in society and strengthening the relationship between Israel and the [[American Jewish]] community, while promoting strategic [[philanthropy]] and expanding circles of giving and involvement. The foundation has released a series of papers discussing various disability studies including disability in the media.

==== Disabled villain ====

One common form of media depiction of disability is to portray villains with a mental or physical disability. Lindsey Row-Heyveld notes, for instance, “that villainous pirates are scraggly, wizened, and inevitably kitted out with a peg leg, eye patch, or hook hand whereas heroic pirates look like Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow.”&lt;ref&gt;Row-Heyveld, Lindsey (2015). [http://pedagogy.dukejournals.org/content/15/3/519.full.pdf "Reading Batman, Writing X-Men Superpowers and Disabilities in the First-Year Seminar"] (PDF). ''Pedagogy: Critical Approaches to Teaching Literature, Language, Composition, and Culture''. '''15''' (3). [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[[doi:10.1215/15314200-2917105|10.1215/15314200-2917105]]. Retrieved April 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The disability of the villain is meant to separate them from the average viewer and dehumanize the antagonist. As a result, stigma forms surrounding the disability and the individuals that live with it.

==== Inspiration porn ====

[[Inspiration porn]] is the use of people with disabilities as a form of inspiration when performing ordinary tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stella Young|Young, Stella]]. "Stella Young: I'm not your inspiration, thank you very much | TED Talk". TED.com. Retrieved 2015-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of inspiration porn say that it distances people with disabilities from able-bodied individuals and portrays disability as an obstacle to overcome or rehab.&lt;ref&gt;Rakowitz, Rebecca. "Inspiration porn: A look at the objectification of the disabled community | The Crimson White". ''The Crimson White''. University of Alabama. Retrieved 5 March2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Kate (17 July 2017). "On Inspiration Porn". ''Huffington Post''. Retrieved 5 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Pitied Character ====

In many forms of media such as films and articles a person who experiences disability is portrayed as a character who is viewed as less than able, different and an 'outcast'. Hayes &amp; Black (2003)[http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/419/585] explore Hollywood films as the discourse of pity towards disability as a problem of social, physical and emotional confinement. The aspect of pity is heightened through the storylines of media focusing on the individuals weaknesses as opposed to strengths and therefore leaving audiences a negative and ableist portrayal towards disability.

=== Sports ===

[[File:Paralympic Runner.jpg|thumb|A runner in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games]]

Sports are often an area of society in which ableism is evident. In sports media, athletes with disabilities are often portrayed to be inferior.&lt;ref&gt;DePauw, K. P. (1997). The (in)visibility of disability: Cultural contexts and ‘‘sporting bodies.’’ ''Quest'', 49, 416–430.&lt;/ref&gt; When athletes with disabilities are discussed in the media, there is often an emphasis on rehabilitation and the road to recovery, which is inherently a negative view on the disability.&lt;ref&gt;Cherney, J. L., Lindemann, K., &amp; Hardin, M. (2015). Research in communication, disability, and sport. ''Communication &amp; Sport'', ''3''(1), 8-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Pistorius]] is a South African runner who competed in the [[2004 Summer Paralympics|2004]], [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]], and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|2012 Paralympics]] and the [[2012 Olympic games]] in London. Oscar was the first double [[Amputation|amputee]] athlete to compete in the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Klemko (10 August 2012), "Oscar Pistorius makes history, leaves without medal", ''USA Today'', archived from the original on 11 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While media coverage focused on inspiration and competition during his time in the Paralympic games, it shifted to questioning whether his prosthetic legs gave him an advantage while competing in the Olympic games.&lt;ref&gt;Swartz, L., &amp; Watermeyer, B. (2008). Cyborg anxiety: Oscar Pistorius and the boundaries of what it means to be human. ''Disability &amp; Society'', ''23''(2), 187-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L. R. (2015).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1172">'''Abu al-Qasim al-Habib Neishaburi''' was a Persian physician from [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] who lived before 1750CE. His name indicates he was from [[Nishapur]].

He is known to have written two Arabic treatises on Prophetic medicine. One is in a unique copy now at The [[National Library of Medicine]], copied in 1792CE, and the other is preserved in a unique copy now in [[Los Angeles]] that was copied in 1750CE.

Therefore, the author must have been active before 1750CE. Since he cites amongst his authorities Ibn Shahin, who composed his major work in 1453CE, we know that Naysaburi must have been active after the mid-15th century.

Nothing else is known about this author.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18584">'''Action selection''' is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In [[artificial intelligence]] and computational [[cognitive science]], "the action selection problem" is typically associated with [[intelligent agents]] and [[animat]]s—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an [[agent environment]]. The term is also sometimes used in [[ethology]] or animal behavior.

One problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an "act". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from ''contracting a muscle cell'' to ''provoking a war''. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.

Most researchers working in this field place high demands on their agents: 
* The acting [[Intelligent agent|agent]] typically must select its action in [[agent environment|dynamic]] and [[agent environment|unpredictable]] environments. 
* The agents typically act in [[Real-time computing|real time]]; therefore they must make decisions in a timely fashion.
* The agents are normally created to perform several different tasks. These tasks may conflict for resource allocation (e.g. can the agent put out a fire and deliver a cup of coffee at the same time?)
* The environment the agents operate in may include [[humans]], who may make things more difficult for the agent (either intentionally or by attempting to assist.) 
* The agents themselves are often intended to [[computer model|model]] animals or humans, and animal/human [[behaviour]] is quite complicated.

For these reasons action selection is not trivial and attracts a good deal of research.

== Characteristics of the action selection problem ==

The main problem for action selection is [[complexity]]. Since all [[computation]] takes both time and space (in memory), agents cannot possibly consider every option available to them at every instant in time. Consequently, they must be [[bias]]ed, and constrain their search in some way. For AI, the question of action selection is ''what is the best way to constrain this search''? For biology and ethology, the question is ''how do various types of animals constrain their search? Do all animals use the same approaches? Why do they use the ones they do?''

One fundamental question about action selection is whether it is really a problem at all for an agent, or whether it is just a description of an [[emergence|emergent]] property of an intelligent agent's behavior. However, if we consider how we are going to build an intelligent agent, then it becomes apparent there must be ''some'' mechanism for action selection. This mechanism may be highly distributed (as in the case of distributed organisms such as [[social insect]] colonies or [[slime mold]]) or it may be a special-purpose module.

The action selection mechanism (ASM) determines not only the agent’s actions in terms of impact on the world, but also directs its perceptual [[attention]], and updates its [[memory]]. These [[egocentric]] sorts of actions may in turn result in modifying the agents basic behavioural capacities, particularly in that updating memory implies some form of [[machine learning]] is possible. Ideally, action selection itself should also be able to learn and adapt, but there are many problems of [[combinatorics|combinatorial complexity]] and computational [[tractable problem|tractability]] that may require restricting the search space for learning.

In AI, an ASM is also sometimes either referred to as an [[agent architecture]] or thought of as a substantial part of one.

== AI mechanisms ==

Generally, artificial action selection mechanisms can be divided into several categories: [[automated planning and scheduling|symbol-based systems]] sometimes known as classical planning, [[distributed systems|distributed solutions]], and reactive or [[reactive planning|dynamic planning]]. Some approaches do not fall neatly into any one of these categories. Others are really more about providing [[scientific model]]s than practical AI control; these last are described further in the next section.

=== Symbolic approaches ===
{{main|Automated planning and scheduling}}
Early in the [[history of artificial intelligence]], it was assumed that the best way for an agent to choose what to do next would be to compute a [[Logical argument|probably optimal]] plan, and then execute that plan. This led to the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis, that a physical agent that can manipulate symbols is [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient]] for intelligence. Many [[software agents]] still use this approach for action selection. It normally requires describing all sensor readings, the world, all of ones actions and all of one's goals in some form of [[predicate logic]]. Critics of this approach complain that it is too slow for real-time planning and that, despite the proofs, it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to logic is a process prone to errors.

[[Satisficing]] is a decision-making strategy which attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than identify an optimal solution. A satisficing strategy may often, in fact, be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus.

'''Goal driven architectures''' – In these [[symbol]]ic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. Each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. The agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. The plan can expand to subgoals, which makes the process slightly recursive. Technically, more or less, the plans exploits condition-rules. These architectures are [[reactive planning|reactive]] or hybrid. Classical examples of goal driven architectures are implementable refinements of [[BDI software agent|belief-desire-intention]] architecture like [http://www.marcush.net/IRS/irs_downloads.html JAM] or [http://urtax.ms.mff.cuni.cz/ive/public/about.php IVE].  

=== Distributed approaches ===

In contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one "box" in the agent which decides the next action. At least in their idealized form, distributed systems have many [[Module (programming)|modules]] running in parallel and determining the best action based on local expertise. In these idealized systems, overall coherence is expected to emerge somehow, possibly through careful design of the interacting components. This approach is often inspired by [[artificial neural networks]] research. In practice, there is almost always ''some'' centralised system determining which module is "the most active" or has the most salience. There is evidence real biological brains also have such [[Executive system|executive decision systems]] which evaluate which of the competing systems deserves the most [[attention]], or more properly, has its desired actions [[disinhibited]].
* [[ASMO (cognitive architecture)|ASMO]] is an attention-based architecture developed by Rony Novianto. It orchestrates a diversity of modular distributed processes that can use their own representations and techniques to perceive the environment, process information, plan actions and propose actions to perform.
*Various types of [[Winner-take-all in action selection|winner-take-all]] architectures, in which the single selected action takes full control of the motor system
* '''Spreading activation''' including [[Maes Nets (ANA)]]
* '''Extended Rosenblatt &amp; Payton''' is a spreading activation architecture developed by Toby Tyrrell in 1993. The agent's behaviour is stored in the form of a hierarchical [[connectionist|connectionism]] network, which Tyrrell named free-flow hierarchy. Recently exploited for example by [http://vrlab.epfl.ch/Publications/pdf/Sevin_Thalmann_CGI_05.pdf de Sevin &amp; Thalmann] (2005) or [http://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/gerstner/eth/download/dpdk2.pdf Kadleček] (2001).
* '''[[Behavior based AI]]''', was a response to the slow speed of robots using symbolic action selection techniques. In this form, separate modules respond to different stimuli and generate their own responses. In the original form, the [[subsumption architecture]], these consisted of different layers which could monitor and suppress each other's inputs and outputs.
* '''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]''' are virtual pets from a computer game driven by three-layered [[artificial neural network|neural network]], which is adaptive. Their mechanism is reactive since the network at every time step determines the task that has to be performed by the pet. The network is described well in the paper of [http://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/~vishnu/gameResearch/AI/creatures.pdf Grand et al.] (1997) and in [http://www.double.co.nz/creatures/ The Creatures Developer Resources]. See also the [http://creatureswiki.net/ Creatures Wiki].

=== Dynamic planning approaches ===

Because purely distributed systems are difficult to construct, many researchers have turned to using explicit hard-coded plans to determine the priorities of their system.

Dynamic or [[reactive planning]] methods compute just one next action in every instant based on the current context and pre-scripted plans. In contrast to classical planning methods, reactive or dynamic approaches do not suffer [[combinatorial explosion]]. On the other hand, they are sometimes seen as too rigid to be considered [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]], since the plans are coded in advance. At the same time, natural intelligence can be rigid in some contexts although it is fluid and able to adapt in others.

Example dynamic planning mechanisms include:
* '''[[Finite state machine|Finite-state machines]]''' These are [[reactive planning|reactive]] architectures used mostly for computer game agents, in particular for first-person shooters [[Computer game bot|bots]], or for virtual movie actors. Typically, the state-machines are hierarchical. For concrete game examples, see [http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/isla_pfv.htm Halo 2 bots paper] by Damian Isla (2005) or [http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Publications/MSc/2001-VanWaveren-MSc.html the Master's Thesis about Quake III bots] by Jan Paul van Waveren (2001). For a movie example, see [[Softimage]].
* Other '''structured reactive plans''' tend to look a little more like conventional plans, often with ways to represent [[hierarchical]] and [[sequential]] structure. Some, such as PRS's 'acts', have support for [[partial plan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.sri.com/~prs/|title=PRS-CL: A Procedural Reasoning System|author=Karen L. Myers|work=[[Artificial Intelligence Center]]|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many agent architectures from the mid-1990s included such plans as a "middle layer" that provided organization for low-level [[behavior based AI|behavior modules]] while being directed by a higher level real-time planner. Despite this supposed [[interoperability]] with automated planners, most structured reactive plans are hand coded (Bryson 2001, ch. 3). Examples of structured reactive plans include [[James Firby]]'s [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~firby/raps/ RAP] System and the [[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]]'s [http://ai.stanford.edu/users/nilsson/trweb/tr.html Teleo-reactive plans]. PRS, RAPs &amp; TRP are no longer developed or supported. One still-active (as of 2006) descendent of this approach is the Parallel-rooted Ordered Slip-stack Hierarchical (or [http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/web/posh.html POSH]) action selection system, which is a part of Joanna Bryson's Behaviour Oriented Design.

Sometimes to attempt to address the perceived inflexibility of dynamic planning, hybrid techniques are used. In these, a more conventional AI planning system searches for new plans when the agent has spare time, and updates the dynamic plan library when it finds good solutions. The important aspect of any such system is that when the agent needs to select an action, some solution exists that can be used immediately (see further [[anytime algorithm]]).

* [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] is a [[symbol]]ic [[cognitive architecture]]. It is based on condition-action rules known as [[Production system (computer science)|productions]]. Programmers can use the Soar development toolkit for building both reactive and planning agents, or any compromise between these two extremes.

* ABL/Hap
* '''[[Fuzzy control system|Fuzzy architectures]]''' The [[fuzzy logic|Fuzzy approach]] in action selection produces more smooth behaviour than can be produced by architectures exploiting boolean condition-action rules (like Soar or POSH). These architectures are mostly [[reactive planning|reactive]] and [[symbol]]ic.

== Theories of action selection in nature ==

Many dynamic models of artificial action selection were originally inspired by research in [[ethology]]. In particular, [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] provided the idea of an [[innate releasing mechanism]] to explain instinctive behaviors ([[fixed action pattern]]s). Influenced by the ideas of [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], Lorenz developed this into a "[[psychohydraulic]]" model of the [[motivation]] of behavior. In ethology, these ideas were influential in the 1960s, but they are now regarded as outdated because of their use of an [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] metaphor; the [[nervous system]] and the control of behavior are now normally treated as involving information transmission rather than energy flow. Dynamic plans and neural networks are more similar to information transmission, while spreading activation is more similar to the diffuse control of emotional / hormonal systems.

[[Stan Franklin]] has proposed that '''action selection''' is the right perspective to take in understanding the role and evolution of [[mind]].  See his page on [http://www.msci.memphis.edu/~franklin/paradigm.html the action selection paradigm].

'''Alexander''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος}}, ''Aléxandros''; 1 August 1893{{spaced ndash}}25 October 1920){{efn|name=dates}} was [[List of kings of Greece|King of Greece]] from 11 June 1917 until his death three years later, at the age of 27, from the effects of a monkey bite.

The second son of [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]], Alexander was born in the summer palace of [[Tatoi Palace|Tatoi]] on the outskirts of [[Athens]]. He succeeded his father in 1917, during [[Greece during World War I|World War I]], after the [[Entente Powers]] and the followers of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] pushed Constantine I, and his eldest son [[George II of Greece|Crown Prince George]], into exile. Having no real political experience, the new king was stripped of his powers by the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] and effectively imprisoned in his own palace. Venizelos, as prime minister, was the effective ruler with the support of the Entente. Though reduced to the status of a [[puppet monarch|puppet king]], Alexander supported Greek troops during their war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Under his reign, the territorial extent of Greece considerably increased, following the victory of the Entente and their [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the First World War and the early stages of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922]].

Alexander controversially married the commoner [[Aspasia Manos]] in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced the couple to leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic [[Barbary macaque]] and died of [[sepsis]]. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival and contributed to the fall of the Venizelist regime. After a [[Greek legislative election, 1920|general election]] and a [[Greek referendum, 1920|referendum]], Constantine I was restored to the throne.

==Early life==
Alexander was born at [[Tatoi Palace]] on 1 August 1893 (20 July in the [[Julian calendar]]), the second son of [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine of Greece]] of the [[House of Glücksburg]] and his wife [[Sophia of Prussia|Princess Sophia of Prussia]]. He was related to royalty throughout Europe. His father was the eldest son and heir apparent of [[George I of Greece|King George I of Greece]] by his wife [[Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia]]; his mother was the daughter of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III of Germany]] and his wife [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Montgomery-Massingberd, p. 327"&gt;Montgomery-Massingberd, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was a grandson of [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX of Denmark]] and a cousin of both [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]]. Sophia was the sister of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany]], and was also a cousin of King George V through her grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Children of King Constantine.jpg|left|thumb|Alexander and his siblings in 1905. Clockwise from far left: [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Helen]], [[George II of Greece|George]], Alexander, [[Paul of Greece|Paul]] and [[Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta|Irene]]. ([[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Katherine]] was born after this photograph was taken.)]]

Alexander's early life alternated between the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Royal Palace]] in [[Athens]], and Tatoi Palace in the city's suburbs. With his parents he undertook several trips abroad and regularly visited [[Schloss Friedrichshof]], the home of his maternal grandmother, who had a particular affection for her Greek grandson.&lt;ref name=vdk62&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was very close to his younger sister, [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Princess Helen]], Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother [[George II of Greece|George]], with whom he had little in common.&lt;ref name="sdm174"&gt;Sáinz de Medrano, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; While his elder brother was a serious and thoughtful child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother [[Paul of Greece|Paul]] were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.&lt;ref name="vdk62"/&gt;

==Military career==
As his father's second son, Alexander was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, George. His education was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious [[Hellenic Military Academy]], where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity.&lt;ref name="sdm174"/&gt; He was passionate about cars and motors, and was one of the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.&lt;ref name="vdk113"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

He distinguished himself in combat during the [[Greece in the Balkan Wars|Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13.&lt;ref name="sdm174"/&gt; As a young officer, he was stationed, along with his elder brother, in the field staff of his father; and he accompanied the latter at the head of the [[Army of Thessaly]] during the capture of [[Thessaloniki]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; King George I was assassinated in Thessaloniki soon afterwards, and Alexander's father ascended the throne as Constantine I.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtship of Aspasia Manos===
In 1915, at a party held in Athens by court marshal Theodore [[Ypsilantis]], Alexander became re-acquainted with one of his childhood friends, [[Aspasia Manos]]. She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances.&lt;ref name="sdm176"&gt;Sáinz de Medrano, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of Constantine's [[Master of the Horse]],&lt;ref name="vdk117"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten,&lt;ref name="sdm176"/&gt; and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of [[Spetses]] where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons.&lt;ref name="sdm176"/&gt; Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.&lt;ref name="sdm177"&gt;Sáinz de Medrano, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:Constantineiofgreece.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander's father, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], in the uniform of a German field marshal, c. 1913]]

During World War I, Constantine I followed a formal policy of neutrality, yet he was openly benevolent towards [[German Empire|Germany]], which was fighting alongside [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] against the [[Triple Entente]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also become something of a Germanophile following his military training in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the [[Balkans]]. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a [[Movement of National Defence|parallel government to that of the king]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 89–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of Greece were occupied by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]]. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved [[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]] by carrying her through the woods for more than two kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally on 10 June 1917, [[Charles Jonnart]], the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine to give up his power.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; On the threat of Entente forces landing in [[Piraeus]], the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while determined to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father.&lt;ref name="vdk107"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George]],&lt;ref&gt;Bertin, pp. 215, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of [[Crete]] between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Bertin, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.&lt;ref name="vdk107"/&gt;

==Reign==

===Accession===
The dismissal of Constantine was not unanimously supported by the Entente powers; while France and Britain did nothing to stop Jonnart's actions, the [[Russian provisional government]] officially protested to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, pp. 305–307.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petrograd]] demanded that Alexander should not receive the title of king but only that of regent so as to preserve the rights of the deposed sovereign and the Crown Prince. Russia's protests were brushed aside, and Alexander ascended the Greek throne.&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ελευθέριος Βενιζέλος.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eleftherios Venizelos]], Greek revolutionary and prime minister, c. 1919]]
Alexander swore the oath of loyalty to the [[Greek Constitution of 1911|Greek constitution]] on the afternoon of 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the [[Archbishop of Athens]], Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, [[Alexandros Zaimis]], attended.&lt;ref name="vdk108"&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no festivities.&lt;ref name="vdk107"/&gt; The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration.&lt;ref name="vdk108"/&gt; He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a [[regent]], rather than a true monarch.&lt;ref name="vdk107"/&gt;

In the evening, after the ceremony, the royal family decided to leave their palace in Athens for [[Tatoi]], but city residents opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last time that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family.&lt;ref name="vdk113"/&gt; The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of [[Oropos]] and set off into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 110–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puppet king===
With his parents and siblings in exile, Alexander found himself isolated. The royals remained unpopular with the Venizelists, and Entente representatives advised the king's aunts and uncles, particularly [[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Prince Nicholas]], to leave. Eventually, they all followed Constantine into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Royal household staff were gradually replaced by enemies of the former king, and Alexander's allies were either imprisoned or distanced from him. Portraits of the royal family were removed from public buildings, and Alexander's new ministers openly called him the "son of a traitor".&lt;ref name="vdk112"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:232 14 Alexandre raccompagne Alexandre jusqu'au train.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander (centre) shaking hands with prince-regent [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander of Serbia]] on the Macedonian Front, May 1918]]

On 26 June 1917, the king was forced to name Eleftherios Venizelos as head of the government. Despite promises given by the Entente on Constantine's departure, the  previous prime minister, Zaimis, was effectively forced to resign as Venizelos returned to Athens.&lt;ref name="vdk113"/&gt; Alexander immediately opposed his new prime minister's views and, annoyed by the king's rebuffs, Venizelos threatened to remove him and set up a regency council in the name of Alexander's brother Prince Paul, then still a minor. The Entente powers intervened and asked Venizelos to back down, allowing Alexander to retain the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Spied on day and night by the prime minister's supporters, the monarch quickly became a prisoner in his own palace, and his orders went ignored.&lt;ref name="vdk112"/&gt;

Alexander had no experience in affairs of state. However, he was determined to make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could.&lt;ref name="vdk112"/&gt; Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the [[Macedonian front]] to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the [[Central Powers]], and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.&lt;ref name="vdk119"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek expansion===
[[File:Greek history from 1832.GIF|thumb|right|Territorial expansion of Greece between 1832 and 1947]]
[[File:Yunan Ordusunun Edirneye girişi (12 Temmuz 1920).jpg|thumb|Alexander entering [[Adrianople]], 1920]]

By the end of World War I, Greece had grown beyond its 1914 borders, and the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|treaties of Neuilly]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Sèvres|Sèvres]] (1920) confirmed the Greek territorial conquests. The majority of [[Thrace]] (previously split between Bulgaria and Turkey) and several [[Aegean Islands]] (such as [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]]) became part of Greece, and the region of [[Smyrna]], in [[Ionia]], was placed under Greek [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, pp. 382–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's kingdom increased in size by around a third. In Paris, Venizelos took part in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace negotiations]] with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Upon his return to Greece in August 1920, Venizelos received a laurel crown from the king for his work in support of [[panhellenism]].&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite their territorial gains following the Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped to achieve the ''[[Megali Idea]]'' and annex [[Constantinople]] and larger areas of Ottoman [[Asia Minor]]; they invaded [[Anatolia]] beyond Smyrna and sought to take [[Ankara]], with the aim of destroying the Turkish resistance led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] (later known as Atatürk).&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus began the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]]. Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.{{efn|name=Lausanne|The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 redrew the boundary between Turkey and Greece back in favor of Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Driault and Lhéritier, pp. 433–434.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Marriage==

===Controversy===
On 12 June 1917, the day after his accession, Alexander revealed his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait until the end of the war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated.&lt;ref name="vdk113"/&gt; Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.&lt;ref name="vdk118"/&gt;

The ruling dynasty of Greece (the [[House of Glücksburg]]) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia were seen as far too German by the Venizelists, but even though the marriage of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms that it was a foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner.&lt;ref name="ls136"&gt;Llewellyn Smith, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos,&lt;ref name="sdm176"/&gt; the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular in the eyes of the people.&lt;ref name="vdk118"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=opinions|According to [[Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark]], Venizelos "encouraged the marriage [of Alexander and Aspasia] to acquire political advantage for himself and his party by bringing the royal family thus into disrepute."&lt;ref&gt;Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, "Comments by HRH Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark" in: Fleming, Patricia H. (June 1973). "The Politics of Marriage Among Non-Catholic European Royalty". ''[[Current Anthropology]]'', vol. 14, no. 3, p. 246. {{JSTOR|2740765}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Philip Noel-Baker, Baron Noel-Baker#Private life|Irene Noel Baker]] told her father-in-law, British MP [[Joseph Allen Baker]], that Venizelos was "personally in favour of the marriage [but] is sincerely convinced that it will be extremely unpopular".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Llewellyn Smith, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], visited Athens in March 1918, to confer the [[Order of the Bath]] upon the king, Alexander feared that a marriage between him and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary of the United Kingdom]] would be discussed as part of an attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself.&lt;ref name="vdk118"/&gt; For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive.&lt;ref name="sdm177"/&gt; The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.&lt;ref name="ls136"/&gt;

Alexander's parents were not so happy about the match. Sophia disapproved of her son marrying a commoner, while Constantine wanted a delay but was prepared to be his son's best man if Alexander would be patient.&lt;ref name="vdk118"/&gt; Alexander visited Paris at the end of 1918, raising hopes among his family that they would be able to contact him once he was outside Greece. When Queen Sophia attempted to telephone her son in his Parisian hotel, a minister intercepted the call and informed her that "His Majesty is sorry, but he cannot respond to the telephone".&lt;ref name="vdk117"/&gt; He was not even informed that she had called.&lt;ref name="vdk117"/&gt;

===Public scandal===
[[File:King Alexander of Greece and Aspasia Manos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aspasia Manos]] and King Alexander depicted at the wheel of his [[Packard]] in a contemporary [[lithograph]] ]]
With the help of Aspasia's brother-in-law, Christo Zalocostas, and after three unsuccessful attempts, the couple eventually married in secret before a royal chaplain, [[Archimandrite]] Zacharistas, on the evening of 17 November 1919.&lt;ref name="sdm177"/&gt; After the ceremony, the archimandrite was sworn to silence but soon broke his promise by confessing to the Archbishop of Athens, [[Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople|Meletios Metaxakis]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Greek constitution, members of the royal family had to obtain permission to marry from both the sovereign and the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt; By marrying Aspasia without the permission of the Archbishop, Alexander caused a major scandal.&lt;ref name="vdk119"/&gt;

Despite his disapproval of the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia and her mother to move into the Royal Palace on condition that the marriage remain secret.&lt;ref name="sdm177"/&gt; The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they did not attend official functions together.&lt;ref name="vdk119"/&gt; On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near [[Fontainebleau]], the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car,&lt;ref&gt;"The King in a Motor Accident", ''[[The Times]]'', 29 May 1920, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; while Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1707255 Narrow Escape While Motoring]", ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'', 31 May 1920, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=kergariou|Count Alain de Kergariou (died 29 May 1920 aged 38) was an officer in the [[French Air Service]] during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;"Count de Kergariou Dead", ''The Times'', 31 May 1920, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He was motoring with his wife and two stepsons, the princes de Tonnay-Charente, when the accident happened. The countess was bruised but otherwise uninjured; one of her sons lost an arm.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/singfreepressb19200710.2.49.aspx Greek King in Motor Smash]", ''The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser'', 10 July 1920, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The government allowed the couple to return to Greece in mid-1920. Although their marriage was legalized, Aspasia was not recognized as queen, but was instead known as "Madame Manos".&lt;ref name="vdk119"/&gt; At first, she stayed at her sister's house in the Greek capital before transferring to Tatoi,&lt;ref&gt;Sáinz de Medrano, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was during this period that she became pregnant with Alexander's child.&lt;ref name="vdk119"/&gt;

Alexander visited the newly acquired territories of [[West Thrace]], and on 8 July 1920 the new name for the region's main town—[[Alexandroupoli]] (meaning "city of Alexander" in Greek)—was announced in the king's presence. The city's previous name of Dedeagatch was considered too Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Kargakos, pp. 325–331&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, Venizelos, counting on a surge of support in the wake of the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres and the expansion of Greek territory, announced a general election for early November.&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn Smith, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Queen Sofia of Greece.jpg|thumb|Alexander's mother, [[Queen Sophia of Greece]], by [[Georgios Jakobides]], 1915]]
On 2 October 1920, Alexander was injured while walking through the grounds of the Tatoi estate. A domestic [[Barbary macaque]] belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dog]], Fritz,{{efn|name=dog|The dog had been found in an enemy trench during World War I by a British officer, who had presented it to Alexander as a gift.&lt;ref name="vdk119"/&gt;}} and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys,&lt;ref&gt;"Monkey Bites King of Greece", ''[[The Portsmouth Herald]]'', 14 October 1920, p.1; Van der Kiste, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not [[cauterize]]d. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

That evening, his wounds became infected; he suffered a strong fever and [[septicemia]] set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished to take responsibility for so drastic an act.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the [[queen dowager]], [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Olga]], George I's widow and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of [[sepsis]] twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; The other members of the royal family received the news by telegram that night.{{efn|name=death|[[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Prince Nicolas]] received the news first but did not communicate it to Alexander's parents until the next morning because he did not wish to disturb their rest.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two days later, Alexander's body was conveyed to [[Athens Cathedral]], where it lay in state until his funeral on 29 October. Once again, the royal family were refused permission to return to Greece, and Queen Olga was the only member who attended.&lt;ref name="vdk125"/&gt; Foreign powers were represented by the [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Prince Regent of Serbia]] with his sister [[Princess Helen of Serbia|Princess Helen]] wife of [[Prince John Konstantinovich of Russia|John Constantinovich of Russia]], the [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince of Sweden]] with his uncle [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugene, Duke of Nericia]], and Rear-Admirals [[George Hope (Royal Navy officer)|Sir George Hope]] of Britain and Dumesnil of France, as well as members of the Athens diplomatic corps.&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Funeral in Athens", ''The Times'', 2 November 1920, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the cathedral service, Alexander's body was interred on the grounds of the royal estate at Tatoi.&lt;ref name="vdk125"&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek royal family never regarded Alexander's reign as fully legitimate. In the royal cemetery, while other monarchs are given the inscription "King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark", Alexander's reads "Alexander, son of the King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark. He ruled in the place of his father from 14 June 1917 to 25 October 1920."&lt;ref name="vdk125"/&gt; According to Alexander's favorite sister, Queen Helen of Romania, this feeling of illegitimacy was also shared by Alexander himself, a sentiment that helps explain his mésalliance with Aspasia Manos.&lt;ref name="vdk118" /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Laszlo - Queen Olga of Greece.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander's paternal grandmother, [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga of Greece]], by [[Philip Alexius de László]], 1914. She acted as regent between his death and the restoration of his father.]]
Alexander's death raised questions about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage,{{efn|name=marriage|Here "unequal marriage" refers to the union between a person of royal rank with an individual of a "lower" social status. This is similar to the [[morganatic marriage]]s of other European countries, though this concept did not exist in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;}} his descendants were not in the line of succession.{{efn|name=succession|The restored King Constantine did not recognize Alexander's only child, [[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Alexandra]], as a member of the House of Greece until July 1922. However, as the Greek succession was governed by [[Salic law]] until the beginning of the reign of [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]], she would not have been eligible as a female anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Sáinz de Medrano, pp. 180, 238, 402.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Hellenic Parliament]] demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting under the direction of the Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn Smith, p. 139; Van der Kiste, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The throne remained vacant and the [[Greek legislative election, 1920|legislative elections of 1920]] turned into an open conflict between the Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine.&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn Smith, pp. 144–148; Van der Kiste, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 November 1920, with the war with Turkey dragging on, the monarchists won, and [[Dimitrios Rallis]] became prime minister; Venizelos (who lost his own parliamentary seat) chose to leave Greece in self-exile. Rallis asked Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine's return.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the restored King Constantine I, whose return was endorsed overwhelmingly in a [[Greek referendum, 1920|referendum]], Greece went on to lose the Greco–Turkish War with heavy military and civilian casualties. The territory gained on the Turkish mainland during Alexander's reign was lost. Alexander's death in the midst of an election campaign helped destabilize the Venizelos regime, and the resultant loss of Allied support contributed to the failure of Greece's territorial ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Goldstein and Langhorne, p. 201; Goldstein, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] wrote, "it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite."&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, p. 409, quoted (for example) in Pentzopoulos, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issue===
Alexander's daughter by Aspasia Manos, [[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Alexandra]] (1921–1993), was born five months after his death. Initially, the government took the line that since Alexander had married Aspasia without the permission of his father or the church, his marriage was illegal and his posthumous daughter was illegitimate. However, in July 1922, Parliament passed a law which allowed the King to recognize royal marriages retroactively on a non-dynastic basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghislain de Diesbach|Diesbach]], p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; That September,&lt;ref name="Montgomery-Massingberd, p. 327"/&gt; Constantine—at Sophia's insistence—recognized his son's marriage to Aspasia and granted her the style of "Princess Alexander".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Kiste, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter (Constantine I's granddaughter) was legitimized as a princess of Greece and Denmark, and later married King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]] in London in 1944. They had one child: [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery-Massingberd, pp. 327, 536, 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''allegory of the long spoons''' is a [[parable]] that shows the difference between heaven and hell by means of people forced to eat with long spoons. It is attributed to Rabbi Haim of [[Rumšiškės|Romshishok]], as well as other sources.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-23/features/sns-201208221330--tms--godsqudctngs-a20120823-20120823_1_remarkable-story-heaven-text|title=Famous spiritual story varies among faiths and cultures, but carries the same message|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hell]] the people are unable to lift food to their mouths using such unwieldy cutlery, and are starving. In [[heaven]], the diners feed one another across the table and are sated. The story can encourage people to be kind to each other. There are [[#Interpretation|various interpretations]] of the fable including its [[#sermons|use in sermons]] and in advice to lonely people.

== Interpretation ==
The story suggests that people have the opportunity to use what they are given (the long spoons in this allegory) to help nourish each other, but the problem, as Haim points out, lies in how the people treat each other.

Given the same level playing field one group of people who treat each other well will create a pleasant environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they treat each other. Writer [[Dawn Eden]] suggests that this is a simple truth which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt;

== Variations ==
The long spoons allegory has become part of the [[folklore]] of several cultures, for example: Jewish,&lt;ref name=allegory&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabbi|first=Haim|title=Narrative of the allegory|url=http://www.hodu.com/parable.shtml|work=Citation source|publisher=Hodu|accessdate=6 Aug 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204060500/http://hodu.com/parable.shtml|archive-date=2011-02-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu,&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web|last=Lord|first=Shiva|title=Hindu parable: A Long Handled Spoon|url=http://www.forwardsteps.com.au/LongHandledSpoon.html|work=Swami|accessdate=5 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Horn|first=Nils|title=Yoga Basic Knowledge and Exercises By|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oriental&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peseschkian|first=Nossrat|title=Oriental stories as tools in psycho therapy|year=1986|publisher=Springer-Verlag|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christian.&lt;ref name="eden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tietze|first=Harald W|title=Happyology|publisher=The Pope tells the story of the long spoons|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, the food in the story is a bowl of stew; in China, it is a bowl of rice being eaten with long chopsticks.&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt;

In some versions of the story the diners are using regular cutlery but are unable to bend their arms,&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt; with a story attributed to Rabbi Haim of Romshishok describing how "both arms were splinted with wooden slats so he could not bend either elbow to bring the food to his mouth".

During [[conflict resolution]] in non-Western cultures{{which|date=May 2014}} communicating difficult truths is better through a third party who can make suggestions through such stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swami|first=Vinod|title=Conflict Mediation Across Cultures|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and popular culture==
&lt;span id="sermons"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;While the parable itself is seldom depicted in art, it is well known and used in sermons when referring to hell, where the fashion for depicting hell in terrible, painful, gruesome terms is fading in recent times.&lt;ref name="eden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eden|first=Dawn|title=The Thrill of the Chaste: Finding Fulfillment While Keeping Your Clothes On|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8499-1311-2|pages=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable is told by [[Norman McCay]] in the novelization of ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]''. In the 2011 [[Boardwalk Empire]] episode, "Under God's Power She Flourishes", Father Brennan tells Margaret the Allegory of the Long Spoons while Emily is fitted for leg braces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2046372/synopsis?ref_=tt_ft|title="Boardwalk Empire" Under God's Power She Flourishes (2011) - Synopsis|work=IMDb|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A scene in the 2013 thriller ''[[The East (film)|The East]]'' draws strong comparisons to the allegory when protagonist Sarah is depicted as selfish for neglecting to feed her adjacent diner, whilst in a straitjacket. It is also retold in [[Barbara Kingsolver]]'s novel, ''[[The Bean Trees]]''.

In Scotland, it is often said "It taks a lang spoon tae sup wi a [[Fife|Fifer]]".

[[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] made an animation video based on this allegory for their campaign "One human family, food for all".&lt;ref&gt;[http://food.caritas.org/video-one-human-family-food-for-all/ Caritas's Video "One human family, food for all"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anamorphosis''' or '''Anamorphogenesis''' refers to postembryonic development and [[moulting]] in [[Arthropoda]] that results in the addition of [[abdominal]] body segments, even after sexual maturity. An example of this occurs in [[protura]]ns and [[millipede]]s.

Anamorphosis has been depicted various times throughout early modern literature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anamorphosis In Early Modern Literature|last=Boyle|first=Jen|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|year=2010|isbn=|location=Farnham, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ancillary administration''' is "the administration of a decedent's estate in a state other than the one in which she lived, for the purpose of disposing of property she owned there."&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another definition is the "administration of an estate's asset's in another state."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/ancillary+administration From the Free dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often a necessary procedure in [[probate]], because the decedent may own property in a state other than his [[Domicile (law)|domicile]], which is subject to the law of the state in which it sits.

An '''ancillary administrator''' is the [[personal representative]] who handles the [[property]] in the other state under ancillary administration.&lt;ref&gt;See note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most major [[court system]]s will have forms and checklists for ancillary administrators to use.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., a [[New York (state)|New York]] court form:[Ancillary Administration Proceeding Checklist: http://www.nycourts.gov/courts/6jd/delaware/surrogate/checklists/ancillaryadm.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Communist League of the Caribbean''' ({{lang-es|Legión Anticomunista del Caribe}}, LAC), also known as the '''Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean''', was an anti-[[Castroism|Castroist]] [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] group based in the [[Dominican Republic]]&lt;ref name="Nordlinger"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nordlinger |first=Jay |authorlink=Jay Nordlinger |date=September 19, 2013 |title= More from the Anti-Che  |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/358877/more-anti-che-jay-nordlinger |newspaper=National Review Online |location= |publisher= |accessdate=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the dictators [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle|Anastasio Somoza]] of Nicaragua and former Cuban Secret Police Chief Orlando Piedra.&lt;ref name=Scott-1&gt;[[Peter Dale Scott|Scott, Peter Dale]] (1993) ''Deep Politics and the Death of JFK'', University of California Press, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the group was to overthrow the government of [[Fidel Castro]] in Cuba.

'''Antonio Deon Tarver''' (born November 21, 1968) is an American [[professional boxer]] and boxing commentator. He is a multiple-time [[light heavyweight]] world champion, having held the [[WBA (Super)]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine]] titles, as well the [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] light heavyweight and [[cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] titles.

As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Tarver represented the United States at the [[1996 Olympics]], winning a bronze medal in the light heavyweight division; he eventually lost to [[Vassiliy Jirov]] from [[Kazakhstan]], whom he had previously defeated at the [[1995 World Amateur Boxing Championships|1995 World Championships]] to win gold. Tarver also triumphed at the [[1995 Pan American Games]] and [[United States national amateur boxing championships|1995 U.S. National Championships]], winning gold in both. He remains the only boxer in history to have won gold at the Pan Am Games, World Championships and U.S. Nationals all in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-08-03/sports/9608030191_1_vasilii-jirov-antonio-tarver-head-coach-al-mitchell Tarver settles for bronze]&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of boxing, Tarver starred as [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]], the [[heavyweight]] champion in the 2006 film ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''.

== Professional career ==

=== Early years ===
Tarver made his professional debut at the age of 28 on February 18, 1997, with a second-round [[knockout]] of Joaquin Garcia at the legendary "[[The Blue Horizon|Blue Horizon]]" in [[Philadelphia]].

Tarver won his first 16 fights,14 by knockout, before stepping up his level of competition. After taking most of his first 16 fights in either his native Florida or at the "Blue Horizon", for his 11th fight he met veteran Rocky Gannon in [[Chester, West Virginia]], on August 30, 1998. Tarver knocked out Gannon in the second round.

On February 29, 2000, Tarver scored a knockout against [[Ernest M-16 Mateen]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Later that year, Tarver suffered his first loss when he was knocked down in the 11th round by [[Eric Harding]], en route to a unanimous decision on June 23 in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]. This was an IBF title elimination bout, where the winner would face [[Roy Jones Jr]].

In 2002, Tarver defeated former two-weight world champion [[Reggie Johnson (boxer)|Reggie Johnson]] by split decision to win the NABF &amp; USBA light-heavyweight titles, and a guaranteed title shot at Roy Jones. He then scored a fifth round stoppage over Harding in a rematch that was on the undercard of the rematch between [[Shane Mosely]] and [[Vernon Forrest]]. Tarver was trailing on the scorecards until the 4th round, when he sent Harding to the canvas with a barrage of unanswered power shots; Harding was also floored twice in the 5th round, leading to the stoppage.

=== Winning the light-heavyweight titles ===
On April 26, 2003, Tarver received his first world title shot, when he faced former WBC champion [[Montel Griffin]] for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] &amp; [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] light-heavyweight titles that had been vacated by [[Roy Jones Jr.]], who had gone on to defeat [[John Ruiz]] for the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] heavyweight title the previous month. After dropping Griffin in the first and last rounds, Tarver was crowned champion after winning a unanimous decision.

=== Tarver vs Jones I &amp; II ===
{{Main article|Antonio Tarver vs. Roy Jones Jr.|Roy Jones Jr. vs. Antonio Tarver II}}
Next, rather than remain at heavyweight, Jones planned to return to light-heavyweight and regain his belts. Given little chance of winning, Tarver took a weight-drained Jones the distance and lost the fight and WBC title by a majority decision on November 8, 2003, in Las Vegas (Tarver had relinquished the IBF title a few days earlier in anticipation of being unable to make a mandatory defense.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2003-11-05-jones-tarver-ring_x.htm Jones concedes, will let Tarver enter ring last]. Usatoday.Com (2003-11-07). Retrieved on 2012-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rematch on May 15, 2004 in Las Vegas, Tarver upset the odds to regain the WBC title and win the "WBA Super" title by knocking Jones out in the second round. In fifty previous fights, Jones had only been sent to the floor once, leaving most observers shocked at the result.

=== Rise in popularity ===
Tarver became a mainstream celebrity after his rematch win over Jones, making appearances at late-night shows, appearing on the cover of both [[Ring Magazine|Ring]] and [[KO Magazine]], being spotted by television cameras as a spectator at various boxing fights, and co-hosting [[ESPN]]'s "Friday Night Fights" for one telecast.

=== Tarver vs Johnson I &amp; II ===
Later in 2004, the WBC decided to strip Tarver of the world title after he decided against fighting their mandatory challenger, instead choosing to fight IBF title holder [[Glen Johnson (boxer)|Glen Johnson]] December 18 in [[Temecula, California]]; Tarver had already been removed as Super Champion by the WBA in their July rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060317035420/http://www.wbaonline.com/ratings/rankings/2004/wba0604.pdf Official Ratings as of June 2004]. World Boxing Association (2004-07-03)&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson himself had been stripped of his IBF title before the bout with Tarver for not fighting his mandatory challenger. Both fighters were celebrated for their decision to fight each other rather than bow to the pressure from what has become known as "The Alphabet Soup" sanctioning bodies (WBC, WBA, WBO, and IBF).

Tarver, considered a favorite to win the fight, suffered an upset loss to Johnson by way of a split decision in a fight that he did not appear to be in top shape for. Tarver avenged the loss six months later with a unanimous decision, out-boxing and out-working the aggressive Johnson at the [[FedEx Forum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] to regain The Ring championship.

=== Rubber match against Jones ===
{{Main article|Antonio Tarver vs. Roy Jones Jr. III}}
In their third fight, Tarver won a unanimous decision over [[Roy Jones Jr.]] on October 1, 2005 in [[Tampa, Florida]], almost knocking Jones down in the 11th round but also finding himself in trouble at times during the fight.

=== Tarver vs Hopkins ===
On June 10, 2006, Tarver faced former undisputed world [[middleweight]] champion [[Bernard Hopkins]] for Tarver's ''The Ring'' title at The [[Boardwalk Hall]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Hopkins, a 3-to-1 underdog, dominated the fight, outboxing Tarver to win a unanimous decision.  The fight was scored 118–109 by all three judges.  Tarver was knocked down in the 5th round. As a result of a clause in the fight contract, Tarver was forced to pay $250,000 to a charity of Hopkins' choice since he did not knock Hopkins out before the fifth round.  Tarver's record would now stand at 24 wins and 4 losses, with 18 wins coming by way of knockout.

=== Return to the ring ===
Tarver returned to the ring nearly one year after his loss to Hopkins, defeating Albanian-fighter Elvir Muriqi on June 9, 2007 by way of a [[majority decision]]. In his next fight, held at [[Foxwoods Resort Casino]] on  December 1, 2007, Tarver registered a win over [[Danny Santiago]] by way of a 4th round [[Knockout|TKO]].

Tarver then regained the IBF title by outpointing [[Clinton Woods]].

=== Tarver vs Dawson I &amp; II ===
On October 11, 2008, Tarver faced rising star [[Chad Dawson]] for Tarver's IBF title.  The fight took place at Palms Casino in Las Vegas.  Tarver lost the fight via unanimous decision, with wide margins of 118–109 and 117–110 (twice). The outcome was not disputed.

With the loss to Dawson, it was speculated that Tarver may choose to retire; however, he later announced that he and Dawson would meet in a rematch in March 2009.

A rematch with Dawson, originally announced for March 14, 2009, had to be postponed due to an injury suffered by Dawson. Finally, on May 9, the two fighters met at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas. Tarver, who came to the fight as a 5:1 underdog, again lost by unanimous decision.

=== Move up to heavyweight ===
Following the rematch loss to Dawson, Tarver took over a year off from the ring, before returning on 15 October 2010 to defeat [[Nagy Aguilera]] by 10 round unanimous decision in a bout that took place in the [[heavyweight]] division. For this fight Tarver officially weighed 221&amp;nbsp;lbs, some 46&amp;nbsp;lbs more than he had weighed for the Dawson rematch.

=== Cruiserweight ===

On 20 July 2011, Tarver took on Australian IBO cruiserweight champion [[Danny Green (boxer)|Danny Green]] at the [[Sydney Entertainment Centre]], Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, in Tarver's debut in the 200&amp;nbsp;lb [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|cruiserweight]] division.

Tarver dominated the fight, knocking Green down in the second round and controlling the majority of the action from there on in. After taking heavy punishment and being saved by the bell at the end of round 9, Green failed to come out for the start of round 10, allowing Tarver to take the victory and the title by TKO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gPxaizuV5ewK9ZMg0_f2hGnkhZOA?docId=CNG.f7f503a6aede16a0648e161326c40fa9.91 AFP: Tarver stops Green for fifth world title]. Google.com (2011-07-20). Retrieved on 2012-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed drug tests ===
Tarver reportedly tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid in his pre-fight urine sample prior to his fight with Kayode, with the tests' results only released publicly after the fight.

Tarver tested positive for a banned substance yet again in his pre-fight urine samples coming into the Cunningham bout, with the tests once again being released after the fight.

== Media ==

=== Rocky Balboa ===
Tarver starred as heavyweight champion [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] in the 2006 film ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. In the film the current, unpopular, champion Dixon fights former champion Rocky Balboa, who decides to come out of retirement. Dixon wins the match by split decision, and after breaking his hand in the second round of the bout but still managing to stand toe to toe with Rocky for the full 10 rounds, proves to doubters that he has the heart of a champion. The DVD of the movie offers an alternate ending, in which Rocky wins the split decision.  Dixon's record before the fight is 33-0 (30 KO).
Also on the DVD, the film's writer and director [[Sylvester Stallone]] wanted to cast a real boxer in the role of Dixon, as he thought it would be easier to teach a boxer how to act than to teach an actor how to box convincingly. In an August 18, 2010 interview with Stallone on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', the director indicated that Tarver refused to film his scene after the MGM had been rented out and filled with people already incurring high costs. In order to get the filming done, Stallone gave Tarver a cut of his own salary and points on the back end which resulted in Stallone making no money on the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1282104000 Stallone has another hit – The Howard Stern Show]. Howardstern.com (2010-08-18). Retrieved on 2012-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commentating with Showtime ===
After his loss to Dawson and up to his failed drug test in June, 2012, Tarver served as a boxing analyst for [[Showtime Championship Boxing]].

'''Arturo Gatti''' (April 15, 1972 – July 11, 2009) was an [[Italian Canadian]] [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1991 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada wants more info about Gatti's death |url=https://nationalpost.com/related/topics/story.html?id=1849566 |publisher=''[[National Post]]'' }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsn01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Canadian former boxing champion Gatti found dead in Brazil |url=http://tsn.ca/boxing/story/?id=284455 |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Sports Network|TSN]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canadian former boxing champion Gatti found dead in Brazil |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090711/arturo_gatti_090711/20090711?hub=TopStories |date= July 11, 2009|publisher=''[[CTV News Channel (Canada)|CTV News Channel]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "Thunder," Gatti was known for his heart and bravery in the ring, and also carried formidable punching power.

A world champion in two [[weight class (boxing)|weight classes]], Gatti held the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] [[junior lightweight]] title from 1995 to 1998, and the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[super lightweight]] title from 2004 to 2005. He also participated in ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine's [[Ring Magazine Fight of the Year|Fight of the Year]] a total of four times (1997, 1998, 2002, and 2003). He announced his retirement on July 14, 2007.&lt;ref name="cbc01"&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxer Arturo Gatti found dead |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/07/11/gatt-dead.html |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[CBC News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spextasy.com/Arturo_Gatti_The_Other_Fighter.html The Other Fighter: Remembering Arturo "Thunder" Gatti] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322035550/http://www.spextasy.com/Arturo_Gatti_The_Other_Fighter.html |date=March 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2012, Gatti was posthumously inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]], in his first year of eligibility, and becoming the tenth Canadian boxer to be inducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arturo Gatti inducted into Boxing Hall of Fame |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Fighting/Boxing/2012/12/10/20422006.html |date= December 11, 2012|publisher=''QMI Agency''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatti was born in [[Cassino]], Italy, and raised in [[Latium]], a region of central western Italy, before moving to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref name="Dernier-Round"&gt;{{cite book| last=Pothier| first=Jacques| editor=Éditions La Presse| title=Arturo Gatti : Le dernier round|date=Feb 2011| location=Montreal| language=French| isbn=978-2-923681-52-8| oclc=701590105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gatti eventually relocated to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] as a teenager. He returned to Montreal after retiring from boxing to work in real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arturo Gatti considering return to the ring |url=https://www.tsn.ca/story/print/?id=250546 |date= September 24, 2008 |publisher=''[[The Canadian Press]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="espn01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Foul play suspected in Gatti's death |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4321150 |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[ESPN]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death in 2009 was mired in controversy, with his wife first being arrested for homicide and then released after an autopsy ruled his death was suicide.

== Professional career ==
Arturo Gatti was a member of the [[Canada at the Olympics|Canadian National team]], and was training to represent Canada at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Games]], but at age 19 (in 1991), he decided to turn pro instead.&lt;ref name="tsn01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hard-hitting Arturo Gatti was one of Canada's boxing greats |url=http://www.inews880.com/News/Sports/Article.aspx?id=125161 |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Canadian Press]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began boxing professionally on the night of June 10, 1991, with a third round knockout of Jose Gonzalez in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]]. He went undefeated for six bouts before losing to King Solomon by split decision in six rounds on November 17, 1992.&lt;ref name="rtubagw"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arturo Gatti |url=https://www.proboxing-fans.com/fighter-profiles/arturo-gatti-remembering-ultimate-blood-and-guts-warrior/ |work=Pro Boxing Fans |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next fight, on March 24, 1993, was his first fight abroad, where he visited [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]] and knocked out Plawen Goutchev in round one.&lt;ref name="rtubagw"/&gt;

In 1994, he beat Leon Bostic, and followed through with a Round 1 knockout over Pete Taliaferro to win the [[United States Boxing Association|USBA]] [[super featherweight]] title. He retained the title against Richard Salazar and former world champion [[Jose Sanabria]].&lt;ref name="rtubagw"/&gt;

=== Signing with HBO ===
On December 15, 1995, Gatti challenged the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] super featherweight Champion [[Tracy Harris Patterson]], [[Floyd Patterson]]'s adoptive son. Gatti became world champion when he narrowly outpointed Patterson (scoring: 116–111, 115–112, 114–113) and signed a multi-fight deal with [[Home Box Office|HBO]] to fight on [[HBO Boxing]].&lt;ref name="ttmgr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ringtv.com/177915-the-time-machine-arturo-gatti-vs-wilson-rodriguez/ |title=The Time Machine: Arturo Gatti vs. Wilson Rodriguez |date=March 23, 2013 |publisher=[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He only had two fights in 1996, once defending his world title. His title defense, at [[Madison Square Garden]] against [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Wilson Rodriguez]] was the first of three Gatti fights in a row to be named a candidate for "[[Fight of the Year]]" by ''[[Ring Magazine]]''. Dropped in round two and with his right eye closing fast, Gatti knocked Rodriguez down in round six with a left hook to the body, before finishing him off in round six to retain the title.&lt;ref name="ttmgr"/&gt;

In 1997, he again won a points victory over Patterson, but this time by a larger margin (118–108, 117–109, 116–110).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Curran |first=John |date=February 23, 1997 |title=Gatti beats Patterson again |url=https://www.apnews.com/cd7bc739dda10412ad8fb98ced717a57 |work=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Timothy W. |date=February 23, 1997 |title=Gatti Leaves Little Doubt In Rematch With Patterson |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/23/sports/gatti-leaves-little-doubt-in-rematch-with-patterson.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then scored a technical knockout over former world champion [[Calvin Grove]] in the seventh round of a non-title affair. Then came his defense against former world champion [[Gabriel Ruelas]], which was also named "Fight of the Year" by ''Ring Magazine''. Rocked by a left uppercut in the fourth, Gatti absorbed more than 15 consecutive punches before being saved by the bell. In the fifth, he connected on a left hook to knock Ruelas out.&lt;ref name="agcfbl"&gt;{{cite news |last=Christ |first=Scott |date=July 13, 2009 |title=Arturo Gatti: The Career, The Fights, The Blood, The Legacy |url=https://www.badlefthook.com/2009/7/13/947448/arturo-gatti-the-career-the-fights |work=Bad Left Hook |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McRae |first=Kevin |date=December 10, 2012 |title=Arturo Gatti's Hall of Fame Call Is a Great Thing for Boxing |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1440029-boxing-international-boxing-hall-of-fame-made-right-call-on-arturo-gatti |work=[[Bleacher Report]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== To the lightweight division ===
After that fight, Gatti relinquished the world title, going up in weight to the [[lightweight]] division. However, 1998 was a bad year for Gatti, as he lost all three of his fights that year. He lost by a technical knockout in round eight to [[Angel Manfredy]], and then lost a pair of close 10-round decisions to [[Ivan Robinson]], the first by split decision, the second by unanimous. In Gatti-Robinson II, Gatti had a point deducted in the eighth round for low blows. Had the point not been deducted, the fight would have been a draw, as Robinson was only ahead by one point on two scorecards. Gatti-Robinson I was chosen "Fight of the Year" by ''Ring Magazine'', thus marking the second year in a row that a Gatti fight was given that award and the third year in a row a Gatti fight was nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Timothy W. |date=December 14, 1998 |title=BOXING: IN THE NEWS -- LIGHTWEIGHT; Gatti Revels in the Punishment |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/14/sports/boxing-in-the-news-lightweight-gatti-revels-in-the-punishment.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He only had one fight in 1999, knocking out Reyes Munoz in round one.&lt;ref name="rtubagw"/&gt;

=== Controversial fight against Gamache ===
Gatti's first fight of 2000 proved to be controversial. Faced with former world champion [[Joey Gamache]], Gatti won by a knockout in round two. A subsequent lawsuit by Gamache's handlers claimed Gatti had gained 19 pounds since the weigh-in the day before and thus had a large advantage over Gamache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Boxer suing Gatti |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/boxing/articles/2006/03/03/boxer_suing_gatti/ |date= March 3, 2006 |publisher=''[[Associated Press|AP]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the fight, boxing regulators pushed for a new law limiting the amount of weight a competitor can gain between the weigh-in and time of the fight. Gatti was also accused by Gamache's handlers of not having actually made the contracted weight of 141 pounds. After Gatti-Gamache, some boxing commissions started weighing boxers a second time.&lt;ref name="agcfbl"/&gt;

Gatti also won his two other fights that year, against Eric Jukabuwski and Joe Hutchinson.&lt;ref name="rtubagw"/&gt;

=== Trilogy against Micky Ward ===
[[File:Arturo Gatti.jpg|thumb|Gatti at the post-fight press conference on June 7, 2003]]
In 2001, Gatti only had one fight, going up in weight to meet [[welterweight]] [[Oscar De La Hoya]], who beat him by a technical knockout in five rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Spousta |first=Tom |date=March 25, 2001 |title=BOXING; Savvy De La Hoya Stops Gatti With Technical Knockout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/25/sports/boxing-savvy-de-la-hoya-stops-gatti-with-technical-knockout.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Gatti returned to the [[light welterweight]] division and defeated former world champion [[Terronn Millett]] by a knockout in round four.&lt;ref name="ttmgr"/&gt;

He then split two ten-round decisions with "Irish" [[Micky Ward]], losing their first bout, but winning their second. Gatti-Ward I also earned "Fight of the Year" honors by [[Ring Magazine]], and the 9th round was called the Round of the Century by [[Emanuel Steward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Raskin |first=Eric |date=May 18, 2012 |title=Gatti-Ward I: ‘Fight of the Century’ |url=http://grantland.com/features/on-10-year-anniversary-gatti-ward-rewatching-one-greatest-boxing-matches-all-time/ |work=[[Grantland]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nile |first=Levi |date=May 18, 2014 |title=Arturo Gatti vs. Micky Ward I: Remembering the FOTY for 2002 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2067579-arturo-gatti-vs-micky-ward-i-remembering-the-foty-for-may-2002 |work=Bleacher Report |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2003, he and Ward had a [[wiktionary:rubber_match|rubber match]]. Gatti broke his twice-repaired right hand on an uppercut in the fourth, and he dropped his arm. In the sixth, Gatti dominated the round, but got caught with an overhand to the top of the head a second before the bell rang and went down. The final scorecards read, 96–93, 96–93 and 97–92, in favor of Gatti. The third fight between the two was again named "[[Fight of the Year]]" by ''Ring Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Geoffrey |date=June 8, 2003 |title=BOXING; Gatti Wins Last Round of Intense Feud |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/sports/boxing-gatti-wins-last-round-of-intense-feud.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Argeris |first=Steve |date=June 9, 2003 |title=Gatti Mulls Next Move, While Ward Calls It Quits |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/2003/06/09/gatti-mulls-next-move-while-ward-calls-it-quits/e62144c3-12d0-4926-9875-d4591860e45b/?utm_term=.63fb8180dba7 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gatti vs. Ward Trilogy - CompuBox By The Numbers |url=https://www.boxingscene.com/gatti-vs-ward-trilogy-compubox-by-numbers--70838 |work=Boxing Scene |date=October 20, 2013 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career after Micky Ward ===
On January 24, 2004, Gatti, having recovered from a broken hand, scored a tenth round knock-down and defeated [[Gianluca Branco]] of [[Italy]] by a 12-round unanimous decision to win the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] light welterweight title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gatti overcomes hand injury, beats Branco |url=http://a.espncdn.com/boxing/news/2004/0124/1717628.html |work=ESPN |date=January 24, 2004 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gatti Wins Latest Battle and a Title |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/25/sports/sp-nwbox(ing)25 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 25, 2004 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Geoffrey |date=January 26, 2004 |title=BOXING; Humbled by Tough Fight, Gatti Is Champ Nonetheless |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/26/sports/boxing-humbled-by-tough-fight-gatti-is-champ-nonetheless.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2004, he knocked out the previously unbeaten former world champion [[Leonard Doroftei|Leonard Dorin Doroftei]] in two rounds at [[Atlantic City]], to retain his title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BOXING; After Showing Polish, Gatti Has Eyes on Mayweather |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/26/sports/boxing-after-showing-polish-gatti-has-eyes-on-mayweather.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 26, 2004 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatti's second defense of his WBC title came against former WBC super featherweight Champion [[Jesse James Leija]] on January 29, 2005. Gatti beat Leija by a fifth-round knockout. That same night, Arturo's protégé, Danny "Little Mac" McDermott, won his pro debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Indri |first=Mike |date=January 30, 2005 |title=Gatti crushes Leija in 5th round knockout – is Mayweather next? |url=https://www.boxing247.com/weblog/archives/103174 |work=Boxing247.com |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his next fight, Gatti fought former super featherweight and lightweight world champion [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on June 25, 2005. He took a horrific beating and Gatti's corner man threw in the towel after he was beaten around the ring, thus ending his title reign via sixth-round technical knockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Clifton |date=June 26, 2005 |title=Gatti Is No Match for Mayweather |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/sports/gatti-is-no-match-for-mayweather.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the loss to Mayweather, Gatti moved up to the welterweight division. He beat Thomas Damgaard on January 28, 2006, by an eleventh-round technical knockout to win the vacant [[International Boxing Association (professional)|IBA]] [[welterweight]] title and become a champion in 3 different weight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Jay |date=January 29, 2006 |title=GATTI: THE WEIGHT’S OK |url=https://nypost.com/2006/01/29/gatti-the-weights-ok/ |work=[[New York Post]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2006, Gatti lost by a TKO to [[Carlos Baldomir]], vying for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] &amp; [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] welterweight championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rafael |first=Dan |author-link=Dan Rafael |date=July 22, 2006 |title=Power of Baldomir quashes 'Thunder' |url=http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2527355 |work=ESPN |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then broke off his relationship with [[Buddy McGirt]] and had a new trainer in [[Micky Ward]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rafael |first=Dan |date=April 29, 2007 |title=Former foes Gatti, Ward to share a corner |url=http://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?columnist=rafael_dan&amp;id=2851021 |work=ESPN |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gatti attempted a comeback on July 14, 2007, against [[Alfonso Gomez]], only to get TKO'd by Gomez. After the fight, Gatti announced his retirement in the dressing room, reportedly quipping: "I'm coming back &amp;mdash; as a spectator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gatti Retires After Beating by Gomez |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/15/AR2007071500270_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |date=July 15, 2007 |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fowle |first=Noah |date=July 15, 2007 |title=Gatti KO'd for career |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/gatti-ko-career-article-1.267782 |work=[[New York Post]] |access-date=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fighting style ==
Arturo was an aggressive, all-action fighter, often remembered as a [[Boxing styles and technique#The Slugger|Slugger]]. Early on in his career, Gatti showed his tremendous punching power as he amassed a large number of first-round knockouts. Although he had the ability to box many opponents (as shown in the second [[Micky Ward]] fight) Gatti would often get into brawls when his opponents were able to take the power and fight back. This is why many of his bouts against good opposition were slug-fests.

Gatti had incredible heart, and an iron [[chin (boxing)|chin]], shown in the majority of his major fights. He was able to absorb incredible amounts of punishments by fighters such as [[Wilson Rodriguez]], [[Gabriel Ruelas]], [[Angel Manfredy]], [[Ivan Robinson]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]], Micky Ward, [[Floyd Mayweather]] and [[Carlos Baldomir]], none of whom could knock him out cold. In the Rodriguez fight he showed off his recuperative abilities as he was close to being stopped under a barrage of shots and in the next round he stopped his opponent.&lt;ref name="rtubagw"/&gt;

Oscar De La Hoya, who faced many big punchers from 130 pounds to 160 pounds, says Gatti hit him the hardest out of any fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ringtv.com/121735-de-la-hoya-blog-the-best-i-fought/ |title=De La Hoya blog: The best I fought |date=August 19, 2009 |publisher=The Ring |access-date=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-career ==
Gatti retired with a record of 40 wins and 9 losses, with 31 wins by knockout. On September 24, 2008, reports had surfaced that Gatti was considering a comeback against Montreal [[welterweight]] [[Antonin Décarie]], the Canadian and [[North American Boxing Organization]] champion. On December 10, 2012 Arturo Gatti was voted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Montreal boxer Arturo Gatti mourned as legend |url=https://montrealgazette.com/travel/Montreal+boxer+Arturo+Gatti+dead/1782665/story.html |date=July 12, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714025550/http://www.montrealgazette.com/travel/Montreal+boxer+Arturo+Gatti+dead/1782665/story.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
On July 11, 2009, Gatti was found dead in a hotel in [[Ipojuca]], [[Pernambuco]], Brazil, where he was on holiday with his Brazilian wife, Amanda Rodrigues, and their 10-month-old son.&lt;ref name="cbc01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lutador de boxe canadense é achado morto em flat em Porto de Galinhas, em Pernambuco |url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cidades/mat/2009/07/11/lutador-de-boxe-canadense-achado-morto-em-flat-em-porto-de-galinhas-em-pernambuco-756779153.asp |language=Portuguese |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[O Globo]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 37 years old.

"There were definite injuries that had not been seen by Brazilian authorities," Baden said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4371447 Baden: Brazil's investigation incomplete.] ESPN via ''The Associated Press''. August 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a year later, in March 2010, the circumstances concerning Gatti's death remained unclear.&lt;ref name="dailynews"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2010/03/13/2010-03-13_boxing_champ_gattis_death_remains_a_mystery.html Boxing Champ Gatti's Death Remains a Mystery.] NY Daily News. March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the family's request, a Quebec coroner agreed to exhume the body so that two pathologists could conduct a second autopsy. Coroner Jean Brochu said, "We've been waiting for this for a long time," and "it's going to take a while" before conclusions can be made, and released to the public.&lt;ref name="dailynews"/&gt; A shortage of staff at the coroner's office was blamed for contributing to the delay of the investigation.&lt;ref name="dailynews"/&gt; Regarding a new toxicology report being prepared, Brochu quipped that it "may take a century to get the results."&lt;ref name="dailynews"/&gt;

The Quebec coroner's report was released in November 2011. Brochu agreed with prior conclusions that Gatti died a violent death from asphyxia by neck constriction. He also noted that Gatti had [[carisoprodol]], a muscle relaxant, in his system, along with alcohol. An expert toxicologist from Quebec retained by the coroner said the drug can produce withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, confusion and psychosis. The coroner also stated that "obvious presence of post-mortem lividity" indicated that the body had been suspended for some time before ending up on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''August Carl Joseph Corda''' (1809–1849) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] physician and [[mycologist]]. This botanist is denoted by the [[List of botanists by author abbreviation|author abbreviation]] '''&lt;span class="vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="fn n"&gt;&lt;span class="nickname"&gt;Corda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;''' when [[Author citation (botany)|citing]] a [[botanical name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Brummitt|first = R. K.|author2=C. E. Powell|title = Authors of Plant Names |publisher = [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |year = 1992 |isbn = 1-84246-085-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Corda was born in Reichenberg (now [[Liberec]]), Bohemia on November 15, 1809.&lt;ref name=hennebert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corda|first=A. J.|title=Autobiographical sketch|journal=MUCL Archive|date=n.d.|editor1-first=G.|editor1-last=Hennebert|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corda's father was a textile seller. Both of Corda's parents died suddenly only a few weeks following his birth, and Corda was raised by his grandmother, attending the Normale School in Reichenberg.&lt;ref name="hennebert"/&gt; Corda's grandmother died in 1819 and Corda was sent to live with an "unacquainted family" for two years during which time he did not receive schooling.&lt;ref name="hennebert"/&gt; Two years later, Corda was transferred to the care of an uncle in [[Prague]] where he attended the "Lyceum of New Prague".&lt;ref name="hennebert"/&gt; As a result of family difficulties, Corda left the Lyceum in 1824 to attend [[Czech Technical University in Prague|polytechnical school]]. There, he studied physics under [[Franz Ignatz Cassian Hallaschka]], chemistry under [[Josef Johann Steinmann]], mineralogy under [[Franz Xaver Zippe]], and botany under [[Ignaz Friedrich Tausch]]. Corda remained at the Polytechnic only 3 years, long enough to become proficient in chemistry.&lt;ref name="hennebert"/&gt;

After leaving the Polytechnic in 1827, Corda took a job in a chemical factory in Prague for a brief time before returning to study surgery at the University of Prague. Shortly thereafter during an outbreak of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', Corda served as an assistant surgeon at the General Hospital in Prague.  He continued as a cholera doctor in [[Rokycany|Rokitzan]], [[Zákupy|Reichstadt]], [[Mimoň|Niemes]] and [[Zwickau]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4JIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=Corda+Zwickau+Niemes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=toH1Y2G-N_&amp;sig=_irEe06DtupK0d9aHrBn0kyeYbk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmwpHr99rLAhWGHx4KHaQqAwsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Corda%20Zwickau%20Niemes&amp;f=false Geschichte der Botanik in Böhmen] by Vincenz Maiwald&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1832, dispirited by his seemingly endless struggle against [[cholera]], Corda quit the practice of medicine.&lt;ref name="hennebert"/&gt;

==Career==
For six weeks, Corda retreated to Berlin to enjoy the company of his close friend [[Kurt Sprengel]] and his many associates in the literati, [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Carl Sigismund Kunth]], [[Johann Horkel]] and [[Martin Lichtenstein]]. Following his return to Reichenberg, Corda was inspired to the study of botany following the receipt of a letter from the Berlin Academy proposing a study of the growth of palms and related plants with a travel grant for a return trip to Berlin. Corda enthusiastically responded by writing ''De incremento stipitis plantarum'' with nearly 100 accompanying illustrations which he completed in 1834 along with a monograph on the "Anatomy of the Rhyzosperms". During his return to Prague, Corda collected at the [[Karlovy Vary]] Hot Springs where he studied aquatic zooplankton and visited [[Nees von Esenbeck]].&lt;ref name="hennebert"/&gt;

Once back in Prague, Corda was invited to take up a position of Curator of the Division of Zoology at the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]] by the museum's founder and president, the influential [[Kaspar Maria von Sternberg]], whom Corda had met during his time at [[Karlovy Vary]] and also at a botanical congress in [[Vratislavia]]. Corda's primary interest quickly drifted to the mycological collections which became the primary focus of his work. Corda is best known for his monumental 6 volume ''Icones fungorum hucusque cognitorum'', published from 1837–1842 and finally in 1854, and his ''Prachtflora europäischer Schimmelbildungen'' published in 1839.&lt;ref name=ainsworth1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Ainsworth|first=G. C.|title=Introduction to the history of mycology|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-21013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|273}} Corda was one of the first mycologists to document the sizes of spores of the fungi he described.&lt;ref name="ainsworth1976"/&gt;{{rp|61}}

In 1848, Corda was suspected of political agitation during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Prague Barricades]] and narrowly escaped assassination.&lt;ref name=gc1850&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berkeley|first=M.

'''Baba Buddha ji''' (6 October 1506 – 8 September 1631) was a prime figure in early [[Sikhism]]. He was one of the earliest disciples of [[Guru Nanak]]. He performed the formal coronation ceremonies of 5 Sikh gurus, till [[Guru Hargobind]]. It is said that in his childhood, he was blessed with a long life by Guru Nanak, who named him as Buddha (meaning - Old/Aged Man) after he was amused by his mature queries related to spirituality at such at young age.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} While the English spelling is same, the word Buddha here is different than [[Gautam Buddha]] of [[Buddhism]]. With Baba Buddha Ji, "d" in the word Buddha is pronounced as it is, while with Gautam Buddha, "d" is pronounced with tongue touching the teeth (pronounced like "the").

Out of the approximately 10,400 known bird species, about 1,300 (13%) are classified as threatened with [[extinction]], 9% as near [[Threatened species|threatened]] and of the remaining 78% many populations are [[Declining population|declining]].&lt;ref&gt;IUCN 2016.

Downloaded on 07 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general consensus among scientists who study these trends that if [[human impact on the environment]] continues as it has one-third of all bird species and an even greater proportion of bird populations will be gone by the end of this century.&lt;ref&gt;Ceballos and Ehlrich, Gerardo; Anne and Paul Ehlrich (2015).

These include countries such as [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Papua New Guinea]].

== Causes of bird extinction ==
Human activity is the greatest cause of bird extinction around the world.  The top human causes of bird extinction involve: the increased human population, destruction of habitat (through development for habitation, logging, animal and single-crop agriculture, and invasive plants), bird trafficking, egg collecting, pollution (in fertilizers impacting native plants and diversity, pesticides, herbicides directly impacting them as well as the plant and animal food birds eat, including the food for their food source further down along the food chain), and climate change and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=J.

== Natural ==
As climate change is caused by a variety of activities. The effect that climate change has on bird extinction is immense. Due to the rapid changes in temperature and climate the bio diverse earth can not progress with these factors.&lt;ref name="Extinction - Causes"/&gt; Severe weather conditions and long seasons, as well as a chemical atmosphere within their surroundings, makes it difficult for many species of birds to keep up with.&lt;ref name="Extinction - Causes"/&gt; In Hawai'i, climate change is responsible for the decline in the population in Hawaiian forest birds and is resulting in an increase of avian malaria (plasmodium relictum). Because the dynamics of malaria are influenced by ambient temperature and participation patterns, the predicted climate changes are expected to increase the occurrence of avian malaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Liao|last2=Atkinson|first2=Carter T.|last3=LaPointa|first3=Dennis A.|last4=Samuel|first4=Michael D.|date=2017|title=Mitigating Future Avian Malaria Threats to Hawaiian Forest Birds from Climate Change|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168880|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=12|pages=|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea level rise may flood islands killing the birds and other animals native to islands causing extinction.

== Disease ==
Each species of birds carries defense mechanisms like resistances and the ability to fight disease.&lt;ref name="Extinction - Causes"/&gt; With the changing climate and atmosphere, many species are losing their ability to fight particular diseases. These bird species are becoming more susceptible to disease, which results to the downfall of extinction. The most common disease affecting birds is [[Salmonellosis]], which originates from the Latin name of [[salmonella]]. Infected birds pass bacteria in their fecal droppings. Other birds then become ill when they eat food contaminated by the droppings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/learn/nature-wildlife/birds/common-bird-parasites-diseases|title=Common Bird Parasites &amp; Diseases|website=Mass Audubon|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calaveras Big Trees State Park''' is a [[state park]] of [[California]], United States, preserving two groves of [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]] trees.  It is located 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of [[Arnold, California]] in the middle elevations of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].  It has been a major tourist attraction since 1852, when the existence of the trees was first widely reported, and is considered the longest continuously operated tourist facility in California.

==History==

Parcels of land that would later become the state park and nearby national park were optioned by lumberman [[Robert P. Whiteside]] in January, 1900, with the intention of logging.  A protracted battle to preserve the trees was launched by [[Laura Lyon White]] and the [[California Club (civic organization)|California Club]].  Despite legislation in 1900 and 1909 authorizing the federal government to purchase the property, Whiteside refused to sell the land at the offered price, preferring its higher valuation as parkland.  It was not until 1931 that Whiteside's family began to divest the property, beginning with the North Grove.&lt;ref name=binkley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binkley|first1=Cameron|title=A Cult of Beauty: The Public Life and Civic Work of Laura Lyon White|journal=California History|volume=82|number=2|date=2005|jstor=25161804|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years other parcels of mixed conifer forests, including the much larger South Calaveras Grove of Giant Sequoias(purchased in 1954 for US $2.8 million, equivalent to US ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2800000|1954|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), have been added to the park to bring the total area to over {{convert|6400|acre|ha}}. The North Grove contains about 100 mature giant sequoias; the South Grove, about 1,000.&lt;ref name="CBTSP"/&gt;  According to [[Naturalist]] [[John Muir]] the forest protected by the park is: "A flowering glade in the very heart of the woods, forming a fine center for the student, and a delicious resting place for the weary."&lt;ref name="StJohn"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-live-winter-weather-california-iconic-sequoia-tree-in-california-state-1483942759-htmlstory.html |date=January 8, 2017 |location=Truckee, California |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=An iconic tunnel tree in a California state park is no more after huge storm

The North Grove includes two sequoias that were cut down or mutilated only to be reassembled in exhibits.  The "Discovery Tree" was noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852 and felled in 1853 leaving a giant stump and a section of trunk showing the holes made by the augers used to fell it.&lt;ref name="CBTSP"/&gt; It measured 25 feet in diameter at its base and was determined by ring count to be 1,244 years old when felled.  At the time the grove was discovered by white explorers, the Discovery Tree was measured by Dowd and others as the largest tree, and it was cut down to advertise the tourist attraction.  The stump was later turned into a dance floor.  John Muir wrote an essay titled "The Vandals Then Danced Upon the Stump!" to criticize the felling of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/13/travel/tr-hiking13|title=An autumn walk through Calaveras County's majestic groves|last=McKinney|first=John|date=2002-10-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second tree named the [[Mother of the Forest]] was stripped of its first 100 feet of bark. Today only a fire-blackened snag remains of the Mother of the Forest, and the Discovery Tree has been renamed the Big Stump; the largest tree in the North Grove today is the Empire State tree, which measures 30 feet at ground level and 23 feet at 6 feet above ground.&lt;ref&gt;North Grove Guidebook, Calaveras Big Trees State Park&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the popular North Grove, the park also now includes the South Grove, with a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} hiking trip into a grove of giant sequoias in their natural setting. The South Grove includes the Louis Agassiz tree, {{convert|250|ft|m}} tall and more than  {{convert|25|ft|m}} in diameter {{convert|6|ft|m}} above ground, the largest tree in the Calaveras groves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How Big are Big Trees? | url = http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=1146 | publisher = California State Parks | accessdate = October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807–1873).

Other attractions in the Park include the [[Stanislaus River]], Beaver Creek, the Lava Bluff Trail, and Bradley Trail.&lt;ref name="CBTSP"/&gt;

The park houses two main campgrounds with a total of 129 campsites, six picnic areas and hundreds of miles of established trails.&lt;ref name="CBTSP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18262">'''ChIP-sequencing''', also known as '''ChIP-seq''', is a method used to analyze [[protein]] interactions with [[DNA]]. ChIP-seq combines [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) with massively parallel [[DNA sequencing]] to identify the [[binding site]]s of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Previously, [[ChIP-on-chip]] was the most common technique utilized to study these protein–DNA relations.

==Uses==
ChIP-seq is used primarily to determine how [[transcription factors]] and other chromatin-associated proteins influence [[phenotype]]-affecting mechanisms. Determining how proteins interact with DNA to regulate [[gene expression]] is essential for fully understanding many biological processes and disease states. This [[epigenetic]] information is complementary to [[genotype]] and expression analysis. ChIP-seq technology is currently seen primarily as an alternative to [[ChIP-chip]] which requires a [[protein microarray|hybridization array]]. This necessarily introduces some bias, as an array is restricted to a fixed number of probes. Sequencing, by contrast, is thought to have less bias, although the sequencing bias of different sequencing technologies is not yet fully understood.

Specific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with transcription factors and other proteins can be isolated by [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]]. ChIP produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest ''[[in vivo]]''. Massively parallel sequence analyses are used in conjunction with whole-genome sequence databases to analyze the interaction pattern of any protein with DNA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = DS | last2 = Mortazavi | first2 = A | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Genome-wide mapping of in vivo protein–DNA interactions | url = | journal = Science | volume = 316 | issue = | pages = 1497–1502 | doi=10.1126/science.1141319 | pmid=17540862}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the pattern of any epigenetic [[chromatin]] modifications. This can be applied to the set of ChIP-able proteins and modifications, such as transcription factors, [[polymerase]]s and [[transcription (genetics)|transcriptional machinery]], [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural proteins]], [[protein modification]]s, and [[DNA modification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illumina.com/Documents/products/datasheets/datasheet_chip_sequence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to the dependence on specific antibodies, different methods have been developed to find the superset of all [[nucleosome]]-depleted or nucleosome-disrupted active regulatory regions in the genome, like [[DNase-Seq]] and [[FAIRE-Seq]].

==Workflow of ChIP-sequencing==
[[Image:Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing.svg|thumb|right|300px|ChIP-sequencing workflow]]

===ChIP===
[[ChIP]] is a powerful method to selectively enrich for DNA sequences bound by a particular protein in living [[cell (biology)|cells]]. However, the widespread use of this method has been limited by the lack of a sufficiently robust method to identify all of the enriched DNA sequences. The ChIP process enriches specific crosslinked DNA-protein complexes using an [[antibody]] against the protein of interest. For a good description of the ChIP wet lab protocol see [[ChIP-on-chip]]. [[Oligonucleotide]] adaptors are then added to the small stretches of DNA that were bound to the protein of interest to enable massively parallel sequencing.

===Sequencing===
After size selection, all the resulting ChIP-DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously using a genome sequencer. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, meaning that features can be located precisely on the chromosomes. ChIP-chip, by contrast, requires large sets of [[tiling array]]s for lower resolution.

There are many [[DNA sequencing#New sequencing methods|new sequencing methods]] used in this sequencing step. Some technologies that analyze the sequences can use [[cluster amplification]] of adapter-ligated ChIP DNA fragments on a solid [[flow cell]] substrate to create clusters of approximately 1000 clonal copies each. The resulting high density array of template clusters on the flow cell surface is sequenced by a Genome analyzing program. Each template cluster undergoes [[Pyrosequencing|sequencing-by-synthesis]] in parallel using novel fluorescently labelled reversible terminator nucleotides. Templates are sequenced base-by-base during each read. Then, the data collection and analysis software aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the ChIP-DNA fragments.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Sensitivity==
Sensitivity of this technology depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor.
The sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost. If abundant binders in large genomes have to be mapped with high sensitivity, costs are high as an enormously high number of sequence tags will be required. This is in contrast to ChIP-chip in which the costs are not correlated with sensitivity.

Unlike [[microarray]]-based ChIP methods, the precision of the ChIP-seq assay is not limited by the spacing of predetermined probes. By integrating a large number of short reads, highly precise binding site localization is obtained. Compared to ChIP-chip, ChIP-seq data can be used to locate the binding site within few tens of base pairs of the actual protein binding site. Tag densities at the binding sites are a good indicator of protein–DNA binding affinity,&lt;ref&gt;Jothi et al. (2008) Genome-wide identification of in vivo protein–DNA binding sites from ChIP-seq data. Nucleic Acids Res 36(16) 5221–5231.&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it easier to quantify and compare binding affinities of a protein to different DNA sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = BE | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = Genomic maps and comparative analysis of histone modifications in human and mouse | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 120 | issue = | pages = 169–181 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.001 | pmid=15680324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
STAT1 DNA association: ChIP-seq was used to study STAT1 targets in HeLA S3 cells. The performance of ChIP-seq was then compared to the alternative protein–DNA interaction methods of ChIP-PCR and ChIP-chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robertson | first1 = G | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Genome-wide profiles of STAT1 DNA association using chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing | url = | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 651–657 | doi=10.1038/nmeth1068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleosome Architecture of Promoters: Using ChIP-seq, it was determined that Yeast genes seem to have a minimal nucleosome-free promoter region of 150bp in which RNA polymerase can initiate transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = ChIP-Seq Data reveal nucleosome architecture of human promoters | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 831–832 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcription factor conservation: ChIP-seq was used to compare conservation of TFs in the forebrain and heart tissue in embryonic mice. The authors identified and validated the heart functionality of transcription enhancers, and determined that transcription enhancers for the heart are less conserved than those for the forebrain during the same developmental stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blow | first1 = M.

Genome-wide ChIP-seq: ChIP-sequencing was completed on the worm C. elegans to explore genome-wide binding sites of 22 transcription factors. Up to 20% of the annotated candidate genes were assigned to transcription factors. Several transcription factors were assigned to non-coding RNA regions and may be subject to developmental or environmental variables. The functions of some of the transcription factors were also identified. Some of the transcription factors regulate genes that control other transcription factors. These genes are not regulated by other factors. Most transcription factors serve as both targets and regulators of other factors, demonstrating a network of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Niu | first1 = W. | last2 = Lu | first2 = Z. J. | last3 = Zhong | first3 = M. | last4 = Sarov | first4 = M. | last5 = Murray | first5 = J. I. | last6 = Brdlik | first6 = C. M. | last7 = Janette | first7 = J. | last8 = Chen | first8 = C. | last9 = Alves | first9 = P. | last10 = Preston | first10 = E. | last11 = Slightham | first11 = C. | last12 = Jiang | first12 = L. | last13 = Hyman | first13 = A.

Inferring regulatory network: ChIP-seq signal of Histone modification were shown to  be more correlated with transcription factor motifs at promoters in comparison to RNA level.&lt;ref&gt;Vibhor Kumar, Masafumi Muratani, Nirmala Arul Rayan, Petra Kraus, Thomas Lufkin, Huck Hui Ng and Shyam Prabhakar, Uniform, optimal signal processing of mapped deep-sequencing data, Nature biotechnology, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Hence author proposed that using histone modification ChIP-seq would provide more reliable inference of gene-regulatory networks in comparison to other methods based on expression.

ChIP-seq offers an alternative to ChIP-chip. STAT1 experimental ChIP-seq data have a high degree of similarity to results obtained by ChIP-chip for the same type of experiment, with &gt;64% of peaks in shared genomic regions. Because the data are sequence reads, ChIP-seq offers a rapid analysis pipeline (as long as a high-quality genome sequence is available for read mapping, and the genome doesn't have repetitive content that confuses the mapping process) as well as the potential to detect mutations in binding-site sequences, which may directly support any observed changes in protein binding and gene regulation.

==Computational analysis==
As with many high-throughput sequencing approaches, ChIP-seq generates extremely large data sets, for which appropriate computational analysis methods are required. To predict DNA-binding sites from ChIP-seq read count data, [[peak calling]] methods have been developed. The most popular method{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} is MACS which empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Y | last2 = Liu | first2 = T | last3 = Meyer | first3 = CA | last4 = Eeckhoute | first4 = J | last5 = Johnson | first5 = DS | last6 = Bernstein | first6 = BE | last7 = Nusbaum | first7 = C | last8 = Myers | first8 = RM | last9 = Brown | first9 = M | last10 = Li | first10 = W | last11 = Liu | first11 = XS | year = 2008 | title = Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) | journal = Genome Biol | volume = 9 | issue = 9| page = R137 | doi=10.1186/gb-2008-9-9-r137 | pmid=18798982 | pmc=2592715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relevant computational problem is Differential peak calling, which identifies significant differences in two ChIP-seq signals from distinct biological conditions. Differential peak callers segment two ChIP-seq signals and identify differential peaks using [[Hidden Markov Model]]s. Examples for two-stage differential peak callers are ChIPDiff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=Sung|author2=Wei |author3=Lin |title=An HMM approach to genome-wide identification of differential histone modification sites from ChIP-seq data|journal=Bioinformatics|date=28 July 2008|volume=24|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn402|pages=2344–2349|pmid=18667444}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ODIN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allhoff|first=Costa|author2=Sere|author3=Chauvistre|author4=Lin|author5=Zenke|title=Detecting differential peaks in ChIP-seq signals with ODIN|journal=Bioinformatics|date=24 October 2014|volume=30|issue=24|pages=3467–3475|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btu722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}

A '''checkweigher''' is an automatic or manual machine for checking the [[weight]] of packaged commodities.
It is normally found at the offgoing end of a [[production line|production process]] and is used to ensure that the weight of a pack of the commodity is within specified limits.  Any [[packaging|packs]] that are outside the tolerance are taken out of line automatically.

A checkweigher can weigh in excess of 500 items per minute (depending on carton size and accuracy requirements).
Checkweighers can be used with [[metal detector]]s and [[X-ray machine]]s to enable other attributes of the pack to be checked and acted upon accordingly.

== A typical machine ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AP Dataweigh 3 bed checkweigher with touchscreen panel.jpg|thumbnail|right|A 3 Bed Checkweigher with touchscreen controls by AP Dataweigh http://www.apdataweigh.com]] --&gt;
An automatic checkweigher incorporates a series of [[conveyor belt]]s.  These checkweighers are known also as [[belt weigher]]s, in-motion scales, conveyor scales, dynamic scales, and in-line scales. In filler applications, they are known as [[check scale]]s.  Typically, there are three belts or chain beds:

* An infeed belt that may change the speed of the package and to bring it up or down to a speed required for weighing.  The infeed is also sometimes used as an indexer, which sets the gap between products to an optimal distance for weighing.  It sometimes has special belts or chains to position the product for weighing.
* A weigh belt. This is typically mounted on a weight transducer which can typically be a strain-gauge [[load cell]] or a servo-balance (also known as a force-balance), or sometimes known as a split-beam.  Some older machines may pause the weigh bed belt before taking the weight measurement.  This may limit line speed and throughput.
*A reject belt that provides a method of removing an out-of-tolerance package from the conveyor line.  The reject can vary by application.  Some require an air-amplifier to blow small products off the belt, but heavier applications require a linear or radial actuator.  Some fragile products are rejected by "dropping" the bed so that the product can slide gently into a bin or other conveyor.

For high-speed precision scales, a load cell using electromagnetic force restoration (EMFR) is appropriate. This kind of system charges an inductive coil, effectively floating the weigh bed in an electromagnetic field.  When the weight is added, the movement of a ferrous material through that coil causes a fluctuation in the coil current proportional to the weight of the object. Other technologies used include strain gauges and vibrating wire load cells.

It is usual for a built-in computer to take many weight readings from the transducer over the time that the package is on the weigh bed to ensure an accurate weight reading.

Calibration is critical.  A lab scale, which usually is in an isolated chamber pressurized with dry nitrogen(pressurized at sea level) can weigh an object within plus or minus 100th of a gram, but ambient air pressure is a factor. This is straightforward when there is no motion, but in motion there is a factor that is not obvious-noise from the motion of a weigh belt,  vibration,  air-conditioning or refrigeration which can cause drafts. Torque on a load cell causes erratic readings.

A dynamic, in-motion checkweigher takes samples, and analyzes them to form an accurate weight over a given time period. In most cases, there is a trigger from an optical(or ultrasonic) device to signal the passing of a package.  Once the trigger fires, there is a delay set to allow the package to move to the "sweet spot" (center) of the weigh bed to sample the weight.   The weight is sampled for a given duration.  If either of these times are wrong, the weight will be wrong. There seems to be no scientific method to predict these timings. Some systems have a "graphing" feature to do this, but it is generally more of an empirical method that works best.

* A reject conveyor to enable the out-of-tolerance packages to be removed from the normal flow while still moving at the conveyor velocity. The reject mechanism can be one of several types. Among these are a simple pneumatic pusher to push the reject pack sideways from the belt, a diverting arm to sweep the pack sideways and a reject belt that lowers or lifts to divert the pack vertically. A typical checkweigher usually has a bin to collect the out-of-tolerance packs. Sometimes these bins are provided with a lock, to prevent that out of specification items are fed back on the conveyor belt.

== Tolerance methods ==

There are several [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]] methods:
* The traditional "minimum weight" system where weights below a specified weight are rejected. Normally the minimum weight is the weight that is printed on the pack or a weight level that exceeds that to allow for weight losses after production such as evaporation of commodities that have a moisture content.  The larger wholesale companies have mandated that any product shipped to them have accurate weight checks such that a customer can be confident that they are getting the amount of product for which they paid.  These wholesalers charge large fees for inaccurately filled packages.
* The [[Estimated sign|European Average Weight System]] which follows three specified rules known as the "Packers Rules".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | id = }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data collection ==
There is also a requirement under the European Average Weight System that data collected by checkweighers is archived and is available for inspection. Most modern checkweighers are therefore equipped with communications ports to enable the actual pack weights and derived data to be uploaded to a host computer. This data can also be used for management information enabling processes to be fine-tuned and production performance monitored.

Checkweighers that are equipped with high speed communications such as [[Ethernet]] ports are capable of integrating themselves into groups such that a group of production lines that are producing identical products can be considered as one production line for the purposes of weight control. For example, a line that is running with a low average weight can be complemented by another that is running with a high average weight such that the aggregate of the two lines will still comply with rules.

An alternative is to program the checkweigher to check bands of different weight tolerances.  For instance, the total valid weight is 100&amp;nbsp;grams ±15&amp;nbsp;grams.  This means that the product can weigh 85 g to 115 g.  However, if 10,000 packs a day are being produced, and most are 110 g, 100&amp;nbsp;kg of product is being lost.  If it is run closer to 85 g, there may be a high rejection rate.

Example: A checkweigher is programmed to indicate 5 zones with resolution to 1 g:
# Under Reject.... the product weighs 84.9 g or less
# Under OK........ the product weighs 85 g, but less than 95 g
# Valid........... the product weighs 96 g, but less than 105 g
# Over OK......... the product weighs 105 g, and less than 114 g
# Over Reject..... the product weighs over the 115 g limit

With a check weigher programmed as a zone checkweigher, the data collection over the networks, as well as local statistics, can indicate the need to check the settings on the upstream equipment to better control flow into the packaging.  In some cases the dynamic scale sends a signal to a filler, for instance, in real-time, controlling the actual flow into a barrel, can, bag, etc.  In many cases a checkweigher has a light-tree with different lights to indicate the variation of the zone weight of each product.

This data can be used to determine if an issue exists with an upstream filling, or packaging, machine.  A checkweigher can send a signal to the machine to increase or decrease the amount put into a package.  This can result in a payback&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://vbssys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/checkweigher-case-study_031715.pdf|title = Checkweigher Case Study|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the checkweigher since producers will be better able to control the amount of give-away.  See [http://vbssys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/checkweigher-case-study_031715.pdf checkweigher case study] outlining ground beef and packaging savings.

== Application considerations ==
Speed and accuracy that can be achieved by a checkweigher is influenced by the following:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* Pack length or dia
* Pack weight
* Line speed required
* Pack content (solid or liquid)
* Motor technology
* Stabilization time of the weight transducer
* Airflow causing readings in error
* Vibrations from machinery causing unnecessary rejects
* Sensitivity to temperature, as the load cells ''can'' be temperature sensitive
{{div col end}}

== Applications ==
In-motion scales are dynamic machines that can be designed to perform thousands of tasks.  Some are used as simple caseweighers at the end of the conveyor line to ensure the overall finished package product is within its target weight.

An in motion [[conveyor]] checkweigher can be used to detect missing pieces of a kit, such as a cell phone package that is missing the manual, or other collateral. Checkweighers are typically used on the incoming conveyor chain, and the output pre-packaging [[conveyor]] chain in a poultry processing plant.  The bird is weighed when it comes onto the [[conveyor]], then after processing and washing at the end, the network computer can determine whether or not the bird absorbed too much water, which as it is further processed, will be drained, making the bird under its target weight.

A high speed [[conveyor]] scale can be used to change the pacing, or pitch of the products on the line by speeding, or slowing the product speed to change the distance between packs before reaching a different speed going into a conveyor machine that is boxing multiple packs into a box.  The "pitch" is the measurement of the product as it comes down the conveyor line from leading edge to leading edge.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dual Lane High Resolution Checkweigher by AP Dataweigh.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dual Lane High Speed, High Resolution Checkweigher by AP Dataweigh [[http:www.apdataweigh.com]]]] --&gt;
A checkweigher can be used to count packs, and the aggregate (total) weight of the boxes going onto a pallet for shipment, including the ability to read each package's weight and cubic dimensions. The controller computer can print a shipping label and a bar-code label to identify the weight, the cubic dimensions, ship-to address, and other data for machine ID through the shipment of the product. A receiving checkweigher for the shipment can read the label with a bar code scanner, and determine if the shipment is as it was before the transportation carrier received it from the shipper's loading dock, and determine if a box is missing, or something was pilfered or broken in transit.

Checkweighers are also used for [[Quality management]]. For instance, raw material for machining a bearing is weighed prior to beginning the process, and after the process,  the quality inspector expects that a certain amount of metal was removed in the finishing process. The finished bearings are checkweighed, and bearings over- or underweight are rejected for physical inspection.  This is a benefit to the inspector, since he can have a high confidence that the ones not rejected are within machining tolerance. A common usage is for throttling plastic extruders such that a bottle used to package detergent meets that requirements of the finished packager.

[[Quality management]] can use a checkweigher for [[Nondestructive testing]] to verify finished goods using common [[Evaluation methods]] to detect pieces missing from a "finished" product, such as grease from a bearing, or a missing roller within the housing.

Checkweighers can be built with metal detectors, x-ray machines, open-flap detection, bar-code scanners, holographic scanners, temperature sensors, vision inspectors, timing screws to set the timing and spacing between product, indexing gates and concentrator ducts to line up the product into a designated area on the conveyor. An industrial motion checkweigher can sort products from a fraction of a gram to many, many kilograms.  In English units, is this from less than 100th of an ounce to as much as 500&amp;nbsp;lbs or more. Specialized checkweighers can weigh commercial aircraft, and even find their center-of-gravity. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Checkweigher with integrated Metal Detection by AP Dataweigh.jpg|thumbnail|right|Single Lane In-Motion Checkweigher with Integrated Metal Detection and Touchscreen Controls by AP Dataweigh http://www.apdataweigh.com ]] --&gt;

Checkweighers can operate at very high speeds, processing products weighing fractions of a gram at over 100m/m (meters per minute) and materials such as pharmaceuticals and 200&amp;nbsp;lb bags of produce at over 100fpm(feet per minute).  They can be designed in many shapes and sizes, hung from ceilings, raised on mezzanines, operated in ovens or in refrigerators.  Their conveying medium can be industrial belting, low-static belting, chains similar to bicycle chains(but much smaller), or interlocked chain belts of any width.  They can have chain belts made of special materials, different polymers, metals, etc.

Checkweighers are used in cleanrooms, dry atmosphere environments, wet environments, produce barns, food processing, drug processing, etc.  Checkweighers are specified by the kind of environment, and the kind of cleaning will be used.  Typically, a checkweigher for produce is made of mild steel, and one that will be cleaned with harsh chemicals, such as bleach, will be made with all stainless steel parts, even the [[Load cell]]s.  These machines are labeled "full washdown", and must have every part and component specified to survive the washdown environment.

Checkweighers are operated in some applications for extremely long periods of time- 24/7 year round.  Generally, conveyor lines are not stopped unless there is maintenance required, or there is an emergency stop, called an E-stop.  Checkweighers operating in high density conveyor lines may have numerous special equipments in their design to ensure that if an E-stop occurs, all power going to all motors is removed until the E-stop is cleared and reset.

'''Frederick Cope''' (July 9, 1860 &amp;ndash; September 19, 1897) was the third [[Mayor]] of [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, serving from 1892 to 1893.

Cope was born in [[Oxford]], [[England]] in 1860. After moving to Canada, and later [[British Columbia]], he was president of the British Columbia Building Association and operated a dry goods, millinery, tailoring and grocery business.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780888940841|last=Davis|first=Chuck|publisher=J.J.

Cope defeated John Thomas Carroll in the 1892 mayoral election, one of the most hotly contested and closest in the city's history, winning with an 11-vote majority. He is the youngest elected mayor in the history of Vancouver, having been aged 32 at the time of his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Todd |first=Douglas |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2011/04/05/the-mayors-of-vancouver-a-lively-history/ |title=The Mayors of Vancouver: A lively history &amp;#124; Vancouver Sun |publisher=Blogs.vancouversun.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the election, he garnered support of the city's business class, and the ''Vancouver World'' newspaper. His council however would consist of "reformers" of the working class, in opposition to Cope's representation of the business class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2P-wIZfFKwC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=fred+cope+vancouver#v=onepage&amp;q=fred%20cope%20vancouver&amp;f=false |title=Making Vancouver: Class, Status, and Social Boundaries, 1863-1913 - Robert A J McDonald - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= 2011-11-01|accessdate=2014-02-28|isbn=9780774842273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his mayoralty, the city experienced an economic downturn; Cope responded by attempting to limit civic expenses, including the laying off of city employees, and initiating cutbacks. He also advocated for the Canada-Australia Steam Line, with the inaugural ship arriving in June 1893.

Cope was a [[Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/vancouver_mayors/cope_f.html |title=Frederick Cope |publisher=Freemasonry.bcy.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drowned during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in 1897 at Summit Lake, [[Yukon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagwaystories.org/2011/09/19/frederick-buscombe-cope/ |title=Fred Cope |publisher=Skagway Stories |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; when his horse fell while crossing the body of water. He tried unsuccessfully to rescue the horse and was pulled away by the undercurrents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.library.uvic.ca/colonist/tc/1897/10/06/18971006003.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307091529/http://europa.library.uvic.ca/colonist/tc/1897/10/06/18971006003.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was later transported back to Vancouver in the same vessel along with notorious American con artist [[Soapy Smith]] which resulted in a mixup of the bodies at their respective funerals. They were later switched upon the realization of the error.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; He was later buried at [[Mountain View Cemetery (Vancouver)|Mountain View Cemetery]] in Vancouver.

'''Gary Arlen Kildall''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|d|ˌ|ɔː|l}}; May 19, 1942&amp;nbsp;– July 11, 1994) was an American [[computer scientist]] and [[microcomputer]] [[entrepreneur]] who created the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] and founded [[Digital Research|Digital Research, Inc.]] (DRI). Kildall was one of the first people to see [[microprocessor]]s as fully capable [[computer]]s rather than equipment controllers and to organize a company around this concept.&lt;ref name="chronicles"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Special Edition: Gary Kildall |series=The Computer Chronicles |series-link=Computer Chronicles |airdate=1995 |url=https://archive.org/details/GaryKild}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also co-hosted the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] TV show ''[[Computer Chronicles|The Computer Chronicles]]''. Although his career in computing spanned more than two decades, he is mainly remembered in connection with [[IBM]]'s unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to license CP/M for the [[IBM PC]].

== Early life ==
Gary Kildall was born and grew up in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where his family operated a [[seafaring]] school. His father, Joseph Kildall, was a captain of Norwegian heritage. His mother Emma was half-[[Sweden|Swedish]]—Gary's grandmother was born in Långbäck, Sweden, in [[Skellefteå Municipality]] but emigrated to Canada at 23 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-first=Ulrika |author-last=Andersson |title=Skellefteåättling kunde ha varit Bill Gates |work=Norra Västerbotten |date=2009-01-19 |access-date=2009-05-07 |url=http://norran.se/familj/article233923.ece |language=Swedish |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524153356/http://norran.se/familj/article233923.ece |archive-date=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary attended the [[University of Washington]] (UW) hoping to become a mathematics teacher, but became increasingly interested in computer technology. After receiving his degree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Experiments in large-scale computer direct access storage manipulation |author-first=Gary Arlen |author-last=Kildall |author-link=Gary Kildall |type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |date=December 1968 |id=Thesis No. 17341&lt;!-- GKMS.WS4 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; he fulfilled a [[conscription|draft]] obligation to the [[United States Navy]] by teaching at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS) in [[Monterey, California]].&lt;ref name="swaine"&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Michael |author-last=Swaine |author-link=Michael Swaine (technical author) |date=1997-04-01 |title=Gary Kildall and Collegial Entrepreneurship |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]] |url=http://www.ddj.com/184410428 |access-date=2006-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Being within an hour's drive of [[Silicon Valley]], Kildall heard about the first commercially available microprocessor, the [[Intel 4004]]. He bought one of the processors and began writing experimental programs for it. To learn more about the processors, he worked at [[Intel]] as a [[consultant]] on his days off.

Kildall briefly returned to UW and finished his [[doctorate]] in [[computer science]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global expression optimization during compilation |author-first=Gary Arlen |author-last=Kildall |author-link=Gary Kildall |type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=[[University of Washington]], Computer Science Group |location=Seattle, Washington, USA |date=May 1972 |id=Thesis No. 20506, Technical Report No. 72-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; then resumed teaching at NPS. He published a paper that introduced the theory of [[data-flow analysis]] used today in [[optimizing compiler]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Gary Arlen |author-last=Kildall |author-link=Gary Kildall |date=1973-10-01 |title=A Unified Approach to Global Program Optimization |journal=Proceedings of the 1st Annual [[ACM SIGACT]]-SIGPLAN [[Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages]] (POPL) |location=Boston, Massachusetts, USA |pages=194–206 |doi=10.1145/512927.512945 |url=http://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/546/451/a_unified_approach_to_global_program_optimization.pdf |access-date=2006-11-20 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629213307/http://static.aminer.org/pdf/PDF/000/546/451/a_unified_approach_to_global_program_optimization.pdf |archive-date=2017-06-29}} ([http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=512945&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM])&lt;/ref&gt;
and he continued to experiment with microcomputers and the emerging technology of [[floppy disk]]s. Intel lent him systems using the [[Intel 8008|8008]] and [[Intel 8080|8080]] processors, and in 1973, he developed the first [[high-level programming language]] for microprocessors, called [[PL/M]].&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt; He created [[CP/M]] the same year to enable the 8080 to control a floppy drive, combining for the first time all the essential components of a computer at the microcomputer scale. He demonstrated CP/M to Intel, but Intel had little interest and chose to market PL/M instead.&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt;

== Business career ==

=== CP/M ===
Kildall and his wife Dorothy established a company, originally called "[[Intergalactic Digital Research]]" (later renamed as [[Digital Research|Digital Research, Inc]]), to market CP/M through advertisements in hobbyist magazines. Digital Research licensed CP/M for the [[IMSAI 8080]], a popular clone of the [[Altair 8800]]. As more manufacturers licensed CP/M, it became a [[de facto standard]] and had to support an increasing number of hardware variations. In response, Kildall pioneered the concept of a [[BIOS]], a set of simple programs stored in the computer hardware (ROM or EPROM chip) that enabled CP/M to run on different systems without modification.&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt;

CP/M's quick success took Kildall by surprise, and he was slow to update it for [[Floppy disk format|high density floppy disks]] and [[hard disk]]s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} After hardware manufacturers talked about creating a rival operating system, Kildall started a rush project to develop [[CP/M 2]].&lt;ref name="eubanksrecollections"&gt;{{cite interview |editor-first=Clive |editor-last=Akass |author-first=Gordon |author-last=Eubanks |author-link=Gordon Eubanks |title=Interview: Gordon Eubanks, Former Student &amp; CEO of Oblix, Inc. |work=Recollections of Gary Kildall |publisher=DigitalResearch.biz |url=http://www.digitalresearch.biz/EUBANKS.HTM |access-date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981, at the peak of its popularity, CP/M ran on 3,000 different computer models and DRI had $5.4 million in yearly revenues.&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt;

=== IBM dealings ===
[[IBM]], presided by [[John R. Opel]], approached Digital Research in 1980, at [[Bill Gates]]' suggestion,&lt;ref name="Isaacson_2014"&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Walter |author-last=Isaacson |author-link=Walter Isaacson |title=The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution |title-link=The Innovators: How a Group of Inventors, Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution |date=2014 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=978-1476708690 |page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; to negotiate the purchase of a forthcoming version of CP/M called [[CP/M-86]] for the [[IBM PC]]. Gary had left negotiations to his wife, Dorothy, as he usually did, while he and colleague and developer of [[MP/M]] operating system [[Tom Rolander]] used Gary's private airplane to deliver software to manufacturer [[Bill Godbout]].&lt;ref name="chronicles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harddrive"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=James |author-last1=Wallace |author-first2=Jim |author-last2=Erickson |date=1993 |title=Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire |isbn=0-88730-629-2 |publisher=[[HarperBusiness]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the IBM representatives would explain the purpose of their visit, they insisted that Dorothy sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]]. On the advice of DRI attorney Gerry Davis, Dorothy refused to sign the agreement without Gary's approval. Gary returned in the afternoon and tried to move the discussion with IBM forward, but accounts disagree on whether he signed the non-disclosure agreement, as well as if he ever met with the IBM representatives.&lt;ref name="fireinthevalley"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Freiberger |author-first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Freiberger |author-first2=Michael |author-last2=Swaine |author-link2=Michael Swaine (technical author) |title=Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer |orig-year=1984 |edition=2nd |date=2000 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=0-07-135892-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various reasons have been given for the two companies failing to reach an agreement. DRI, which had only a few products, might have been unwilling to sell its main product to IBM for a one-time payment rather than its usual [[royalties|royalty]]-based plan.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Jeffrey |author-last=Young |date=1997-07-07 |title=Gary Kildall: The DOS That Wasn't |journal=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/0707/6001336a.html |access-date=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dorothy might have believed that the company could not deliver CP/M-86 on IBM's proposed schedule, as the company was busy developing an implementation of the [[PL/I]] programming language for [[Data General]].&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Harold |author-last1=Evans |author-link1=Harold Evans |author-first2=Gail |author-last2=Buckland |author-first3=David |author-last3=Lefer |author-link3=David Lefer |date=2004 |title=They Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine: Two Centuries of Innovators |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Co.]] |isbn=978-0-316-27766-2 |id={{ISBN|0-316-27766-5}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Or, the IBM representatives might have been annoyed that DRI had spent hours on what they considered a routine formality.&lt;ref name="harddrive"/&gt; According to Kildall, the IBM representatives took the same flight to [[Florida]] that night that he and Dorothy took for their vacation, and they negotiated further on the flight, reaching a handshake agreement. IBM lead negotiator Jack Sams insisted that he never met Gary, and one IBM colleague has confirmed that Sams said so at the time. He accepted that someone else in his group might have been on the same flight, but noted that he flew back to Seattle to talk with [[Microsoft]] again.&lt;ref name="harddrive"/&gt;

Sams related the story to Gates, who had already agreed to provide a [[BASIC]] interpreter and several other programs for the PC. Gates' impression of the story was that Gary capriciously "went flying", as he would later tell reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=Stephen |author-last1=Manes |author-link1=Stephen Manes |author-first2=Paul |author-last2=Andrews |date=1992 |title=Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry—and Made Himself the Richest Man in America |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |isbn=0-671-88074-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sams left Gates with the task of finding a usable operating system, and a few weeks later he proposed using the operating system [[86-DOS]]—an independently developed operating system that implemented Kildall's CP/M [[Application programming interface|API]]—from [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP). [[Paul Allen]] negotiated a licensing deal with SCP. Allen had 86-DOS adapted for IBM's hardware, and IBM shipped it as [[PC&amp;nbsp;DOS]].&lt;ref name="fireinthevalley"/&gt;

Kildall obtained a copy of PC&amp;nbsp;DOS, examined it, and concluded that it infringed on CP/M. When he asked Gerry Davis what legal options were available, Davis told him that intellectual property law for software was not clear enough to sue.&lt;ref name="hamm"&gt;{{cite journal |author-first1=Steve |author-last1=Hamm |author-first2=Jay |author-last2=Greene |title=The Man Who Could Have Been Bill Gates - A new book says Gates got the rewards due Gary Kildall.

Instead Kildall only threatened IBM with legal action, and IBM responded with a proposal to offer CP/M-86 as an option for the PC in return for a release of liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |author-first=Gordon |author-last=Eubanks |author-link=Gordon Eubanks |editor-last=Morrow |editor-first=Daniel S. |date=2000-11-08 |location=Cupertino, CA, USA |title=Gordon Eubanks Oral History |work=[[Computerworld]] Honors Program International Archives |url=http://www.cwhonors.org/archives/histories/Eubanks.pdf |access-date=2006-11-20 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326073320/http://www.cwhonors.org/archives/histories/Eubanks.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kildall accepted, believing that IBM's new system (like its previous personal computers) would not be a significant commercial success.&lt;ref name="scoble"&gt;{{cite interview |author-first=Tom |author-last=Rolander |author-link=Tom Rolander |editor-last=Scoble |editor-first=Robert |title=Scoble Show |work=PodTech.net |date=2007-08-08 |url=http://scobleizer.com/the-rest-of-the-story-behind-microsofts-os-deal-with-ibm/ |access-date=2016-11-11&lt;!-- http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/technology/1593/the-rest-of-the-story-how-bill-gates-beat-gary-kildall-in-os-war-part-1 |access-date=2007-09-13 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When the IBM PC was introduced, IBM sold its operating system as an unbundled option. One of the operating system options was PC&amp;nbsp;DOS, priced at US$40. PC&amp;nbsp;DOS was seen as a practically necessary option; most software titles required it and without it the IBM PC was limited to its built-in [[IBM Cassette BASIC|Cassette BASIC]]. CP/M-86 shipped a few months later six times more expensive at $240, but sold poorly against DOS and enjoyed far less software support.&lt;ref name="chronicles"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|Activenture|KnowledgeSet|Prometheus Light and Sound}}Later work ===
With the loss of the IBM deal, Gary and Dorothy found themselves under pressure to bring in more experienced management, and Gary's influence over the company waned. He worked in various experimental and research projects, such as a version of CP/M with [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] ([[MP/M]]) and an implementation of the [[Logo programming language]].&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt; He hoped that Logo, an educational dialect of [[Lisp programming language|LISP]], would supplant BASIC in education, but it did not.&lt;ref name="eulogy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomrolander.com/GaryKildall/In%20memory%20of%20Gary%20Kildall.htm |access-date=2006-11-30 |author-first=Tom |author-last=Rolander |author-link=Tom Rolander |title=In Memory of GARY A.

After seeing a demonstration of the [[Apple Lisa]], Kildall oversaw the creation of DRI's own [[graphical user interface]], called [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]. [[Novell]] acquired DRI in 1991 in a deal that netted millions for Kildall.&lt;ref name="hamm"/&gt;

Kildall also pursued computing-related projects outside DRI. During seven years, from 1983 to 1990 he co-hosted a [[public television]] program on the side, called ''[[Computer Chronicles]]'', that followed trends in personal computing.
In 1984 he started another company, ''Activenture'', which adapted [[optical disc]] technology for computer use.&lt;ref name="Activenture"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Personal Computer - The People and the Technology |author-first=Roy A. |author-last=Allan |publisher=Allan Publishing |date=2001 |edition=1 |type=ebook |isbn=0-9689108-3-1 |url=https://archive.org/stream/A_History_of_the_Personal_Computer/eBook00#page/n3/mode/1up&lt;!-- https://archive.org/stream/A_History_of_the_Personal_Computer/eBook20_djvu.txt--&gt; |access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1985 it was renamed into ''KnowledgeSet'' and released the first computer [[encyclopedia]] in June 1985, a [[CD-ROM]] version of [[Grolier]]'s ''[[Academic American Encyclopedia]]''&lt;ref name="fireinthevalley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Activenture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; named ''[[The Electronic Encyclopedia]]''&lt;!-- 1985 version, later version called "[[The New Electronic Encyclopedia]]" --&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=CD ROM Conference: Lured by 600 Megabytes on Disk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmtbry-ytXgC&amp;pg=PA42 |access-date=2016-11-19 |author-first=Craig L. |author-last=Stark |journal=[[PC Magazine]] |date=1986-04-29 |page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; later acquired by [[Banta Corporation|Banta]].&lt;ref name="F6S_2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tom Rolander - Serial entrepreneur and Emergent Farming co-founder |url=https://www.f6s.com/tomrolander |access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kildall's final business venture, known as ''Prometheus Light and Sound'' (PLS) and based in [[Austin, Texas]], developed a home [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] system&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt; that integrated [[Plain old telephone service|land-line telephones]] with [[mobile phone]]s.

== Personal life ==
Kildall's colleagues recall him as creative, easygoing, and adventurous. In addition to flying, he loved [[sports car]]s, [[auto racing]], and [[boating]], and he had a lifelong love of the sea.&lt;ref name="chronicles"/&gt;&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt;

Although Kildall preferred to leave the IBM affair in the past and to be known for his work before and afterward, he continually faced comparisons between himself and Bill Gates as well as fading memories of his contributions. A legend grew around the fateful IBM-DRI meeting (encouraged by Gates and various journalists),{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} suggesting that Kildall had irresponsibly taken the day off for a recreational flight, and he became tired of constantly having to refute that story.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; In later years, he had occasional private expressions of bitterness at being overshadowed by Microsoft.&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt;

Kildall was annoyed when the University of Washington asked him, as a distinguished graduate, to attend their computer science program anniversary in 1992, but gave the keynote speech to Gates, a dropout from Harvard. In response he started writing his memoir, ''Computer Connections''.&lt;ref name="hamm"/&gt; The memoir,&lt;ref name="Shustek_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kildall_1993"/&gt; which he distributed only to a few friends, expressed his frustration that people did not seem to value elegance in software,&lt;ref name="eulogy"/&gt; and it said of Gates, "He is divisive. He is manipulative. He is a user. He has taken much from me and the industry." In an appendix he called DOS "plain and simple theft" because its first 26 [[system call]]s worked the same as CP/M's.&lt;ref name="gatesshadow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/1994/0714.html |author-last=Andrews |author-first=Paul |date=1994-07-14 |title=A Career Spent in Gates' Shadow—Computer Pioneer Dies at 52 |journal=[[Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He accused IBM of contriving the price difference between PC&amp;nbsp;DOS and CP/M-86 in order to marginalize CP/M. The journalist [[Harold Evans]] used the memoir as a source for a chapter about Kildall in the 2004 book ''They Made America'', concluding that Microsoft had robbed Kildall of his inventions.&lt;ref name="evans"/&gt; IBM veterans from the PC project disputed the book's description of events, and Microsoft described it as "one-sided and inaccurate."&lt;ref name="hamm"/&gt;
In August 2016, Kildall's family made the first part of his memoir available to the public.&lt;ref name="Perry_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/geek-life/history/cpm-creator-gary-kildalls-memoirs-released-as-free-download |title=CP/M Creator Gary Kildall's Memoirs Released as Free Download |author-first=Tekla S. |author-last=Perry |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |date=2016-08-03 |access-date=2016-11-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117232914/http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/geek-life/history/cpm-creator-gary-kildalls-memoirs-released-as-free-download |archive-date=2016-11-17 |quote=Later chapters, they indicated, did "not reflect his true self," but rather his struggles with alcoholism, and will remain unpublished.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shustek_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/in-his-own-words-gary-kildall/ |title=In His Own Words: Gary Kildall |author-first=Len |author-last=Shustek |date=2016-08-02 |work=Remarkable People |publisher=[[Computer History Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kildall_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |orig-year=1993 |date=2016-08-02 |title=Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry |author-first=Gary Arlen |author-last=Kildall |author-link=Gary Kildall |editor-first1=Scott |editor-last1=Kildall |editor-link=Scott Kildall |editor-first2=Kristin |editor-last2=Kildall |publisher=Kildall Family |type=Manuscript, part 1 |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/computer-history-museum-license-agreement-for-the-kildall-manuscript/ |access-date=2016-11-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://archive.is/20161117231531/http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/computer-history-museum-license-agreement-for-the-kildall-manuscript/ |archive-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;!-- http://s3data.computerhistory.org/kildall-p.1-78-publishable-lowres.pdf--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling DRI to Novell had made Kildall a wealthy man, and he moved to the West Lake Hills suburb of Austin. His Austin house was a lakeside property, with stalls for several sports cars, plus a video studio in the basement. Kildall owned and flew his own [[Learjet]] private jet airplane and had at least one boat on the lake. While in Austin he also participated in volunteer efforts to assist children with [[HIV/AIDS]]. He owned a mansion with a panoramic ocean view in [[Pebble Beach, California]], near the headquarters of DRI.

== Death ==
On July 8, 1994, Kildall fell at a Monterey, California [[biker bar]] and hit his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-first=Clive |author-last=Akass |title=The man who gave Bill Gates the world - Gary Kildall was one of the founding fathers of the PC but he is remembered now for his greatest mistake |journal=[[Personal Computer World]] |date=2006-08-11 |url=http://www.pcw.co.uk/personal-computer-world/analysis/2162044/man-gave-bill-gates-world |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011233635/http://www.pcw.co.uk/personal-computer-world/analysis/2162044/man-gave-bill-gates-world |archive-date=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact circumstances of the injury remain unclear.

He is buried in [[Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park]] in north Seattle.

== Recognition ==
Following the announcement of Kildall's death, Bill Gates commented that he was "one of the original pioneers of the PC revolution" and "a very creative computer scientist who did excellent work. Although we were competitors, I always had tremendous respect for his contributions to the PC industry. His untimely death was very unfortunate and his work will be missed."&lt;ref name="chronicles"/&gt;

In March 1995, Kildall was posthumously honored by the [[Software Publishers Association]] (now the [[Software and Information Industry Association]]) for his contributions to the microcomputer industry:&lt;ref name="swaine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wharton_1994"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/1994/0801.html |access-date=2016-11-18 |title=Gary Kildall, industry pioneer, dead at 52: created first microcomputer languages, disk operating systems |journal=[[Microprocessor Report]] |publisher=[[MicroDesign Resources Inc.]] (MDR) |author-first=John |author-last=Wharton |volume=8 |number=10 |date=1994-08-01 |type=PDF |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161118222925/http://tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/1994/0801.html |archive-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the city of Pacific Grove installed a commemorative plaque outside Kildall's former residence, which also served as the early headquarters of Digital Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author-last=Sammon |author-first=John |title=Computer pioneer honored in Pacific Grove |url=http://www.montereyherald.com/News/Local/ci_25645008/Computer-pioneer-honored-in-Pacific-Grove |journal=[[Monterey Herald]] |date=2014-04-27 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030700/http://www.montereyherald.com/News/Local/ci_25645008/Computer-pioneer-honored-in-Pacific-Grove |archive-date=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I was somewhat reluctant to adapt CP/M to yet another controller, and thus the notion of a separated Basic I/O System (BIOS) evolved. In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute [[CP/M 1.3|CP/M version 1.3]], which eventually evolved into an operating system called [[IMDOS]]. […]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''K XVII''''' was one of five {{sclass-|K XIV|submarine}}s built for the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]. She served during [[World War II]].

==Design==
HNLMS ''K XVII'' was the last design of J.J. van der Struyff, a [[submarine]] designer and engineer of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;van Royen, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; ''K XVII'' had a similar design as her [[Sister ship|sister]] submarines in the {{sclass-|K XIV|submarine|4}}, she was fully riveted and her [[pressure hull]] was made of {{convert|14|mm|in|adj=on|2}} thick steel. To increase the submarine's seaworthiness the pressure hull was plated with {{convert|3|mm|in|adj=on|2}} thick steel. As a consequence ''K XVII'' was 200 tons heavier than submarines in the previous {{sclass-|K XI|submarine|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;Gerretse and Wijn, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did allow ''K XVII'' to dive as deep as {{convert|80|to|100|m|ft|0}}, while withstanding the enormous water pressure.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Between the plating and the pressure hull there was room for the [[ballast tank]]s, [[fuel tank]]s, [[anchor]], [[torpedo tube]]s and more.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; Furthermore, the submarine was divided into six compartments.&lt;ref&gt;van Royen, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; The first compartment at the front contained a room with four torpedo launchers which were loaded during wartime, while there were also four reserve [[torpedo]]es stored. The room also acted at the same time as sleeping accommodation and [[caboose]] for the crew. In the second and third compartment the [[Accu (battery)|accus]] were stored, and also contained the sleeping accommodation for officers. The fourth compartment was the nerve center of ''K XVII'', since this was the place were all control panels, instruments and command tower were located. This tower was made of thick and pressure-resistant steel. The fifth compartment contained the machine chamber and thus the diesel motor. The sixth, and last, compartment was located at the back and had two torpedo launchers and the electric motor. There was also space for two reserve torpedoes. The torpedo tubes of ''K XVII'' had  a width of {{convert|53|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Kimenai, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the submarine, six water resistant shutters were built.

==Service history==

===Commissioning and serving in the Dutch East Indies===
HNLMS ''K XVII'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] in [[Rotterdam]] at the shipyard of [[Wilton-Fijenoord]] on 1 June 1931 together with her [[sister ship]] {{HNLMS|K XVIII||2}}.&lt;ref name="mark76"&gt; Mark, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine's [[Ceremonial ship launching|launch]] took place on 26 July 1932 and on 19 December 1933 ''K XVII'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in the Royal Netherlands Navy.&lt;ref name="mark76" /&gt; As a K series submarine the purpose of ''K XVII'' was to be active in waters around the [[Dutch East Indies]]. However, before she left for the Dutch East Indies she first became part of the Royal Netherlands Navy escadre ''Oostzee'' between 20 June and 1 August 1934.&lt;ref&gt; van Royen, p. 19; Kimenai, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Other ships that were part of this escadre were {{HNLMS|Hertog Hendrik}}, {{HNLMS|Evertsen|1926|2}}, {{HNLMS|Z 5||2}} another {{sclass-|K XIV|submarine|2}}, namely {{HNLMS|K XVIII||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;van Royen, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the navy escadre ''Oostzee'', the ''K XVII'' made a trip to several ports and harbors connected to the [[Baltic Sea]], such as [[Gdynia]], [[Königsberg]], [[Riga]] and [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Kimenai, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 1935 ''K XVII'' and her sister {{HNLMS|K XVI||2}}, were sent to the Dutch East Indies where they arrived on 26 March 1935 at [[Padang]].&lt;ref name="dutchsubmarines"/&gt; During this trip both submarines were under command of LTZ1 J.A. de Gelder and visited several ports, such as [[Lisbon]] (14–18 January), [[Gibraltar]] (20 January), [[Naples]] (25–30 January), [[Alexandria]] (5–11 February), [[Port Said]] (12 February), [[Ismaila]] (12–13 February), [[Suez]] (13–15 February), [[Aden]] (23–28 February), [[Colombo]] (?-18 March) and finally, Padang (26 March).&lt;ref&gt; van Royen, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; At every port which they visited more than two days meetings were organised and included showing the Dutch national flag as part of promoting the Netherlands. Alongside this 'Holland-promotion', the meetings also involved parties and dinners.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; The crew meanwhile made certain visits during their visits to the different ports. For example, the crew visited the [[Pyramid of Cheops]] while the ship was docked at the port in Alexandria, and also [[Vatican City]] was visited by the crew of ''K XVII'' while they were docked at the port in Naples.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

On 4 April 1935 made both ''K XVII'' and ''K XVIII'' made it to their new home port in the Dutch West Indies, namely [[Surabaya]]. Here they were added to submarine division I. Later that year, in October 1935, this division took part in a [[Military exercise|exercises]] near Surabaya. After the exercises were finished all boats underwent maintenance, which took till 24 February 1936 to complete. Immediately after the maintenance periods were completed on all boats of submarine division I, they were ordered to be part of a navy escadre. The escadre would make a exercise trip to the west part of the [[Java Sea]].&lt;ref&gt; van Royen, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The trip would last till mid-March, after which the escadre would change course to the [[Makassar Strait]] and spent the remainder of March practicing there. During April, May and June ''K XVII'', as part of submarine division I, went on a exercise trip to the eastern part of the [[Indian archipelago]].&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

From October 1936 till June 1937 the ''K XVII'', and the rest of submarine division I, were once again part of a navy escadre. This time the escadre exercised for 8 months with sea planes.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; These excersises took place at the [[Makassar Strait]] and [[Java Sea]]. One year later, in January 1938, submarine division I, which included the submarines ''K XIV'', ''K XIV'', ''K XVI'', ''K XVII'' and ''K XVIII'' were once again added to a navy escadre for exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Bezemer, p. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; The ''K XVII'' served this time as flag-ship of the submarine division, and was under command of LTZ 1 A. van Karnebeek, while LTZ 1 J.A. de Gelder had command of the whole submarine division I.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The exercises were done at the [[Makassar Strait]] and [[Java Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;van Royen, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 1938 the ''K XVII'' participated in a fleet show at Surabaya. The show was held in honor of the Dutch Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] who was than 40 years the head of state. More than twenty navy ships of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] and three ships of the [[Government Navy]] participated in the show.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; 

===World War II===
When [[Germany]] [[German declaration of war against the Netherlands|declared war]] on the [[Netherlands]] and also started it's war against other West-European nations, the Dutch navy gave the order for all submarines in the [[Dutch East Indies]] to protect the colony against possibly attacks or raids by German or Italian auxiliary cruisers.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Kimenai, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Dutch navy also observed Japanese activity closely, especially after Japan had signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Italy and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;van Royen, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The ''K XVII'' was during this period mainly tasked with protecting merchant ships against raiders by either taking part in convoys or closely shadowing merchant ships. For example, on 15 September 1940 ''K XVII'' together with ''[[HNLMS O 16|O 16]]'' shadowed the steamship ''Lematang'' and the tanker ''Olivia'' on their trip to [[Durban]] and [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]]. They had the order to keep their eyes open for German raiders and attack them if spotted.&lt;ref&gt;van Royen, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of September 1940 ''K XVII'' also protected the steamship ''Salando'' of the Rotterdam company ''Lloyd'' when it made its way through the Soenda Strait to reach its destination, [[Durban]].&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;van Royen, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1941 ''K XVII'', alongside the submarines ''K IX'' and ''K X'', was sent the Soenda Strait because of the 'Scheer-alarm'. The scheer-alarm meant that the German cruiser [[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|''Admiral Scheer'']] had been spotted. The Dutch navy believed, based on their intel, that ''Admiral Scheer'' was planning to enter the [[Indian Ocean]] with as goal to sink allied merchant ships and head towards [[Surabaya]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The Dutch navy made therefore preparations to possibly face the ''Admiral Scheer'' and eventually sink the cruiser. The ''K IX'', ''K X'' and ''K XVII'' were ordered to patrol around [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]]. However, the German cruiser did not enter the [[Indian Ocean]] and thus the submarines could resume with their normal patrols.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

In June 1941 ''K XVII'' was sent alongside other ships, such as ''K XVIII'' and ''O 16'', to north-west of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There were reports of Japanese warships accompanying merchant ships to Southeast Asia, and the Dutch navy sent her own ships as a precaution to be ready for anything.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; After this assignment the ''K XVII'' was sent to [[Surabaya]] for her half yearly maintenance. At the end of July she was declared fit for service, and was taken back into service.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

During the war ''K XVII''  patrolled in the [[South China Sea]], off [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and in the [[Gulf of Siam]]. While exiting the Gulf of Siam in December 1941 she hit a Japanese mine and sunk. The entire crew of thirty-six men perished.&lt;ref&gt;Willigenburg, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Her wreck was located in 1978.&lt;ref name="dutchsubmarines"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/boats/boat_kxvii.htm |title=Dutch Submarines: The submarine K XVII |first= |last= |work=dutchsubmarines.com |year=2012 |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several conspiracy theories involving ''K XVII'' and how the submarine allegedly sighted the Japanese fleet prior to [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchsubmarines.com/boats/boat_kxvii.htm|title=Dutch Submarines: The submarine K XVII|work=dutchsubmarines.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/books-the-spy-who-went-after-the-gold-1312223.html|title=Books: The spy who went after the gold|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Creighton |first=Christopher |date=1996 |title=Op.

'''Hazer Tarkhan''' was a general ([[tarkhan]] is both a military rank and, in some cases, a personal name) who led a [[Khazar]] army of 40,000 men in the failed defense of [[Atil]] in 737 CE. He was ambushed and killed by Kawthar, the lieutenant of Marwan ibn Muhammad (later [[Caliph]] [[Marwan II]]). Following his death the Khazars sued for peace.

'''Joseph Ritter von Fraunhofer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|aʊ|n|ˌ|h|oʊ|f|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfraʊnˌhoːfɐ|lang}}; 6 March 1787 – 7 June 1826&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|5|382|384|Fraunhofer, Joseph von (bayerischer Personaladel 1824)|Adolf Wißner|116746599}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavarian]] [[physicist]] and [[Lens (optics)|optical lens manufacturer]]. He made optical glass and [[achromatic telescope]] [[objective lens]]es, invented the [[spectroscope]], and developed [[diffraction grating]]. In 1814, he discovered and studied the dark absorption lines in the [[spectrum]] of the sun now known as [[Fraunhofer lines]].&lt;ref name="nautilus"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Glassmaker Who Sparked Astrophysics|author=Kitty Ferguson &amp; Miko Maciaszek |url=http://nautil.us/issue/11/light/the-glassmaker-who-sparked-astrophysics |date=20 March 2014|accessdate=8 April 2018|publisher=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German research organization [[Fraunhofer Society]] is named after him and is Europe's biggest Society for the Advancement of Applied Research.

==Biography==
Joseph Fraunhofer was born in [[Straubing]], in the [[Electorate of Bavaria]], to Franz Xaver Fraunhofer and Maria Anna Frohlich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |date=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=22 August 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58484.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was orphaned at the age of 11 and started working as an apprentice to a harsh glassmaker named Philipp Anton Weichelsberger.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Myles W. Jackson|title=Spectrum of Belief: Joseph Von Fraunhofer and the Craft of Precision Optics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ6SE3sbxDsC|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-10084-7|chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt; In 1801, the workshop in which he was working collapsed, and he was buried in the rubble. The rescue operation was led by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Prince-Elector Maximilian Joseph]]. The prince entered Fraunhofer's life, providing him with books and forcing his employer to allow the young Fraunhofer time to study.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt;

Joseph Utzschneider was also at the site of the disaster, and would also become a benefactor to Fraunhofer. With the money given to him by the prince upon his rescue and the support he received from Utzschneider, Fraunhofer was able to continue his education alongside his practical training.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern: Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit. Band 4: Perfektion von Optik und Mechanik. Cologne, 2010. 355–356.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806, Utzschneider and [[Georg von Reichenbach]] brought Fraunhofer into their Institute at [[Benediktbeuern Abbey|Benediktbeuern]], a secularised [[Benedictine]] monastery devoted to glassmaking. There he discovered how to make the fine optical glass and invented precise methods for measuring [[dispersion (optics)|optical dispersion]].&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt;

It was at the Institute that Fraunhofer met Pierre Louis Guinand, a Swiss glass technician, who instructed Fraunhofer in glassmaking at Utzschneider's behest.&lt;ref name=plicht/&gt; By 1809, the mechanical part of the Optical Institute was chiefly under Fraunhofer's direction, and Fraunhofer became one of the members of the firm that same year.&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fraunhofer, Joseph von|year=1920|vb=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, Guinand left the firm, as did  Reichenbach. Guinad would later became a partner with Fraunhofer in the firm, &lt;ref name=plicht&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.plicht.de/chris/35fraunh.htm|title=Fraunhofer, Joseph von (1787–1826)|accessdate=26 March 2011|publisher=plicht.de}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name was changed to Utzschneider-und-Fraunhofer. During 1818, Fraunhofer became the director of the Optical Institute. Due to the fine optical instruments developed by Fraunhofer, Bavaria overtook England as the center of the optics industry. Even the likes of [[Michael Faraday]] were unable to produce glass that could rival Fraunhofer.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleppner"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Master of Dispersion|author=[[Daniel Kleppner]]|journal=[[Physics Today]]|year=2005|volume=58|issue=11|doi=10.1063/1.2155731|page=10|bibcode=2005PhT....58k..10K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His illustrious career eventually earned him an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1822. In 1824, Fraunhofer was appointed an [[Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown|Knight of the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown]] by [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|King Maximilian I]], through which he was raised into personal nobility (with the title "Ritter von", i.e. knight). The same year, he was also made an honorary citizen of [[Munich]].

Like many [[glassmaker]]s of his era, he was poisoned by [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] vapors, resulting in his premature death. Fraunhofer died in 1826 at the age of 39. His most valuable glassmaking recipes are thought to have gone to the grave with him.&lt;ref name="Jackson2000"/&gt;

== Invention and scientific research ==
[[Image:Fraunhofer spectroscope.JPG|thumb|right|Fraunhofer demonstrating the spectroscope.]]
One of the most difficult operations of practical optics during the time period of Fraunhofer's life was accurately [[polishing]] the spherical surfaces of large [[Objective (optics)|object glasses]]. Fraunhofer invented the machine{{Which one|date=January 2018}} which rendered the surface more accurately than traditional [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. He also invented other grinding and polishing machines and introduced many improvements into the manufacture of the different kinds of glass used for optical instruments, which he always found to be injured by flaws and irregularities of various sorts.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

In 1811, he constructed a new kind of [[Glass production|furnace]], and during his second melting session when he melted a large quantity of glass, he found that he could produce [[flint glass]], which, when taken from the bottom of a vessel containing roughly 224 pounds of glass, had the same [[refraction|refractive]] power as glass taken from the surface. He found that the English [[crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] and the German table glass both contained defects which tended to cause irregular refraction. In the thicker and larger glasses, there would be even more of such defects, so that in larger telescopes this kind of glass would not be fit for object glasses. Fraunhofer, therefore, made his own crown glass.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

It was thought that the accurate determination of power for a given medium to refract rays of light and separate the different colors which they contain was impeded due to the [[color]]s of the [[spectrum]] having no precise limits, making it difficult to accurately measure the angle of refraction. To debunk this, Fraunhofer performed a series of experiments for the purpose of producing [[monochromatic light|homogeneous light]] artificially, and unable to effect his object in a direct way, he did so by means of lamps and [[Prism (optics)|prism]]s.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

=== Discovery dark absorption lines ===
[[File:DBP 1987 1313 Joseph von Fraunhofer, Sonnenspektrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Illustration of solar spectrum drawn and colored by Joseph von Fraunhofer with dark lines named after him. (1987 [[Deutsche Bundespost|DBP]]'s stamp on 200th anniversary of birthday of Fraunhofer)]] 
Thus in 1814, Fraunhofer invented the [[spectroscope]]. In the course of his experiments, he discovered a bright fixed line which appears in the orange color of the spectrum when it is produced by the light of [[fire]]. This line enabled him afterward to determine the absolute power of refraction in different substances. Experiments to ascertain whether the solar spectrum contained the same bright line in orange as the line produced by the orange of fire light led him to the discovery of 574 dark fixed lines in the solar spectrum. Today, millions of such fixed absorption lines are now known.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

Continuing to investigate, Fraunhofer detected dark lines also appearing in the spectra of several bright [[star]]s, but in slightly different arrangements. He ruled out the possibility that the lines were produced as the light passes through the [[Earth’s atmosphere]]. If that were the case they would not appear in different arrangements. He concluded that the lines originate in the nature of the stars and [[sun]] and carry information about the source of light, regardless of how far away that source is.&lt;ref name="nautilus"/&gt;

Fraunhofer found out that the spectra of [[Sirius]] and other first-magnitude stars differed from the sun and from each other, thus founding [[Astronomical spectroscopy|stellar spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraunhofer (1814–1815), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2-AAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA230#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 220–221]:

''Original'': Ich habe auch mit derselben Vorrichtung Versuche mit dem Lichte einiger Fixsterne erster Grösse gemachte. Da aber das Licht dieser Sterne noch vielmal schwächer ist, als das der Venus, so ist natürlich auch die Helligkeit des Farbenbildes vielmal geringer. Demohngeachtet habe ich, ohne Täuschung, im Farbenbilde vom Lichte des Sirius drey breite Streifen gesehen, die mit jenen vom Sonnenlichte keine Aehnlichkeit zu haben scheinen; einer dieser Streifen ist im Grünen, und zwey im Blauen. Auch im Farbenbilde vom Lichte anderer Fixsterne erster Grösse erkennt man Streifen; doch scheinen diese Sterne, in Beziehung auf die Streifen, unter sich verschieden zu seyn.

''Translation'': With the same device [i.e., spectroscope], I've also made some experiments on the light of some stars of the first magnitude.  Since the light of these stars is many times weaker than that of Venus, so naturally, the brightness of the spectrum is also many times less. Notwithstanding, I have seen -- without any illusion -- three broad stripes in the spectrum of Sirius, which seem to have no similarity to those of sunlight; one of these stripes is in the green, and two in the blue. Also, in the spectrum of the light of other fixed stars of the first magnitude, one detects stripes; yet these stars, in regard to the stripes, seem to differ among themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;

These dark fixed lines were later shown to be atomic absorption lines, as explained by [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]] in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;See:

=== Invent optical intruments ===
Fraunhofer also developed a [[diffraction grating]] in 1821, which occurred after [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] discovered the principles of diffraction grating and after American astronomer [[David Rittenhouse]] invented the first man-made diffraction grating in 1785.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Ultimately, however, his primary passion was still practical optics, once noting that "In all my experiments I could, owing to lack of time, pay attention to only those matters which appeared to have a bearing upon practical optics".&lt;ref&gt;Prismatic and Diffraction Spectra: Memoirs (1899) Tr. &amp; Ed. J. S. Ames p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telescopes and optical instruments==
Fraunhofer produced various optical instruments for his firm.&lt;ref name="plicht"/&gt; This included the Fraunhofer Dorpat Refractor used by Struve (delivered 1824 to [[University of Tartu Old Observatory|Dorpat Observatory]]), and the Bessel [[Heliometer]] (delivered posthumously), which were both used to collect data for [[stellar parallax]]. The firm's successor, Merz und Mahler, made a telescope for the New Berlin Observatory, which confirmed the existence of the major planet [[Neptune]]. Possibly the last telescope [[Objective (optics)#Telescope|objective]] made by Fraunhofer was supplied for a [[transit telescope]] at the [[City Observatory, Edinburgh]],&lt;ref name="Edinburgh city obs web"&gt;[http://www.astronomyedinburgh.org/publications/booklet/ A Guide to Edinburgh's Popular Observatory], Astronomical Society of Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; the telescope itself being completed by [[Johann Georg Repsold|Repsold]] of Hamburg after Fraunhofer's death.

The death of a popular musician, and likewise, the use of a dead musician's work in advertising, often causes a sharp increase in sales of the musician's recordings and associated products; this has led to a number of '''posthumous number one singles in the UK''' and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/sales-of-amy-winehouse-records-surge-2320089.html|title=Sales of Amy Winehouse records surge|work=[[The Independent]]|date=25 July 2011|accessdate=24 August 2011|first=Rosa|last=Silverman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/03/industry-us-jackson-sales-idUSTRE5624WF20090703|title=Michael Jackson sales surge expected to last months|publisher=[[Reuters]]|first=Ed|last=Christman|author2=Bruno, Antony |date=3 July 2009|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/popandrock2|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Is that my bassline I can hear?|first=Marcus|last=Gray|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=24 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMCH" /&gt;

The first deceased artist to top the charts was [[Buddy Holly]], who died in [[The Day the Music Died|a plane crash on 3 February 1959]].

In 2002 his song "[[A Little Less Conversation]]", a little-known former B-side, topped the charts after being remixed by Dutch dance music producer [[Junkie XL]] for a television advertisement for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], which broke Presley's long-standing tie with [[The Beatles]] for the most UK number ones.&lt;ref name="EMCH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2048610.stm|title=Elvis makes chart history|date=16 June 2002|accessdate=25 July 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three years later three of his singles returned to the top spot when all his previous number one singles were re-issued to mark what would have been his 70th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?storyCode=11318&amp;sectioncode=1|title=Jailhouse Rock tops UK singles chart|date=10 January 2005|work=[[Music Week]]|accessdate=25 July 2011|first=Alan|last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1980 and early 1981 three singles by [[John Lennon]] reached number one in quick succession following [[Death of John Lennon|his murder on 8 December 1980]].  His fellow former member of The Beatles, [[George Harrison]], achieved a posthumous number one in 2002 when a re-issue of his song "[[My Sweet Lord]]", originally a number one in 1971, entered the chart at number one.  In doing so, he knocked "[[More than a Woman (Aaliyah song)|More than a Woman]]" by American singer [[Aaliyah]] from the top spot, the first time that two deceased artists had topped the charts in consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.uk.msn.com/photos/photos.aspx?ucsort=0&amp;cp-documentid=156997342&amp;page=3|title=George Harrison and Aaliyah's posthumous double header|first=James|last=Hurley|publisher=[[MSN Music]]|date=7 May 2011|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following singles were all explicitly credited (either wholly or partially) to deceased artists when they reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. Singles featuring deceased artists who did not receive an explicit credit (e.g. as a member of a band), such as the 1991 re-release of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" following the death of lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]], are not included.

{{about|the book|the Eamon album|Love &amp; Pain|the Super Heroines album|Super Heroines}}

'''''Love and Pain''''' is a 2008 book of [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]] by American author [[Thaddeus Golas]], the author of ''[[The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment]]''. Love and Pain was first drafted in 1986 and underwent several rewrites throughout the 1990s. Golas called it his [[masterpiece|Opus]] and considered it his most important work. He was not able to find a publisher for the work while alive. He described it as "a step beyond ''The Lazy Man's Guide'', and perhaps a revision to it."

''Love and Pain'' was published posthumously by Seed Center Books/Even Lazier Publishing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seedcenterbooks.com/ Seed Center Books/Even Lazier Publishing, Ltd. website]&lt;/ref&gt; an independent publishing company in California dedicated to publishing the work of Golas.

== Contents    ==
Love and Pain describes a theory of [[metaphysics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[cosmology]] and more including a theory of [[Gravity|gravitation]]. Golas describes a universe made entirely of one single vital substance. This substance has only three possible states: expanding continuously with great force, contracting continuously (appearing as a sub-atomic particle), and alternating between expansion and contraction at a variety of frequencies (appearing as energy). Golas explains how this accounts for every phenomenon known of, without providing any proven science.

'''Manono II''' (died 1819) was a Hawaiian chiefess and member of the royal family during the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. She along with her second husband [[Keaoua Kekuaokalani]] died fighting for the [[Hawaiian religion]] after [[Kamehameha II]] abolished the [[kapu]] system.

==Biography==
Manono's father was Kekuamanoha, and her mother was [[Kalolaa-kumukoa|Kalola-a-Kumukoʻa]], the wife of Kamehameha before his victory at the [[Battle of Mokuohai|Battle of Mokuʻōhai]]. Through her father she was a granddaughter of [[Kekaulike]], the King or [[Moi of Maui|Moʻi of Maui]]. From her mother's side, she was the great-granddaughter of King [[Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku]] of Hawaiʻi.{{sfn|Fornander|1880|pages=130-131}}{{sfn|Kalākaua|1888|page=440}}
Her half-siblings from her father's first marriage were [[Kalanimoku]], [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]], and [[Wahinepio]]. She was cousin of [[Kaahumanu|Kaʻahumanu]], [[Kalākua Kaheiheimālie]], and [[Namahana Piia|Namahana Piʻia]], [[Kuakini]], Governor of Hawaiʻi; and [[Keeaumoku II|Keʻeaumoku II]].&lt;ref name="Maui"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.royalark.net/Hawaii/maui.htm |title=Maui Genealogy |author=Christopher Buyers |accessdate=2011-03-20 |work= Royal Ark web site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1809, while still in her youth, Manono was chosen along with her cousin [[Kekāuluohi]] by [[Kamehameha I]] "to warm his old age" thus becoming the old king's last two wives.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|page=208}}
The two young chiefesses were deemed his ''wahine pālama'', a term that denote their special status and rank which required them to live in a sacred enclosure of lama wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |palama|accessdate=January 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"Lama" was the Hawaiian name for endemic [[ebony]] trees of genus ''[[Diospyros sandwicensis]]'' that were used in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=lama&amp;d=D10372 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120716031640/http://wehewehe.org/cgi-bin/hdict?e=q&amp;a=q&amp;l=en&amp;q=lama&amp;d=D10372 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= July 16, 2012 |title= lookup of lama |work= on Hawaiian dictionary |author= [[Mary Kawena Pukui]] and Elbert |year= 2003 |publisher= Ulukau, the Hawaiian Electronic Library, University of Hawaii |accessdate= August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oral tradition attested that Kamehameha's last child, a daughter named Kapapauai, was born from one of his ''wahine pālama'', either Manono's or Kekāuluohi's.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|page=208}}{{sfn|Thrum|1916|page=51}}
She would later marry High Chief [[Keaoua Kekuaokalani]], a nephew of the Kamehameha I. Kekuaokalani's maternal grandmother was her namesake [[Manono I]], a daughter of [[Alapainui]] and [[Kamakaimoku]]. Kekuaokalani inherited the guardianship of the Hawaiian god of war, [[Kū|Kūkaʻilimoku]] after Kamehameha's death.{{sfn|Kamakau|1992|page=209}}

After Kamehameha I's death, on May 8, 1819, Liholiho succeeded as King [[Kamehameha II]]. Influenced by powerful female chiefs such as [[Kaʻahumanu]] and his mother [[Keōpūolani]], the young king abolished the [[kapu]] system that had governed life Hawaiian society for centuries. Henceforth, men and women could eat together, women could eat formerly forbidden foods, and official worship at the stone platform temples, or [[heiau]]s, was discontinued. This event is called the [[ʻAi Noa]], or free eating.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|pages=67-68}}
In response to Liholiho's actions, Kekuaokalani put himself forward as the defender of the ''kapu'' system and old religion, amassing a formidable force in the village of Kaʻawaloa. All attempts of reconciliation failed between the two royal cousins and war broke out between Kekuaokalani and the royal forces led by Manono's half-brother [[Kalanimoku]]. Fighting alongside her husband in the Battle of [[Kuamoo Burials|Kuamoʻo]], they both perished in defense of the ''kapu'' system.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|pages=68-69}}{{sfn|Dibble|1843|page=156}}

Visiting Kuamoʻo a few years afterward, British missionary [[William Ellis (missionary)|William Ellis]] of the [[London Missionary Society]] chronicled the native accounts of the battle and the death of Kekuaokalani and Manono on Ellis' tour of the island of Hawaii:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The small tumuli increased in number as we passed along, until we came to a place called Tuamoo. Here Kekuaokalani made his last stand, rallied his flying forces, and seemed, for a moment, to turn the scale of victory; but being weak with the loss of blood, from a wound he had received in the early part of the engagement, he fainted and fell. However, he soon revived, and, though unable to stand, sat on a fragment of lava, and twice loaded and fired his musket on the advancing party. He now received a ball in his left breast, and immediately covering his face with his feather cloak, expired in the midst of his friends. His wife Manono during the whole of the day fought by his side with steady and dauntless courage. A few moments after her husband's death, perceiving Karaimoku and his sister advancing, she called out for quarter; but the words had hardly escaped from her lips, when she received a ball in her left temple, fell upon the lifeless body of her husband, and instantly expired. The idolaters having lost their chief, made but feeble resistance afterwards; yet the combat, which commenced in the forenoon, continued till near sunset, when the king's troops, finding their enemies had all either fled or surrendered, returned to Kairua.{{sfn|Ellis|1827|pages=108-109}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Martin Petrus Frederik Blomberg''' (December 11, 1888 in [[Östervåla|Östervåla, Sweden]]—1966 in [[Winter Park, Florida]]) was an American engineer of Swedish origin.  He became well known for the development of the [[Bogie|truck]] frame for the diesel-electric locomotives of the [[Electro Motive Division]] (EMD).

== Early life ==
Blomberg grew up as a son of a teacher and minister.  He graduated from the technical institute in Örebro, and in 1910 went to the university at Uppsala.  In this time, he was very active and trained for the Olympic Games of 1912 in Sweden. However, he immigrated to Canada in the same year.  From 1912 to 1914, he worked in [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec]] in a paper mill, and studied technical drawing and mechanical construction in an evening school. From 1915, he worked then [[National Steel Car]] Ltd Hamilton, Ontario. He later traveled for a year by canoeing 900 miles from the Albany River to the Hudson Bay.

In 1916, he went to the US and enlisted with the US Army during World War I. After he returned, he married Laura Van Buskirk. His son Richard Nelson Blomberg was born on October 21, 1924.

== Pullman-Standard ==
From 1925 to 1935, Blomberg worked for the [[Pullman Company]], where he was responsible for the construction of railroad [[Bogie|truck]] frames and [[passenger car (rail)|passenger car]] bodies. Among his designs he assisted at Pullman were the Union Pacific [[M-10000]] in 1934 ({{US Patent|D100,000}}), and the [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company|Brooklyn Rapid Transit]] "Green Hornet", lightweight [[MS Multi-section car (New York City Subway car)]] for use on the BRT elevated transit lines in Brooklyn, New York.

== Electro-Motive ==
On September 1, 1935, he accepted a position in the [[Electro-Motive Corporation]] (from 1941, it was renamed to [[Electro-Motive Division]] of General Motors). There Blomberg was given responsibility for the construction of locomotive bodies, frames and truck frames. The [[EMC E4]] diesel-electric locomotive was mostly his design, including the three-axle (A1A) truck. In 1939 he designed the four-wheel flexible truck frame from the three-axle version for the new diesel-electric freight locomotive called the [[EMD FT]].  This four-wheel truck frame and its derivations were incorporated in more than 15,000 locomotives. Unofficially, but generally accepted, the two-axle trucks, [[Blomberg B]] and [[Blomberg B|Blomberg M]], are named after him. The two-axle [[AAR type A switcher truck|AAR Type A]] switcher truck is also a Blomberg design.

Blomberg registered over 100 patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office during his 32 years with EMD.  In 1947, he became lead engineer after the chief engineer of EMD.

== Retirement ==
On 1 June 1949, he retired.  He died in 1966 at the age of 78 years in Winter Park, Florida.

'''Mojo''' is a fictional character, a supervillain appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually those featuring the [[X-Men]] family of characters. Created by writer [[Ann Nocenti]] and artist [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]], Mojo first appeared in ''[[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]]'' #3 (November 1985), as the titular hero's [[archenemy]], and subsequently a villain to the [[X-Men]] and their various sub-groups as well.

Mojo is one of the "Spineless Ones", an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] race that is immobile without advanced technology. He is a [[Slavery|slave]]r who rules the '''Mojoverse''', a dimension where all beings are addicted to his [[gladiator]]-like television programs. The character is an [[absurdism|absurdist]] [[parody]] of network executives, and was created as a result of the influence of writers like [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Walter Lippmann]] on Nocenti.&lt;ref name=SequentialTart&gt;Keller, Katherine (November 2, 2007). [http://www.sequentialtart.com/article.php?id=737 "Writer, Creator, Journalist, and Uppity Woman: Ann Nocenti"]. ''Sequential Tart''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
At the time she wrote the ''[[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]]'' miniseries, writer [[Ann Nocenti]] was pursuing her [[Master's degree]] at the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University]], working at the magazine ''Lies of Our Times'', and reading the work of writers like [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Walter Lippmann]]. Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ash|first=Roger |title=Ann Nocenti and Arthur Adams Bet on a Longshot|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=29 |pages=26-31 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=August 2008|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A character named [[Manufactured Consent]] after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in Nocenti's 1990 book ''The New Mutants Summer Special'', was also born of these works.)&lt;ref name=SequentialTart/&gt; Artist [[Art Adams]] designed the character per Nocenti's instructions that he be disgusting and unpleasant, and also tried to make him look frightening.&lt;ref name=ModernMasters&gt;{{cite book|last=Khoury|first=George|author2=Eric Nolen-Weathington|title=Modern Masters Volume 6:Arthur Adams|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|pages=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wires that hold Mojo's eyelids open, thus preventing him from blinking, were inspired by an interview with actor [[Malcolm McDowell]] on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', in which McDowell revealed that the similar apparatus he had to wear for the [[Ludovico technique]] scene in ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' had scarred his corneas. The rest of the equipment attached to Mojo's head controls his mechanized chair.&lt;ref name=MarvelAge&gt;"Art Adams interview". "The Mutant Report". Volume 3. ''[[Marvel Age]]'' #71 (February 1989). Marvel Comics. pp. 12 - 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mojo first appeared in ''Longshot'' #3 (November 1985), and was the main villain of the miniseries, appearing in the subsequent three issues.

The character subsequently appeared in ''The New Mutants Annual'' #2 (1986). That same year, in ''The Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #10, Mojo appeared as the villain in the story, which saw Longshot join the X-Men. In 1988, Mojo appeared in a backup story in ''The Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12. He was the main villain of the one-shot special ''Excalibur: Mojo Mayhem'' (December 1989). Subsequent appearances include ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #89 (1991), ''The Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #15 (1991), ''Wolverine'' #52 (March 1992), ''X-Men'' #6 (March 1992), ''Wolverine'' #53 (April 1992), ''X-Men'' #7 (April 1992), #10-11 (July–August 1992), ''The Uncanny X-Men Annual 16'' (Annual 1992), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #119 (1993), ''What If?'' #59 (March 1994), ''X-Men Adventures: Season Two'' #11 (December 1994), ''Marvel: Portraits of the Universe'' #1 (March 1995), ''X-Men: Mutations'' #1 (1996), ''Youngblood/X-Force'' #1 (July 1996), ''X-Force/Youngblood'' #1 (August 1996), ''X-Force'' #60-61 (November–December 1996), ''The Adventures of the X-Men'' #9-10 (1996-January 1997), ''X-Babies: Murderama'' #1 (January 1998), ''X-Force'' #76 (April 1998), ''X-Babies Reborn'' #1 (January 2000), ''X-Men Unlimited'' #32 (September 2001), ''Exiles'' #18-19 (December 2002-January 2003), ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #460-461 (August 2005), and ''Exiles'' #73-74 (February 2006).

Mojo was featured in an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]'' #8, and in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' #7 (2006).

==Fictional character biography==
Most of the denizens of what would come to be called the Mojoverse were slowly driven insane by waves of energy from another space-time continuum. It would take centuries (of their time) for them to discover the origin of these transmissions. Mojo's race did not [[evolution|evolve]] much because of their inability to stand upright, until a scientist named Arize developed [[exoskeleton]]s that allowed a fast technological revolution. Some members of the race refused to use them and called themselves the Spineless Ones. Instead, they used motorized platforms to transport their bodies. They also became the rulers and demanded a race of slaves to do all the tasks they could not or would not do. Arize created the slaves, humanoid beings, using genetic engineering and basing their appearance on the "demons" of the Spineless Ones' nightmares - which were actually the characters of TV broadcasts of Earth-616, somehow scattered throughout their time line and perceived by the Spineless Ones. Unknown to the Spineless Ones, Arize secretly planted the seeds in their genetic make-up to eventually turn on their masters and rule Mojoworld justly. Arize was banished by the Spineless Ones when he refused to build weapons for them.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

The power structure of this world was based on the television industry and Mojo became their leader by controlling it, along with the slave trade. Mojo named the world after himself; 'Mojo World' and the universe the 'Mojoverse'. His followers, including [[Warwolves]] (vaguely dog-like metallic beings with the ability to kill people and take over the remains of their bodies as skins), became known as Wildways. Mojo also has a [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]], an android named Major Domo, who oversees Mojo's financial records and relays Mojo's commands to his servants. Major Domo is completely loyal to Mojo, but often obeys with sarcastic comments towards Mojo. Major Domo's assistant, a near-constant companion, is called Minor Domo, a hysterical young girl prone to imagining worst-case scenarios.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

One of the slaves Mojo had ordered, [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], became one of his best stunt performers. However, Longshot disagreed with the rules and led a rebellion (most likely motivated by the death of Jackson, a fellow stuntman). He was captured and had his memories removed, but managed to escape to Earth, followed by bounty hunters. On Earth Longshot found allies in the form of Dr. Strange and the human stuntwoman Rita Ricochet and they managed to defeat Mojo, driving him back to his own world. Longshot, his friend Quark and Rita returned to the Mojoverse to free their fellow slaves. Longshot's mission failed and they were captured by Mojo. Longshot was brainwashed again, while Rita was tied to the bow of Mojo's worldtravelling ship, serving as a guide. In an alternate future, Mojo had Rita transformed into an insane warrior/mage named [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and she was sent back in time to capture or kill Longshot.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Mojo became interested in Earth and captured Betsy Braddock, the mutant known as [[Psylocke]], who had been blinded, and implanted bionic eyes in her original body. Much later it was learned that the eyes Mojo gave her were in fact interdimensional cameras allowing Mojo to record and broadcast all she could see. Psylocke was rescued by the [[New Mutants]], and she aided both the New Mutants and the [[X-Men]] before officially becoming an X-Man herself. It was later revealed that Betsy's body retained robotic eyes, as her consciousness was switched with the one of a comatose Japanese assassin.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Shortly afterward, Mojo sent Longshot to Earth where he joined the X-Men as well. Mojo had planned on enslaving the X-Men by turning them into children, but the New Mutants managed to free them and together they forced Mojo to flee again. Still Mojo found out that the adventures of the X-Men shot the audience level to top ratings; which increased his political power.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Mojo also manipulated the X-Men member [[Rachel Summers]] into working for him, but she soon escaped after realizing she was little more than a prisoner. Further setbacks began as Psylocke's broadcasts stopped when the X-Men were presumedly killed by the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], but Mojo wanted to have footage of the X-Men to improve his ratings,  so one of his assistants came up with a possible solution; create versions that could be controlled. Many different versions of the X-Men appeared before him, but he considered them all failures and ordered their death except the [[X-Babies]]. The X-babies were an immediate success but they rebelled almost immediately and escaped taking Rita with them.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Mojo reappeared along with an alternate version of [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. Mojo had kidnapped Jubilee, taking her to the "Big Crunch", the end of time where all matter would collapse. Jubilee agreed to be Mojo's slave if he wouldn't interrupt the Crunch. Older and renamed Abcissa, she kidnapped her younger self and took her to the Crunch. Wolverine appeared with a missile and defeated Mojo. Since Jubilee refused Mojo's offer, Abcissa's existence was nullified.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Eventually, Longshot returned to free the slaves and deposed Mojo, with the help of Mojo's upright, more human looking (although yellow) clone '''Mojo II: The Sequel'''. However, Mojo II turned out to be just as bad as his predecessor and Longshot had to defeat him as well. After Mojo II was ousted, Mojo reclaimed his position and became the leader of Mojo World once more.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Mojo never learned from his mistake concerning the X-babies and would create more X-Babies, who also rebelled. Eventually all of the X-Men had X-Baby counterparts on Mojoworld, and they all rebelled against Mojo and fled to an area he could not reach. He also created the Mitey 'Vengers (child versions of the Avengers) to finally stop the X-Babies once and for all. Of course, the Mitey 'Vengers, being essentially of the same moral fabric as their adult counterparts, turned on Mojo and defeated him. Finally, he created toddler versions of the Age of Apocalypse villains. These entities were seemingly more intelligent and broke the control Mojo had on them. According to Dazzler these versions were responsible for the destruction of a great part of Mojoworld, but apparently Mojo managed to defeat them and managed to once again take control of Mojoworld. He then made a deal with the Exiles: in return for Longshot's help, Mojo receives broadcasts from all over the multiverse through the Exiles' crystal palace; prior to this, Mojo had tried to get his hands on Nocturne using the "Exile Legal Eagles", clones of the Exiles' previous lineup.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Later, Mojo reappeared along with the previously vanished Nocturne and Juggernaut, using a "Jean-Bomb" to turn the X-Men into babies, and after his defeat, a guilt-ridden Juggernaut was tempted with the offer of remaining a child, but ultimately refused. Emma Frost made sure that Mojo would be handled by professionals so that he would never bother the X-Men again and was locked away by the Government. But, he is now free once again.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

During the "[[X-Men: Endangered Species|Endangered Species]]" storyline, Mojo was one of the villains [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] offered to "sell his soul to" in order to obtain help in reversing the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Spiral later mentions to Beast that Mojo is displeased with the fact that mutants are now an endangered species and how it will affect his television ratings.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In both 2010 and 2011 Mojo was revealed as the villain responsible for [[Spider-Man]] and Wolverine being sent randomly shifting through time, the time-shifts being virtual creations generated by Mojo as a new idea.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Astonishing Spider-Man/Wolverine]]''{{issue|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Mojo was demoted by the producers on Mojo World due to low ratings and was moved to "Educational Broadcasting". He created an agency named The Yellow Eye and spied on every single mutant alive. When [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] sent [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] to spy on this agency, she ended up being captured and brainwashed by Mojo.&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Force]]'' (vol.4) Issue # 12&lt;/ref&gt; His organization was eventually brought down by the [[X-Force#Volume_4|X-Force]], when Domino broke free from his control, and he was revealed as the mastermind behind the agency.&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Force]]'' (vol.4) Issue # 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Mojo is currently a prisoner of Cable's X-Force team.&lt;ref&gt;''[[X-Force]]'' (vol.4) Issue #15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' run, Mojo was revealed to have used footage of Howard's adventure to create a [[reality show]] for the Mojoverse. To fill in the gaps on Howard's life, Mojo filmed footage of a small alien in a duck costume interacting with [[Lea Thompson]] performing as [[Beverly Switzler]] (referencing the [[Howard the Duck (film)|1986 film adaptation of the character]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Howard the Duck]]'' (vol.6) Issue # 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Mojo's multi-legged flying platform is armed with various particle beam weapons. It also has a large artificial appendage that can be used as an arm or a slicing weapon and two smaller arms. He is strong enough to hold a human off of the ground with one arm easily. He has several powers derived from magic, like the projection of magical energy blasts, controlling the minds of others, and inter-dimensional teleportation. These magical powers are strengthened by the 'worship of his followers' and hence directly linked to the popularity of his TV programs. He cannot be harmed by the touch of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], no matter how long she is in contact with him. He has bear hugged Rogue with much ease until she was left unconscious.

He is also a master manipulator and schemer, shown in his organization of his slaughter entertainment games. He can also call upon vast manpower to assist him in his endeavors and has access to vast technological resources.

Mojo is also a force of death and corruption, able to generate an anti-life field that makes his touch able to wither plants and age humans outside of his home dimension. According to [[Doctor Strange]], his prolonged presence on Earth could cause storms and other natural disasters.

==Other versions==
[[File:UltimateMojoAdams.jpg|thumb|Ultimate Mojo Adams]]
Mojo claims that he and the beings who populate Mojo World are "unique" in the sense that unlike the rest of the Marvel Universe, Mojo World has no parallel counterpart; this was documented in ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #18-19. However, alternate versions of Longshot and Mojo exist in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, and an alternate future reality of Mojo World, where the Spineless Ones were mistreated slaves, was featured in the "Shattershot" storyline.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Ultimate Marvel===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Genosha]] --&gt;
In the series ''[[Ultimate X-Men]],'' which is a separate [[Marvel Universe|Marvel continuity]], Mojo is not an alien but an ordinary human being named '''Mojo Adams'''. He is a well-dressed, obese [[albino]] television producer. He trapped a young mutant fugitive [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]] on an island where humans hunt him as part of a popular [[reality show]]. This Mojo also has a Major Domo, a young, fit, human man with a family of his own. Later on he was seen working with Augustus "Gus" Beezer and hired [[Deadpool (comics)#Ultimate Deadpool|Deadpool]] and his [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] to capture the X-Men and bring them back to Krakoa where they were to be executed on live television by the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]]. He kept [[Professor X]] captive and forced him to watch the entire show a la ''[[Clockwork Orange (film)|Clockwork Orange]]''. His plans however were foiled by the combined efforts of the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] and [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], who was also captured during his visit to the [[X-Mansion]]. It is unknown what happened to Mojo after this because Xavier seemed to have "taken care" of him during his escape.

'''Müezzinzade Ali Pasha''' ({{lang-tr|Müezzinzade Ali Paşa}}; also known as '''Sofu Ali Pasha''' or '''Sufi Ali Pasha''' or '''Meyzinoğlu Ali Pasha'''; died 7 October 1571) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] statesman and naval officer. He was the Grand Admiral ([[Kapudan Pasha]]) in command of the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]], where he was killed in action. He also served as the [[List of Ottoman governors of Egypt|governor of]] [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]] from 1563 to 1566.

==Background==
He was the son of a [[muezzin]], hence his epithet ''Müezzinzade'' ("son of a muezzin"). He was a favorite of Sultan [[Selim II]] and of the women of the seraglio who admired his voice as a muezzin, and he married one of Selim II's daughters.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

From 1563 to 1566, Ali Pasha served as the Ottoman governor of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Konstam2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Konstam|title=Lepanto 1571: The Greatest Naval Battle of the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xloOS43F-X8C&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-409-2|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly a very ascetic [[Sufi]] man, wearing only "coarse woolen clothes" and paying many visits to the tombs of saints in the [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|City of the Dead]] necropolis in [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="DalyPetry1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.

==Ottoman conquest of Cyprus==
{{main|Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573)}}
Ali Pasha, with a fleet eventually numbering 188 [[galley]]s, [[fusta]]s, transports and other ships, carried the main land force, commanded by [[Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha|Lala Mustafa Pasha]], for the Ottoman invasion and conquest of [[Cyprus under the Ottoman Empire|Cyprus]] from [[Constantinople]] on 16 May 1570 to Cyprus, where they landed on 3 July. While Lala Mustafa commanded the eventual capture of the island from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], Ali Pasha took the bulk of his fleet to [[Crete]] and then to [[Morea]], thereby effectively preventing any Christian relief fleet from coming to the aid of the besieged defenders of Cyprus.

==Battle of Lepanto and death==
[[File:Ali Pasha.jpg|thumb|A print from a 1571 anonymous German [[broadsheet]] after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] of the same year, where Ali Pasha was wounded and killed in action by being shot in the head and beheaded. The print ostensibly shows his "true likeness" in the foreground, while his head is displayed on a pike on an Ottoman battleship in the background.]]
{{Disputed section|date=December 2015}}
Ali Pasha was commander-in-chief of the Ottoman naval forces at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] on 7 October 1571. Selim had entrusted him with one of the most precious possessions of the Ottoman Sultans, the great "Banner of the Caliphs", a huge green banner heavily embroidered with texts from the [[Qur'an]] and with the name of Allah emblazoned upon it 28,900 times in golden letters. It was intended to provide an incentive for him and his men to do their best in battle.

Ali Pasha was more of a land soldier than a naval tactician, and his failure to keep his lines together and keep his individual squadrons from charging like cavalry units in a land battle allowed the Christian forces to penetrate his battle line in various places and to surround and defeat the isolated ships.  He was also somewhat of a firebrand and almost immediately sought the direct confrontation with his opposite number.  His flagship, the galley ''Sultana'', battled head-to-head with [[John of Austria|Don Juan]]'s flagship [[Real (galley)|''La Real'']], was boarded and, after about one hour of bloody fighting, with reinforcements being provided to both sides by other galleys in their respective fleets, was captured. In the ensuing battle, Ali Pasha was slain and his head was then displayed upon a pike.  This, and the capture of the Banner of the Caliphs by ''La Real'', led to a collapse in Turkish morale, greatly contributing to their rout in the battle.

Thomas A. Anderson was born in Lower Downtown, Capital City, USA on March 11, 1962 (so, in the real world near 2162) according to his criminal record, or September 13, 1971 according to his passport (both seen in the film). His mother was Michelle McGahey (the name of the first film's art director&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/trivia Trivia for ''The Matrix''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and his father was John Anderson. He attended Central West Junior High and Owen Patterson High (named after the film's production designer). In high school, he excelled at science, math and computer courses, and displayed an aptitude for literature and history. Although he had disciplinary troubles when he was thirteen to fourteen years old, Anderson went on to become a respected member of the school community through his involvement in football and hockey.

At the start of the series, Neo (also known as Anwar) is one of billions of humans neurally connected to the Matrix, unaware that the world he lives in is a [[simulated reality]].&lt;ref&gt;This name carries several homages to Christian theology/mythology. "Anderson" literally means "son of man", which is how Jesus primarily referred to himself in the Gospels. "Thomas" is the name of Jesus' disciple who infamously doubted the truth of the risen Christ. In ''The Matrix'', Thomas Anderson sheds his disbelief and comes to accept that the Matrix is real and he is thereby "born again," and is referred to as "Neo."  He also comes to believe that he is The One.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===''The Matrix''===
In his legitimate activities, he is a quiet [[computer programming|programmer]] for the "respectable software company" &lt;span class="org"&gt;Meta Cortex&lt;/span&gt;; but he is also a computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] who penetrates computer systems illicitly and steals information under his hacker [[pseudonym|alias]] "&lt;span class="nickname"&gt;Neo&lt;/span&gt;", and he also sells illegal untraceable computer systems and hacking programs along with controlling computer viruses stashed on CDs and diskettes. During his time as a hacker, Anderson has learned about something known only as "[[Matrix (fictional universe)|The Matrix]]". It is described as a vague notion that Neo has felt his whole life that "there is something wrong with the world".

During the years prior to the events of ''The Matrix'', Neo has spent his time trying to find the one man who he thought could tell him what the Matrix was: a supposed terrorist known only as Morpheus. After an encounter with another hacker, Trinity, Anderson is suddenly contacted by [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] via a cell phone mailed to his office, but is almost immediately captured by the [[virtual reality]]'s [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]], led by [[Agent Smith]].  After refusing to co-operate with the agents, Neo has an electronic bug implanted within his Matrix-simulated body so that his actions can be tracked and those seeking to make contact from the free world can be traced and destroyed. He is then contacted by [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]],&lt;ref&gt;a reference to the Christian doctrine of God as being understood as a [[Trinity (Christianity)|Trinity]] composed of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (or alternatively, as Creator, Redeemer, Sustainer)&lt;/ref&gt; freed from the bug, and taken to meet Morpheus.

Neo is offered a choice to remain in his everyday life and forget about the Matrix or to learn what the Matrix really is. Choosing to learn what the Matrix really is, he takes a drug (commonly called the "[[red pill]]") designed to disrupt his body's neural connection to the Matrix, and wakes up disoriented and alarmed to find himself weak, hairless, naked in a pod full of red liquid, and connected to many wires.

Neo is rescued in the real world and his body is healed of the effects of his [[atrophy]] suffered in the power plant. Once Neo regains consciousness and is able to walk, Morpheus tells Neo the truth about the Matrix: that it is a simulated world to which humans are connected, and that humanity is used as a power source for giant intelligent machines. He also tells Neo about The One, a human with the power to manipulate The Matrix, who has been foretold to end the war between humans and machines, and says that he believes Neo is The One. The next day, Neo begins his "training" and becomes knowledgeable in many forms of combat, as well as vehicle and weapons operations, by having various training programs uploaded directly into his brain. He also receives further instruction from Morpheus on subjects such as "freeing his mind" from the restrictions of the Matrix, essentially overcoming the physics engine the Matrix operates on. He is also made aware the existence of its Agents.

After several days aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Neo is taken to meet the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], who has the power of foresight within the simulated world. She tells him that he has the "gift", but appeared to be waiting for something, and that in his present life he is not the one. The Oracle warns him that a situation will arise when he will have to choose between saving his own life or that of Morpheus.

Returning from the Oracle to the hard line, which serves as the exit for "red pills" to leave The Matrix, the crew of Morpheus's ship is betrayed by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a "red pill" who is willing to give the agents Morpheus in exchange for the promise of being reconnected permanently to the Matrix as an escape from the real world's bleakness. In the Matrix, SWAT troops kill Mouse. Cypher jacks out, grabs a real-world lightning gun, injuring Tank and killing Dozer. He kills Apoc and Switch, who remain jacked in, by prematurely terminating their connections. In the Matrix, Smith defeats and captures Morpheus. Neo and Trinity try to jack out but Cypher threatens to unplug them too, however he is thwarted when Tank recovers, killing Cypher and helping Neo and Trinity jack out.

Neo learns the Agents seek to hack into Morpheus's brain, forcing him to tell them the access codes to the mainframe in the hidden rebel city Zion. After refusing to sacrifice Morpheus to prevent this, Neo decides to jack in and attack the building where he is being held. He and Trinity proceed to fight their way to the roof level of the building, where they are confronted by Agent Jones. Neo unloads two entire magazines on Jones as he dodges each bullet effortlessly. When Jones returns fire, Neo proves capable of dodging bullets himself, fluidly moving in a way only an agent was thought to be capable of. Trinity then shoots Jones at point-blank range. Using an armed chopper, Neo and Trinity successfully rescue Morpheus. As Neo has just successfully rescued comrades from a building protected by heavily armed guards and agents (thought to be an unprecedented feat), Tank and Morpheus both believe Neo is indeed The One. Neo tries to tell Morpheus what the Oracle told him, but Morpheus explains that she merely told Neo what he needed to hear: had he believed himself to be the One, he would likely not have attempted the rescue, which was a necessary step to his emergence as the One.

Reaching the hard line, Morpheus and Trinity return to the real world, but Neo is trapped by Agent Smith. Trinity admonishes Neo to run, but he stands his ground, having begun to believe that he may be the One. The two of them draw guns and fire them empty, but are able to effortlessly dodge each other's fire. Neo skillfully engages Smith in hand-to-hand combat, almost seeming to be Smith's equal. In the end Neo is briefly incapacitated and held by Smith as a subway train approaches, but at the last minute he is able to get free and backflip up onto the platform, leaving Smith to be run over. The Agent, however, possesses the body of the conductor and emerges from the train and Neo, realizing that the Agents' ability to possess other bodies makes this a fight he cannot win, flees the subway station.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Matrix bullets.png|thumb|right|320px|Neo discovers that he can control the simulated reality of the Matrix, and is therefore able to stop bullets]] --&gt;
Pursued by Smith and his fellow Agents, Neo is able to evade them and reach the location of the hard line, just to be ambushed and fatally shot in the chest by Smith. Trinity, seeing Neo die in the real world while his mind is still in the Matrix, tells his evidently lifeless body that the Oracle had foretold that she would fall in love with The One. When kissed by Trinity, Neo comes back to life, finally fully emerging as The One. The Agents try to kill him again, Neo simply raises his hand and the bullets freeze in mid-air, then drop harmlessly to the ground. It is then shown that he is able to perceive, interpret, and alter the computer code of the Matrix. Fully believing in his newfound powers, he effortlessly fends off Agent Smith before forcing himself into the agent's body and destroying it from within. The other two agents quickly flee.

Neo is then seen leaving a message for the machines via phone; a warning that he plans to oppose the machines by freeing as many human minds as possible. He then hangs up and flies into the sky.

===''The Matrix Reloaded''===
Approximately six months between the events of the first film and ''The Matrix Reloaded'', Neo is now fully confident in his ability to manipulate the artificial world within the Matrix. Not surprisingly, he no longer uses firearms and instead prefers martial arts. His ability to manipulate the coding of the Matrix allows him to stop incoming fire from multiple attackers. Dispensing with the long black [[trenchcoat]] and black shirt he wears at the conclusion of ''The Matrix'', Neo now prefers a [[cassock]] with a high-rise [[mandarin collar]] giving the appearance of a priest or Bishop. He and Trinity are now lovers. Neo seeks more advice from the Oracle, unsure of his purpose, while Zion prepares for a massive attack by the Machines from over 250,000 Sentinels &amp;ndash; giant jellyfish-like machines. The Oracle directs him on a quest to find the Keymaker, a personified program that has access to numerous [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]s within the system. The Keymaker will be able to lead Neo safely to the [[Source code|Source]], the programming heart of the machine world, which contains the programs sustaining the Matrix.

After the Oracle leaves, Agent Smith (now known simply as Smith) appears, and it is revealed that Neo had separated Smith from the rest of the Matrix code by shattering him, giving him a life independent of the machine's systems, and now the two of them share a "connection" to each other. Smith is no longer an Agent of the Matrix, but has become more [[Computer virus|virus]]-like, able to insert his code into other systems and infect other programs and human minds to make copies of himself. Neo fends off hundreds of these Smiths and escapes. Later, he, Morpheus, and Trinity steal the Keymaker from his keeper, [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|The Merovingian]]. During this time, Neo stays behind to fight off the Merovingian's men and becomes separated from the others. He flies off to help them and only arrives in time to save Morpheus and the Keymaker from two agents crashing two semis together.

The Keymaker explains that two power stations elsewhere in the Matrix must be disabled in a short time window to successfully disable the security system of a building where the door to the Source will appear, allowing Neo to reach it. This task is accomplished; but the Keymaker is killed, a hovercraft is destroyed, and Trinity is put in jeopardy by Agents of the Matrix; a vision that Neo has seen earlier in his dreams. Entering the door, Neo finds himself confronted by [[Architect (Matrix character)|the Architect]], a program which created and designed The Matrix.

The Architect presents Neo with a radically different explanation of his origins and purpose, claiming that Neo is actually the sixth "One". He goes on to say that Zion has been destroyed by the machines five times before; faced with the dilemma of allowing humanity to be destroyed, or allowing the machines' preferred status quo to be reconstructed, Neo's five predecessors have helped reload, or restart the Matrix, before being allowed to rebuild Zion with a handful of freed humans. The productive output of the Matrix is based upon this repeated cycle of destruction and recreation, to keep the human minds which power it in a stable structure. The Oracle is as much part of that self-perpetuating design as the Architect, Neo is told, and the prophecy of The One is designed to ensure it runs smoothly each time.

The Architect warns of the annihilation of all human life in and out of the Matrix if he did not enter the Source door to reload the Matrix, but unlike his predecessors, Neo does not enter the door to the Source; he chooses not to believe the Architect's dire warnings of consequences, and to save Trinity instead. Returning to the Matrix, he catches Trinity as she falls from an upper-story window of a power plant. She dies of a gunshot wound to the heart that she sustains during the fall, but Neo brings her back to life by reaching into her [[virtual body]], removing the bullet, and restarting her heart.

Together, they exit the Matrix and return to the real world. Neo tells Morpheus that the Prophecy was merely another system of control, and that Zion's destruction is imminent. A group of Sentinels begin to converge on their hovercraft, so that Neo and the others are forced to abandon it and flee as it is destroyed. Neo stays behind, realizing that he can now sense the Sentinels, and stops them from attacking by force of will; however, the effort causes him to fall unconscious. He and the crew are rescued by the hovercraft ''Mjolnir'' (also known as the ''Hammer''), the crew of which is dealing with a mystery in the form of Bane, a crew member from another ship, who is the only survivor of an ill-fated attack by the Zion fleet. Unknown to anyone, Bane has been caught and infected by Smith.

===''The Matrix Revolutions''===
''The Matrix Revolutions'' begins immediately after the events of the second movie. As a result of his struggle with the Sentinels, Neo returns to consciousness finding himself caught in an isolated train station-like [[limbo]] only accessible by order of the Merovingian, from which his mind is unable to free itself.  It is here that he meets Sati, a young program created without a purpose who is being smuggled into the Matrix by her parents, who are also programs in the machine world.  Neo remains trapped until freed by Trinity (assisted by Morpheus and Seraph) who threatens the Merovingian in a [[Mexican standoff]].

After a final visit to the Oracle, Neo learns that he has powers over the machines which extend beyond the Matrix and that Smith is spreading, threatening to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. Building on the Oracle's previous explanations about the nature of choice, Neo learns that the Architect's assertion that his choice to save Trinity would inherently lead to the extinction of humankind was incorrect, due to his nature as a purely mathematical being rendering him incapable of seeing past choices made by humans as he considers them mere variables in equations. Having told Neo that he now has the power to choose to end the war and defeat Smith, the Oracle then states "Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo" and informs him that he must now go to the heavily guarded Machine City in hopes of stopping the Sentinels and Smith. Soon after Neo leaves, dozens of Smiths come and assimilate Seraph, Sati, and the Oracle.

Neo and Trinity are given the ''Logos'', a hovercraft commanded by Morpheus's former lover, [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]], in what seems to others as a suicidal journey to the Machine City. Meanwhile, Captain Roland and the ''Nebuchadnezzar'''s surviving crew of [[Link (The Matrix)|Link]] and Morpheus in the hovercraft ''Hammer/Mjolnir'' return to Zion, which is now besieged and losing to the Machines. Neo and Trinity are ambushed by the stowaway Bane/Smith, who blinds Neo with an electric cable, but is killed when Neo discovers an ability to 'see' programs and Machines independently of his eyesight. Neo, with Trinity as pilot, guide the ''Logos'' past the Machine City's defenses, but in the effort the ''Logos'' crash-lands, and Trinity sustains fatal injuries and dies.

Neo encounters the Deus Ex Machina, a giant Machine construct and the de facto leader of the Machines. He offers Smith's defeat and destruction in exchange for a truce. The offer is accepted; Neo enters the Matrix to find that the Smith program has copied itself throughout the simulated world, and has turned it into a rainswept dark simulation. One of the copies of Smith, having assimilated the Oracle and obtained as much freedom and control over the virtual world as Neo, faces Neo alone. For a while, the two fight evenly with no real advantage, but ultimately, the tireless Smith begins to wear out Neo and takes control of the fight. Realizing he cannot win with brute force, Neo allows Smith to assimilate him, which enables the machines to eradicate the Smith virus directly through his body, though Neo's life is sacrificed in the process.

Neo's body is taken away by the Machines in the Machine City, while below in Zion, the Machines stop their attack and retire in deference to the peace that Neo bartered. The Matrix is rebooted and a beautiful sunrise appears over the horizon, created by Sati in Neo's honor.

===''The Matrix Online''===
Although the fate of Neo was never truly revealed in the [[MMORPG]] sequel, ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', his influence nevertheless had a strong impact on several key events throughout the game.

In the beginning, scattered code fragments of Neo's "RSI" (Residual [[Self image|Self Image]]) were found on the bodies of the impostor Agents who appeared across the Mega City during Chapter 1.1 (later revealed to be Sentinels under the command of The General program). When held, these fragments echoed some of the final thoughts of Neo inside the redpill's mind. Each of the three main post-war political organizations inside the Matrix realized the possible significance of these fragments and began fighting amongst themselves to gather as many as they could.

The Oracle reveals a secret society of exiles known only as the Shapers, who are the only ones able to bring the Fragments together in any significant way and that they must be protected from the impostor agents' corruption. The redpills' distrust and organizational differences prove too much for any strong unity, so that a Shaper fell into the captivity of the false agents. His power was used to encode some part of The One's being onto them, creating the powerful, pale-skinned "N30 Ag3nts".

In Chapter 1.2, Morpheus states that though the Machines never returned Neo's physical remains (Neo's body in the real world) to Zion, they did not "recycle" them: a reference to the first film, in which Morpheus tells Neo that the machines liquefy deceased occupants of the Matrix to provide organic sustenance for its living inhabitants. This would be the driving force behind Morpheus' descent into fanatical terrorism against the System in an attempt to force the Machines to reveal Neo's fate, ultimately leading to his assassination.

The subject of Neo then fell to the side lines for other struggles until the arrival of The Oligarchs in Chapter 9. The original intruder, Halborn, was notably intrigued by the life of The One and was personally shocked about the implications of Neo's ability to affect Machines outside of the simulation had on his search for what he called "The Biological Interface Program".

After Halborn's removal in Chapter 10, little more was questioned until the revelation of the Trinity project, originally headed by The Oracle, in Chapter 12. It was revealed that both Neo and Trinity were actually the culmination of decades of Machine research into translating human DNA perfectly into Machine code, allowing them to interface directly with technology without the need for simulated interfaces.

==Powers and abilities==
Neo has carried, since his conception, the Matrix's source code known as the Prime Program. This gives him the ability to freely manipulate the simulated reality of the Matrix, similar to the authority a system administrator has over a given system. He manifests these abilities as various superhuman powers.
 
The power Neo exhibits most often is akin to [[telekinesis]] in the Matrix. In that, he seems capable of manipulating any object in the Matrix through will alone. By focusing this ability upon himself, he can fly at amazing speeds and jump great distances. Whilst his speed is never specified, he flies from the Merovingian's mountain manor to the highway "500 miles due south" in a very short time. His speed of flight is further exemplified by his ability to escape explosions, and the sonic boom left in his wake has the power to overturn rows of heavy vehicles. He has used this ability multiple times to stop several bullets in mid flight, first against the Agents and again against the Merovingian.
 
In addition to his abilities, Neo possesses [[superhuman strength]] and [[agility]], and is near-invulnerable to most attacks.  Although his physical endurance is immense, Neo can still be harmed or killed, as evidenced by an injury that Neo suffers while blocking a sword with his hand.  His endurance is also finite: when confronted by masses of Smith clones in the second film, Neo was forced to escape rather than continue fighting through he easily overpowered at least 40 Smith clones and threw about 50 of him, and upon being disconnected from the Matrix, he appeared exhausted and winded. His reflexes are great enough to dodge bullets. Neo's strength and speed level have never been accurately measured; he is known to be capable of Mach 8, at least, and Mach 10 under stress, but his upper limit has never been shown.  In the third movie, Neo has reached his (apparent) full strength; he is capable of withstanding a direct physical punch from Smith, and is also able to hold his own in a prolonged fight (though his endurance is not without limit; he can fight Smith to a standstill, but not defeat him).

In the real world, Neo does not display any of the aforementioned abilities aside from fighting skills. Neo does have some degree of wireless connectivity with the Matrix system: he eventually learns to sense the presence of the Machines, and even interfere with their function. This capability initially overwhelms him, and he loses consciousness from the strain.  According to the Oracle, "The power of The One extends beyond the Matrix. It reaches from here all the way back to where it came from." Apparently because of his status as The One, he has a direct connection to the Source, and can therefore affect everything connected to it.  After he is blinded in the fight against Smith/Bane, Neo begins to perceive everything connected to the Source, including the Machine City itself, as silhouettes of golden light; he is thus able to see Smith/Bane and kill him.

The '''Neville–Neville feud''' was an inheritance dispute which took place in the [[north of England]] during the early [[15th century|fifteenth century]] between two branches of the [[House of Neville|Neville family]]. The inheritance in question was that of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]], a prominent northern nobleman who had issue from two marriages. Westmorland favoured as his [[heir]]s the children of his second wife, [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]], closely related to the royal family, over those of his first wife, [[Margaret de Stafford|Margaret Stafford]].

After Ralph Neville's death in 1425, many of the Neville family holdings were transferred through legal means to the children of Joan Beaufort (the Middleham [[cadet branch]] of the Neville family), in effect disinheriting the senior branch (the Nevilles of Raby). This led to more than a decade of rivalry between both branches of the family. Ralph Neville's eldest son, [[John Neville (d.1420)|John Neville]], had died before his father. John Neville's son, also named [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Ralph]], became the 2nd [[earl of Westmorland]]. Though the title earl of Westmorland passed to the senior Nevilles, for legal reasons, many holdings, particularly those of the Neville patrimony in [[History of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] and [[Raby Castle]] in [[County Durham|Durham]] were transferred to Joan and her children. The [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort]] Nevilles were also able to consolidate their control over the [[County Palatine of Durham]] after [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]] assumed the office of [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1437.

The senior branch disputed their disinheritance — both legally and by force of arms — but Joan Beaufort's eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville]], prevailed due to his family's greater political connections. The feud continued through the 1430s, until an agreement was reached in 1443. This settlement was largely favourable to Salisbury, and both branches of the family remained at odds with each other. The dispute between the senior and junior branches of the Neville family continued into the [[Wars of the Roses]]. During the prolonged civil war, the senior branch sided with the Lancastrians, while their cousins sided with the Yorkists. Margaret Stafford's grandsons gave Salisbury no support during the conflict and he was captured fighting for [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]]. Rather than being ransomed according to the usual custom of the time, Salisbury was beheaded by the common people "who loved him not."

==Background and causes==
[[File:Neville Inheritance.png|thumb|Neville holdings in [[Yorkshire]], [[Cumberland]], [[Northumberland]], [[Westmorland]] and [[County Durham|Durham]] in the 15th c.]]
Disputes over divided inheritances were not uncommon in [[Later Middle Ages|later medieval England]]; apart from the dispute between branches of the Neville family, there were similar disputes within the [[Baron Talbot|Talbot]] and [[Mountford family|Mountford]] families. Historian [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] described these three disputes, where property was transferred from a senior line to a junior line, as "particularly large scale and high profile".{{sfn|Hicks|2002|p=177}}

Ralph Neville, the 1st earl of Westmorland (c. 1364–1425) married twice. His first wife Margaret Stafford, daughter of the [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford|earl of Stafford]], died in 1396.{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} Shortly after her death, Ralph Neville married Joan Beaufort, daughter of [[John of Gaunt]] and cousin of [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]].{{sfn|Hicks|1991|p=266}} They had 9 sons and 5 daughters together: the eldest, Richard Neville, became [[earl of Salisbury]]; their second son, [[William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent|William Neville]], became [[earl of Kent]] and was created [[Baron Fauconberg]]; [[George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer|George Neville]] became the 1st [[Baron Latimer]], [[Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny|Edward Neville]] was [[Baron Abergavenny]] and their youngest, [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]], eventually assumed the office of Bishop of Durham.{{sfn|Commire|2000a}}{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} Historian [[Anthony Tuck]] writes that this marriage "was to have major consequences both for the Neville family and for the English nobility" throughout the 15th century.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} 

Neville's new proximity to the royal family through his marriage to the Richard II's cousin, and his loyalty to the Crown during the [[Richard II of England#Second crisis of 1397.E2.80.9399|crisis of July 1397]], led to his elevation to the [[Peerage of England|peerage]] as [[earl of Westmorland]] in 1397.{{sfn|Brown|2015|p=116}}{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=173}} Joan and Ralph were granted numerous offices, lands, wardships and pensions. They continued to enjoy royal favour until the death of King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] in 1413.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=320}} 

The Neville patrimony included lands in [[Yorkshire]], [[County Durham|Durham]], [[Westmorland]] and [[Cumberland]].{{sfn|Arvanigian|2004|p=28}} After marrying Joan Beaufort, Ralph Neville began the process of disinheriting the children from his first marriage through a legal process called [[enfeoffment]]. The earl's eldest son [[John Neville (d.1420)|John Neville]], had previously agreed to a settlement in which he would inherit only [[Raby Castle]] and [[Brancepeth Castle]] in Durham.{{sfn|Bicheno|2017|loc=ch. 8}} This transfer of property to the cadet branch resulted in the "virtual disinheritance" of the senior branch of the family.{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} It was done legally and left the senior Nevilles with no legal recourse.{{sfn|Hicks|1991a|p=323}} [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]] has noted that the earl's eldest son does not seem to have attempted to stop his father or prevent his son's disinheritance, but may even have assisted with some of the transfers.{{sfn|Ross|1950}} 

This process of transfer of property, the so-called "Neville trust" or "Neville-Beaufort trust", had as its architect [[William Gascoigne]], one of the crown's most prominent lawyers. This might reflect an interest of the crown in retaining the Neville lands with Beaufort descendants, who would be closely related to the royal family due to their shared Lancastrian ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reputation and Representation in Fifteenth-Century Europe|last=Biggs|first=Douglas L.|last2=Michalove|first2=Sharon D.|last3=Reeves|first3=Albert Compton|year=2004|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Henry V: New Interpretations|last=Dodd|first=Gwilym|year=2013|publisher=[[Boydell &amp; Brewer]]|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of the dispute==
[[File:Ralph Neville.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.60|Drawing of [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]]{{'}}s tomb]]

When Ralph Neville died in 1425, the title earl of Westmorland passed to his eldest grandson Ralph "[[fee tail|in tail male]]",{{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} but neither of his sons by Margaret Stafford were mentioned in his will.{{sfn|Petre|1979|p=423}} Joan immediately took possession of [[Middleham Castle]], [[Penrith Castle]] and [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] for her eldest son.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=535}} She also held [[Raby Castle]] in Durham as part of her [[dower]] until her death in 1440.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|pp=590–591}} Historian J. R. Lander has written that the second earl of Westmorland was as "poor in land as an Earl as his father had been in early life as a baron."{{sfn|Lander|1980|p=177}} 

Only some estates in [[Brancepeth]], [[History of Northumberland|Northumberland]], Lincolnshire, two inns in London and [[History of Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Bywell Castle]] and property in [[Ripon]] were left for the senior Neville inheritance.{{sfn|Lewis|2015|loc=ch. 4}} The vast Yorkshire properties of [[Middleham Castle]], [[Sheriff Hutton Castle]] and [[Wensleydale]] all went to Richard Neville,{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|pp=590–591}} who also became Warden of the West March when he inherited the [[Honour of Penrith]] in [[Cumberland]].{{sfn|Bicheno|2017|loc=ch. 8}} {{sfn|Tuck|2004b}} His wife, 15-year-old [[Alice Montacute, 5th Countess of Salisbury|Alice Montagu]], was the sole heir of the [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury|late Earl of Salisbury]],{{sfn|Commire|2000b}} so Richard also inherited the title [[earl of Salisbury]] in 1428 when his father-in-law was killed in the [[Hundred Years' War]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=217}} 

Westmorland spent much of life trying to recover the properties at Middleham, Sheriff Hutton, Penrith and Raby, but he was largely unsuccessful, because Joan Beaufort had powerful allies amongst the nobility including [[Thomas Langley]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], and her brother [[Cardinal Beaufort]].{{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} Langley withheld the [[patronage]] of the [[county palatine]] from the second earl, and denied him any available official offices or positions under the bishop's grant.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} Westmorland entered into recognisances with the Beaufort-Nevilles in 1430, after Salisbury brought the matter before the King's council.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=322}} When Salisbury departed for the Hundred Years' War in 1431 and again in 1436, Westmorland was once again [[bound over]] to keep the King's peace.{{sfn|Pollard|2004b}} However, in 1435, complaints from the North reached the [[Lord Chancellor]] that the dispute between the elder and junior branches of the Neville family had resulted in the assembling "by manner of war and insurrection, great routs and companies upon the field, which have done all manner of great offences".{{sfn|Baldwin|2011|loc=ch. 1}}

When the Bishop of Durham died in 1437, [[Cardinal Beaufort]] used his influence on the king's council to help Joan's younger son [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]] become the new Bishop. The [[House of Beaufort]] was able to gradually consolidate its control over the holding.{{sfn|Tuck|2004a}} By 1441, Salisbury's younger brother Lord Fauconberg was steward and military commander of Durham.{{sfn|Pollard|2004c}} There were a number of attempts to arbitrate a settlement in council, and between 1441 and 1443 both parties were constrained by bonds not to enter each other's estates except with permission. Historian [[R. L. Storey]] has questioned—with Salisbury being such a significant member of the council—whether Westmorland ever had "much faith in its impartiality".{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=113}}

==Aftermath and consequences==

[[File:Middleham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 610849.jpg|thumb|[[Middleham Castle]], seat of [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland]] and later her son the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]].]]
A peace was finally agreed between Salisbury and Westmorland on 26 August 1443.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=323}} Pollard writes that the "settlement" signified a "crushing defeat" for Ralph II {{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} and that the "odds had been heavily stacked" against him from the start.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=14}} True, he was confirmed in his right to the Lordship of [[Raby Castle]], but had to surrender everything else he had previously claimed from Salisbury back to him. He was also placed in bonds of £400 to keep to the agreement in the future, not just to Salisbury, but to his four brothers as well.{{sfn|Pollard|2004a}} Westmorland had to renounce all claims to the Neville lands in [[County Durham]], and had to pay annual rents to Salisbury for various Northumberland manors.{{sfn|Jacob|2004|p=323}} Salisbury was not subject to similar constraints, merely having to agree to not claim the £400 pension while Westmorland adhered to their agreement.{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=186}}

[[J.R. Lander]] described the Neville–Neville feud as illustrating how the Neville family "never could and never did work together".{{sfn|Lander|1986|p=32}} The dispute between the senior and junior branches of the Neville family continued into the Wars of the Roses.{{sfn|Wagner|2001|p=174}} During the prolonged conflict that ravaged the English nobility, Westmorland gave his half-brother no support at all; in fact Westmorland's younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|Lord John Neville]] died fighting for the Lancastrian [[King Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] at the [[Battle of Towton]] in 1461.{{sfn|Griffiths|1991|p=342}} Salisbury himself was captured at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and instead of being ransomed, he was beheaded by the common people, who "loved him not."{{sfn|Haigh|2001}} Lander also suggested that if had been united as a family behind Salisbury, who supported [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] during the Wars of the Roses, York's "power in the land would have been overwhelming".{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=177}}

The '''OMACs''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|m|æ|k|s}}; '''Omni Mind And Community''', originally '''Observational Metahuman Activity Construct''') are a fictional type of [[cyborg]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. They are based on the [[Jack Kirby]] [[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|character of the same name]].

==Publication history==
The OMACs first appeared in ''[[The OMAC Project]]'' #1 (June 2005) and were created by [[Greg Rucka]].

==Fictional team biography==
===The OMAC Project===
{{Main|The OMAC Project}}
The OMACs are cyborgs, human bodies transformed by a virus into living machines to assassinate any and all beings with superpowers. The virus was created from [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac-13]]'s nanotechnology, which had been acquired by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] and [[Lexcorp]], and was then secretly introduced into general [[vaccine]] supplies. The OMACs are featured in the mini-series ''The OMAC Project'' that leads up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' series.

====Brother MK I====
The new OMACs are controlled by the Brother MK I satellite. Brother MK I was created by [[Batman]] and programmed by Pseudopersons, Inc., scientist [[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|Buddy Blank]], who in this retelling of the story is a partner of Wayne Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|title=Countdown|issue=30|date=October 3, 2007|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sole purpose was to gather data on all [[metahuman]]s, both villain and hero.  Batman had grown distrustful of metahumans after discovering that the [[Justice League]] [[mindwipe|altered his memories]] following an altercation with [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] in ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]''. [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]] later gave the satellite sentience as part of his plans. [[Maxwell Lord]], recently promoted to the top rank of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]], subverted the original mission of the Brother MK I satellite by inculcating a fear and suspicion of all metahumans. The first OMAC test subject was renamed "Buddy Blank", after the scientist who programmed the satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns]], [[Greg Rucka]] and [[Judd Winick]]|artist=various artists|title=[[Countdown to Infinite Crisis]]|issue=1|date=May 2005|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OMACs' history may be more recent than Brother MK I's itself. [[Equus (comics)|Equus]] and Pilate, formerly featured in ''[[For Tomorrow (comics)|Superman: For Tomorrow]]'', are later denounced as former iterations of the OMAC concept. In ''[[Justice League#JLA: Classified|JLA: Classified]]'' an all mechanical OMAC is an enemy of the [[Metal Men]]. Since then, the design has improved to the current form, with little to no changes to the base model.

====Brother Eye====
When Maxwell Lord brainwashed [[Superman]] to kill Batman, [[Wonder Woman]], and possibly the rest of the [[Justice League|JLA]], Wonder Woman broke Lord's neck to free Superman from his control. Because Lord proffered this solution while held by her Lasso of Truth, Diana believed this was the only course of action possible; she was fiercely criticized from many quarters.

Brother MK I, rechristening itself Brother Eye, initiated the "KingIsDead" protocol. Specifically designed to be used in the event of Lord's death, it ordered all of the OMACs (all 1,373,462 of them) to attack and kill all the metahumans on Earth and destroy Checkmate. A group superhero effort stopped the attack, using an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] blast as well as a "Shut Down" command given by [[Sasha Bordeaux]], who had become a third-generation cyborg linked to Brother Eye, now designated Blacknight 1. These measures effectively freed the majority of the OMAC hosts from their nanotech forms and reduced the number of OMACs to roughly 200,000.

===Infinite Crisis===
{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}

====Truth and Justice====
In response, the satellite broadcast footage of Wonder Woman executing Maxwell Lord, preceded by the word MURDER, to media outlets all over the world, destroying her reputation. After this, Brother Eye initiated the final protocol, "Truth and Justice", by having all the remaining OMACs invade and attack her homeland, Themyscira, to wipe out all of the Amazons.

It was revealed that [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]] was the one who wrestled control of Brother Eye away from Batman. He used it to program his [[multiverse]] tuning fork and redirect its energy to where he needed it as part of his attempt to re-create [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Earth-Two]], and in turn, a perfect Earth. Brother Eye continues to aid Alex Luthor by remapping out the multiverse and helping to guard the tuning fork with its OMACs, reasoning that it would eliminate the need for heroes like those who Batman had created it to monitor by aiding in the creation of a perfect Earth.

====Downfall of Brother Eye====
Batman leads a collection of superheroes, consisting of: [[Hal Jordan]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], [[Green Arrow (Oliver Queen)|Green Arrow]] (only because Batman is attempting to trust people again and contacted him to see if he would come), [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Mister Terrific]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Black Canary]], the new [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], [[Metamorpho]], [[Booster Gold]] and Sasha Bordeaux, to Earth's orbit using Intel from Booster Gold and [[Ted Kord]]'s spaceship. Blue Beetle's scarab allows him to find and reveal Brother Eye's hidden location above Earth by negating its vibrational frequency. Brother Eye sends the OMACs and the two groups clash.

With the two Green Lanterns fighting off most of the OMACs and Brother Eye's defenses, the heroes' ship crashes into Brother Eye. Metamorpho provides an oxygen supply as Blue Beetle and Booster Gold stay with the ship to guard it, but Blue Beetle later assists in the destruction of the device that Brother Eye used to hide in orbit and the rescuing of some of the other heroes. Batman goes to distract Brother Eye by shutting off the central computer, although Brother Eye tries to distract him by showing him [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]]'s confrontation with [[Superboy-Prime]]. Sasha, linked to [[Barbara Gordon#Oracle (1989–present)|Oracle]], goes to upload every computer virus on Earth into Brother Eye's system as well as trying to prevent the artificial gravity from shutting down. Black Canary goes to the surveillance room to use her sonic scream to blind the Eye. Black Lightning and Mr. Terrific go to the memory banks so that Black Lightning fries as much circuitry as possible while Mr. Terrific, invisible to machines and electronics, delivers the fatal blow by knocking Brother Eye off orbit using its orbital thrusters.

The plan works, and Brother Eye is deactivated, and begins to fall apart. All of the remaining activated OMACs shut down, releasing their hosts. As the heroes evacuate the falling Brother Eye, it tries to take Batman down with it, telling him he can never trust the costumed heroes again after what they did to him. Batman, however, says that he will take his chances, and accepts Hal Jordan's aid in getting to safety.

After crash-landing in Saudi Arabia, Brother Eye tries to download its system into Sasha as a means of self-preservation. However, Sasha manages to destroy the satellite, freeing herself from the nanobots infecting her.

===DCU: A Brave New World===
On June 28, 2006, DC released ''DCU: A Brave New World'', which was the epilogue to the ''OMAC'' limited series.

Brother Eye has not been fully decommissioned and lies in a [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] facility. [[Michael Costner]] is the last OMAC unit, kept as emergency backup, and Brother Eye calls to him.

This Brother Eye has corrupted programming and now believes that all humans need to be subjugated and/or exterminated, whether metahuman or not. It has also recently begun to manifest disassociative behavior with at least two "personalities" now being heard in the OMAC's internal conversations.

===OMAC limited series (2006)===
{{Main|Michael Costner}}

The 2006 ''OMAC'' limited series (not to be confused with the 2005 ''OMAC Project'' limited series) follows "the last OMAC" Michael Costner. Brother Eye attempts to make Costner rebuild itself, but is forced to face his wrath when Costner regains control of both his forms, human and OMAC, and subsequently destroys Brother Eye again; although a tiny fraction of it is still active.

===Countdown to Final Crisis===
{{Main|Countdown to Final Crisis}}
A portion of Brother Eye was later retrieved and rebuilt by Buddy Blank, a former scientist from Wayne Industries. This portion meets the time-traveling [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]] who is seeking a cure for the Morticoccus, a 31st-century illness that evolved from the OMAC virus. Announcing that "the Great Disaster has come to me", Brother Eye directs him to [[Blüdhaven]]. Soon after, it reactivates its offensive protocols and assimilates the hangar it is being held in, turning the people within the hangar into new OMAC cyborgs. It then travels to the ruins of Blüdhaven and assimilates the city's infrastructure and the people within it using the [[Atomic Knight]]s and [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] as power sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | title=Countdown | issue=21 | date=December 5, 2007 | publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | title=Countdown | issue=20 | date=December 12, 2007 | publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | title=Countdown | issue=15 | date=January 16, 2008 | publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it activates a [[Boom Tube]] and travels to [[Apokolips]], where it assimilates the entire planet and attempts to obtain the Morticoccus virus from Karate Kid, who has also been led there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | title=Countdown | issue=12-9 | date=February 2008 | publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is forced to flee Apokolips when attacked by the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]] using the [[Anti-Life Equation]].

Later, Brother Eye transforms Buddy Blank into a modified OMAC resembling Kirby's version of the character. Buddy uses this power to save himself and his grandson from starvation in the Command-D bunker beneath Blüdhaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|title=Countdown|issue=1|date=April 23, 2008|publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Eye implies that it will contact Buddy again for a future need.

===Batman and the Outsiders===
{{Main|Outsiders (comics)}}
[[Image:ReMAC HCV.jpg|185px|thumb|left|Depiction of ReMAC from ''[[Outsiders (comics)|Batman and the Outsiders]]''.]]
A modified OMAC is shown as a part of the new Outsiders team in the 2008 ''Batman and the Outsiders'' series.

When a team from the Justice League attempts to seize a partially active OMAC, a leftover from ''The OMAC Project'' events, Batman takes the opportunity to reclaim it for himself—having Dr. Francine Langstrom (the long-suffering wife of [[Man-Bat|Dr. Kirk Langstrom]]) create a clever forgery to leave in care of the League.

The OMAC, aptly renamed '''ReMAC''', appears to be "an [[iPod]] with its tracklist wiped". Dr. Langstrom is unable to discern who ReMAC was before being infected by the OMAC virus; finding ReMAC a mere husk, devoid of any personal identity. This complete lack of personality makes ReMAC the perfect infiltrator, using its advanced shapeshifting abilities and its unquestioning obedience for the Outsiders' sake.

Since its lack of personality allows villains to snatch control of ReMAC, turning it into an enemy, Batman rigs up a telepresence system turning ReMAC into an advanced drone for Salah Miandad, Dr. Langstrom's chief assistant, enabling operation from the Outsiders HQ, the Batcave, or other secret locations.

However, while testing a new neural interface, less dependent from his stamina, to control the former OMAC, Salah is knocked into a coma. His mind comes to reside in ReMAC, supplanting the missing personality of the drone for a while (one full issue), until, due to the machinations of the villainous [[Simon Hurt]], ReMAC is fed a malicious self-destruct code that blows it to pieces, making the restoration of Salah's consciousness impossible.

===Final Crisis===
In ''[[Final Crisis]]'', [[Darkseid]] and his prophets from Apokolips have taken new forms as humans on Earth after mass-distributing the Anti-Life Equation around the world. Batman has been captured; Superman is on a journey in the multiverse; and Wonder Woman has become a [[Female Furies|Female Fury]]. With most of the world's population under the influence of the equation, they are effectively under Darkseid's control seemingly making him the ruler of the Earth.

In the one-shot ''Final Crisis: Resist'', Mister Terrific and the Checkmate organization are working to mount a resistance against Darkseid, but seemingly do not have the means to do it. Sitting in despair in a Checkmate stronghold, [[Snapper Carr]], through his hopeless rantings, gives Mister Terrific an ingenious idea. Using Sasha Bordeaux to make contact with Brother Eye, he convinces the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] to help them, explaining that it will surely be destroyed if Darkseid indeed captures the world.

Realizing this, Brother Eye accepts Mister Terrific's terms and reveals that there are still millions of people infected with OMAC nanotech. These people, now mindless drones of Darkseid, are overwritten by Brother Eye and become OMAC soldiers under the command of Mister Terrific. This gives Checkmate and him the means to forcefully resist Darkseid.

During the ''Final Crisis'' events when all seems lost, Lord (Brother) Eye prepares to leave the doomed Earth with his OMACs and the people of Command-D, the bunker underneath Blüdhaven, and start a new society on another Earth in another universe. To this end, he asks [[Renee Montoya]] to serve as the head of a to-be-founded [[Global Peace Agency|Global Peacekeeping Agency]], her faceless appearance as the [[Question (comics)#Renee Montoya|Question]] being an allusion to the faceless agents of the GPA from the original OMAC series.

===Generation Lost===
In the ''[[Justice League: Generation Lost]]'' limited series, the resurrected Maxwell Lord controls the squad of OMACs attacking [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Jaime Reyes]]'s home and his family.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #2 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The old Justice League International arrives and takes Jaime's family to safety.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #3 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Max escapes from the JLI, Booster Gold's partner, [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]] informs the JLI that he has the locations of the four formerly-dormant Checkmate cells which he had placed inside robotics laboratories that Max has been in contact with.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #10 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The JLI travel to Chicago beneath the hidden robotics laboratory and learns that the OMAC variants were pure robots that are human/machine synthesis of the originals. Skeets scans the fingerprints of the robotics laboratory and discovers that [[Professor Ivo]] was here.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #11 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Captain Atom absorbs the energy from Magog's spear, he is propelled forward through time 112 years in the future, where Max, while long dead, has plunged humanity into a massive metahuman war ruled by OMACs. Captain Atom battled for survival alongside the future versions of the Justice League, however they all are eventually contaminated by a new version of OMACs and one by one become OMACs themselves. Captain Atom is eventually returned to the present, but not before Batman ([[Damian Wayne]]) tells him how to stop Max's ultimate plans.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #14 (November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterward, Max gains new abilities to transform his targets into cadaver Black Lanterns then into OMAC's after being fully restored to life.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #17 (January 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Max uses a device to enhance his new mental powers, turning people around the world into OMACs to attack Wonder Woman and the JLI.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #22 (March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Max sends his newest OMAC known as OMAC Prime which he gave sentience and his voice to attack Diana and the JLI.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #23 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; This new OMAC could assimilate the abilities of metahumans in order to grow ever stronger with time, initially overwhelming the heroes it fought. During the final battle, Prime takes Blue Beetle's power, causing it to be nearly unstoppable, but Blue Beetle mentioned to OMAC Prime that it cannot control the Scarab's power. Blue Beetle uses this to paralyze prime with crippling system failures before attacking and destroying OMAC Prime for good.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #24 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible Future===
In ''Batman'' #700 (June 2010) in a [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] within the issue, [[Damian Wayne]] as Batman is shown having succeeded at what his father had failed to do: regaining control of Brother Eye.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #700&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kevin Kho===
In [[The New 52]], a reboot of the DC Comics universe that launched in September 2011, a [[Cambodian-American]] man named Kevin Kho is introduced as the new O.M.A.C. and had worked as a genetic researcher at [[Project Cadmus]]&lt;ref&gt;''O.M.A.C.'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell Lord is revealed to have had a hand in Kevin's transformation.&lt;ref&gt;''O.M.A.C.'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was cancelled after running eight issues, due to DC's introduction of a "Second Wave" of new titles. Additionally, O.M.A.C. joined the [[Justice League International]] in the title's final issue.&lt;ref name=SecondWave&gt;{{cite web| last = Kushins| first = Josh| title = DC Comics in 2012-–-Introducing the "Second Wave" of DC Comics The New 52| work = The Source| publisher = DC Comics| date = January 12, 2012| url = http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-–-introducing-the-“second-wave”-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/| accessdate = January 14, 2012| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/64hEz5q0J?url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/2012/01/12/dc-comics-in-2012-%E2%80%93-introducing-the-%E2%80%9Csecond-wave%E2%80%9D-of-dc-comics-the-new-52/| archivedate = January 14, 2012| deadurl = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, the [[Crime Syndicate of America]] has captured Kevin Kho's O.M.A.C. form and is planning to use him as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' Vol. 4 #24&lt;/ref&gt; Harley, who is working for the Thinker, takes O.M.A.C. and activates him causing him to fire a laser on the mountain which collapses on the two teams inside it. Harley arrives at Belle Reve and drops O.M.A.C. near [[James Gordon Jr.]] James Gordon Jr. also learns that the Thinker is planning to use O.M.A.C. While James Gordon Jr. is talking to Harley, the Thinker has taken O.M.A.C. and begins transferring his mind to it. Now activated, O.M.A.C. proceeds to attack Amanda Waller, James Gordon Jr., Harley Quinn, King Shark, and Kamo.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' Vol. 4 #25&lt;/ref&gt; King Shark begins to attack Kamo, until Amanda Waller is able to lie to both to get them to help her defeat OMAC.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' Vol. 4 #26&lt;/ref&gt; OMAC is fighting King Shark and Kamo while Amanda Waller attempts to activate Belle Reve's failsafe through the Thinker's computer. Before she is able to do so, Kevin Kho reaches out to her telling her he is trapped within OMAC.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' Vol. 4 #27&lt;/ref&gt; As Waller works with Kho, the team returns from the mountains, only to be dragged into the fight with OMAC. Having killed Kamo, OMAC is able to defeat Power Girl, Steel, Unknown Soldier, and King Shark and heads further into Belle Reve. Deadshot and Harley find "magic bullets" that will allow them to gain temporary super human powers. Deadshot fires them into Harley, Waller, himself, and Unknown Soldier and the Squad begins to attack OMAC.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' Vol. 4 #28&lt;/ref&gt; Kho is able to regain control of OMAC before Waller has to enact her last resort. But without knowing, Captain Boomerang knocks OMAC into a porthole, sending him to another dimension.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' Vol. 4 #29&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Kho returns in [[DC Rebirth]] in Blue Beetle. He is a friend of [[Jaime Reyes]]. After seeing monsters in the city, OMAC takes control of Kevin and begins fighting. Jaime convinces OMAC to help him against the real enemy and OMAC agrees.

==Powers and abilities==
Brother Eye can activate the virus in any infected person, at any time, within planetary range. Once activated, the person is covered in cybernetic armor and becomes a thrall to Brother Eye's commands.

An OMAC unit has access to archives on almost every metahuman on file, and can simulate the powers of a variety of superheroes and supervillains in order to target its opponent's weaknesses. Among the powers displayed were the ability to fly, shoot fire, project needles of artificial cellulose (against [[Alan Scott]]; an approximation of his weakness to wood), dispense flame-retarding foam, and fire various energy beams from its eye and hands with caustic, concussive, or blinding effects. In addition, the OMAC unit can morph its extremities into blades and pincers. It once simulated [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]]'s lightning power and forced [[Mary Marvel]] to revert to her human form. It can disable the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]] effortlessly.

The only weakness an OMAC has is that it is human beneath its shell, intended as a deterrent to prevent heroes from using lethal force against them. The OMACs are dependent on their assessment of individual heroes. When fighting multiple opponents, they require a few seconds to adapt their countermeasures for each hero. [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] was able to stop an OMAC that was attacking the [[Justice Society of America|JSA]] by stomping it before it could assess his threat level. OMACs are also very vulnerable to Mister Terrific, as he cannot be detected by technology.

In the ''[[Superman/Batman]]'' series, Brainiac temporarily occupies a prototype OMAC drone.&lt;ref&gt;Superman/Batman 36, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

ReMAC, the OMAC possessed by the Outsiders, has the same powers and abilities of a regular OMAC. He greatly differs in his physical makeup, being red in color and with a more human-like face even in his armored form.

Unable to contact Brother Eye and unable to access his former personality, ReMAC was controlled for a period by Dr. Salah Miandad. In this way, ReMAC retained his invulnerability and strength, but was limited by Salah's personal stamina and attention span, which was not always sufficient for a fight. Salah's mind was later trapped into the ReMAC body by a faulty mind interface, removing the limits of his below-average stamina.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Brother Eye appears in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "When OMAC Attacks!" voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. This version is the '''One-Man Army Corps''' Buddy Blank version. See [[Buddy Blank]]
* In the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode "[[List of Arrow episodes#ep49|Corto Maltese]]", [[The Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] is inspecting blueprints for OMAC. Later in the episode "[[List of Arrow episodes#ep51|The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak]]", a group of cyber terrorists referring to themselves as Brother Eye used a virus to attack Starling City and threatened to shut down all banks and set everyone on an even socioeconomic status. [[Felicity Smoak]] is revealed to have created the '''Brother Eye Virus''' years ago with her then-boyfriend currently donning the name and leading the terrorist group, '''Cooper Seldon'''. In the episode "[[List of Arrow episodes#ep55|The Climb]]", Ray Palmer tells Felicity that he is changing the name of the exo-suit design from "OMAC" to "A.T.O.M.".

===Video games===
* The OMAC Project makes a cameo appearance in Batman's ending for the video game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]''. In the game, it is explained that Batman designed the OMACs as a way to defend New Earth from multiverse invaders following the destruction of Dark Kahn (the merged form of [[Darkseid]] and [[Shao Kahn]]). These OMACs have an armor pattern that is similar to Batman's own costume and the acronym stands for '''O'''uterworld '''M'''onitor and '''A'''uto '''C'''ontainment''.
* Brother Eye and the OMAC Project appear in ''[[DC Universe Online]]'' with Brother Eye voiced by Ken Thomas. Brother Eye is reactivated and becomes a pawn of Brainiac in his plot to take over Earth. Brother Eye unleashes the OMAC virus and begins assimilating the area around the Gotham City Knights Dome. The players find Brother Eye in the sewers in Gotham City. Brother Eye's OMAC minions consist of Defective OMAC, OMAC Drones, OMAC MK II, OMAC Nanosyths, OMAC Sigmas, OMAC Units, OMAC Delta, and an OMAC Incinerator.
* Brother Eye appears in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[David Loefell]] as a communications hub linking every satellite and server on the planet which will warn Batman of impending crime. Bruce designed it after toppling Superman's regime in the previous game. During the game's story mode, Batman shows Black Canary and Green Arrow the new Batcave in the old Gotham Subway system built by Bruce's great-grandfather where Brother Eye is located. He explains Brother Eye's purpose to them. It is eventually taken over by Brainiac forcing Batman to abandon the Batcave. Cyborg hacks it, in though Brainiac states it is impossible for a mere human to penetrate his neural network though Cyborg reveals that he is not trying to. Cyborg reveals he is teaching Brother Eye to ignore Brainiac which successfully removes it from Brainiac's control. Catwoman then orders Brother Eye to activate communications so the Insurgency and Regime can coordinate evacuation of civilians in preparation for their attack on Brainiac's ship. Batman orders Brother Eye to broadcast their communications on the old Justice League band. Brother Eye is also the games announcer and its satellite interface acts as the game's main menu. The Brother Eye Vault acts as a menu for decoding Mother Boxes (as part of the game's loot box system), as well as regenerating and transforming customizable gear. In the Multiverse Mode intro, it is revealed that Brother Eye is equipped with the latest [[Source (comics)|Source energy]] scanners enabling it to search for threats to both the Regime Universe and others allowing them to deal with crisis and ensure peace in the Multiverse. As a result Brother Eye plays a key role in the narrative of Multiverse Mode.
* OMAC appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]''.

'''''Pet Society''''' was a [[social-network game]] developed by [[Playfish]] that could be played on [[Facebook]]. The game ranked as one of the most popular Facebook applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Top Applications |url= http://www.developeranalytics.com/search_app.php |publisher= DeveloperAnalytics |location=  |date= 17 April 2009 |accessdate= 17 April 2009 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5g67OEU4t?url=http://www.developeranalytics.com/search_app.php |archivedate= 17 April 2009 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Pet Society |url= http://www.developeranalytics.com/app.php?id=11609831134 |publisher= DeveloperAnalytics |location=  |date= 17 April 2009 |accessdate= 17 April 2009 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5g67V3GwT?url=http://www.developeranalytics.com/app.php?id=11609831134 |archivedate= 17 April 2009 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players could design their pets by choosing genders, names, colors and altering appearances. The user interacted with their pets through washing, brushing, petting and feeding.

The game was launched August 8, 2008 by Playfish and at its "peak had 50 million monthly players, 5 million daily players and made as much as $100,000 a day by selling in-game items."&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/08/when-a-cold-hearted-corporation-takes-away-your-beloved-virtual-pet/278588/|title=When a Cold-Hearted Corporation Takes Away Your Beloved (Virtual) Pet|last=Maiberg|first=Emanuel|date=2013-08-12|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic Arts acquired Playfish in November 2009.

An [[iOS]] version, ''Pet Society Vacation'' was released in 2011 with similar gameplay, but set on a topical island with new settings like underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2011/07/27/pet-society-vacation-review/|title=Pet Society Vacation Review - Gamezebo|date=2011-07-27|work=Gamezebo|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Players' pets could interact with each other within the "friend" network. Pets could visit the pets of their owner's friends and perform activities with these pets (washing, grooming, feeding, etc.) A pet could visit other pets as many times a day as it wished. The players received coins and Paw Points on their first visit of the day to each friend,&lt;ref name="GamasutraFriends"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/116117/InDepth_The_Most_Popular_Gamer_On_Facebook.php/|title=In-Depth: The Most Popular Gamer On Facebook|last=Im|first=Soyon|work=Gamasutra|date=September 16, 2009|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but earn only Paw Points for subsequent visits. Participating in the Daily Lottery, visiting friends, winning awards, cleaning or playing with pets, winning hurdle races, or betting on the outcome of hurdle races also provided players with ways to earn coins. Visiting friends, buying items, and using the stadium earned players Paw Points.

Paw Points were akin to XP/EXP (Experience) in other social games of the sort; gaining sufficient paw points made the pet level up. When a pet leveled-up, the player received coins, new features and special statuses. During Pet Society's initial release, there were 34 levels. In 2009, after houses were enlarged to accommodate 10 rooms, 13 additional levels were added, bringing the total to 47. In August 2010, the level cap of Pet Society was raised to 100.

Some certain items were required to be bought at a certain level.

== Reception ==
[[Gamezebo]] gave it 5 out of 5 stars, liking the content variety and fun unique activities, but warning the players aren't raising pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2010/03/05/pet-society-review/|title=Pet Society Review|last=Squires|first=Jim|date=2010-03-05|work=Gamezebo|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter of Bourbon-La Marche''' (1342&amp;ndash;1362, [[Lyon]]) was the eldest son of [[James I, Count of La Marche]] and Jeanne of Châtillon.

He was knighted by his father shortly before the [[Battle of Brignais]], in which both father and son fought. Both were severely wounded during the battle, but were carried away by their soldiers to Lyon. He survived his father only a short while, and was succeeded by his brother [[John I, Count of La Marche|John]].

==Overview==
Compartmentalization was important in the origins of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Membranes form enclosed compartments that are separate from the external environment, thus providing the cell with functionally specialized aqueous spaces. Because lipid bilayer of membranes is impermeable to most [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] molecules (dissolved by water), cells have membrane transport systems that achieve the import of  nutritive molecules as well as the export of waste.&lt;ref&gt;

It is very challenging to construct protocells from molecular assemblies. An important step in this challenge is the achievement of vesicle dynamics that are relevant to cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking and self-reproduction, using amphiphilic molecules. On the primitive Earth, numerous chemical reactions of organic compounds produced the ingredients of life.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Of these substances, amphiphilic molecules might be the first player in the evolution from molecular assembly to cellular life.&lt;ref&gt;Deamer, D.W.; Dworkin, J.P. "Chemistry and Physics of Primitive Membranes". Top. Curr. Chem. 2005, 259, 1–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walde, P. "Surfactant Assemblies and their various possible roles for the origin(s) of life." Orig. Life Evol. Biosph. 2006, 36, 109–150.&lt;/ref&gt; A step from vesicle toward protocell might be to develop self-reproducing vesicles coupled with the metabolic system.&lt;ref&gt;

==Selectivity for compartmentalization==
[[File:Phospholipids aqueous solution structures.svg|thumb|left|200px|The three main structures phospholipids form in solution; the [[liposome]] (a closed bilayer), the micelle and the bilayer.]]
Self-assembled vesicles are essential components of primitive cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2010" /&gt; The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the universe move in a direction in which disorder (or [[entropy]]) increases, yet life is distinguished by its great degree of organization. Therefore, a boundary is needed to separate [[Metabolism|life processes]] from non-living matter.&lt;ref name="SciAm 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Simpler Origin for Life |journal=Scientific American |date=12 February 2007 |first=Robert |last=Shapiro |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-simpler-origin-for-life/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cell membrane]] is the only cellular structure that is found in all of the cells of all of the organisms on Earth.&lt;ref name="mgh.ex9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073031216/student_view0/exercise9/the_importance_of_membranes.html |title=The Importance of Membranes |accessdate=2014-03-17 |first=Darrell S. |last=Vodopich |first2=Randy |last2=Moore. |year=2002 |work=Biology Laboratory Manual, 6/a |publisher=McGraw-Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Irene A. Chen and [[Jack W. Szostak]] (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009)  amongst others, demonstrated that simple physicochemical properties of elementary protocells can give rise to simpler conceptual analogues of essential cellular behaviors, including primitive forms of Darwinian competition and energy storage. Such cooperative interactions between the membrane and encapsulated contents could greatly simplify the transition from replicating molecules to true cells.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt;  Competition for membrane molecules would favor stabilized membranes, suggesting a selective advantage for the evolution of cross-linked fatty acids and even the [[phospholipid]]s of today.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt;  This [[micro-encapsulation]] allowed for [[metabolism]] within the membrane, exchange of small molecules and prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Thomas Ming Swi |title=Artificial cells : biotechnology, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, blood substitutes, bioencapsulation, cell/stem cell therapy |year=2007 |publisher=World Scientific |location=Hackensack, N.J. |isbn=978-981-270-576-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include increased [[solubility]] of the cargo and creating [[Energy#Biology|energy]] in the form of chemical gradient. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when chemically combined with [[oxygen]] during [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref name="Knowles 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knowles |first=JR |title=Enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reactions |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=49 |pages=877–919 |year=1980 |pmid=6250450 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.49.070180.004305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pph.2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |first2=Brad |last2=Williamson |first3=Robin J. |last3=Heyden |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy gradient===
A March 2014 study by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory demonstrated a unique way to study the origins of life: fuel cells.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140313"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=How Did Life Arise? Fuel Cells May Have Answers |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-079 |date=13 March 2014 |work=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel cells are similar to biological cells in that electrons are also transferred to and from molecules. In both cases, this results in electricity and power. The study states that one important factor was that the Earth provides electrical energy at the seafloor. "This energy could have kick-started life and could have sustained life after it arose. Now, we have a way of testing different materials and environments that could have helped life arise not just on Earth, but possibly on [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and other places in the [[Solar System]]."&lt;ref name="NASA-20140313" /&gt;

==Vesicles and micelles==
[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a [[micelle]] spontaneously formed by [[phospholipid]]s in an [[aqueous]] solution]]
When [[phospholipids]] are placed in water, the molecules spontaneously arrange such that the tails are shielded from the water, resulting in the formation of membrane structures such as bilayers, vesicles, and micelles.&lt;ref name="PiP" /&gt; In modern cells, [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] are involved in [[metabolism]], transport, buoyancy control,&lt;ref name="mr.58"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsby |first=AE |title=Gas vesicles |journal=Microbiological Reviews |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=94–144 |year=1994 |pmid=8177173 |pmc=372955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[enzyme]] storage. They can also act as natural chemical reaction chambers. A typical vesicle or [[micelle]] in [[aqueous solution]] forms an aggregate with the [[hydrophilic]] "head" regions in contact with surrounding [[solvent]], sequestering the [[hydrophobic]] single-tail regions in the micelle centre. This phase is caused by the [[Lipid bilayer phase behavior|packing behavior]] of single-tail [[lipids]] in a [[lipid bilayer|bilayer]]. Although the protocellular self-assembly process that spontaneously form lipid ''monolayer'' vesicles and micelles in nature resemble the kinds of primordial vesicles or protocells that might have existed at the beginning of evolution, they are not as sophisticated as the ''bilayer'' membranes of today's living organisms.&lt;ref name="HHMI 2004"&gt;{{cite web |last=Szostak |first=Jack W. |title=Battle of the Bubbles May Have Sparked Evolution |url=http://www.hhmi.org/news/battle-bubbles-may-have-sparked-evolution |date=3 September 2004 |work=[[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than being made up of phospholipids, however, early membranes may have formed from monolayers or bilayers of [[fatty acids]], which  may have formed more readily in a prebiotic environment.&lt;ref name="Exploring Origins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploringorigins.org/fattyacids.html |title=Membrane Lipids of Past and Present |author=National Science Foundation |year=2013 |work=Exploring Life's Origins Project - A timeline of Life's Evolution |accessdate=2014-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatty acids have been synthesized in laboratories under a variety of prebiotic conditions and have been found on meteorites, suggesting their natural synthesis in nature.&lt;ref name="Chen 2006" /&gt;

[[Oleic acid]] vesicles represent good models of membrane protocells that could have existed in prebiotic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aminosilane/Oleic Acid Vesicles as Model Membranes of Protocells |journal=Langmuir |date=24 November 2014 |last=Douliez |first=Jean-Paul |last2=Zhendre |first2=Vanessa |last3=Grélard |first3= Axelle |last4=Dufourc |first4= Erick J. |volume=30 |issue=49 |pages=14717–14724 |doi=10.1021/la503908z |pmid=25420203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrostatic interactions induced by short, positively charged, hydrophobic peptides containing 7 amino acids in length or fewer, can attach RNA to a vesicle membrane, the basic cell membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/08/peptide-glue-rna-may-have-held-first-protocells-together|title = Peptide glue may have held first protocell components together|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Electrostatic Localization of RNA to Protocell Membranes by Cationic Hydrophobic Peptides|journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume = 54|issue = 40|pages = 11735–11739|doi = 10.1002/anie.201505742|pmid = 26223820|pmc = 4600236|year = 2015|last1 = Kamat|first1 = Neha P.|last2 = Tobé|first2 = Sylvia|last3 = Hill|first3 = Ian T.|last4 = Szostak|first4 = Jack W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal ponds and clay===
[[Image:Lipid bilayer section.gif|thumb|left|This fluid [[lipid]] bilayer cross section is made up entirely of [[phosphatidylcholine]].]]
Scientists have suggested that life began in [[hydrothermal vent]]s in the deep sea, but a 2012 study suggests that inland pools of condensed and cooled geothermal vapor have the ideal characteristics for the origin of life.&lt;ref name="Switek 2012"&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Switek |title=Debate bubbles over the origin of life |date=13 February 2012 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/debate-bubbles-over-the-origin-of-life-1.10024 |work=Nature - News }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion is based mainly on the chemistry of modern cells, where the cytoplasm is rich in potassium, zinc, manganese, and phosphate ions, which are not widespread in marine environments. Such conditions, the researchers argue, are found only where hot hydrothermal fluid brings the ions to the surface—places such as [[geyser]]s, mud pots, [[fumarole]]s and other [[geothermal]] features. Within these fuming and bubbling basins, water laden with zinc and manganese ions could have collected, cooled and condensed in shallow pools.&lt;ref name="Switek 2012" /&gt;

Another study in the 1990s showed that [[montmorillonite]] clay can help create RNA chains of as many as 50 nucleotides joined together spontaneously into a single RNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Discover 2004" /&gt; Later, in 2002, it was discovered that by adding montmorillonite to a solution of fatty acid [[micelles]] (lipid spheres), the clay sped up the rate of [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] formation 100-fold.&lt;ref name="Discover 2004" /&gt;

Research has shown that some minerals can catalyze the stepwise formation of hydrocarbon tails of [[fatty acids]] from hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases—gases that may have been released from [[hydrothermal vent]]s or [[geyser]]s. Fatty acids of various lengths are eventually released into the surrounding water,&lt;ref name="Exploring Origins" /&gt; but vesicle formation requires a higher concentration of fatty acids, so it is suggested that protocell formation started at land-bound hydrothermal vents such as [[geyser]]s, mud pots, [[fumarole]]s and other [[geothermal]] features where water evaporates and concentrates the solute.&lt;ref name="Discover 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HHMI protocell model"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack W. |last=Szostak |title=Researchers Build Model Protocell Capable of Copying DNA |date=4 June 2008 |work=HHMI News |url=http://www.hhmi.org/news/researchers-build-model-protocell-capable-copying-dna |publisher=Howard Hughes Medical Institute }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ns.dn4307"&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Cohen |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4307 |title=Clay's matchmaking could have sparked life |work=New Scientist |date=23 October 2003 |quote=Journal reference: ''Science'' (vol 302, p 618 ) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montmorillonite bubbles===
Another group suggests that  primitive cells might have formed inside inorganic clay microcompartments, which can provide an ideal container for the synthesis and compartmentalization of complex organic molecules.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2011"&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard A. |last=Stone |title=Clay-armored bubbles may have formed first protocells |date=7 February 2011 |work=Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay-armored ''bubbles'' form naturally when particles of [[montmorillonite]] clay collect on the outer surface of air bubbles under water.  This creates a semi permeable vesicle from materials that are readily available in the environment. The authors remark that montmorillonite is known to serve as a chemical catalyst, encouraging lipids to form membranes and single nucleotides to join into strands of RNA. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the clay bubbles burst, releasing the lipid membrane-bound product into the surrounding medium.&lt;ref name="Harvard 2011" /&gt;

===Membrane transport===
[[Image:Pore schematic.svg|thumb|200px|right|Schematic showing two possible conformations of the lipids at the edge of a pore. In the top image the lipids have not rearranged, so the pore wall is hydrophobic. In the bottom image some of the lipid heads have bent over, so the pore wall is hydrophilic.]]
For cellular organisms, the transport of specific molecules across compartmentalizing membrane barriers is essential in order to exchange content with their environment and with other individuals.

Environmental effects have been suggested to trigger conditions under which a transport of larger molecules, such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], across the membranes of protocells is possible. For example, it has been proposed that [[electroporation]] resulting from [[lightning]] strikes could enable such transport.&lt;ref name="Demanèche20012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demanèche|first=S|last2=Bertolla|first2=F|last3=Buret|first3=F|last4=et. al|date=August 2001|title=Laboratory-scale evidence for lightning-mediated gene transfer in soil|journal=Appl.

During electroporation in laboratory procedures, the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore (hole) that acts as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA and RNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core.&lt;ref name="Neumann19822"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neumann|first=E|last2=Schaefer-Ridder|first2=M|last3=Wang|first3=Y|last4=Hofschneider|first4=PH|year=1982|title=Gene transfer into mouse lyoma cells by electroporation in high electric fields|journal=EMBO J.|volume=1|issue=7|pages=841–5|pmc=553119|pmid=6329708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, electroporation is one of the key methods of [[transfection]] as well as bacterial [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].

A similar transfer of content across protocells and with the surrounding solution can also be caused by freezing and subsequent thawing. For example, this could occur in an environment in which day and night cycles cause recurrent freezing. Laboratory experiments have shown that such conditions allow an exchange of genetic information between populations of protocells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Litschel|first=Thomas|last2=Ganzinger|first2=Kristina A.|last3=Movinkel|first3=Torgeir|last4=Heymann|first4=Michael|last5=Robinson|first5=Tom|last6=Hannes Mutschler|last7=Schwille|first7=Petra|date=2018|title=Freeze-thaw cycles induce content exchange between cell-sized lipid vesicles|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1367-2630/20/i=5/a=055008|journal=New Journal of Physics|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=055008|doi=10.1088/1367-2630/aabb96|issn=1367-2630}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained by the fact that membranes are highly permeable at temperatures slightly below their phase transition temperature. If this point is reached during the freeze-thaw cycle, even large and highly charged molecules like [[nucleic acid]]s can temporarily pass the protocell membrane.

Some molecules or particles are too large or too hydrophilic to pass through a lipid bilayer even under these conditions, but can be moved across the membrane through [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fusion]] or budding of [[Lipid vesicle|vesicles]],&lt;ref name="oleb.282"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=V.|last2=Raine|first2=D.J.|date=October 1998|title=A fission-fussion origin for life|journal=Orig Life Evol Biosph|volume=28|issue=4|pages=523–537|pmid=9742727}}&lt;/ref&gt; events which have also been observed for freeze-thaw cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsuji|first=Gakushi|last2=Fujii|first2=Satoshi|last3=Sunami|first3=Takeshi|last4=Yomo|first4=Tetsuya|date=2016-01-19|title=Sustainable proliferation of liposomes compatible with inner RNA replication|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/3/590|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=3|pages=590–595|doi=10.1073/pnas.1516893113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=26711996|pmc=4725462}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may eventually have led to mechanisms that facilitate movement of molecules to the inside of the protocell ([[endocytosis]]) or to release its contents into the extracellular space ([[exocytosis]]).&lt;ref name="oleb.282" /&gt;

K. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |issn=2322-0015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the nature and properties of the Jeewanu remains to be clarified.&lt;ref name="Grote 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA 1967"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Linda D. |last=Caren |first2=Cyril |last2=Ponnamperuma |year=1967 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670026284.pdf |format=PDF |title=A review of some experiments on the synthesis of 'Jeewanu' |journal=NASA Technical Memorandum X-1439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar synthesis experiment a frozen mixture of water, [[methanol]], ammonia and [[carbon monoxide]] was exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This combination yielded large amounts of organic material that self-organised to form globules or vesicles when immersed in water.&lt;ref name="pnas.98"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Self-assembling amphiphilic molecules: Synthesis in simulated interstellar/precometary ices |first=Jason P. |last=Dworkin |first2=David W. |last2=Deamer |first3=Scott A. |last3=Sandford |first4=Louis J. |last4=Allamandola |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=30 January 2001 |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=815–9 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/98/3/815.abstract |pmid=11158552 |doi=10.1073/pnas.98.3.815 |pmc=14665 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..815D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigating scientist considered these globules to resemble cell membranes that enclose and concentrate the chemistry of life, separating their interior from the outside world. The globules were between {{convert|10|to|40|µm|in}}, or about the size of red blood cells. Remarkably, the globules [[fluoresced]], or glowed, when exposed to UV light. Absorbing UV and converting it into visible light in this way was considered one possible way of providing energy to a primitive cell. If such globules played a role in the origin of life, the fluorescence could have been a precursor to primitive [[photosynthesis]]. Such fluorescence also provides the benefit of acting as a sunscreen, diffusing any damage that otherwise would be inflicted by UV radiation. Such a protective function would have been vital for life on the early Earth, since the [[ozone layer]], which blocks out the sun's most destructive UV rays, did not form until after photosynthetic life [[Great Oxygenation Event|began to produce oxygen]].&lt;ref name="StarStuff"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mullen |first=L |title=Building Life from Star-Stuff |journal=Astrobiology Magazine |date=5 September 2005 |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/1702/building-life-from-star-stuff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and controversy==
Protocell research has created controversy and opposing opinions, including critics of the vague definition of "artificial life".&lt;ref name="n.465"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Life after the synthetic cell |journal=Nature |date=27 May 2010 |volume=465 |issue=7297 |pages=422–424 |doi=10.1038/465422a |pmid=20495545|bibcode=2010Natur.465..422. |last1=Bedau |first1=M. |last2=Church |first2=G. |last3=Rasmussen |first3=S. |last4=Caplan |first4=A. |last5=Benner |first5=S. |last6=Fussenegger |first6=M. |last7=Collins |first7=J. |last8=Deamer |first8=D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of a basic unit of life is the most pressing ethical concern, although the most widespread worry about protocells is their potential threat to human health and the environment through uncontrolled replication.&lt;ref name="Beadau"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beadau |first=Mark A. |title=The ethics of protocells moral and social implications of creating life in the laboratory |year=2009 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass. |isbn=978-0-262-51269-5 |edition=Online |last2=Parke |first2=Emily C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sean Aaberg was born in [[Oakland, California]]. He is the son of [[Philip Aaberg]] and LouAnn Lucke. He grew up in Oakland, attending [[Bishop O'Dowd High School]] and briefly attended the [[California College of the Arts]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a kid, he liked  "anything weird, nasty and old", including cheap magazines and bought thousands of them, he said in an interview. He and his friends read ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', drew comics, liked to listen to [[Cheech and Chong]] and the [[Ramones]] on the [[Dr. Demento]] show, and later discovered the [[Church of the Subgenius]]. He admired the movies of [[Ralph Bakshi]]. The interviewer noted that Aaberg writes in ALL CAPS.&lt;ref name=Contraversao/&gt; Sean founded and played drums in the Oakland-based Hardcore Punk band The Masked Men, played drums for Baltimore-based Anarcho Punk band A//Political and founded and played drums for Eugene-based Rock and Roll band The Latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dread|first=Dennis|title=Entartete Kunts|year=2013|publisher=Ajna Bound|page=1|url=http://www.theajnaoffensive.com/products/entartete-kunts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726094407/http://www.theajnaoffensive.com/products/entartete-kunts|archivedate=2013-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaberg came up in the international [[DiY-Fest|DIY]] Punk scene in the 90s&lt;ref name=Contraversao/&gt; doing [[zines]] and art for Punk zines such as  ''[[Slug and Lettuce (fanzine)|Slug and Lettuce]]''. Aaberg has created illustrations and comics for ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'', ''[[Roctober]]'', ''Kitchen Sink'' magazine, ''BANG!'' newspaper, and ''VICE'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Aaberg|url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/a/aaberg_sean-p.htm|publisher=Lambiek Comiclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaberg is mostly known for his Weirdo Art following in the foot-steps of [[Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]], [[Basil Wolverton]] and [[Robert Crumb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sean Aaberg|date=September 28, 2012|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/illustration/sean-aaberg|publisher=Juxtapoz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean has been noted for his ability to change styles and use different design languages in order to keep things lively. Such comic artists as [[Tim Goodyear]] have been published in PORK.&lt;ref name=gridlords&gt;{{cite news|last=Nilsson|first=Emily|title=Tim Goodyear: Multiple Maniac, interviewed by Emily Nilsson|url=http://gridlords.tumblr.com/post/41471902132/tim-goodyear-multiple-maniac-interviewed-by-emily|accessdate=24 March 2013|newspaper=GRIDLords|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaberg sells his zines on the ''PORK'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://porkmagazine.bigcartel.com/product/pork-1 pork series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310021249/http://porkmagazine.bigcartel.com/product/pork-1 |date=2013-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaberg is the designer and artist, with Eric Radey, of &lt;i&gt;Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom&lt;/i&gt;, a cooperative fantasy boardgame with a punk metal esthetic. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom|date = 2017|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/210232/dungeon-degenerates-hand-doom|publisher=BoardGameGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is married to artist and photographer Katie Aaberg who collaborates with her husband on ''PORK''. She told an interviewer for ''Tension Magazine'' that people do not always understand their sense of humor and that they frequently receive hate mail from "activists" who lecture them on appropriate behavior, but "cultural ownership" is against their artistic vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tensionmagazine.com/articles.php?choice=katie-aaberg-interview Katie Aaberg Interview by Josi Hannon Madera, ''Tension Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Selfing  is widespread – from unicellular organisms to the most complex [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s (especially [[invertebrates]]). In unicellular organisms such as [[Protozoa]], selfing can occur when two individuals (or their [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]) interbreed that were produced from a previous [[mitosis|mitotic]] division of the same individual.

Among hermaphrodite animals there are some that regularly reproduce by self-fertilization. In others, it is a rare event; selfing in such species is more common in adverse environmental conditions, or in the absence of a partner.

==Genetic consequences of  selfing==
Self-fertilization results in the loss of genetic variation within an individual (offspring), because many of the genetic loci that were [[heterozygous]] become [[homozygous]]. This can result in the expression of harmful [[recessive]] [[allele]]s, which can have serious consequences for the individual. The effects are most extreme when self-fertilization occurs in organisms that are usually out-crossing. After several generations, [[inbreeding depression]] is likely to purge the deleterious alleles from the [[population]] because the individuals carrying them have mostly died or failed to reproduce.

If no other effects interfere, the proportion of heterozygous loci is halved in each successive generation, as shown in the following table.

*Parental &lt;math&gt;(P)&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;Aa&lt;/math&gt; x &lt;math&gt;Aa&lt;/math&gt; (100%), and in
*&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[generation]] gives:  &lt;math&gt;1 AA&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;2 Aa &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;1 aa&lt;/math&gt;, which means that the frequency of heterozygotes  now is 50% of the starting value.
*By the &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; generation, heterozygotes have almost completely disappeared, and the population is polarized, with almost exclusively [[homozygous]] individuals (&lt;math&gt;AA&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;aa&lt;/math&gt;)

In [[Irish folklore|Irish]] and [[Scottish folklore]], the '''Sluagh''' ({{IPA-ga|sˠl̪ˠuə|lang}}, {{IPA-gd|s̪l̪ˠuaɣ|lang}}; [[Irish orthography#Spelling reform|modern Irish spelling]] '''Slua'''; English: "horde, crowd") were the spirits of the restless dead.  Sometimes they were seen as sinners, or generally evil people who were welcome in neither heaven nor hell, nor in the [[Celtic Otherworld|Otherworld]], who had also been rejected by the [[Celtic Polytheism|Celtic]] deities and by the earth itself.  Whichever the underlying belief, they are almost always depicted as troublesome and destructive.  They were seen to fly in groups like flocks of birds, coming from the west, and were known to try to enter the house of a dying person in an effort to carry the soul away with them.  West-facing windows were sometimes kept closed to keep them out.  Some consider the Sluagh to also carry with them the souls of innocent people who were kidnapped by these destructive spirits.

Lewis Spence writes in 'The Magic Arts in Celtic Britain':&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Lewis (1945), ''The Magic Arts in Celtic Britain'', p. 88, {{ISBN|0-09-474300-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the Western Isles of Scotland the Sluagh, or fairy host, was regarded as composed of the souls of the dead flying through the air, and the feast of the dead at Hallowe'en was likewise the festival of the fairies."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8181">A '''terroristic threat''' is a threat to commit a [[crime of violence]] or a threat to cause bodily injury to another person and terrorization as the result of the proscribed conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Sonja Larsen, 86 [[Corpus Juris Secundum|C.J.S.]] ''Threats'' § 24 (database last updated Dec. 2015) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[U.S. state]]s have enacted [[state law|statutes]] which impose [[criminal liability]] for "terroristic threatening" or "making a terroristic threat."&lt;ref name="ALR"&gt;45 [[American Law Reports|A.L.R.]] 4th 949 (originally published in 1986, subsequently updated).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Generally, a terroristic threat "is sufficiently specific where it threatens death or great bodily injury, and a threat is not insufficient simply because it does not communicate a time or precise manner of execution. Thus, a criminal statute prohibiting terroristic threatening serves to criminalize future, as well as present, death threats."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 86 C.J.S. ''Threats'' § 24 (database last updated Dec. 2015) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have held that "a threat need not take any particular form or be expressed in any particular words, and may be made by innuendo or suggestion, and that the words uttered will not be considered in a vacuum but rather in light of all the circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of courts have upheld convictions under a state criminal terroristic threat statute on the basis of a single or solitary threat,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 7.&lt;/ref&gt; a conditional threat,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 8.&lt;/ref&gt; or a threat that some third person will take action.&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In several states, courts have held that a "threatener's present inability to carry out his or her threats does not in itself remove the threats from the purview of terroristic threat or terroristic threatening statutes."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the courts recognized that one does not violate a terroristic threat or terroristic threatening statute by making idle talk or jests which do not have a reasonable tendency to create apprehension that the speaker will act according to the threat."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The threat need not be communicated in person, but may be made by any means; courts have in a number of cases held that a terroristic threat statute may be violated by a threat may by telephone,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 22.&lt;/ref&gt; by letter&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 23.&lt;/ref&gt; by communication with a third party,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 24.&lt;/ref&gt; or by "a nonverbal, symbolic threat which in other respects satisfies the criminal elements specified in the terroristic threat statute" (such as the [[Cross-burning|burning of a cross]] on the target's driveway).&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 25[a].&lt;/ref&gt;

The required ''[[mens rea]]'' element of the offense is generally "that the accused have made the threat with the [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] or purpose of causing fear in the victim or in [[reckless disregard]] of the risk of causing such fear."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 29.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one court has specified that the "proof of a terroristic threat is measured by an objective standard."&lt;ref&gt;31A [[American Jurisprudence|Am. Jur.]] 2d ''Extortion, Blackmail, etc.'' § 53 (citing ''State v. Dispoto'', 189 N.J. 108, 913 A.2d 791 (2007)).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[American Law Reports]]'' indicates that "the cases are in disagreement over the availability of [[Intoxication defense|voluntary intoxication]] as a defense in a terroristic threat or terroristic threatening prosecution, with intoxication being a defense where a [[Specific intent|specific criminal intent]] is an essential element of the offense, but not a defense where the offense is established without specific criminal intent."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terroristic-threat statutes have generally been upheld by the courts against constitutional challenges raising claims that such laws violate the [[Free Speech Clause]],&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Void for vagueness|impermissibly vague]],&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or overlap with a criminal [[assault]] statute.&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example statutes==
===Model Penal Code===
Under the [[Model Penal Code]], "a person is guilty of a felony of the third degree if he threatens to commit any crime of violence with purpose to terrorize another or to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or facility of public transportation, or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience, or in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience."&lt;ref&gt;31A [[American Jurisprudence|Am. Jur.]] 2d ''Extortion, Blackmail, etc.'' § 53 (citing [[Model Penal Code]] § 211.3).&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
"Under [[California law]], the elements of the completed crime of making threats with intent to terrorize are: (1) willfully threatening to commit a crime that will result in death or great bodily injury to another person, (2) specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat, (3) the threat was on its face and under the circumstances so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, (4) the threat caused the victim to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family's safety, and (5) the victim's fear was reasonable under the circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 12.5 (citing West's Ann.Cal.Penal Code § 422).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
In [[Texas]], terroristic threats are prohibited under Chapter 22 of the [[Texas Penal Code]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm|title=Penal Code Title 5.

'''William Patrick "W. P." Kinsella''' {{post-nominals||country=CAN|OC|OBC}} (May 25, 1935{{snd}}September 16, 2016) was a Canadian [[Canadian literature|novelist]] and short story writer, known for his novel ''[[Shoeless Joe (novel)|Shoeless Joe]]'' (1982), which was adapted into the movie ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' in 1989. His work often concerned [[baseball]], [[First Nations]] people, and other Canadian issues.

==Early life==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
William Patrick Kinsella was born in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, the son of [[Irish Canadian]] parents, Olive Mary (née Elliott/Elliot), a printer, and John Matthew Kinsella, a contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3416500076/kinsella-w-illiam-p.html |title=Kinsella, W(illiam) P(atrick) 1935- - Contemporary Authors, New Revision Series |website=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised until he was 10 years old at a [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] near [[Darwell, Alberta]], 60&amp;nbsp;km west of the city, [[home school|home-schooled]] by his mother and taking [[correspondence course]]s. "I'm one of these people who woke up at age five knowing how to read and write," he says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcbookworld.com/?state=view_author&amp;author_id=2671 |title=ABCBookWorld |publisher=ABCBookWorld |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was ten, the family moved to Edmonton. He did not go to school until grade five, and did not attend university until he was in his mid-30s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=W.P. Kinsella: 14th Annual Literary Festival|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/litfest/14th/kinsella.html|publisher=Old Dominion University|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella was not exposed to literature in  school, claiming in a 2010 interview, "One Shakespeare play and one J. M. Barrie play was the total literature of my high school years."

Kinsella's literary education in his formative years came from reading and by attending all the plays at high school and any theatrical productions that made it to Edmonton. He also worked in the school library his senior year.&lt;ref name="geddes1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Geddes|first=John|title=W.P. on J.D.: Kinsella talks about writing Salinger into 'Shoeless Joe'|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/01/29/w-p-on-j-d-kinsella-talks-about-writing-salinger-into-shoeless-joe/|publisher=Macleans|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an adult, he held a variety of jobs in Edmonton, including as a clerk for the [[government of Alberta]] and managing a [[credit bureau]]. In 1967, he moved to [[Victoria, British Columbia]], running a pizza restaurant called Caesar's Italian Village and driving a taxi. Though he had been writing since he was a child (winning a [[YMCA]] contest at age 14), he began taking writing courses at the [[University of Victoria]] in 1970, receiving his Bachelor of Arts in Creative Writing there in 1974. He earned a Master of Fine Arts in English degree through the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1978.  Before becoming a professional author, he was a professor of English at the [[University of Calgary]].

==Literary life==
According to the ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', W. P. Kinsella's literary output primarily consisted of two cycles of work dealing with two [[fictional universe|fictive universes]]: those dealing with baseball and those depicting the [[First Nations|indigenous people of Canada]]. Kinsella's first published book was called ''[[Dance Me Outside (book)|Dance Me Outside]]'' (1977), which was a collection of seventeen short stories narrated by a young [[Cree]], Silas Ermineskin, who describes life on a [[Indian reserve|First Nations reserve]] in Kinsella's native Alberta.&lt;ref name="besner1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Besner|first=Neil|title=William Patrick Kinsella|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0004326|publisher=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later collection of similar stories, ''The Fencepost Chronicles'', earned Kinsella the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]].  Kinsella was criticized for writing from the point of view of Native people, appropriating their voices.  He rejected the criticism on the grounds that a writer has the license to create anything he chooses and called the term "[[cultural appropriation]]" the nonsense of [[Eastern Canada|Eastern Canadian]] academics.&lt;ref&gt;Bourgeois-Doyle, Dick, What’s So Funny?: Lessons from Canada’s Leacock Medal for Humour Writing. General  Store Publishing House, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-77123-342-2}}. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

These stories use the ineptness of the [[Indian agent|white bureaucrats on reservations]] as background, and Kinsella defended the stories, saying, "It's the oppressed and the oppressor that I write about. The way that oppressed people survive is by making fun of the people who oppress them. That is essentially what my Indian stories are all about." &lt;ref name="besner1"/&gt;

In the field of baseball, Kinsella wrote nearly 40 short stories and three novels. ''[[Shoeless Joe (novel)|Shoeless Joe]]'' (1982), his first novel, blends fantasy and [[magical realism]] to tell the story of a poor Iowa farmer who, yielding to voices in his head, builds a baseball field in his corn field that attracts the spirits of the [[Black Sox Scandal|1919 Chicago White Sox]]. The ''Iowa Baseball Confederacy'' (1986), another book blending fantasy and magical realism, recounts an epic baseball game a [[minor league]] team played against the 1908 World's Champion [[1908 World Series|Chicago Cubs]].   ''[[Box Socials]]'' (1991), an evocation of life in rural Alberta during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], features a growing boy as its narrator and a purported local batting hero's hopes in facing a visiting major league pitcher 60 miles away in Edmonton.

''Shoeless Joe'' remains Kinsella's most famous work. The book was mildly controversial in that it used a living person, the reclusive author [[J.D. Salinger]], as one of its main characters. Kinsella, who had never met him, created a wholly imagined character (aside from his being a recluse) based on the author of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', a book that had great meaning to him when he was a young man. To get a feel for Salinger, he re-read his body of work.&lt;blockquote&gt;"I made sure to make him a nice character so that he couldn’t sue me."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an example of [[metafiction]], he named his protagonist in ''Shoeless Joe'' "Ray Kinsella", a character from  Salinger's  uncollected story “[[A Young Girl in 1941 with No Waist at All]]”. Salinger had also used the surname shared by writer and protagonist in ''The Catcher in the Rye'' ([[Holden Caulfield]]'s friend Richard Kinsella).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Known for his litigiousness, Salinger contacted Kinsella's publisher via his attorneys to express outrage over having been portrayed in ''Shoeless Joe''. Kinsella denied that Salinger, as a writer, had any real influence on his own writing, despite rumors to the contrary (some rumors held that Kinsella had actually met Salinger in person).&lt;ref name="geddes1"/&gt;

''Shoeless Joe'' won Kinsella the prestigious [http://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Houghton%20Mifflin%20Literary%20Fellowship%20Award Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship] and the [[Books in Canada First Novel Award]] in 1982. The book garnered good reviews, sold very well, and was made into a popular movie.

==Adaptations==
W. P. Kinsella's novel ''Shoeless Joe'' was made into the movie ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', starring [[Kevin Costner]]. The movie grossed nearly $65 million in the United States, and helped establish Costner as a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box office/business for Field of Dreams (1989)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/business|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella's eight books of short stories about life on reserves were the basis for the 1994 movie ''[[Dance Me Outside]]'' and [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] television series ''[[The Rez]]'', both of which Kinsella considers to be of very poor quality{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. The collection ''Fencepost Chronicles'' won the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour|Stephen Leacock Award for Humour]] in 1987. The short story ''The Last Pennant Before Armageddon'' was adapted for the stage by the [[Live Bait Theater]] in [[Chicago]] in 1990.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A short story by Kinsella, ''[[Lieberman in Love]]'', was the basis for a short film that won the [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film]] in 1996. The Oscar win came as a surprise to the author, who, watching the award telecast from home, had no idea the film had been made and released. He had not been listed in the film's credits, and was not acknowledged by director [[Christine Lahti]] in her acceptance speech. A full-page advertisement was placed in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' apologizing to Kinsella for the error.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Career interruption==
W. P. Kinsella was involved in a car accident in 1997 which almost resulted in the end of his fiction writing career. He was struck by a car while out walking and suffered a head injury when he hit the ground. He would not publish another novel for 14 years.

In a 1999 interview with the [[University of Regina]]'s student newspaper, Kinsella explained that he could no longer write as he lost his ability to concentrate. The injury also robbed him of his senses of taste and smell. Kinsella said he went from being a [[Type A personality]] to Type B. After the accident, he didn't feel like doing the things he had done in his normal routine and didn't care. He did write book reviews to keep his name before the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coderre|first=Nadine|title=Car accident ends W. P. Kinsella's writing career|url=http://www.carillon.uregina.ca/99.09.30/feature/accident.html|publisher=The E-Carillon|accessdate=September 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729234011/http://www.carillon.uregina.ca/99.09.30/feature/accident.html|archivedate=July 29, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella's 14-year-long exit from the world of published fiction also may have had economic roots. He was cited as an archetypical victim of changes in the publishing industry during the late 1980s, which accelerated during the 1990s, that made it more difficult for well-regarded "mid-list" writers such as Kinsella to remain in print. Changes to the U.S. tax code effected by the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] discouraged publishers from maintaining inventories of titles in their back lists, as they were taxed on warehoused books.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

This led to the thinning out of back lists and the more rapid remaindering of books. The publishing industry underwent a wave of consolidation in the 1990s, as publishers were acquired by big communications companies seeking marketing synergies. The new publishing houses poured more capital into higher-paid, best-selling writers and celebrities who could guarantee "hit" books as well as media tie-in novels. Mid-list writers with first-rate reputations but mid-range, non-spectacular sales suffered accordingly as they were ignored by the new publishing conglomerates.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Commenting about the state of the book industry in a 2010 interview with ''[[Maclean's Magazine]]'', Kinsella said, "The publishing industry today is just—I couldn’t break into the market today if I was just starting out. The publishing industry is down to a few dozen mainly adventure and romance writers. There’s still some academic fiction out there, but it has an incredibly small audience. Nobody really cares about it."

==Later years==
On September 1, 2011, '[[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]'s [http://www.librarything.com/publisher/1251/Enfield-Wizenty Enfield and Wizenty], a small press specializing  in limited edition [[hardcover | hardcover books]], released Kinsella's first published work in thirteen years, ''[[Butterfly Winter]]''. The unpublished manuscript of the novel had won this publisher's Colophon Prize the preceding March. The release was backed up by a "modest" book tour, according to the publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News: Kinsella’s back!|url=http://www.enfieldandwizenty.ca|publisher=Enfield and Wizenty|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Julio and Esteban Pimental, twins whose divine destiny for baseball begins with games of catch in the womb, marks a return to form, combining his long-held passions of baseball and magical realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Steven|title=A welcome return to baseball’s field of dreams|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/butterfly-winter-by-wp-kinsella/article2229537|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=January 30, 2012|date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Toronto Press]] released a trade hardcover edition on October 1. A short story of Kinsella's by the same title was included in his 1988 collection, ''Red Wolf, Red Wolf'' published by Totem Press(Collins Publishers).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A noted tournament [[Scrabble]] player, Kinsella became more involved with the game after being disillusioned by the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]]. He spent his final years in [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], [[British Columbia]], with his fourth wife, Barbara, occasionally writing articles for various newspapers.

==Death==
Kinsella, who had suffered from [[diabetes]] for decades, elected to [[Euthanasia in Canada|die with a physician's assistance]] on September 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/books/shoeless+author+kinsella+died/12199117/story.html Obituary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013111103/http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/books/shoeless+author+kinsella+died/12199117/story.html |date=2016-10-13 }}, MontrealGazette.com; retrieved September 17, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Ángela Ginard Martí''' (3 April 1894 – 26 August 1936) – in religious '''Maria de los Ángeles''' – was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Nun|professed religious]] from the Zelatrices of the Eucharistic Devotion.&lt;ref name=SQPN&gt;{{citeweb|date=21 August 2015|accessdate=2 December 2017|publisher=Saints SQPN|url=https://www.catholicsaints.info/blessed-maria-de-los-angeles-ginard-marti/|title=Blessed María de los Ángeles Ginard Martí}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Holy See|date=|accessdate=2 December 2017|title=Bl. Mary of the Angels Ginard Martí|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20050424_ginard-marti_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginard took care of her siblings growing up and did [[Embroidery|embroidering]] to support them alongside two older sisters. But the experience at her [[First Communion]] and the example of her two nun aunts caused her to think about entering the religious life as a nun.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/92247|title=Blessed Mary of the Angels Ginard|date=|publisher=Santi e Beati|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginard entered a religious order in 1921 having her parents give their assent (her parents once refused this request in 1914) and she set about tasks such as embroidering cloth for the [[altar]] and preparing bread for hosts.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{citeweb|publisher=Catholic Exchange|date=13 September 2017|accessdate=2 December 2017|author=Sarah Metts|title=Bl. Maria of the Angels: Joyful Martyr of the Spanish Civil War|url=http://catholicexchange.com/bl-maria-angels-joyful-martyr-spanish-civil-war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginard was killed during the onslaught of the [[Spanish Civil War]] a month after having gone into hiding when the conflict broke out. Her remains were discovered a short while later for burial.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

The beatification for the slain nun was initiated in the 1980s and culminated in 2005 after she was beatified in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

==Life==
Ángela Ginard Martí was born on 3 April 1894 in [[Llucmajor]] as the third of nine children to Sebastián Ginard García and Margarita Martí Canals.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Her father's retirement from the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] saw the Ginard's move to [[Palma de Mallorca]] when she was sixteen where the three eldest sisters (including herself) helped around the house and learnt to embroider and make hats.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;

It was after her [[First Communion]] on 14 April 1905 that she had the desire to consecrate herself to [[Jesus Christ]] and realized that it would be through the religious life as a [[nun]]. It was also after this experience that she made frequent visits to the [[tabernacle]] where she would kneel in reflection before Him to further discern her vocation and to strengthen her own faith.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; Even the example of her two maternal aunts who were nuns had a profound effect on her growing up. But she admired one of those aunts in particular due to the contemplative life she led in her [[convent]]. Her sisters often went out with friends to the [[Movie theater|cinema]] or other social engagements while she preferred to remain at home to instruct her other siblings in [[catechism]] and the lives of the saints.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

In 1914 she asked her parents for permission to enter the convent her aunt was stationed in but her parents (her father in particular) opposed the idea and advised her to wait and think more on it.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Ginard entered the Zelatrices of the Eucharistic Devotion in Palma de Mallorca on 26 November 1921 and assumed the religious name "Maria de los Ángeles"; she assumed the habit in May 1922 and then served as a postulant for six months before commencing her period of [[novitiate]] from 1922 to 1923. It was in 1923 that she made her initial profession and renewed it in 1926 (then being moved to the house in [[Madrid]]) before making her solemn profession later in 1929 in [[Barcelona]] where she was stationed until 1932 when she returned to Madrid.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Ginard did embroidering for the cloths used for the [[altar]] and also prepared the bread that would be made into the Eucharistic hosts.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

But the conflict forced nuns and priests alike to go underground due to the danger against them so the nuns of her convent were forced on 20 July 1936 to disperse while using disguises to flee.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; During the conflict she hid in an apartment but was arrested during the afternoon on 25 August 1936. The guards who raided the apartment accused a woman of being another nun but Ginard stepped forward to confirm that she was the sole nun living in the apartment.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; The guards escorted her outside to a waiting car and drove off with her. Ginard was shot dead in a park either in the afternoon or evening on 26 August 1936 and her remains were left at the site of the killing.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; The next morning the sisters were looking through files at a government building and found pictures of her corpse. The sisters went to the site to reclaim her remains for a proper burial. Her remains were [[Exhumation|exhumed]] moved on 20 May 1941 and again in 1984 to the convent where she lived.&lt;ref name=SQPN/&gt;&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;

==Beatification==
The beatification process opened under [[Pope John Paul II]] on 6 February 1987 after the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the edict declaring "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections) and titled Ginard as a [[Servant of God]]. The diocesan process was held in Madrid with Cardinal [[Ángel Suquía Goicoechea]] inaugurating the investigation on 28 April 1987 and later closing on 23 March 1990; the C.C.S. later validated this process on 18 October 1991 and received the [[Positio]] dossier from the postulation in 1993 for additional assessment.

Theologians assessed and approved the cause on 11 November 2003 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 17 February 2004. John Paul II granted the final approval needed for the cause on 19 April 2004 and confirmed that Ginard would soon be beatified after determining that she had died "in odium fidei" (in hatred of the faith) meaning no miracle was required for beatification.

Her beatification had been scheduled for 24 April 2005 but the death of John Paul II weeks earlier meant that the beatification was pushed back. The beatification was later celebrated on 29 October 2005 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] with Cardinal [[José Saraiva Martins]] presiding on the behalf of [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=HS/&gt;
